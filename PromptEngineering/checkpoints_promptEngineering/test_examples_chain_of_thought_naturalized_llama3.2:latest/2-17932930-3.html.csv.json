Next, I will look at row 5 of the table: nat: per, name: curiel, moving to: alianza atl\u00e9tico, type: transfer, transfer window: winter.\n   - The transfer window for this transfer is also winter, so it must have occurred in either December, January, or February.\n\n4. Now that I know both transfers occurred during the same time period, I need to verify whether they actually did occur before 2008 (the claim states \"in 2008\").\n\n5.

So I will look at the next rows.\n\n6. Checking row 5 again: nat: per, name: curiel, moving to: alianza atl\u00e9tico, type: transfer, transfer window: winter.\n   - The same problem as before for this player. Since both of these transfers only have a general timeframe in which they are occurring (\"winter\"), it is impossible to definitively state when they took place.\n\n7.

Therefore, this row does not match the claim.\nFor Row 5 (curiel), name is \"curiel\" and type is indeed \"transfer\", but it should be \"loaned out\".\nSince only one of the two rows matches the claim partially, we cannot conclude that both names moving to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico are of the \"loan out\" type.\n\nStep 3: Check if there are other rows that indicate a name moving to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico is indeed of \"loan out\" type.\nIn Row 3 (tragodara), there is a mention of \"atl\u00e9tico minero\", which indicates that \"tragodara\" moved from a different team and might be related.

However, as discovered in Step 5, only one name meets the specified criteria (but not entirely matching the claim due to a different transfer window).

Rivas is indeed moving to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze with a transfer window of winter.\n\n3. Then, I'll look at Tragodara's transfer information in Row 3.

I've already established that Curiel is indeed moving to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico (not Atl\u00e9tico Minero), so this part of the claim about \"both\" does not apply.\n\n6. However, since Rivas is moving to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze and not Atl\u00e9tico Minero, the claim can be assessed as FALSE regarding its specific mention of both being moved to Atl\u00e9tico Minero.\n\n7. There's an oversight in my initial analysis: Row 5 actually shows that Curiel is moving to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico with the same transfer window (\"winter\") but does not specify he's going to Atl\u00e9tico Minero, unlike Tragodara. Hence, while Rivas' destination does differ from Tragodara's, the claim is about both being moved to Atl\u00e9tico Minero.\n\n8. Since Curiel was moving to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico and not Atl\u00e9tico Minero with a winter transfer window, I can confirm that the claim \"curiel and rivas be both moving to atl\u00e9tico minero , the same as tragodara\" is indeed FALSE.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Curiel's transfer details: destination different from Tragodara's\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"name\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Rivas' transfer details and its implications for the claim\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"moving to\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"name\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Clarifying the claim's specification and its relation to Tragodara\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"type\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",
