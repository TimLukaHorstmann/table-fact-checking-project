By examining the table, we can see that in Row 23, the Royals' game against the Athletics (or possibly others) has the date April 24, but it's not explicitly stated, only that \"Row 21\" score was postponed due to rain for that date and therefore rescheduled for April 24.\n\n#### Step 3: Clarify the postponement issue with Row 21\nGiven this is actually a part of another row (row 22), and we need to look at the details in row 23, which doesn't have any mention of postponements but does show that one of the Royals vs Athletics games ended up being on April 24. We thus can ignore the \"postponed\" information because our target game is likely in Row 22 or another detail we have to look through.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify if row 23 has the score 2 - 0\nIn Row 23, it says \"score: 2 - 0\".
