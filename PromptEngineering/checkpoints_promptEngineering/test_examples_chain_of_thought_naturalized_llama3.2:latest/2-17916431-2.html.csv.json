To do this, we'll first find out how many times Port Vale appeared as a team facing an opponent, and then check which opponents they faced in those instances.\n3. Since there is no direct data on Bradford City playing against Port Vale in the given chart, we can't immediately confirm or deny this claim without further information.\n4. However, looking at the table, we see that Port Vale played against some teams multiple times, so it's possible that one of those games was against Bradford City.\n\nNow, let's list all games where Port Vale faced an opponent twice:\n\n- Altrincham 0 - 1 (port vale)\n- Blyth Spartans 3 - 0 (port vale)\n- Burton Albion 4 - 2 (port vale)\n- Bury 0 - 0 (port vale)\n- Chesterfield 3 - 2 (port vale)\n- Chorley 5 - 1 (port vale)\n- Dagenham & Redbridge 0 - 0 (port vale)\n- Gillingham 1 - 0 (port vale)\n- Grimsby Town 0 - 0 (port vale)\n- Halifax Town 2 - 3 (port vale)\n- Hartlepool United 4 - 0 (port vale)\n- Kidderminster Harriers 3 - 2 (port vale)\n- Macclesfield Town 1 - 0 (port vale)\n- Morecambe 1 - 2 (port vale)\n- Notts County 1 - 3 (port vale)\n- Rochdale 0 - 3 (port vale)\n- Shrewsbury Town 0 - 0 (port vale)\n- Tranmere Rovers 2 - 0 (port vale)\n- Wycombe Wanderers 1 - 4 (port vale)\n\nHowever, we can see that the claim is not directly supported by any of these results.\n\n5.

We will examine each row of the table to locate this specific match.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if there is a match for Aldershot Town vs Bradford City\",\n    \"Verify that the date matches 10 March 2009\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Locate the desired match\nAfter reviewing each row of the table, we find that the match in question is:\nRow Index 36:\nColumn Name 'opponent'\n Value : aldershot town\nRow Index 40:\n Column Name 'result'\nValue : 0 - 0\n\nHowever, this indicates a draw, not Bradford City scoring the highest point total.
