Identify the row(s) containing a population of 824:\n   * Row 7: Lepreau, with a population of 824\n   * Row 8: West Isles, with a population of 824\n\n2. Select the column for area (km2):\n   The relevant column is \"area km2\"\n\n3. Compare the areas of Lepreau and West Isles:\n   * Lepreau's area is 209.4 km^2\n   * West Isles' area is 37.93 km^2\n\n4. Determine which parish has a larger area:\n   Since 209.4 > 37.93, Lepreau has a larger area.\n\nHowever, the claim states \"the lepreau parish have a larger area\". The comparison should be between the two parishes with a population of 824 (Lepreau and West Isles). We already determined that Lepreau has a larger area but in this case, both parishes have the same population. However we can still assert the claim is false since the question states \"of the 2 parish\", meaning it's asserting only one of them must be true.\n\nThus, even though Lepreau does indeed have a larger area and West Isles doesn't, the phrasing of the question makes it impossible to say that this statement is true.",
