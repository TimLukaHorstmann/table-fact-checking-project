We'll focus on rows with a result of \"w\", specifically looking at columns \"scored_points\", \"opponent\", and \"attendance\".\n\n#### Step 3: Identify Shutout Games\nWe can see that some teams had shutout wins, but we need to find those with the Dolphins' defense winning.\n\n#### Step 4: Check Dolphins' Defense Performance\nLooking through rows 1-16, we'll check each row for a win by the Dolphins' defense and verify if it was a shutout game (no points scored by the opponent).\n\n#### Step 5: Verify Relevant Rows\nUpon examining the table, we find the following relevant rows:\n- Row 8 (Baltimore Colts): The Dolphins didn't play against the Colts.\n- Row 9 (Los Angeles Rams): A win but no shutout.\n- Row 10 (San Francisco 49ers): No shutout.\n- Row 11 (New England Patriots): No shutout and opponent was not a defense.\n- Row 12 (Baltimore Colts): The Dolphins didn't play against the Colts.\n- Row 13 (Cincinnati Bengals): A win, but we need to verify if it was a shutout against their defense.\n- Row 14 (Houston Oilers): A win, but no information about opposing defense is provided in the table.\n- Row 15 (Atlanta Falcons): A win, but again, we lack info on the defensive team.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine Relevance\nFrom row 13, since it was a Bengals game and one of those games was against Cincinnati's defense, then this must be relevant for determining if there were two shutout wins by Dolphins' defense.\n\n#### Step 7: Conclusion\nThere is no clear evidence in the table that suggests any other game was won by the Dolphins' defense with a scoreline where they didn't allow their opponent to score points.

To do this, we will first find the minimum attendance value from the table by looking at each row of the table and finding its corresponding attendance figure.\n3.

Looking at the table, we find that there are four different attendance figures: 32343, 39434, 54482, and 74506.\n2. These values represent the following games:\n   - Week 8 vs. Baltimore Colts with an attendance of 32343\n   - Week 14 vs. Houston Oilers with an attendance of 39434\n   - Week 12 vs. Baltimore Colts with an attendance of 54482\n   - Week 13 vs. Cincinnati Bengals with an attendance of 74506\n\n3.
