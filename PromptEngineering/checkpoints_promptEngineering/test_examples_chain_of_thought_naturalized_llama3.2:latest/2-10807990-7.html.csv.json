First, we need to identify the information required for the claim: the away score of Melbourne against South Melbourne and the away score of South Melbourne.\n\n2.

The claim states that Melbourne's away record is 12.11 (83) while South Melbourne records an away score of 11.20 (86).\n\n4. We can see from the table that both Melbourne (row 3) and South Melbourne (row 1) have away scores mentioned, but they are different.\n\n5. Based on this information, we need to evaluate if the claim is true or false. Given the values, it seems unlikely that the claim would be true since the values for both teams are distinct and do not match each other.\n\n6.

Extract the scores of the Melbourne away team and South Melbourne away team from the table.\n   - Melbourne away team score: 12.11 (83)\n   - South Melbourne away team score: 11.20 (86)\n\n2. Calculate the difference in points between the two teams by subtracting the lower score from the higher score.\n   However, since we want to find out if Melbourne's score is 4 points higher than South Melbourne's, this step becomes redundant.\n\n3. Instead, evaluate whether the calculated difference meets the condition of being exactly 4 points more for Melbourne than South Melbourne.\n   This comparison will be made in a numerical format (83-86) and since we are only looking if it is -3 or greater, then clearly -3 will indicate that melbourne have score that be 4 point higher.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Extract the scores of the Melbourne away team and South Melbourne away team from the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate the difference in points between the two teams.
