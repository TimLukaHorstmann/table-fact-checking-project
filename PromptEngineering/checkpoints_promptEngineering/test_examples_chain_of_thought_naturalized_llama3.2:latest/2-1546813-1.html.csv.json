    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to determine if there are at least 7 occurrences of the Solheim Cup being hosted in the US between 1990 and 2013.\n2. To verify this, we should count the number of years from 1990 to 2013 where the venue is listed as being in the USA.\n3. Then, we need to check each year to ensure that it is indeed a Solheim Cup match and not another type of international golf tournament.\n4. We can do this by checking if the winning team was the United States or Europe, as specified in the table for each year.\n\nHere's how these steps translate into an executable solution in Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define the data from the table\ntable = {\n    \"2013\": {\"venue\": \"colorado golf club\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"europe\"},\n    \"2011\": {\"venue\": \"killeen castle golf resort\", \"country\": \"ireland\", \"winning_team\": \"europe\"},\n    \"2009\": {\"venue\": \"rich harvest farms\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"2007\": {\"venue\": \"halmstad gk\", \"country\": \"sweden\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"2005\": {\"venue\": \"crooked stick golf club\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"2003\": {\"venue\": \"barseb\u00e4ck golf & country club\", \"country\": \"sweden\", \"winning_team\": \"europe\"},\n    \"2002\": {\"venue\": \"interlachen country club\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"2000\": {\"venue\": \"loch lomond golf club\", \"country\": \"scotland\", \"winning_team\": \"europe\"},\n    \"1998\": {\"venue\": \"muirfield village\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"1996\": {\"venue\": \"st pierre golf & country club\", \"country\": \"wales\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"1994\": {\"venue\": \"the greenbrier\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"},\n    \"1992\": {\"venue\": \"dalmahoy country club\", \"country\": \"scotland\", \"winning_team\": \"europe\"},\n    \"1990\": {\"venue\": \"lake nona golf & country club\", \"country\": \"usa\", \"winning_team\": \"united states\"}\n}\n\n# Initialize variables to track the number of years and whether a year is valid\nnum_years = 0\nvalid_years = []\n\n# Iterate through each year in reverse chronological order\nfor i, date in enumerate(sorted(table.keys(), reverse=True)):\n    venue = table[date][\"venue\"]\n    country = table[date][\"country\"]\n    winning_team = table[date][\"winning_team\"]\n\n    # Check if the year is valid based on the data provided\n    if (i < 7 and country == \"usa\") or (i >= 7 and country != \"usa\"):\n        num_years += 1\n        valid_years.append({\"row_index\": i, \"column_name\": date})\n\n# Determine if the claim is true\nclaim = False\n\nif num_years >= 7:\n    claim = True\n\nprint(json.dumps({\n    \"chain_of_thought\": f\"Iterated through each year from {sorted(table.keys(), reverse=True)[0]} to {sorted(table.keys(), reverse=True)[-1]} to check if there were at least 7 occurrences of the Solheim Cup being hosted in the US between 1990 and 2013.\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\" if claim else \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": valid_years\n}))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output a JSON object that summarizes your steps and whether the claim is true or false.",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim: \"the solheim cup be host outside the us on 7 occasion from 1990 - 2013\". To determine if this claim is true or false, we need to examine each year and venue in the given table.\n\n2. Let's start with Row 12 (year: 1992): The Solheim Cup was hosted at Dalmahoy Country Club in Scotland, which is outside of the US. This matches part of our claim, so we'll mark this as true.\n\n3. Next, let's consider Row 13 (year: 1990): The Solheim Cup was also hosted at Lake Nona Golf & Country Club in Florida, USA. Since it was held within the United States, this doesn't match our claim of being outside the US. So we'll mark this as false.\n\n4. Now let's look at Row 11 (year: 1994): The Solheim Cup was again hosted, this time at The Greenbrier in West Virginia, USA. This also contradicts our claim since it took place within the United States. So we'll mark this as false.\n\n5. Moving on to Row 10 (year: 1996), the venue was St Pierre Golf & Country Club in Wales. Since Wales is outside of the US, this matches part of our claim. We'll mark this one true.\n\n6. Next up is Row 9 (year: 1998): Muirfield Village in Ohio, USA, which also doesn't fit our criteria because it was held inside the United States. So we'll make this false.\n\n7. Then there's Row 8 (year: 2000), with Loch Lomond Golf Club in Scotland hosting the Solheim Cup. As mentioned earlier, that takes place outside of the US and is one instance in our claim. This matches true.\n\n8. Looking at Rows 5-6, the venues are Crooked Stick Golf Club in Indiana (USA) for Row 5 and Barseb\u00e4ck Golf & Country Club in Sweden for Row 6. Both are outside of the United States, adding more instances to our count.\n\n9. Now let's check Row 3 (year: 2009): Rich Harvest Farms in Illinois, USA. This doesn't fit because it was held within the US. Marking false.\n\n10. Next up is Row 4 (year: 2007) with Halmstad GK in Sweden, which matches being outside of the United States and adds another instance to our true count.\n\n11. Finally, we have Rows 2 (2011), 1 (2013). The venues are Killeen Castle Golf Resort in Ireland and Colorado Golf Club in Colorado, USA respectively. Only the former is outside of the US, so marking Row 2 as true and Row 1 false.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWe've evaluated all relevant rows and found that there were indeed instances where the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the United States (1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2007). However, it took place within the US on multiple occasions as well (2011, 2013).\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
