    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. The claim states that Lake Oval drew the smallest crowd of any game. To determine if this is true, we need to compare the crowd sizes at each venue.\n\n2. We start by identifying the relevant rows where a crowd size was recorded: Rows 4, 5, and 6 (Lake Oval, Melbourne, and Hawthorn).\n\n3. For Row 4, the crowd size at Lake Oval is listed as 12176. This value will be compared to other venues' crowd sizes.\n\n4. For Row 5, the crowd size at Melbourne's MCG is listed as 17951. Since this is not the smallest crowd size recorded so far (Lake Oval), we move on.\n\n5. For Row 6, the crowd size at Hawthorn's VFL Park is listed as 21561. This value is greater than Lake Oval's and thus does not represent the smallest crowd size.\n\n6. Next, we need to verify that these are indeed all the relevant venues for which crowd sizes were recorded. A quick glance at Rows 1-3 shows that there are no other significant crowds worth noting.\n\n7. Since Row 4 (Lake Oval) has a smaller crowd than Rows 5 and 6, it follows logically that Lake Oval drew the smallest crowd of any of these games.\n\n\n#### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
