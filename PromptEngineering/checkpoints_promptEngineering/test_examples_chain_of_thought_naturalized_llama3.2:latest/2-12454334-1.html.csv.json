    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for evaluating the claim:\n\n1. Identify the columns in the table related to the claim:\n   - The claim compares two cities based on their positions among a list of other cities specified by \"city of license\".\n   - Thus, we need to find the following columns: \"city of license\" and compare the order.\n\n2. Evaluate each row of the table for the relevant column:\n   For each row in the table, we will look at its entry for \"city of license\":\n   - For Row 1, it is \"cape vincent , ny\"\n   - For Row 2, it is \"webster , ny\"\n   - For Row 3, it is \"malone , ny\"\n   - For Row 4, it is \"syracuse , ny\"\n   - For Row 5, it is \"cold brook , ny\"\n\n3. Arrange the cities in order from first to last based on their entries:\n   - The list of cities would be: \"cape vincent , ny\", \"webster , ny\", \"malone , ny\", \"syracuse , ny\", and \"cold brook , ny\"\n   - This is the correct order.\n\n4. Compare the claim with the actual arrangement:\n   - The claim states that \"cape vincent , ny be the first among the city of license keep webster , ny behind it\".\n   - In reality, there are more cities than the ones mentioned in the claim.\n   - So the claim cannot be true because it is comparing two cities within a subset of data.\n\n5. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison:\n   - Based on our arrangement of cities and the comparison with the original statement, we can see that there are more cities than those mentioned in the statement.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"cape vincent , ny be the first among the city of license keep webster , ny behind it\" is FALSE.\n\n6. Determine which cells are relevant to this claim:\n   - The following cells contain the information necessary for evaluating the claim: \n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n     }\n\n7.
