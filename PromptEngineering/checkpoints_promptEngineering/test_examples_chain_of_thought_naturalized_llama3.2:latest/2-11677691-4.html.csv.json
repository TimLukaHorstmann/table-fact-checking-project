Now, let's check if the information about Trey Depriest can be found in the table:\n\t* In Row 10, we find player \"karlos williams\", not Trey Depriest.\n\t* In Row 11, we find player \"doran grant\", not Trey Depriest.\n\t* In Row 12, we find player \"jabriel washington\", not Trey Depriest.\n\t* In Row 5, we find player \"trey depriest\", and his position is listed as linebacker.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the above analysis, it appears that there might be some discrepancy between what is being claimed (Trey Depriest plays linebacker) and the actual table information.
