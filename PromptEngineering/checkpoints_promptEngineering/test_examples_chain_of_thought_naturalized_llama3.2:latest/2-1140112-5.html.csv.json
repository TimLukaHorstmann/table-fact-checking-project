    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's check if the race name \"iv glover trophy\" appears in the table.\n   - The race name \"iv glover trophy\" indeed appears in row 2 of the table.\n\n2. Next, we need to verify that there are only two races in the Goodwood circuit during the 1956 Formula One season.\n   - Looking at row 2 of the table again, the race name is \"iv glover trophy\".\n   - We also see another race in row 10: \"ii sussex trophy\". \n   - Since there are more than 2 races in the Goodwood circuit during the 1956 Formula One season, we must determine if this information can disprove the claim.\n   - However, upon closer inspection, it appears that these two races (iv glover trophy and ii sussex trophy) indeed take place on the same circuit (Goodwood). Since there is no indication that other races in Goodwood will be present during the 1956 season or any year with this table, the claim remains TRUE.\n\n\n3. Now let's look at row 2 again. We see the following information: race name \"iv glover trophy\", circuit \"goodwood\", date not given.\n   - As mentioned earlier, we know that there are indeed two races in the Goodwood circuit during the 1956 Formula One season.\n   - Therefore, it appears that the claim is indeed true.\n\n4. Lastly, let's look at row 10: race name \"ii sussex trophy\", circuit \"goodwood\", date not given.\n   - As previously stated, we know that there are indeed two races in the Goodwood circuit during the 1956 Formula One season.\n   - Since this information does match our previous assertion, it is clear that there are two races in the Goodwood circuit.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"race name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"race name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns:** The claim mentions the constructor, so we need to focus on the \"constructor\" column.\n\n2. **Locate data for 1956 season:** Since the table does not explicitly mention the year, but rather uses Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.) as race numbers, we can infer that each row represents a different race from consecutive years. The first row is likely from 1948, given the format of racing circuits and drivers mentioned.\n\n3. **Find Maserati's performance in the specified season:** To verify if Maserati was the highest constructor in the 1956 season (implied to be the year corresponding to Roman numeral 'i'), we need to find a row that matches this criteria. However, there is no direct evidence of the 'i' race being from 1956.\n\n4. **Analyze data for each relevant constructor:** We'll examine each constructor's performance across different years and races mentioned in the table.\n\n5. **Determine if Maserati was the highest constructor in 1956:** Without explicit information on a \"1956\" race, we cannot directly conclude that Maserati was the highest constructor for this year based solely on the provided data.\n\nGiven these steps and without direct evidence of the 'i' (implied to be 1956) race from the table, it's not possible to definitively determine if Maserati was the highest constructor in 1956 based solely on the information provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Due to lack of direct evidence for a '1956' year and explicit performance data for the season, we cannot conclusively verify the claim.

Therefore, we must re-examine our initial conclusion.\n\n#### Step 5: Re-evaluate the original statement of the problem\nUpon re-examination, we realize that the statement claims \"the Lancia - Ferrari constructor occur more often than the Gordini constructor\".

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, I need to find the relevant information about the 1956 Formula One season. This can be done by looking at the date column for each race, as it will likely indicate when the races took place.\n\n2. From the table, I notice that the dates in Row 11 (the \"i brscc formula 1 race\" row) are all in October, which suggests that these races took place towards the end of the 1956 season. This could be a clue about whether the Caen circuit was commonly used as the Aintree circuit during this time period.\n\n3. To determine if the Caen circuit was commonly used as the Aintree circuit, I need to look for any evidence that suggests which circuits were actually used during the 1956 Formula One season. This can be done by looking at the column headers in each row of the table.\n\n4. The column header \"circuit\" in Row 1 lists the Mendoza circuit, and the column header \"circuit\" in Row 11 lists the Brands Hatch circuit. It is unlikely that these two circuits were used interchangeably during the same season.\n\n5. However, I do notice that there are a few rows where the \"circuit\" column has the word \"Aintree\" written in it, but with a different date and constructor than Row 1. This might suggest that Aintree was used for some races during the 1956 season.\n\n6. Looking closer at these specific rows, I see that there is no row with both the date \"26 August\" (which corresponds to Row 9) and the text \"Aintree\" in the \"circuit\" column. This seems like a crucial piece of information that contradicts my initial assumption.\n\n7. Upon re-examining my previous conclusion, I realize that it was based on an incorrect assumption about which circuits were used during the 1956 season. The fact that there is no row with both the date \"26 August\" and the text \"Aintree\" in the \"circuit\" column suggests that the Caen circuit might have been a different track from Aintree for some races.\n\n8. However, I also notice that the table does contain another row where the constructor is listed as \"maserati\", with both the date \"26 august\" and the text \"caen\" written in the \"circuit\" column. The year of this race isn't explicitly given but we can tell that it occurred before 1957 because the next Maserati race that occurs after the 1956 season is row 11, which includes the Brands Hatch circuit.\n\n9. Now that I have looked at all of the relevant rows in the table, I should be able to make a final determination about whether or not the Caen circuit was commonly used as the Aintree circuit during the 1956 Formula One season.\n\n\nHere's my output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"circuit\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
