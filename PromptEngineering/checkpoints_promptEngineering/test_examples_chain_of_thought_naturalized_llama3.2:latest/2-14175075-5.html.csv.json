Looking at the table, Row 1 has the date: September 4, 2007, site: Cedar Rapids.\n\n3. **Verify the date**: Since we are looking for the earliest date, we need to compare this date with the dates in other rows that contain different sites.

Next, let's compare the date of the wrestling match with other sports' dates that took place in 2007 to see if it has the latest date. For each row, we check the sport and date columns.\n\n3. We can see from Row 1 that there is a golf event on September 4, 2007, which predates the wrestling event.\n\n4. Similarly, we can also see from Row 5 that there is a cross country event for both men and women on November 10, 2007. Since this date is later than December 9, it means that the wrestling match actually took place in 2008, not 2007.\n\n5.
