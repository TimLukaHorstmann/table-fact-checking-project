Next, let's look at Row 8 to confirm whether Donington Park also hosted a race in 1997. In Row 8, we find that the venue is again \"donington park\" and the season is indeed \"1997\". This confirms that Donington Park hosted a race in both 1996 and 1997.\n\n3.

To do this, I will look at each row in the table and check if Portugal is listed as the champion for that season.\n3. If Portugal is the champion for a season, I will increment a counter variable to keep track of the total number of championships won by Portugal.\n4. After reviewing all rows in the table, I will compare my counter variable with the number of championships won by other countries during the same period.\n5. If any country has more championships than Portugal, I can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Counting Championships Won by Portugal:\n\n- Row 1: Pedro Lamy and Diogo Castro Santos are listed as champions for Portugal in 1990.\n- Row 2: Pedro Lamy and Diogo Castro Santos are listed as champions again for Portugal in 1991.\n- Row 3: Not listed as champion in any capacity for Portugal, but Martin Koene and Jos Verstappen won the championship in the Netherlands, not Portugal.\n- Row 4: Martin Albrecht and Hubert Stromberger won the championship in Austria, not Portugal.\n- Row 5: Tom Coronel and Donny Crevels are listed as champions for Portugal in 1994.\n- Row 6: Manuel Gi\u00e3o and Andr\u00e9 Couto are listed as champions for Portugal in 1995.\n- Row 7: Not listed as champion in any capacity for Portugal, but Pierre Kaffer and Norman Simon won the championship in Germany, not Portugal.\n- Row 8: Giovanni Montanari and Giovanni Anapoli are listed as champions for Italy, not Portugal.\n- Row 9: Not listed as champion in any capacity for Portugal.\n\n#### Counting Championships Won by Other Countries:\n\n- Netherlands has 2 championships (1991 is shared with Germany but that can be considered only one championship).\n- Great Britain has 1 championship.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nPortugal won a total of 3 championships from 1990 to 1998, while no country won more than Portugal.

This means we have to find the row that corresponds to both 1991 and 1994 seasons in the table.\n\n2. Next, let's look for the relevant rows in the table:\n   - For season 1991: The corresponding cell is Row 2.\n   - For season 1994: The corresponding cell is Row 5.\n\n3. Now we need to check how many teams competed at circuit park zandvoort in both of these seasons by looking at Rows 2 and 5:\n   - In Row 2, the number of teams that competed at circuit park zandvoort is mentioned as: teams: 18.\n   - In Row 5, the number of teams that competed at circuit park zandvoort is also mentioned as: teams: 18.\n\n4. Since both rows say there were 18 teams that competed in these seasons, we need to verify if this information about \"circuit park zandvoort\" is correct for each season:\n   - For Row 2 (1991), the venue at circuit park zandvoort indeed corresponds to the specified date.\n   - For Row 5 (1994), the venue at circuit park zandvoort also indeed corresponds to the specified date.\n\n5. Now, let's check if there were more teams competing in either of these seasons:\n   - Row 2 states that there were 18 teams.\n   - Row 5 also states that there were 18 teams.\n\n6. Since both rows mention the same number (18) for the season mentioned, it is true that the most team competed at circuit park zandvoort in both 1991 and 1994, given these conditions.\n\n\n#### Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Claim: \\\"the most team compete at circuit park vandvoort in 1991 and 1994\\\"\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"We need to find the relevant rows that correspond to both seasons\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find corresponding row for season 1991\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find corresponding row for season 1994\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check number of teams that competed at circuit park zandvoort in both seasons\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify venue information for circuit park zandvoort\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if there were more teams competing in either of these seasons\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if claim is true\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Since both seasons have the same number of teams (18) and this information about \\\"circuit park zandvoort\\\" is correct for each season, it is indeed true that there were 18 teams competing in these years\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

For 1992, Portugal is mentioned as a second-place team.\n5. For 1993, Brazil is mentioned as a third-place team and a different country altogether from 1990-98. This implies that there is no Portuguese champion in 1993 according to the given information, thus confirming one championship loss by portugal.\n6. For 1995, 1997, Portugal is again in a 2nd place; while for the rest of years it is only a second-placed team (which means, they are not champions).

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the total number of championships won by Austria from 1990 to 1998\nWe need to find out how many times Austria has won the championship during this period.\n\n#### Step 2: Examine each row for the relevant information about Austrian championships\nWe will check Row 3, Row 4, and Row 5 to see if Austria won any championships from 1990 to 1998.\n\n#### Step 3: Check Row 3\nIn Row 3, the champion is Netherlands (Martin Koene, Jos Verstappen), not Austria. Therefore, we can rule out Row 3 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 4: Check Row 4\nIn Row 4, the champion is Austria (Martin Albrecht, Hubert Stromberger). This means that from 1990 to 1998, Austria has won at least one championship.\n\n#### Step 5: Check Row 5\nIn Row 5, the champion is Netherlands (Tom Coronel, Donny Crevels), not Austria. Therefore, we can rule out Row 5 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if there are any other relevant rows that could provide additional information about Austrian championships from 1990 to 1998\nWe need to check the remaining rows (Rows 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8) for the same condition to see if Austria won more than one championship during this period.\n\n#### Step 7: Check Row 1\nIn Row 1, there is no Austrian team mentioned as the champion. Therefore, we can rule out Row 1 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 8: Check Row 2\nIn Row 2, Portugal (Pedro Lamy, Diogo Castro Santos) won, not Austria. Therefore, we can rule out Row 2 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 9: Check Row 6\nIn Row 6, the champion is Portugal (Manuel Gi\u00e3o, Andr\u00e9 Couto), not Austria. Therefore, we can rule out Row 6 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 10: Check Row 7\nIn Row 7, the champion is Germany (Pierre Kaffer, Norman Simon), not Austria. Therefore, we can rule out Row 7 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 11: Check Row 8\nIn Row 8, the champion is Italy (Giovanni Montanari, Giovanni Anapoli), not Austria. Therefore, we can rule out Row 8 as an Austrian championship winner.\n\n#### Step 12: Determine if there are any Austrian championships from 1990 to 1998 that were not mentioned in Rows 4 and 6\nFrom the available information, it appears that only one Austrian championship was mentioned (Row 4). We cannot find any additional information about another Austrian championship during this period.\n\n#### Step 13: Determine if Austria has won exactly three championships from 1990 to 1998 based on the available information\nBased on Row 4, we know Austria won at least one championship. However, we do not have enough information to confirm that they won exactly three championships. The statement \"Austria have win 3 championship from 1990 to 1998\" is not supported by our findings.\n\n#### Step 14: Determine the final answer\nGiven that the available information does not support the claim that Austria has won exactly three championships from 1990 to 1998, the final answer can be determined.\n\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"We need to determine how many times Austria has won the championship during this period.\",\n    \"Check Row 3: no Austrian champion found.\",\n    \"Check Row 4: Austria is the champion.\",\n    \"No other championships can be found in Rows 1-8 for Austria.\",\n    \"Only one championship was mentioned from 1990 to 1998.\",\n    \"Not enough information to confirm three championships.\",\n    \"Therefore, the statement 'Austria have win 3 championship from 1990 to 1998' is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
