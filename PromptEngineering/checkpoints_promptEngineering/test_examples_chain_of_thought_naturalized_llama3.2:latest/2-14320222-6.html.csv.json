    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the total points mentioned in the claim\nThe claim states that game 61 has a score of 3 - 1, which means the team scored 3 goals and the opponent scored 1 goal, resulting in a total of 4 points (3 + 1). However, this is not explicitly stated as part of the data in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify that game 61 actually has 86 points\nAccording to the table, row 10 mentions game 61 with a score of 3 - 1 and a record of 41 - 16 - 4. The total points are indeed 86 (41 + 45 = 86), which confirms the claim.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify other games that have 86 points\nWe need to check if there are any other games with a score equal to or greater than 2 goals and less than 6 goals, since this is the only possible range for a total of 86 points (4*21+2=86).\n\n#### Step 4: Check row 11\nRow 11 mentions game 62 with a score of 4 - 7. The team scored 4 goals but lost, which doesn't match the required condition.\n\n#### Step 5: Check row 12\nRow 12 mentions game 63 with a score of 1 - 3. The team didn't even reach 2 goals and lost, so it also doesn't match the required condition.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince we found that only one specific game has 86 points (game 61) and there are no other games that meet the specified conditions for having a total of 86 points, we can confirm whether or not this is true.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Claim states game 61 has 86 points\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"Verify that row 10 of table indeed mentions game 61 as having a total score of 86\"},\n    {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"Find other games with the same conditions as stated in the claim\"},\n    {\"step\": 4, \"description\": \"Row 11 doesn't match since they lost\"},\n    {\"step\": 5, \"description\": \"Row 12 also loses so does not meet criteria\"},\n    {\"step\": 6, \"description\": \"Only row 10 from table has a total of 86 points\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

This indicates that the claim about the Quebec Nordiques having a game with a score of 2-2 OT is true.\n\n#### Step 2: Retrieve the game details for the Chicago Black Hawks\nNext, we need to check if there is a game with a score of 2-2 OT for the Chicago Black Hawks.\nFrom the table, we can see that Row 4 mentions \"opponent: chicago black hawks\" and has a \"score: 2 - 2 ot\". This indicates that the claim about the Chicago Black Hawks having a game with a score of 2-2 OT is also true.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify if both claims are relevant to the table\nBoth the Quebec Nordiques and the Chicago Black Hawks have a game with a score of 2-2 OT, which means they both meet the criteria specified in the claim.
