    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the total number of gold medals won by each nation\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of gold medals won by each nation. This can be done by summing up the 'gold' column for each row.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 9},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 2},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 14}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Find the nation with the most gold medals\nNow that we have calculated the total number of gold medals won by each nation, we can find the nation with the most gold medals. Saudi Arabia has 0 gold medals.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 9},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 2},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 14}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince Saudi Arabia has only 0 gold medals and no other nation has more than 14 gold medals, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine the total number of gold medals won by each nation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Find the nation with the most gold medals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 9},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 2},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 1},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 0},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\", \"value\": 14}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the condition for a nation to receive only one total medal\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to understand what it means for a nation to be awarded \"only 1 total medal\". This implies that a nation can have multiple medals (gold, silver, and bronze) but still only be counted as having received one total medal.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the conditions under which a nation would receive more than one total medal\nA nation will receive more than one total medal if they have:\n\n*   More than one gold medal\n*   More than one silver medal\n*   More than one bronze medal\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then the nation has multiple total medals.\n\n### Step 3: Check each row in the table for nations that meet the conditions\nWe'll examine each row to see if any nation meets the condition of receiving more than one medal.\n\n-   Row 1 (Iran): Only one gold and two other metals, so Iran does not have more than one total medal.\n-   Row 2 (South Korea): Only three medals in total.\n-   Row 3 (Kazakhstan): Has multiple bronze medals but only three medals overall.\n-   Row 4 (Qatar): Has one silver and two bronze medals, for a total of five medals, which is more than one.\n-   Row 5 (China): Has four bronze medals and no other metal counts towards the \"more than one\" condition here. \n-   Row 6 (Saudi Arabia) and Row 7 (Japan): Only have one medal each.\n-   Row 8 & Row 9 (Chinese Taipei & Indonesia): Both only have bronze medals, which doesn't apply to our case.\n-   Row 10: This row has a total of 42 medals across three metals. So if a nation here receives more than two medals, the chain of thought for this problem is broken.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion based on findings\nBased on step 3, we have found that Qatar and China meet the conditions of having multiple medals (silver & bronze respectively) while still only being counted as receiving one total medal. Therefore, the claim is true because there are indeed four nations who be awarded only one total medal.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        \"Step 1: Check for a nation with more than one gold medal, silver medal, or bronze medal\",\n        \"Step 2: Verify that no nation has three medals (gold + silver + bronze)\",\n        \"Step 3: Look through the table to determine each row's conditions and results.\",\n        \"Step 4: Determine if there are four nations meeting the stated condition\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",
