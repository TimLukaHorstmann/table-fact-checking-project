Next, we need to calculate what it means for a score to be three times higher than another score.\n\nTo do this, let's find out what the three times value of Geelong's home team score is:\n13.12 x 3 = 39.36\n\nThis tells us that Collingwood's home team score should be higher than or equal to 39.36 if it's to be three time higher than that of Geelong.\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the rows where the home team's score is higher than the away team's score.\n2. We will compare each row's home team score with the away team's score.\n3. If a row meets this condition, we note it down for further analysis.\n4. After analyzing all rows, we check if there are exactly three such rows where Kardinia Park is mentioned as the venue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\nFor Row 1:\n- Home team: geelong\n- Away team: hawthorn\n- Home score: 13.12 (90)\n- Away score: 7.6 (48)\n\nThe home team's score is higher than the away team's score.\n\nRelevant cells for this row:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n}\n\nFor Row 2:\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Away team: south melbourne\n- Home score: 12.16 (88)\n- Away score: 13.12 (90)\n\nThe away team's score is higher than the home team's score.\n\nRelevant cells for this row:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n}\n\nFor Row 3:\n- Home team: carlton\n- Away team: essendon\n- Home score: 10.16 (76)\n- Away score: 11.14 (80)\n\nThe away team's score is higher than the home team's score.\n\nRelevant cells for this row:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n}\n\nFor Row 4:\n- Home team: richmond\n- Away team: melbourne\n- Home score: 10.18 (78)\n- Away score: 15.4 (94)\n\nThe away team's score is higher than the home team's score.\n\nRelevant cells for this row:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n}\n\nFor Row 5:\n- Home team: north melbourne\n- Away team: footscray\n- Home score: 9.14 (68)\n- Away score: 9.14 (68)\n\nThe home and away scores are equal.\n\nRelevant cells for this row:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n}\n\nFor Row 6:\n- Home team: st kilda\n- Away team: fitzroy\n- Home score: 13.14 (92)\n- Away score: 9.15 (69)\n\nThe home team's score is higher than the away team's score.\n\nRelevant cells for this row:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 6,\n  \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 6,\n  \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n}\n{\n  \"row_index\": 6,\n  \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n}\n\nNow, we check if there are exactly three such rows where Kardinia Park is mentioned as the venue:\nFor Row 1: \n- Venue: kardinia park\n- Home team's score is higher than away team's score.\n\nFor Row 3: \n- Venue: princes park\n- Not a match\n\nFor Row 6: \n- Venue: junction oval\n- Not a match\n\nWe found only one row where the home team's score is higher than the away team's score and Kardinia Park is mentioned as the venue. So, the claim \"kardinia park be 1 of 3 venue where the home team score be higher than the away team score\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare each row's home team score with the away team's score.\",\n    \"Analyze all rows and check if there are exactly three such rows where Kardinia Park is mentioned as the venue.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
