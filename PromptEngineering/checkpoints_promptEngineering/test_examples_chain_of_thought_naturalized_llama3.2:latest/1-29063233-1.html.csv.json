First, let's identify the relevant information about David Moore from the table:\n   - Row 1: no overall, no for series: 1, title: the curse of cornelius sigan, directed by: david moore...\n   - This indicates that David Moore did direct at least one episode.\n3. Next, let's identify the relevant information about Series 2 from the table:\n   - Row 2: no overall: 15, no for series: 2, title: the once and future queen, directed by: jeremy webb...\n   - This indicates that Series 2 was indeed created.\n4.

Checking row 11 and 12, we see another 2 unaccounted for episodes (episode 11 and episode 12), both of which were directed by Alice Troughton and Jeremy Webb respectively.

To determine whether the claim \"Lucy Watkins only writes 6 episodes of series 2\" is true or false, we need to first identify the number of episodes written by Lucy Watkins in Series 2.\n\n2.

There is also an additional row in the table that includes further episode details:\n    \"Row 12\" (for Series 2), directed by: jeremy webb, written by: julian jones.\n    This indicates another series 2 entry without writing credits.\n\n5. To answer this claim accurately, we need to check if Lucy Watkins was truly only credited with writing 6 episodes in Series 2:\n   - According to the table (row 11), \"the witch's quickening\", written by: jake michie.\n   - Also in row 11 of series 2, another entry is: \"the witch 's quickening\", directed by: alice troughton, written by: jake michie.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that \"Beauty and the Beast (Part 2) has less UK viewers than Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)\". To verify this, we need to compare the number of UK viewers for both episodes.\n2. We can find the relevant information in rows 5 and 6 of the table: Row 5 has \"Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)\", with a UK viewers figure of 5.53 million, while row 6 has \"Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)\", with a UK viewers figure of 6.14 million.\n3. Since 5.53 million is less than 6.14 million, it appears that the claim is true.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the number of UK viewers for both episodes\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"5\", \"Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)\", \"6\", \"Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that 5.53 million is less than 6.14 million\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"5\", \"UK viewers (million): 5.53\", \"6\", \"UK viewers (million): 6.14\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"UK viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"UK viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)\"}\n  ]\n}",
