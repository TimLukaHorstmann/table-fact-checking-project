    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "#### Chain of Thought:\n\n1. The claim states that there will be a replay in January 1976.\n2. We need to check if any match has a score that is not the expected one (i.e., the home team wins) or if the score is drawn, as these could potentially lead to a replay.\n3. Looking at Row 1, tie no: 1, we see that Southampton won with a score of 3 - 1, which does not indicate a potential replay.\n4. Moving on to Row 2, tie no: 2, Leicester City won with a score of 1 - 0, which also does not suggest a replay.\n5. Examining Row 3, tie no: 3, West Bromwich Albion won with a score of 3 - 2, indicating that there could be a replay because the away team did not win.\n6. For Row 4, tie no: 4, Sunderland won with a score of 1 - 0, which does not suggest a potential replay.\n7. In Row 5, Derby County won with a score of 1 - 0, also without indication of replay.\n8. Checking Row 6, the match between Ipswich Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers ended in a draw (0-0), which may indicate a replay if both teams had equal chances to win or if it was a penalty shootout.\n9. For tie no: 7, Coventry City and Newcastle United's match ended in a draw (1 - 1), but as there is no indication of the team that scored first, we cannot immediately conclude that it will be replayed solely based on this row.\n10. In Row 8, Newcastle United won with a score of 5 - 0, meaning there was likely a replay after the initial match ended in a draw.\n11. Examining tie no: 9, Manchester United won with a score of 3 - 1, which suggests potential for replay but does not confirm one.\n12. Row 10's result (Bradford City winning) also doesn't necessarily indicate replay.\n13. For tie no: 11, Southend United lost, so no replay is needed in this case.\n14. The match between Huddersfield Town and Bolton Wanderers ended with a loss for the home team, which does not necessitate a replay.\n15. In Row 12, Bradford City won but again there's no immediate reason to conclude it'll be replayed based solely on this row.\n16. Lastly, in Row 13, Southend United lost, meaning there is no potential for a replay.\n17. Checking Row 14 and 15 shows that only one specific match (Newcastle United vs Coventry City) had an initial draw with a subsequent win by Newcastle, indicating a replay.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nGiven these observations, the most relevant reason to believe in a replay being held in January 1976 is because of the two matches: Row 8's Newcastle United and Coventry City match (involving an initial draw), along with Row 11\u2019s Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers match. However, it's worth noting the claim specifically mentions 'January 1976' without specifying which tie or month in January.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Claim states that there will be a replay in January 1976.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Looking at match results, we check for any indication of potential replay (draws).\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"To find out if the claim is true or false\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Examine tie no: 1, - Southampton won with a score of 3 - 1.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Move to tie no: 2, - Leicester City won with a score of 1 - 0.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5: Check for tie no: 3, - West Bromwich Albion lost but won in the replay (3-2).\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"This could potentially indicate a replay.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"6: Investigate tie no: 4, - Sunderland won with a score of 1 - 0.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"7: Look into tie no: 5, - Derby County also won 1-0.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"8: Look at tie no: 6\u2019s Ipswich Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers match which ended in a draw.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"The potential for replay is here.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"9: Investigate tie no: 7, Coventry City vs Newcastle United's initial result was a draw (1 - 1).\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"10: After the initial match ended in a draw, it is likely that there was replay.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Given this tie's progression\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"11: Look into tie no: 9\u2019s Manchester United match.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"12: Investigate tie no: 10\u2019s Bradford City match result.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"13: Move on to tie no: 11, Southend United's loss doesn\u2019t necessitate replay.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"14: Check into tie no: 12\u2019s Huddersfield Town match against Bolton Wanderers (loss for home).\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"15: Finally, inspect the last few ties to ensure no conclusive replay indication found.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we first need to identify all the drawn matches (goalless matches) from the table.\n\n2. From Row 6, we can see that the match between Ipswich Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers on January 24th, 1976 ended in a 0-0 draw.\n\n3. From Row 18, we can also see that the match between York City and Chelsea on January 24th, 1976 ended in a 0-2 score, but since it's not entirely goalless (as Chelsea scored), this does not meet the condition for a drawn match.\n\n4. Next, we need to check if there is only one of these drawn matches that ended with no goals scored by either team. From Row 17, we can see that the match between Leeds United and Crystal Palace on January 24th, 1976 also ended in a goalless draw.\n\n5. Now, let's examine if there are any other drawn matches from the table that did not result in zero goals being scored (i.e., some team scored). Looking at Rows 15-19, we can see that none of these results fit this scenario.\n\n6. The final step is to determine if the claim \"only 1 of the 3 drawn match be goalless\" is TRUE or FALSE based on our findings. Since there are indeed two drawn matches with no goals scored (the Ipswich Town-Wolverhampton Wanderers match and the Leeds United-Crystal Palace match), this statement is false.\n\n7.

We'll look for its corresponding replay result.\n\t* Row 7 (replay): home team wins, contradicting the claim that both teams drew goalless matches.\n4. Since we found at least one drawn match, let's check for more:\n\t* Row 12: score is not goalless, so it doesn't contribute to our claim.\n\t* Row 14: score is 0-1, indicating the home team won and contradicting the claim that both teams drew goalless matches.\n5. We've identified two drawn games in the original table (Rows 6 and the replay for Row 7) but found one instance where either the away or home team didn't win both games (in this case, home team wins). This suggests our initial assertion is partially true but not entirely.\n6. Now we must check if there are indeed more than two drawn matches by examining the remaining rows:\n\t* Rows 2-19: The rest of these rows all contain non-goalless matches.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the presence of at least one goalless match, and considering that there is at least one game where a team loses but another wins (contradicting our initial assumption), we can't confidently say all three drawn games were goalless based solely on our observations from these rows.\n\nHowever, because our reasoning process led to identifying potential inconsistencies in the claim's absolute truthfulness rather than disproving it outright and as no conclusive evidence of other draws is found within the data provided or inferred beyond Row 7, we will proceed under the assumption that at least one match does indeed result in a draw.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The claim states that all 3 of the drawn matches be goalless\",\n      \"action\": \"Verify existence of draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Examine each row for draws and check for home team wins\",\n      \"action\": \"Identify potential inconsistencies in the claim's truthfulness\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Row 6 indicates a drawn game (0-0)\",\n      \"action\": \"Find corresponding replay result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Row 7 (replay): home team wins, contradicting goalless draw\",\n      \"action\": \"Conclusion that not all draws were goalless\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
