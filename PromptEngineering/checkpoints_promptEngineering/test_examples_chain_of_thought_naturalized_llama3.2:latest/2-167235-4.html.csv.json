We need to verify if Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri indeed holds this title by comparing his birth year with other prime ministers' birth years in the table.\n3. First, we will check all rows for a prime minister who was born before 1872 and after 1963 (the death year of Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri).\n4. Since none of these checks are successful, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri seems to be the oldest prime minister with this birth year.\n5. However, we must also verify that he indeed held the position from 22 october 1935 until his death on 9 november 1963 and check if all other conditions in the claim match.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check all prime ministers born before 1872 and after 1963\",\n    \"No such prime minister found, making Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri possibly the oldest with this birth year.\",\n    \"Verify that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term start is on or after his claimed start (22 october 1935) until his death year (9 november 1963).\",\n    \"Verify all other conditions in the claim match.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"born\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"term_start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"term_end\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the claim being evaluated\nThe claim states that \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota's leadership\" needs to be verified.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify relevant cells for evaluation\nTo evaluate this claim, we need to look at the following cells:\n- Row 2, Column \"term start\": This cell contains the date of Kostaq Kota's term start.\n- Row 5, Column \"term start\": This cell contains the date of Kostaq Kota's second term start.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare the dates in the relevant cells\nWe need to compare the date in Row 2, Column \"term start\" (5 September 1928) with the date in Row 5, Column \"term start\". However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the dates of Kostaq Kota. In row 2, his term starts on '5 september 1928', whereas in row 5 it says that he started again on '9 november 1936'. Since the claim specifies 5 september 1928, we need to determine if this is indeed before or after the start date of his second term.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the dates based on logical comparison\nThe given date for Kostaq Kota's first term (5 September 1928) must be compared with November 9th 1936. September and November are both within the same month, therefore it is clear that the earlier date will be correct.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false\nSince '5 september 1928' comes before '9 november 1936', the earliest term start for Kostaq Kota on 5 September 1928 is indeed his first term, making the statement FALSE.\n\n#### Step 6: Format final answer as JSON object\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this claim, we need to check if Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term ended before 9 November 1936 and if Kostaq Kota's term started after that date.\n3. Looking at the table, we find Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term in row 4 with \"term start: 22 october 1935\" and \"term end: 9 november 1936\".\n4. Since 22 October 1935 is before 9 November 1936, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term ended on or before the specified date.\n5. Now we check Kostaq Kota's term in row 2 with \"term start: 5 september 1928\" and row 5 with \"term start: 9 november 1936\".\n6. Since 5 September 1928 is before 22 October 1935 (Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term start), Kostaq Kota's term started after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term ended.\n7.

Let's correct this by accurately assessing whether Kostaq Kota's term indeed starts after Pandeli Evangjeli's term ends based on their respective dates:\n\n- **Correct Comparison:**\n  - If we compare the end date of Pandeli Evangjeli (16 October 1935) with the start date of Kostaq Kota (9 November 1936), it is clear that there was a gap in time after Pandeli Evangjeli's term ended and before Kostaq Kota took office.\n\n7. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The claim that \"kostaq kota 's term start on 9 november 1936 , after pandeli evangjeli 's term end\" is indeed TRUE because the specified dates do fulfill the condition stated in the claim.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Claim Statement Verification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify Relevant Dates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate Pandeli Evangjeli's Term End Date\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate Kostaq Kota's Term Start Date\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare Dates to Verify Claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Correct Comparison Based on Actual Dates\",\n      \"description\": \"Pandeli Evangjeli's term end (16 October 1935) before Kostaq Kota's term start (9 November 1936)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Final Assessment of Claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant information for the claim: We need to find if Pandeli Evangjeli was the only 1st time minister of Albania.\n2. Look up the term \"1st time\" in the table: This term refers to the first occurrence of a person holding the position of prime minister, which is indicated by the prefix \"(1st time)\".\n3. Check if Pandeli Evangjeli has the \"(1st time)\" suffix: Looking at Row 3, we see that \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" indicates two occurrences, so he does not meet this condition alone.\n4. Look for other individuals who had the \"(1st time)\" prefix and were prime ministers: In Row 2, we find Kostaq Kota with the \"(1st time)\" prefix, indicating his first occurrence as a prime minister. In Row 4, we also see Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri with the same prefix.\n5. Check if Pandeli Evangjeli was actually a prime minister: Looking at Row 3, we confirm that he indeed held the position of prime minister.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant information for the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if Pandeli Evangjeli has the (1st time) suffix\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Look for other individuals who had the (1st time) prefix and were prime ministers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check if Pandeli Evangjeli was actually a prime minister\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
