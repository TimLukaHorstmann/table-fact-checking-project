    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"On 8 February, the crowd at Hisense Arena was 8093.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It's a JSON table with columns like date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The data is an array of arrays, each representing a game.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions 8 February. So I need to check which rows have the date \"8 february\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: 4 Feb\n- Row 1: 4 Feb\n- Row 2: 6 Feb\n- Row 3: 6 Feb\n- Row 4: 7 Feb\n- Row 5: 7 Feb\n- Row 6: 7 Feb\n- Row 7: 8 Feb\n\nOnly row 7 is on 8 February. Now, I need to check the crowd column for that row.\n\nLooking at row 7, the data is:\n[\"south dragons\", \"93 - 83\", \"melbourne tigers\", \"hisense arena\", 8093, \"box score\", \"-\"]\n\nSo the crowd number is 8093 in this row. The claim says the crowd was 8093 on that day, which matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be true as the crowd at Hisense Arena on 8 February is indeed 8093 according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"On 7 February, the box score shows that the away team was the New Zealand Breakers.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are the date (7 February), the box score, and the away team being the New Zealand Breakers.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The data rows contain information for each game on specific dates.\n\nI need to find any row where the date is 7 February and check if the away team in that row is the New Zealand Breakers.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"4 february\" \u2013 not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Same as above, so skip.\n3. **Row 2**: \"6 february\" \u2013 nope.\n4. **Row 3**: Also 6th, move on.\n5. **Row 4**: \"7 february\" \u2013 this is the date we need to check. Now, looking at the away team column in this row: it's listed as \"new zealand breakers\". That matches the claim.\n\nSo, in row 4 (index 4), the away team is indeed the New Zealand Breakers, and the date is 7 February. Therefore, the box score for that game shows the away team as the New Zealand Breakers.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"February 4 have a score smaller than 4485.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. It's a JSON table with columns like date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The data rows have information about basketball games on specific dates in February.\n\nThe claim mentions \"February 4,\" which refers to the date. So I need to find all the games that occurred on February 4th. Looking at the table's data array, I see two entries for February 4:\n\n1. [\"south dragons\", \"97 - 77\", ...]\n2. [\"sydney spirit\", \"81 - 89\", ...]\n\nSo each of these rows has a score. The claim is about whether any of these scores are smaller than 4485.\n\nLooking at the first row, the score is \"97 - 77,\" which when converted to numbers is 97 for the home team and 77 for the away team. Both of these are much smaller than 4485.\n\nThe second row has a score of \"81 - 89.\" So the home team scored 81, and the away team scored 89. Again, both are less than 4485.\n\nTherefore, on February 4th, all games have scores that are indeed smaller than 4485. There's no game on that date where the score is equal to or exceeds 4485.\n\nSo the claim is true because each relevant cell (the score column) for February 4 has a value less than 4485.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all games on February 4 have scores smaller than 4485. The relevant cells are the two entries under the \"score\" column in their respective rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"the state sport centre be the home ground of the south dragon.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table columns to see which ones are relevant. The columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. Since the claim mentions \"home ground,\" I'm particularly interested in the \"venue\" column because it likely indicates where each game was played.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to check if the South Dragons have a game at the State Sports Centre. \n\nLooking at row 0: The home team is the South Dragons, and the venue is Hisense Arena. So, this isn't the State Sports Centre.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Sydney Spirit; venue is State Sports Centre, but that's not the South Dragons' game.\n\nRows 2-6 don't list any games involving the South Dragons at the State Sports Centre.\n\nIn row 7 (row index 7), the home team is the South Dragons, and the venue is Hisense Arena again. So, they played against Melbourne Tigers there, but that's not the State Sports Centre.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, in row 1, the away team is Cairns Taipans at State Sports Centre, but the home team is Sydney Spirit, so South Dragons aren't involved there.\n\nSo, across all rows, I don't see any game where the South Dragons are listed as the home team at State Sports Centre. Their games are either at Hisense Arena or other venues.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence in the table that the State Sports Centre is their home ground.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
