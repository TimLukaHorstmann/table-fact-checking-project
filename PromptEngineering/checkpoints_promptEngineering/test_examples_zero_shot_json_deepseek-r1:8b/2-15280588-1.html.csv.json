The dates in the table are scattered, so I should go row by row until I find one with July 29.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- Row 0: August 9\n- Row 1: August 13\n- ...\n- Continuing down, I see row 21 is August 31.\nWait, that's not it. Hmm.\n\nI need to check each row carefully. Maybe I'm missing July 29. Let me go further.\n\nWait, looking at the list again:\n\nI think I might have skipped a part. Wait, row 21 is August 31. Then rows continue into September and beyond. So perhaps there's no match on July 29 in this table? Or maybe I need to check each row for July 29 specifically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a specific column or data point related to hosting. Maybe I should look at the 'Date' column for matches hosted by SK Brann on July 29.\n\nGoing through each date:\n\n- Row 5: August 9\n- Row 6: August 13\n- Row 10: August 24\n- Row 12: August 27\n- Row 14: September 14\n- Row 19: October 2\n- Etc.\n\nI don't see a July 29 date in the table. So maybe SK Brann didn't host any matches on that specific date in this dataset, or perhaps it's not covered here.\n\nAlternatively, if I check for the 'Opponent' and 'Competition', but the claim is about hosting the Champion League (q). So I need to see if there's an entry on July 29 where SK Brann is the home team playing in a Champions League qualifying match.\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\nI don't find any matches on July 29. The closest is August 9, but that's not July.\n\nWait, perhaps the table only includes certain dates, and July 29 isn't listed here. So based on the data provided, there's no evidence of SK Brann hosting a Champions League (q) match on July 29. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no relevant cell in the table supporting it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"In the match on July 29, FK Ventspils play as a visitor team against SK Brann at the Brann Stadion, Bergen.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the match on July 29 in the table. Let me scan through each row to find the one that matches this date.\n\nLooking at the data, I see the last few rows are September and October dates, so maybe July entries come earlier. Let me check from the top:\n\nRow 0: August 24\nRow 1: August 27\nWait, no July dates yet. Hmm, perhaps I need to go further back. Wait, the user provided a list starting with August 24 as row 23, but in the initial data, maybe it's better to check each row sequentially.\n\nWait, let me recount the rows. Each entry has a date and other details. Let me go through them:\n\nRow 0: August 24\nRow 1: August 27\nRow 2: September 14\n...\nNo, I think I might have missed July 29 in my initial scan. Let me check from the top again.\n\nLooking at each entry, row 25 is August 31, then row 26 is September 14. Wait, maybe the July 29 entry is somewhere around row 20-30? Or perhaps it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the data provided by the user, the matches go from August 24 onwards. So perhaps there's no match on July 29 in the table. If that's the case, then the claim would be false because there's no evidence of such a match in the given data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each entry:\n\n- August 24\n- August 27\n- September 14\n- September 18\n- September 22\n- September 28\n- October 2\n- October 6\n- October 19\n- October 26\n- November 2\n\nNo July dates here. So, the match on July 29 isn't present in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided, so the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"fk ventspils be the visitor of the match on april 20th\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. First, I'll look at each row and see where the dates and teams match.\n\nLooking at the table, I'm searching for any matches that happened on April 20th. Scanning through the rows, I notice there's no match on April 20th listed in the table. The closest entries are on April 20th, but it seems like there's a typo or perhaps an error because the data goes up to November 2nd.\n\nNext, I need to check which teams were involved as visitors on that date. Since there's no match on April 20th, I can infer that the claim might be based on incorrect information. The table doesn't show fk ventspils as visitors on any specific dates except in later matches, but specifically, it's not for April 20th.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided, so the answer should be \"FALSE\". There are no relevant cells because the date in question isn't present in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not have a match on April 20th in the table, so it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"Champion League (q) be the tournament on April 21 hosted by Stab\u00e6k.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a specific tournament name, \"Champion League (q)\", occurring on April 21, and being hosted by Stab\u00e6k. \n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it's a schedule with various matches across different months and dates. Each row has details like date, home team, away team, and the tournament name.\n\nI'll start by checking if there's any match on April 21. Scanning through the dates, I don't immediately see an April 21 entry. The earliest dates listed are in April but not specifically 21st. For example, the first row is April 1 and the next is April 8, then April 15, 22, etc. So, no April 21 date stands out.\n\nNext, I'll look for any mention of Stab\u00e6k as the host club. Scanning each row, I see that some matches are hosted by Stab\u00e6k, like on August 13 and August 27 against Marseille. But none of these are on April 21.\n\nAlso, the tournament names listed in the table include \"Champions League (q)\" for certain matches, particularly those involving European clubs like Marseille and Deportivo Coru\u00f1a. However, these instances don't fall on April 21 either.\n\nThe claim specifies that the tournament is hosted by Stab\u00e6k specifically on April 21. From the data, it seems that there's no such match. Stab\u00e6k usually hosts matches in August and September, not in April. Therefore, the claim doesn't align with any entries in the table.\n\nSo, putting this together, there's no evidence in the table to support the claim of a Champion League (q) match on April 21 hosted by Stab\u00e6k. The relevant columns would be \"Date\" and \"Home Team\" to check these specifics.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"}]}",
