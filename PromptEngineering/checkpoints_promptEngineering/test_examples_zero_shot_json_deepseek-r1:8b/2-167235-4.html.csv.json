    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the oldest prime minister , 1872 - 1963\" is true based on the given table. Let's break down the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row represents a different prime minister with their respective details.\n\nThe claim in question is about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's lifespan as the oldest prime minister from 1872 to 1963. So, I need to check if there's any data in the table that supports or contradicts this.\n\nStarting with the 'name' column, I look for entries containing \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" \u2013 doesn't match.\n- Row 1: \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 3: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\" \u2013 yes, this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, focusing on the 'born - died' column for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. The data here shows his lifespan as \"1872 - 1963\". That directly matches the claim's timeframe of 1872 to 1963, indicating he lived during that period.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the other relevant columns: term start is \"22 october 1935\" and term end is \"9 november 1936\". These are specific dates when he served as prime minister, but they don't affect his lifespan claim. The political party is listed as \"non - party\", which isn't needed here.\n\nSo, the relevant cells that confirm his lifespan are in row 3 for both 'name' and 'born - died'. Since there's no contradictory information and his lifespan aligns with the claim, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim says and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota's leadership.\" So, I'm looking for information about when Kostaq Kota started his term, specifically if it was on September 5, 1928. \n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. The data rows include details about different leaders, including their terms.\n\nLet me go through each row to find Kostaq Kota's entries. \n\nRow 1 is labeled \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" but doesn't have a name. So maybe this is just the context for that period.\n\nRow 2: The name is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", born-died from 1889-1949, term start on September 5, 1928, term end March 5, 1930, and political party as non-party. This seems relevant because it's the first instance of Kostaq Kota.\n\nRow 3: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" is here, so this isn't Kostaq Kota.\n\nRow 4: \"mehdi bej frashri (1st time)\", not relevant.\n\nRow 5: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\", so this is his second term. The term start is November 9, 1936, which is later than September 1928. So the first occurrence of Kostaq Kota as prime minister started in September 1928, and he served until March 1930.\n\nSo the claim says that the earliest term start under Kostaq Kota was on September 5, 1928. Checking row 2, column \"term start\" is indeed 5 September 1928. Therefore, this supports the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no earlier terms for him in the table. The first time he's mentioned is row 2, which has the term start of September 5, 1928. The second time is row 5, starting November 9, 1936, which is later. So yes, row 2 is the earliest.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 2, column \"term start\", and also maybe his name column to confirm it's Kostaq Kota. But the claim mentions Kostaq Kota specifically, so checking the name column for that row is also important.\n\nSo in terms of columns, I need to list both \"name\" and \"term start\" from row 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine if the claim \"all prime minister on the list have no political party\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The table has five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. There are five rows of data, each representing a different prime minister with their respective terms and parties.\n\nThe claim is that all listed prime ministers have no political party. So I need to check each row to see if the 'political party' column indicates they belong to any party or not.\n\nLooking at the table:\n1. The first row has \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" as both name and political party. This seems odd because a prime minister representing a period might be a collective term rather than an individual. But in this context, it's listed under 'name', so perhaps it's referring to a specific person or a group that isn't tied to a party. However, the column \"political party\" here is filled with \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", which might be a way to denote that they were non-partisan or part of an inter-party coalition. But I'm not entirely sure if this counts as having a political party.\n\n2. The second row: \"kostaq kota (1st time)\". His political party is listed as \"non - party\". So he doesn't belong to any party, which aligns with the claim.\n\n3. Third row: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\". Again, political party is \"non - party\", so he also doesn't have a party affiliation.\n\n4. Fourth row: \"mehdi bej frash\u2022ri (1st time)\". His political party is listed as \"non - party\".\n\n5. Fifth row: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\". Again, \"non - party\" is his affiliation.\n\nNow, focusing on the first row: if it's a prime minister representing a period without any specific party, does that mean they have no political party? Or is this a way to indicate they were non-partisan? The term \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" could imply multiple individuals or a collective term. If this is meant to indicate no party affiliation, then perhaps it's considered as having no party.\n\nBut wait, the first row's name is also listed as \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", which might be confusing. Maybe it's a specific prime minister with that name? Or could it be an error in the table where they didn't assign a political party correctly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row is intended to show that during that period, the prime ministers didn't belong to any single party, hence no political party listed. But the way the data is structured, each row should represent a specific individual's term, so having \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" in both name and party might be incorrect.\n\nWait, looking closer: in the second row, the name is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", and the political party is \"non - party\". Similarly for others. So perhaps the first row is a placeholder or incorrectly entered data. If that's the case, maybe it's an error, but since the claim says all have no party, I have to check based on what's in the table.\n\nIf the first row truly has \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" as their political party, then that would mean they do belong to a party, which is contradictory. But if it's intended to denote no party, perhaps it's an oversight or misrepresentation.\n\nBut given the data as is, I have to go by what's provided. The first row lists \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" in both name and political party columns. So that would indicate they do belong to a party, which contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'name' column should be individual names, but in the first row, it's \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", which might imply multiple individuals without a specific party, but the political party column is also filled with that same term. So that would mean they are part of a group without a specific party.\n\nBut considering the other rows have explicit 'non - party' entries, perhaps the first row's entry is a way to indicate no party as well. Maybe it's a formatting issue where \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" is used instead of \"non - party\". If that's the case, then all of them would indeed have no political party.\n\nBut without more context, I have to assume each entry in the 'political party' column accurately reflects their affiliation. The first row says \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean they were part of multiple parties or that there was no single party for that period, making them effectively non-partisan.\n\nHowever, if the claim is strictly based on what's in the table without any external knowledge, then the first row does have a political party entry, albeit a generic one. That would mean not all of them are without a party, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" is meant to indicate no party, then maybe it's intended to align with the others, making the claim TRUE. But based purely on data, the first row does have an entry in the political party column, so it's not empty or marked as non-party.\n\nTherefore, considering each row, only the first one might be considered as having a political party, depending on how we interpret \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\". But since the claim is about all of them having no party, any instance where a political party is listed, even if generic, would make the statement FALSE.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be FALSE because not all have no political party. The first row does list a political party.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all prime ministers in the table have no political party. However, upon examining the table:\n\n1. The first row lists \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" as both name and political party, indicating they belong to a political group or are non-partisan.\n2. The other four rows explicitly state \"non - party\", meaning they don't affiliate with any specific political party.\n\nSince not all prime ministers have no political party (the first row does), the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Kostaq Kota's term start being on November 9, 1936, after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term end is true based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row represents a different prime minister or leader with their respective details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two people: Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (also known as Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri). So I should find the rows corresponding to each of them in the table.\n\nLooking at the data, there are five rows. The second row is about Kostaq Kotas (1st time), and the fourth row is about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time). \n\nSo for Kostaq Kotas, his term start is on September 5, 1928, and term end is April 8, 1939. For Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, his term starts on October 22, 1935, and ends on November 9, 1936.\n\nThe claim says that Kostaq's term start (November 9, 1936) comes after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term end. Wait, but looking at the data, Mehdi's term ends on November 9, 1936. So Kostaq's term starts on the same day Mehdi's term ends.\n\nDoes that mean it's immediately after? Well, technically, if a term ends and another begins on the same day, it could be considered as starting after the previous one ended. But I'm not sure if that's how terms work in this context. Usually, a new term starts right after the previous one ends, so maybe they overlap or are consecutive.\n\nBut the claim says \"after,\" which implies that Kostaq's start is later than Mehdi's end. Since both events happen on November 9, it depends on the exact timing. If the term ends at a certain time and the next starts later that same day, then yes, it would be after. But if they end and start simultaneously, it might not be strictly after.\n\nLooking at the data: Mehdi's term end is November 9, 1936, and Kostaq's term start is also November 9, 1936. So their terms are on the same day but possibly different times or instances. Since the claim says \"after,\" it might not hold because they're on the same date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a break between Mehdi's end and Kostaq's start, but according to the data provided, both events are on November 9, 1936. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's not after in terms of date.\n\nWait, let me check again. The term start for Kostaq is November 9, 1936, and Mehdi's end is also November 9, 1936. So they are on the same day. Therefore, the claim that Kostaq's term starts after Mehdi's ends might not be accurate because it's not a different date.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because both Kostaq Kotas and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri have their terms end and start on the same date, November 9, 1936. Thus, it isn't accurate that one starts after the other.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Kostaq Kota Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister of Albania.\" It seems to suggest that these two individuals have both been the first-time Prime Minister of Albania.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different Prime Minister. The columns include name, their term periods (born - died, term start, term end), and political party.\n\nLet me check each relevant entry:\n\n1. **Kostaq Kota**: There are two entries for him.\n   - First occurrence: He is listed as \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" in the first data row. Wait, that seems confusing because it's repeating \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" across columns. Maybe this is a placeholder or a header issue.\n   - Second occurrence: In row index 1, he's listed as \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" with term start 5 September 1928 and term end 5 March 1930. So his first term was from 1928 to 1930.\n\n2. **Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri**: He is mentioned in the claim, but I need to check if he's ever been a Prime Minister of Albania as the first time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The third row (index 3) is Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time). His term start is 22 October 1935 and term end is 9 November 1936. So he was indeed a Prime Minister in his first time.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"Kostaq Kota Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister.\" That phrasing suggests that both Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri are each their own first-time PMs. From the table, Kostaq Kota had a first term as PM, and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri also had a first term.\n\nHowever, I notice that in the claim, it's phrased as both being \"1st time prime minister of Albania.\" But in the table, each of them is listed separately. So perhaps the claim is suggesting that Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri have both been the first-time Prime Minister, which is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back, the claim might be a bit unclear. It's stated as \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" So it could mean that both Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri have been the first-time PMs.\n\nFrom the table, yes, both have their own entries as the first time. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells:\n\nFor Kostaq Kota:\n- In row 1 (index 1), columns \"name\" and all the term-related columns.\nBut since the claim refers to him being a PM, the relevant columns are name and perhaps born-died or others? Wait, the claim doesn't mention anything about terms, just that he's been a PM. So probably only the name column is relevant.\n\nSimilarly for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri:\n- He's in row 3 (index 3). The same applies; only the name column is relevant unless the term details are needed. Since the claim doesn't specify terms, just that he was a PM once.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to check if both were indeed PMs as per the table.\n\nKostaq Kota: In row index 1, he's listed as having been a PM during his first time. So the relevant cell is row 1, column \"name\".\n\nMehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: In row index 3, same thing. Relevant cell is row 3, column \"name\".\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's phrased as both being \"1st time prime minister of Albania.\" So maybe each of them had their first term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri are both first-time PMs, which they are according to the table. Therefore, the relevant cells would be their respective rows under \"name\".\n\nSo, in the data array, the relevant rows are:\n\n- index 1: name = \"kostaq kota (1st time)\"\n- index 3: name = \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\"\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would include these two entries.\n\nWait, but in the table's data array, each row is a separate entity. So Kostaq Kota is listed as two separate rows: one with his first term and another with his second term. Similarly, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is listed once as (1st time).\n\nTherefore, for the claim to be true, both Kostaq Kota (as 1st time) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (also as 1st time) must be present.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1, column_name: \"name\" \u2192 \"kostaq kota (1st time)\"\n- row_index: 3, column_name: \"name\" \u2192 \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\"\n\nThus, these two entries support the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the second oldest prime minister after pandeli evangjeli.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party.\n\nI need to find relevant cells related to the claim. The claim mentions two individuals: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri and Pandeli Evangjeli. It's about their ages relative to each other during their terms as prime ministers.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the name is either \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" or \"pandeli evangjeli.\" \n\nIn row 2, the name is \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\", with a born-died range of 1859-1939 and term dates from March 6, 1930, to October 16, 1935. In row 3, the name is \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\", born 1872-1963, with a term start on October 22, 1935, and end on November 9, 1936.\n\nWait, but looking at their term starts: Pandeli's second term started on March 6, 1930, while Mehdi's first term started on October 22, 1935. So Pandeli was prime minister earlier than Mehdi. But the claim says Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli. \n\nI think it's about their age at some point in time, not necessarily their order of service. So I need to compare their ages when they were alive. \n\nPandeli was born in 1859 and died in 1939. Mehdi was born in 1872 and died in 1963. So in terms of lifespan, Pandeli lived until 1939 at age 80, while Mehdi lived until 1963 at age 91. Therefore, Mehdi was older than Pandeli.\n\nWait, but the claim is about being the second oldest after Pandeli, which might mean that during their time as PM, Pandeli was older or something else. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps it's about who served longer or who was older in terms of age when serving.\n\nBut looking at their term dates: Pandeli's second term started in March 1930 and ended in October 1935, while Mehdi's first term started in October 1935 and ended in November 1936. So during their overlapping terms, they were both serving around the same time but in consecutive years.\n\nAs for age, since Pandeli was born in 1859, by 1930 he would be about 71. Mehdi was born in 1872, so by 1935 he would be 63. That makes Pandeli older than Mehdi during their terms. Therefore, if the claim is that Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli, it's not accurate because Pandeli was older.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to who served longer or had a later term. But I'm focusing on age. Since Pandeli was born earlier, he would naturally be older than Mehdi, making him the older of the two. Therefore, Mehdi wouldn't be second oldest after Pandeli; rather, he is younger.\n\nSo the claim seems to be incorrect because Mehdi wasn't older than Pandeli; Pandeli was older. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli Evangjeli. However, upon examining their dates of birth and term starts, it's clear that Pandeli was older than Mehdi during their time as prime ministers. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Albania's first prime minister began their term in 1927\" is true or false by checking the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The table has columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. There are five rows of data for different prime ministers.\n\nThe claim refers to \"Albania's first prime minister.\" So I need to find out who that is from the table. Looking at the 'name' column:\n\n- The first row has \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" repeated, which seems like a general category.\n- The second row: \"kostaq kota (1st time)\"\n- Third row: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\"\n- Fourth row: \"mehdi bej frashri (1st time)\"\n- Fifth row: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\"\n\nSo, the first prime minister would likely be Kostaq Kota, as he's listed twice with \"(1st time)\" in his name. Now, I need to check when his term started.\n\nLooking at the 'term start' column:\n\n- Row 2: \"5 september 1928\"\n- Row 3: \"6 march 1930\"\n- Row 4: \"22 october 1935\"\n- Row 5: \"9 november 1936\"\n\nWait, Kostaq Kota is in row 2 and row 5. The term start for row 2 is September 1928, which would make him the first prime minister. But the claim says he started in 1927, which doesn't match.\n\nSo I'm checking if any of the relevant cells support the claim. Since Kostaq Kota's term began in 1928, not 1927, that directly contradicts the claim. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps to verify the claim against the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"albania have be see prime minister come from a political party\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nThe claim seems to suggest that Albania's Prime Ministers are required to come from a political party. But looking at the data in the table, I should check each row and column to see if there's any indication of this.\n\nFirst, let's look at the columns provided: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party. So each row represents a different Prime Minister, with their details.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\n1. The first row seems to be about \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" and doesn't specify a person's name. Maybe it's just an umbrella term for the period.\n2. The second row is about \"kostaq kota (1st time)\". Looking at the political party column here, it says \"non - party\". So this PM didn't come from any party.\n3. Third row: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\", again \"non - party\" in the political party column. So another one not from a party.\n4. Fourth row: \"mehdi bej frashari (1st time)\", also \"non - party\".\n5. Fifth row: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\", same as before, \"non - party\".\n\nWait, so all the individuals listed in the table are from \"non - party\". That means that in these specific instances, the Prime Ministers didn't come from any political party.\n\nBut the claim is about whether they \"have be see prime minister come from a political party.\" So if some of them did come from parties and others didn't, does that mean the statement isn't fully accurate? Or maybe the table doesn't cover all possible cases?\n\nLooking back at the claim: it's stated in general terms. The data shows at least one PM (maybe more) who are \"non - party.\" So the claim might not be entirely true because some Prime Ministers didn't come from a political party.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"have be see prime minister come from a political party.\" Maybe it's phrased as whether all or most do. If some don't, then the claim is false because not all Albanian Prime Ministers in this period came from parties.\n\nAlternatively, if the table only shows specific cases and doesn't cover all possible PMs, then maybe the claim isn't necessarily contradicted by the data provided. But I think the task is to check based on the given data.\n\nSo, looking at the relevant cells: each row's \"political party\" column. The relevant cells would be where the political party is specified. From the table, every PM in rows 1-5 has either \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" as name or specific names with \"non - party.\"\n\nWait, actually, the first row doesn't have a person's name but rather a term, so it might not be relevant to individuals. So the relevant cells are the ones where each PM is listed and their political party.\n\nTherefore, for rows 2-5, the column \"political party\" is \"non - party.\" That directly contradicts the claim that they come from a political party. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Albanian Prime Ministers come from political parties. However, according to the table, several named Prime Ministers are listed as \"non - party,\" indicating they didn't belong to any party. This contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has some data about people and their terms, like when they started and ended. The claim in question is: \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936 , after pandeli evangjeli 's term end.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. There are five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. The data is provided in rows, each representing a different individual.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's about two people: kostaq kota and pandeli evangjeli. Specifically, it says that kostaq kota started his term on 9 November 1936, which was after pandeli evangjeli ended his term.\n\nI should locate where these individuals are in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. The first row seems to be a header or maybe a placeholder because all columns have \"prime ministers...\" as their values.\n2. The second row is about \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", with his term start on 5 September 1928, and term end on 5 March 1930.\n3. The third row is pandeli evangjeli (2nd time), with term start on 6 March 1930 and term end on 16 October 1935.\n4. The fourth row is mehdi bej frashiri (1st time), starting on 22 October 1935 and ending on 9 November 1936.\n5. The fifth row is kostaq kota again, this time as the (2nd time), with term start on 9 November 1936 and term end on 8 April 1939.\n\nSo, kostaq kota appears twice in different rows: once as the first time and then as the second time. Pandeli evangjeli is also in a separate row.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: kostaq kota's term start was on 9 November 1936, which should be after pandeli evangjeli's term end. Looking at the data:\n\n- Pandeli evangjeli (3rd row) ended his term on 16 October 1935.\n- Kostaq kota (5th row) started his second term on 9 November 1936.\n\nSo, 9 November 1936 is indeed after 16 October 1935. That checks out because October is earlier than November, so the start of kostaq's term in late November would be after pandeli's term ended in mid-October.\n\nWait, but I should also check if it's the same individual or different terms. Kostaq kota has two entries: 1st time and 2nd time. The claim refers to \"kostaq kota 's term start,\" so that could be either of his terms. But in this case, it seems to refer to the second term because the term start is after pandeli's term end.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Are there any other rows that might have overlapping or conflicting data? For example, mehdi bej frashiri started on 22 October 1935 and ended on 9 November 1936. That means his term started before pandeli evangjeli's term end but ended after kostaq kota's second term start.\n\nBut the claim specifically compares kostaq kota's term start to pandeli evangjeli's term end, so mehdi's data isn't directly relevant here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Pandeli evangjeli ended on 16 October 1935. Kostaq kota started his second term on 9 November 1936, which is indeed after Pandeli's term ended.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because kostaq kota's term start in November 1936 occurs after pandeli evangjeli's term end in October 1935.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"term end\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the only 1st time minister of albania be pandeli evangjeli",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the only 1st time minister of albania be pandeli evangjeli.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The columns are name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. The data has multiple rows, each representing a person's terms in Albania.\n\nThe claim is about someone being the \"1st time minister.\" I think this refers to a first-time prime minister. So I need to look for any row where the name is Pandeli Evangjeli and it's his first time as a prime minister.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The second row (row index 1) has the name Pandeli Evangjeli, and it says \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\". Hmm, that indicates he served twice. So this is his second term, not the first. \n\nWait, the claim says he's the only \"1st time\" minister. Maybe I need to check all rows where the name is Pandeli Evangjeli to see if any of them are marked as their first time.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 1: Name is \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", so not an individual person.\nRow 2: Pandeli Evangjeli, second time. So he's been prime minister twice before.\nRow 3: Mehdi Bej Frashri, first time? No, his name doesn't mention the term number.\nWait, no, each row has a name and then in parentheses, perhaps indicating their term number.\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\n- Row 2: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" \u2013 so that's his second time as prime minister.\n- Is there another row with Pandeli Evangjeli? No. So he only served twice.\n\nSo the claim is saying he was the first-time minister, but in reality, he was the second time when he held the position.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Pandeli Evangjeli wasn't a first-time minister; he was already serving his second term.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be \"name\" and possibly \"born - died\" or others? Wait, the claim refers to being a first-time minister, so maybe the column is indicating whether it's their first time.\n\nLooking at row 2: the political party is non-party, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, the rows have the term start and end dates. But the claim is about the position, not the term dates.\n\nSo the key columns are \"name\" to identify who Pandeli Evangjeli is, and perhaps \"political party,\" but more importantly, any indication of whether it's his first time.\n\nIn row 2, he's marked as (2nd time), so that's relevant. So the relevant_cells would be where name is Pandeli Evangjeli and where it's specified if it's their first time or not.\n\nBut in this table, each row has a term number in parentheses after the name, indicating how many times they served. For example, \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" \u2013 so that row is relevant because it shows he was already on his second time when he held the position.\n\nSo, for the claim to be true, Pandeli Evangjeli should have been a first-time minister, but in reality, he wasn't. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nNow, the relevant cells are where his name is listed and whether it's his first time or not. So the relevant columns would be \"name\" and perhaps another column indicating if it's their first term. But looking at the table structure, the parentheses after the name seem to indicate the term number, so maybe that's a separate data point.\n\nBut in the given JSON, each row has the name as the first element, followed by other columns. So \"name\" is definitely relevant, and perhaps the column indicating if it's their first time.\n\nWait, but the columns are fixed: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party. The parentheses in the data might be part of the name or additional info. Wait, no, looking at row 2:\n\n[\n  \"kostaq kota (1st time)\",\n  \"1889 - 1949\",\n  \"5 september 1928\",\n  \"5 march 1930\",\n  \"non - party\"\n]\n\nWait, actually, in the data, the name is sometimes followed by \"(1st time)\" or \"(2nd time)\". So perhaps the second element of each row isn't the term start but part of the name. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the columns are separate.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nThe columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party.\n\nSo in row 1, data is:\n[\n  \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\",\n  \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\",\n  \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\",\n  \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\",\n  \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\"\n]\n\nThis seems like it's a header or placeholder, not an actual person.\n\nRow 2:\n[\n  \"kostaq kota (1st time)\",\n  \"1889 - 1949\",\n  \"5 september 1928\",\n  \"5 march 1930\",\n  \"non - party\"\n]\n\nSo the name here is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", which seems to include the term number as part of his name, perhaps? Or maybe it's an annotation.\n\nSimilarly, row 3:\n[\n  \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\",\n  \"1859 - 1939\",\n  \"6 march 1930\",\n  \"16 october 1935\",\n  \"non - party\"\n]\n\nSo in this case, the name is followed by \"(2nd time)\", so it's indicating he served twice before.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then each row has the person's name and a note about how many times they've held office. So for Pandeli Evangjeli, his first term would not be listed here because this is his second time.\n\nSo in row 2, Kostaq Kota is marked as (1st time), so he was a first-time prime minister. But Pandeli Evangjeli is marked as (2nd time), meaning he's been there before.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only 1st time minister of Albania is false because Kostaq Kota is also listed as a first-time minister in another row.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"the only 1st time minister,\" implying only one person. But from the table, there are multiple people with (1st time), including Kostaq Kota and perhaps others.\n\nSo to check if Pandeli Evangjeli was a 1st time minister, we look for any row where his name is listed as (1st time). If none exists, then he wasn't a first-time minister. But in the table, he's marked as (2nd time), so he wasn't.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE, and relevant cells are the rows where his name is listed along with whether it's his first time or not.\n\nSo the steps I took were:\n\n1. Identify who Pandeli Evangjeli is from the table.\n2. Look for any mention of him being a 1st time minister.\n3. Since he's marked as (2nd time), the claim is false.\n4. Identify relevant cells: name and whether it's their first term.\n\nI think that covers it. So the final answer is that the statement is false, and the relevant data points are the name column and any additional info indicating if it's their first time.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine whether the statement \"Pandeli Evangjeli was the only 1st time minister of Albania\" is true based on the provided table. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- The table lists individuals with their names, birth-death years, term start and end dates, and political party.\n- Each name may be followed by a parenthetical note indicating how many times they held office (e.g., \"1st time,\" \"2nd time\").\n- From the table:\n  - Kostaq Kota is marked as \"(1st time),\" meaning he was a first-time minister.\n  - Pandeli Evangjeli is marked as \"(2nd time),\" indicating he had previously served.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPandeli Evangjeli was not a first-time minister; thus, the statement is false. The relevant data points are the name and any additional notes about the term number.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is false. Relevant cells include the name column and any additional info indicating if it's their first time.",
