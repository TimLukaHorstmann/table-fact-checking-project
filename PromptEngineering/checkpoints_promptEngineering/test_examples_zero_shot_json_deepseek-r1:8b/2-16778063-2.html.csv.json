    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"week 12 be on december 2 , 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON table provided. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week with corresponding data.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"week 12\" and the date \"december 2 , 2001\". So, my first step is to find the relevant rows in the data array that match week 12. \n\nLooking through the data, I see that each sub-array starts with the week number as an integer. The row for week 12 has a week value of 12 and the date \"december 2 , 2001\". That matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nNext, I need to verify if the opponent in that particular week's game aligns with any additional conditions implied by the claim. Wait, actually, the claim only specifies the week and date. It doesn't mention anything about the opponent or result. So maybe the opponent isn't necessary for this check. \n\nHowever, just to be thorough, I'll look at who the opponent was in week 12. According to the data, the opponent was \"tampa bay buccaneers\". The claim doesn't specify the opponent, so that's not a point of contention here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are multiple entries for week 12. Looking back, I only see one row with week 12 on December 2, 2001. So no duplication or ambiguity there.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, week 12 does occur on December 2, 2001. There's a direct match between the claim and the data provided. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is supported by the table, making it TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"on week 12 the attendance be 64217\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a specific week with corresponding data. My task is to check if for Week 12, the attendance figure matches 64217.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's specifically about Week 12, so I'll focus on that week. I need to find the relevant row in the table where the \"week\" column equals 12.\n\nI go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Week 1: Not 12.\n2. Week 2: Not 12.\n3. Week 3: Not 12.\n4. Week 4: Not 12.\n5. Week 5: Not 12.\n6. Week 6: Not 12.\n7. Week 7: Not 12.\n8. Week 9: Oh, week 9 is listed here. Wait, that's not week 12, so I continue.\n9. Week 10: Not 12.\n10. Week 11: Not 12.\n11. Week 12: Found it! This row has the week number 12.\n\nNow, checking the attendance for Week 12. The data says 52135. Hmm, that's not matching 64217 as stated in the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rows. I count each one to ensure I didn't skip any. Yes, week 12 is indeed at row index 11 (since it starts from 0). The attendance there is 52135, which doesn't match 64217.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on Week 12, the attendance was 64,217. Upon examining the table, the row corresponding to Week 12 shows an attendance of 52,135, not 64,217. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The data rows have information for each week, including who the opponent was that week.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Cleveland Brown\" as the opponent on week 14. So I need to check two things: whether the opponent in week 14 is Cleveland Browns and what the actual result of that game was.\n\nLooking at the table, week 14's data is in row index 13 (since it starts from 0). The opponent for week 14 is listed as \"new york jets\". That doesn't match the claim's \"Cleveland Brown\".\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Maybe there's a mistake in indexing. Let me count again: rows start at 0, so row 13 corresponds to week 14. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo since the opponent for week 14 is the New York Jets, not the Cleveland Browns, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]}",
