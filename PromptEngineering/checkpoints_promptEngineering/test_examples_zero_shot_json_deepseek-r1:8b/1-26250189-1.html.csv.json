It has columns like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. Each row seems to represent a different performance or selection.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 0: The song choice is \"auditioner 's choice\" and the original artist is \"glenn miller and his orchestra.\" So this doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 1: Theme is \"first solo performance,\" song choice is \"for once in my life,\" original artist is \"stevie wonder.\" This seems relevant because it matches both the song title and the original artist mentioned in the claim.\n\nRows 2-4 mention different themes like group performance or second solo but don't have \"first solo performance.\"\n\nRow 5 onwards: These are about top groups, Billboard hits, etc., so not directly related to a specific first solo performance.\n\nSo only Row 1 has both the song choice as \"for once in my life\" and the original artist as Stevie Wonder. Therefore, this row supports the claim. \n\nI should check if any other rows might also match, but looking through each, none else have both the correct song and artist for a first solo performance.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by Row 1's data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"For the Rolling Stone theme, Katie be number 6 in order.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a \"Rolling Stone\" theme. Looking at the table, I see that there's a column called \"theme,\" and some rows have \"rolling stones\" as their theme. Specifically, row 7 has \"the rolling stones\" as the theme.\n\nNext, the claim says \"Katie be number 6 in order.\" I'm assuming this refers to the \"order\" column. The table does have an \"order\" column. So, for the row where the theme is \"rolling stones,\" I need to check what the order is.\n\nLooking through the table, let's find the row with the theme \"rolling stones.\" It's row 7: \n[\n  \"top 12\",\n  \"the rolling stones\",\n  \"wild horses\",\n  \"the rolling stones\",\n  \"6\",\n  \"safe\"\n]\n\nSo in this row, the order is listed as \"6\". \n\nNow, the claim mentions \"Katie\" being number 6. I need to check if \"Katie\" is associated with this row. The \"song choice\" column has \"wild horses,\" which was performed by \"the rolling stones.\" There's no mention of a performer named Katie in this context. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row represents a different week or performance category, and each cell corresponds to that week's theme, song choice, original artist, order, etc. So, for the Rolling Stones theme (row 7), the order is 6. However, there's no information about \"Katie\" in this row.\n\nI think the claim might be trying to say that Katie was number 6 when the Rolling Stone theme was chosen. But from the table, I don't see any reference to \"Katie\" being associated with order 6 in that context. Maybe \"Katie\" refers to another performer or aspect not listed here, or perhaps it's a misinterpretation of the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is correct because it's referring to the position in the top 12, and Katie was placed 6th. But without any row mentioning \"Katie,\" I can't confirm that from this table. The table doesn't have any entries for \"Katie\" as an artist or performer.\n\nSo, considering all of this, the claim doesn't seem to be fully supported by the provided data. There's no entry in the table where Katie is associated with the Rolling Stone theme and order 6.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n]}",

The claim states: \"the song chosen for the rolling stone theme was originally performed by the rolling stones.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any relevant rows and columns that relate to this claim.\n\nLooking at the 'theme' column, I see entries like \"the rolling stones\" in row 7 (index 7). That's a likely candidate because it directly mentions the Rolling Stones as the theme. \n\nNext, the 'song choice' column is important because the claim refers to the song chosen for that theme. In row 7, under 'song choice,' it says \"wild horses.\" So this is the song in question.\n\nThen, the 'original artist' column should tell me who originally performed \"wild horses.\" The entry here is also \"the rolling stones,\" which matches the band's name.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect this claim. For example, the 'result' column in row 7 says \"safe,\" but since it doesn't indicate anything about performance quality related to the original artist, I can ignore it for this specific claim.\n\nOther rows don't seem to mention the Rolling Stones as a theme or have their songs, so they're not relevant here. \n\nPutting it all together: The song chosen for the Rolling Stones theme is \"wild horses,\" which was originally performed by the Rolling Stones.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim says: \"big girl don't cry be the choice song where the original artist be stevie wonder.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for rows where both \"song choice\" is \"big girl don't cry\" and the \"original artist\" is Stevie Wonder. \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Song choice is \"last\", not relevant.\n- Row 1: Song choice is \"for once in my life\", original artist is Stevie Wonder, but song isn't \"big girl\".\n- Row 2: Song is \"no one\", no match.\n- Row 3: Song is \"chasing pavements\", not the target.\n- Rows 4-8: These have different song choices or artists. \n- Row 9: Song choice is \"big girls don't cry\" but original artist is Fergie, not Stevie Wonder.\n- Row 10: Song is \"chain of fools\", artist is Aretha Franklin.\n- Row 11: Song is \"let it be\", artist is The Beatles.\n\nNone of the rows have both \"big girl don't cry\" as the song choice and Stevie Wonder as the original artist. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells. These are the columns for \"song choice\" and \"original artist\". So, I need to list all rows where these are checked.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: song, artist\n- Row 1: song, artist (since the song is different but Stevie Wonder is there)\n- Rows 4-11: song, artist columns relevant as well.\n\nWait, actually, since the claim is specifically about \"big girl don't cry\" and Stevie Wonder, rows that have these should be included. But looking at row 9: it has \"big girls...\" but not Stevie. So maybe only rows where both are present regardless of the song match? Hmm, no, because the claim is about a specific combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the relevant cells are any rows where \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" columns are checked, as those are the ones we need to verify the claim. So all rows in \"song choice\" and \"original artist\".\n\nBut according to the instructions, the relevant_cells should be where the condition is met or not. Since the claim isn't true because there's no row matching both song and artist, perhaps the relevant cells are all rows where those columns might have data related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the specific rows that need to be checked for the claim. So in this case, I think the relevant cells are all rows because each could potentially affect whether the claim is true or false.\n\nWait no, actually, since the claim is about a specific song and artist, the relevant_cells would be the rows where \"song choice\" is \"big girl don't cry\" and \"original artist\" is Stevie Wonder. But in our table, there's no such row.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user might want all cells that are part of the claim, which are \"song choice\" and \"original artist\". So for each row, these columns could be relevant because they need to be checked against the claim.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include all rows where either column is in question.\n\nTherefore, I should list all cells under \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" as they are necessary to check the claim. That means:\n\nFor each row, if it has a value under \"song choice\", that's relevant. Similarly for \"original artist\".\n\nLooking at the table, every row has both columns except maybe some edge cases? Wait no, all rows have both.\n\nSo, I'll include all cells in \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" columns across all rows as relevant because they're the ones used to verify the claim.\n\nWait, but that might be too many. Maybe only those columns where the condition is checked. But since the claim involves two specific cells (big girl don't cry and Stevie Wonder), perhaps we need to find all cells in \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" because each of these could have values that are or aren't matching.\n\nBut I think the user expects us to list all columns where the data is relevant, not just the specific rows. So for this claim, since both \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" are involved, we need to look at all their cells to verify if any row meets the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant_cells should be each cell in those two columns because they are part of the condition being checked.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to include all rows where either \"song choice\" or \"original artist\" could potentially have data that would affect the claim. So for each row, if it has a value under these columns, it's relevant.\n\nSo the relevant_cells list would include, for each row, the cell in \"song choice\" and the cell in \"original artist\". Therefore, I'll create an array where each entry is a row index along with the column name. For example:\n\n- Row 0: song and original artist\n- Row 1: same\nAnd so on.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects just the columns, not the rows. Or maybe both.\n\nWait, the example given in the instructions includes two entries: one for \"Revenue\" (row 0) and \"Employees\" (row 1). So it's per row index and column name.\n\nTherefore, I need to list each occurrence of \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" across all rows as relevant cells because these are the data points that could affect whether the claim is true or false.\n\nSo for each row, add two entries: one for the song choice, another for original artist.\n\nBut that would result in a lot of entries. Let me count:\n\nThe table has 11 rows (from 0 to 10). Each row has \"song choice\" and \"original artist\". So for each row, we need two cells: song and artist.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells array will have 22 objects, each indicating row index and column name.\n\nBut perhaps that's too extensive. Alternatively, maybe only the specific columns are needed, but the user's example shows it per row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just include all the \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" cells as relevant because they're part of the data that could support or refute the claim.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed to list each occurrence of these columns across all rows.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those under the \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" columns for each row, as these are the data points needed to verify whether the claim holds true. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original_artist\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"9 be katie 's order number when the theme be the rolling stone\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to say that when the theme is \"the rolling stone,\" Katie's order number was 9. So I need to find a row in the table where the 'theme' column is \"the rolling stones\" (I notice that in the table, it's spelled as \"lennonmccartney\") and then check if Katie's 'order' number in that row is 9.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'columns' include 'week', 'theme', 'song choice', 'original artist', 'order', and 'result'. The data has multiple rows. Let me scan through each row to see which ones have 'the rolling stone' as their theme. Wait, in the table, the 'theme' column for the last relevant row is \"lennonmccartney\", which might be a typo or shorthand for \"The Rolling Stones\". So I'll consider that as the theme.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The first row has theme \"auditioner 's choice\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Second row: \"first solo performance\" \u2013 nope.\n- Third row: \"group performance\" \u2013 no.\n- Fourth row: \"second solo\" \u2013 no.\n- Fifth row: \"billboard hot 100 hits\" \u2013 no, and the theme is \"top 24\".\n- Sixth row: \"put your records on\" \u2013 theme is \"top 20\".\n- Seventh row: \"breakaway\" \u2013 theme is \"top 16\".\n- Eighth row: \"wild horses\" \u2013 theme is \"top 12\", original artist is also \"the rolling stones\". So this row has the theme \"the rolling stones\" (assuming 'lennonmccartney' is a shorthand). The order here is listed as 6.\n- Ninth row: \"big girls don't cry\" \u2013 theme is \"billboard 1 hits\".\n- Tenth row: \"chain of fools\" \u2013 R&B/soul theme.\n- Eleventh row: \"let it be\" \u2013 theme is \"top 9\", original artist is \"the beatles\". So the order here is 2.\n\nWait, in the eighth row, the theme is \"top 12\", and the song choice is \"wild horses\" by The Rolling Stones. So that's where the theme would be relevant for \"The Rolling Stone\".\n\nNow, in that row (which I think is the seventh data row because it's zero-indexed as row_index 7?), the order column says 6. But the claim says order number 9.\n\nWait, no, let me count again. The first data array is index 0, so:\n\n- Row 0: audition\n- Row 1: hollywood\n- Row 2: hollywood\n- Row 3: hollywood\n- Row 4: top24...\nSo the eighth row would be index 7 (since starting from 0). That's where the theme is \"top12\" and order is 6. So in that row, the order is 6, not 9.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all rows with their indices:\n\n0: audition\n1: hollywood\n2: hollywood\n3: hollywood\n4: top24\n5: top20\n6: top16\n7: top12 (theme \"the rolling stones\", order 6)\n8: top11\n9: top10\n10: top9\n\nSo the row where theme is \"rolling stones\" is index 7, and the order there is 6. The claim says when the theme is \"the rolling stone,\" Katie's order number was 9. But in that specific row, it's 6. Therefore, the claim is false because the order number isn't 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which row corresponds to Katie. Perhaps Katie has a different theme? Let me check all rows again for any mention of 'katie'. Looking through the 'original artist' column:\n\n- Row 0: glenn miller\n- Row1: stevie wonder\n- Row2: Alicia Keys\n- Row3: Adele\n- Row4: cy grant\n- Row5: corinne bailey rae\n- Row6: kelly clarkson\n- Row7: the rolling stones (artist is same as theme)\n- Row8: fergie\n- Row9: aretha franklin\n- Row10: the beatles\n\nI don't see any row with 'katie' in the original artist. So perhaps Katie isn't in the table, or maybe she's in another context. Alternatively, maybe \"Katie\" refers to a contestant with order number 9 in some other theme, but looking at the data, there is a row at index 10 where the theme is \"top9\", and the order is 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"when the theme be the rolling stone,\" so maybe any row where the theme is \"the rolling stones.\" But in all those rows, the order numbers are 6 or something else, not 9. So unless there's another row with theme \"rolling stone\" and order 9, which I don't see, the claim is false.\n\nSo to sum up:\n\n- The claim refers to a specific scenario where when the theme is \"the rolling stone,\" Katie's order number was 9.\n- Looking at the table, the only relevant row is index7 (theme \"top12\", order6) and another row index10 (theme \"top9\", order2).\n- Neither of these has an order number of 9 in the context of the theme being \"the rolling stones\".\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the theme is \"the rolling stone,\" Katie's order number was 9. However, examining the table, there's no row with both the theme as \"the rolling stones\" and an order number of 9 for Katie. The relevant rows either have different themes or incorrect order numbers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"order\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So that's not matching.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's about when the theme is r&b/soul, and the original artist is the rolling stone. So I need to find a row where both are present.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nOnly row 8 has the original artist as the rolling stones, but the theme there isn't r&b/soul. The only row with r&b/soul theme is row 10, where the original artist is aretha franklin, not the rolling stones.\n\nSo none of the rows have both the theme as r&b/soul and the original artist as \"the rolling stone\".
