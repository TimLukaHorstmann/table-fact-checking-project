Let me break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions Karachi as the venue. So I should look at the 'venue' column for any entry that says \"karachi.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'venue' value. Scanning through them:\n\n1. chittagong\n2. colombo\n3. colombo\n4. karachi\n5. sydney\n6. ahmedabad\n7. bridgetown\n8. lord 's\n9. johannesburg\n10. nottingham\n\nSo row index 4 (0-based) has the venue \"karachi.\" That's relevant because the claim mentions Karachi.\n\nNext, the claim states that in Karachi, Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera have 437 runs. So I need to check if these two players are paired in a row where the venue is Karachi and the runs are 437.\n\nLooking at row index 4 (the one with venue \"karachi\"), let's see the 'wicket' column: it says \"4th,\" which probably refers to their position in this particular table. The 'battling partners' column has \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera.\" That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nNow, checking the 'runs' column for that row: it's 437. So all parts of the claim are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE because both the venue, the players, and the runs match the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 195 run together , in karachi\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It's a JSON with columns: wicket, runs, battling partners, batting team, fielding team, venue, and season. The data has 10 rows, each representing different matches or events.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera. I need to check if they are listed together in the table under any relevant columns. \n\nLooking at the 'battling partners' column, I see that in row 4 (index 3), the batting partners are \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera\". That seems to match the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the runs column for row 4 is 437. The claim states they have 195 runs together. Wait, that doesn't add up. 437 isn't 195. So there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nWait no, the claim says \"have 195 run together\". But in the table, their runs are 437. That's not matching. Hmm, maybe I need to check if 195 is mentioned elsewhere.\n\nLooking at other columns: venue for row 4 is Karachi, which matches the claim. The season is listed as \"2008 / 09\", but that doesn't affect the runs part.\n\nSo the problem is with the runs number. The batting partners are correct, but their total runs in this match were 437, not 195. Therefore, the runs part of the claim isn't supported by the table data. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the runs column. Let me check again. Row 4's runs are indeed 437. So the claim is incorrect on that front.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in another row, these two players have 195 runs together? Let me scan through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: 415 runs by \"gc smith and neil mckenzie\"\n- Row1: 576 by \"roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuriya\"\n- Row2:624 by \"mahela jayawardene and kumar sangakkara\" (so Mahela is here, but not Thilan)\n- Row3:437 by Mahela and Thilan\n- Row4:405 by donald bradman and sid barnes\n- Row5:351 by Mahela and prasanna\n- Row6:347 by others\n- Row7:332 by Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad\n- Row8:195 by \"pat symcox and mark boucher\"\n- Row9:163 by Phillip Hughes and Ashton Agar\n\nNo, I don't see another row where Mahela and Thilan have 195 runs. So the claim is wrong because the runs figure doesn't match, even though their partnership in Karachi (venue) is correct.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim has two parts: 195 runs together and in Karachi.\n\nSo, for the venue, it's correct as Karachi is listed for row4. But for the runs, 195 doesn't match 437. Therefore, one part is correct, but another isn't. So does that make the entire claim FALSE? Because both conditions need to be met?\n\nWait, no. The claim states both: that they have 195 runs together and in Karachi. Both parts must hold true for it to be TRUE.\n\nSince the runs are 437, not 195, even though the venue is correct, the overall claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the runs part doesn't match, despite the venue being correct.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: since both Mahela and Thilan are in row4, their column 'battling partners' (index 2) is relevant. Also, the runs (column1) is 437, which contradicts the claim's 195, so that cell is also relevant to check.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include row_index 3 for both columns: 'battling partners' and 'runs'.\n\nI think that covers it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera do have a partnership in Karachi, their runs were 437, not 195. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 1997 , roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuira do not battle\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns of the table to understand what each column represents. The columns are:\n\n- wicket\n- runs\n- battling partners\n- batting team\n- fielding team\n- venue\n- season\n\nThe claim is about a specific year (1997) and two cricketers: Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya. So, I need to check if they are indeed present in the table for that year and then see if there's any information about them \"battling\" or not.\n\nLooking at the data rows, each row represents a different match or event with details across the columns. For 1997, I should find the row where the season is \"1997\".\n\nRow 1: Season is 1997, but let me check the battlers. The battling partners are Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya. So this seems relevant because it's about them.\n\nNow, the claim says they do not battle. But in row 1, they are listed as battling partners under the \"battling partners\" column. That means they did battle together in that season. Therefore, the claim is false because the data shows they did battle in 1997.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
