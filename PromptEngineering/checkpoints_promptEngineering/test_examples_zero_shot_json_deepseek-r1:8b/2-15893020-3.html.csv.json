So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that Deon Kruis has an average of 0.1. Now, looking at the table, each row represents a player, and there are several columns related to their performance.\n\nI should start by locating Deon Kruis in the table. Scanning through the \"player\" column, I see his name: \"deon kruis\". That's row 12. Wait, let me count again. The first entry is Craig White (row 0), then Jacques Rudolph (1), Anthony McGrath (2), Ajmal Shahzad (3), Andrew Gale (4), Rana Naved-Ul-Hasan (5), Gerard Brophy (6), Chris Taylor (7), Adil Rashid (8), Tim Bresnan (9), Darren Gough (10), Michael Vaughan (11), Adam Lyth (12), Richard Pyrah (13), Simon Guy (14), David Wainwright (15), and then the totals. So, Deon Kruis is row 16? Wait, no, let me count again.\n\nWait, after Adam Lyth (row 12), it's Richard Pyrah (13), Simon Guy (14), David Wainwright (15), Deon Kruis is next, which would be row 16. Hmm, but the table provided goes up to row 20, with the total at the end. Let me check:\n\n- Row 0: Craig White\n- Row 1: Jacques Rudolph\n- ...\n- Row 12: Adam Lyth\n- Row 13: Richard Pyrah\n- Row 14: Simon Guy\n- Row 15: David Wainwright\n- Row 16: Deon Kruis\n- Row 17: Total Batting\n\nSo, Deon Kruis is at row_index 16. Wait, but in the table provided, the last entry before \"total batting\" is:\n\n[\n  \"deon kruis\",\n  12,\n  1,\n  1,\n  3,\n  3,\n  \"n / a\",\n  \"75.00\",\n  0\n]\n\nSo that's row 16 (since starting from 0, the first player is row 0). So yes, Deon Kruis is at row_index 16.\n\nNow, the claim is about his average being 0.1. Looking at the columns, \"average\" is one of them, which is column 6 in the table (if we index from 0: 0-player, 1-matches, etc., so column 6 is \"average\"). \n\nSo, I need to check what value is in Deon Kruis' average. From his row, the average is listed as \"n / a\". Wait, that stands for not applicable or not available? So, if the average is \"n/a\", does that mean the data isn't provided, which would make the claim false because 0.1 isn't equal to n/a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread it. Let me check again: in row 16, the columns are:\n\n[\n  \"deon kruis\",\n  12,\n  1,\n  1,\n  3,\n  3,\n  \"n / a\",\n  \"75.00\",\n  0\n]\n\nSo, the \"average\" column (column 6) is \"n / a\". Therefore, Deon Kruis doesn't have an average listed; it's not applicable or missing.\n\nThe claim says his average should be 0.1, but in reality, the data for him isn't available\u2014it's marked as \"n/a\". Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported because the relevant data isn't present. So the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we first locate Deon Kruis' row and check his average. His average is listed as \"n / a\", which means the data isn't available. Since the claim states his average is 0.1, this doesn't align with the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
