    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"hayate usui be only 1 time defeat in round 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Hayate Usui has only one loss in round 3 across all the fights listed in the table. So, I need to check how many times Hayate Usui lost in round 3.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a fight with details like \"res\" (result), \"opponent\", etc. The columns are: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time.\n\nI should focus on the 'res' column to find losses and the 'round' column to check if it's round 3.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: res is \"loss\", but round is 2.\n2. Row 1: same as above, round 2.\n3. Rows 2-5: wins in round 2.\n4. Row 6: win, round 2.\n5. Rows 7 and 8: draws or wins, round 2.\n6. Row 9: win, round 2.\n7. Row 10: loss, but the opponent is Akitoshi Tamura. Wait, the claim mentions Hayate Usui, so I need to check if the opponent is Usui. No, in this row, the opponent is Akitoshi Tamura, not Usui.\n8. Rows 11-13: opponents are different from Usui.\n9. Row 14: opponent is Takeshi Inoue, not Usui.\n10. Row 15: same as above, opponent is Takeshi Matsushita.\n11. Row 16: loss to Keisuke Yamada, not Usui.\n12. Row 17: loss to Takashi Inoue, not Usui.\n13. Row 18: loss to Hiroyuki Takaya, but that's a different fighter.\n\nWait, I didn't see any row where res is \"loss\" and round is 3 for Hayate Usui. So in the entire table, there are no losses by Hayate Usui in round 3. The claim says he should have only one such loss, but since none exist, it's FALSE.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me count again:\n\nLooking at each row's 'opponent' column: is the opponent Hayate Usui? From what I can see, no. Most opponents are different names like Tamura, Nakamura, Kasuya, etc. So there are no losses by Hayate Usui in round 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because he doesn't have any defeats in round 3 listed here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"4 of usui 's fight end before the 5 - minute period be up.\" Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"4 of usui's fight\" probably refers to four fights involving someone named Usui. The phrase \"end before the 5-minute period be up\" is a bit confusing, but I think it's trying to say that these four fights ended before the five-minute mark.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like res (result), opponent, method, etc. The columns relevant here are \"event\" and \"round,\" especially since they relate to the time the fight ended. Wait, no, the \"time\" column is there as well, which probably indicates when the fight concluded.\n\nWait, actually, the claim mentions a 5-minute period. So I should look for fights where the end time was before or at five minutes. Since all times in the table are given with a colon and numbers, like \"5:00\" or \"2:38,\" it's clear that some fights ended within two to five minutes.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim again: \"4 of usui's fight end before the 5 - minute period be up.\" So we need to find four fights where Usui was involved and each of those fights ended by the 5-minute mark. \n\nLooking at the table data, I'll scan through each row for any mention of Usui as the opponent or fighter. From the data provided:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is issei tamura\n- Row 1: Opponent is hiroshi nakamura\n- Row 2: Opponent is shinya kumazawa\n- Row 3: Opponent is sakae kasuya\n- Row 4: Opponent is daisuke ishizawa\n- Row 5: Opponent is shintaro ishiwatari\n- Row 6: Opponent is eiji murayama\n- Row 7: Opponent is hiroki kita\n- Row 8: Opponent is ed newalu\n- Row 9: Opponent is manabu inoue\n- Row 10: Opponent is michihisa asano\n- Row 11: Opponent is akitoshi tamura\n- Row 12: Opponent is naosuke mizoguchi\n- Row 13: Opponent is takeshi inoue\n- Row 14: Opponent is seigi fujioka\n- Row 15: Opponent is takeshi matsushita\n- Row 16: Opponent is keisuke yamada\n- Row 17: Opponent is takashi inoue\n- Row 18: Opponent is hiroyuki takaya\n\nWait, I don't see any Usui here. The opponents are all other names, none of them Usui. So maybe the claim refers to fights that Usui participated in where he ended before five minutes? But since there's no data on Usui as an opponent or fighter, perhaps the table doesn't include him.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table and Usui is involved somewhere else. Let me check again. The \"opponent\" column lists all the names, none of which are Usui. So if Usui isn't in the table at all, then there's no data to support the claim that four of his fights ended before five minutes.\n\nTherefore, without any information about Usui's fights in the table, I can't verify the claim as true. The answer should be false because the necessary data isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to four of Usui's fights ending before the 5-minute mark, but none of the opponents listed are Usui. Since there is no data on Usui's fights in the table, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part means. The term \"usui\" likely refers to a fighter named Usui, but looking at the table, I don't see any rows with \"Usui\" as the opponent or the fighter. The opponents listed are names like Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, Shinya Kumazawa, and others. There's no mention of Usui here.\n\nNext, let me break down the claim. It mentions three wins by a fighter named Usui that were decided by majority decision. To verify this, I need to look for any rows where the outcome is a \"win\" and the method is \"decision (majority)\". Then, I have to check if there are exactly three such instances.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n1. The first win is against Shinya Kumazawa with a decision (unanimous).\n2. Second win against Sakae Kasuya, also decision (unanimous).\n3. Third win against Daisuke Ishizawa, again unanimous.\n4. Fourth win: against Shinataro Ishiwatari, unanimous.\n5. Fifth win: Eiji Murayama, unanimous.\n6. Sixth win: Hiroki Kita, unanimous.\n7. Seventh win: Draw with Ed Newalu, not a win.\n8. Eighth win: Manabu Inoue, majority decision. So that's one.\n9. Ninth win: Michihisa Asano, unanimous.\n10. Tenth loss: Akitoshi Tamura.\n11. Eleventh win: Naosuke Mizoguchi, submission, so not a decision.\n12. Twelfth loss: Takeshi Inoue.\n13. Thirteenth win: Seigi Fujioka, majority decision. Second one.\n14. Fourteenth win: Takeshi Matsushita, majority decision. Third one.\n15. Fifteenth loss: Keisuke Yamada.\n16. Sixteenth loss: Takashi Inoue.\n17. Seventeenth loss: Hiroyuki Takaya.\n\nFrom this, the wins by majority decision are:\n- Manabu Inoue (row 8)\n- Seigi Fujioka (row 13)\n- Takeshi Matsushita (row 14)\n\nThat makes three instances where Usui's wins were by majority decision. However, I need to check if it's Usui winning these fights. Wait, in the data, the columns include \"opponent\" and \"record\". The opponents are listed as names like Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, etc., but there is no row with an opponent named Usui.\n\nSo even though there are three wins by majority decision, if the fighter isn't Usui, then the claim is false because it's about \"usui's\" wins. Since Usui isn't present in the table as a fighter, the claim can't be true.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision,\" we need to verify if there are three instances where Usui won by a majority decision.\n\n1. **Check for Rows with Usui**: The table lists various opponents but does not include any entry where the opponent is \"Usui.\" Without Usui being present, it's impossible to have his wins in the table.\n   \n2. **Review Relevant Columns**: We look at the \"opponent\" and \"record\" columns for Usui. No such entries exist, confirming that Usui isn't involved in any of the listed matches.\n\nSince Usui is not a fighter in the provided data, the claim cannot be true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"usui defeat daisuke ishizawa more convincingly than he defeat manabu inoue.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify who \"usui\" refers to. Looking at the table's data, each row has a 'record' and an 'opponent'. I need to find if there's a fighter named Usui defeating others.\n\nWait, looking through the opponents: I see names like Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue. Hmm, but I don't immediately see a fighter named Usui in the table. That's confusing because the claim mentions Usui defeating both Daisuke and Manabu.\n\nLet me check each row for any mention of Usui as the winner or opponent. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: loss by Issei Tamura vs someone else.\n- Row 1: Hironaka, etc., not Usui.\n- ...\n- Row 5: Eiji Murayama wins over someone.\n- Continuing, I don't see any row where the winner is Usui.\n\nWait a second, maybe \"usui\" is another name. Could it be a typo or different spelling? Or perhaps the table doesn't include all relevant fighters, but according to the data provided, there's no entry with Usui defeating anyone.\n\nSo if Usui didn't defeat Daisuke and Manabu, then the claim might be false because he didn't defeat either. But without evidence of him defeating them, especially more convincingly than against Manabu, it can't be true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Usui is another fighter not in this table. If that's the case, the data doesn't support the claim since there are no records of Usui's victories.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no evidence from the provided table that supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the defeat by a ko do not occur in the same tournament as the drawn match.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"defeat by a ko\" refers to a knockout (or KO) in a fight, meaning the fighter was defeated via a knock-out. The other part is about a \"drawn match,\" which I assume refers to a fight that ended in a draw, neither fighter winning.\n\nThe claim states that these two events\u2014KO defeat and drawn match\u2014do not happen in the same tournament. So I need to check if there's any row in the table where a KO defeat and a draw occurred in the same event.\n\nLooking at the columns provided: res (result), record (maybe fight record?), opponent, method, event, round, time.\n\nSo, for each row, I'll check the 'res' column. If it's a \"KO\" or similar, that's a KO defeat. Then, if in any other row within the same tournament, there's a draw, does that happen?\n\nWait, but how are tournaments structured here? Each entry seems to be an individual fight, with details like who they fought, method (like submission, decision), event name, round, and time.\n\nI need to see if any KO defeat is in the same tournament as a drawn match. But wait, each row is a separate fight. So, maybe I should look for any instance where one of these two outcomes exists, and then check if another outcome exists in the same tournament.\n\nWait, but how is the tournament defined? The 'event' column might refer to different events or tournaments within the data. For example, some entries have \"shooto\" as the method, others \"tenkaichi fight.\" So perhaps each event is a different tournament.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'event' field isn't directly indicating the tournament but something else, like the name of the promotion or organization.\n\nHmm, this might complicate things. Let me look at the data rows.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: loss via decision (unanimous), opponent is issei tamura, event shooto.\nNo KO here.\n\nRow 1: similar to row 0, no KO.\n\nRow 2: win via decision (unanimous). No KO.\n\nRow 3: same as above.\n\nRow 4: win, no KO.\n\nRow 5: loss via KO? Wait, in row 5, the res is \"loss\", but method is submission (rear naked choke), so not a KO. So that's a submission loss.\n\nWait, I need to check for where the res is KO or similar. Let me see if any 'res' column has \"KO.\" Looking through each row:\n\nRow 0: loss\nRow1: loss\nRow2: win\nRow3: win\nRow4: win\nRow5: loss via submission.\nRow6: win via submission.\nRow7: win.\nRow8: draw. So in row8, res is \"draw.\"\nRow9: win.\nRow10: win.\nRow11: loss.\nRow12: win.\nRow13: win.\nRow14: loss.\nRow15: win.\nRow16: loss.\nRow17: win.\nRow18: win.\nRow19: loss via decision (unanimous). Opponent is hiroyuki takaya, method is tko. Wait, in row19, res is \"loss,\" opponent is hiroyuki takaya, method is tko.\n\nSo in row19, the result is a loss, and the method is tko (tko), which typically stands for Technical Knockout. So that's a KO defeat.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other fight in this tournament where it was a draw.\n\nWait, but each row seems to be a separate fight, not grouped into tournaments. So maybe the claim refers to within the same event or promotion. Alternatively, perhaps the 'event' column can indicate if they're part of the same tournament.\n\nLooking at the 'event' column:\n\nRows 0-4: shooto\nRow5: shooto\nRow6: tenkaichi fight\nRow7: tenkaichi fight\nRow8: shooto? Or is it another event.\nWait, let me check each row's 'event' value.\n\nRow0: opponent is issei tamura, event \"shooto\"\nRow1: same as row0?\nRow2: opponent is someone else, event is \"tenkaichi fight\"\nRow3: same as row2\nRow4: shooto again\nRow5: same as row4\nRow6: tenkaichi fight\nRow7: same as row6\nRow8: draw against opponent, event is \"shooto\"\nSo in row8, the res is draw.\n\nThen row9: opponent is someone else, event is \"tenkaichi fight.\"\nWait, no, let me check each 'event' value:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- Row0: shooto\n- Row1: shooto\n- Row2: tenkaichi fight\n- Row3: tenkaichi fight\n- Row4: shooto\n- Row5: shooto\n- Row6: tenkaichi fight\n- Row7: tenkaichi fight\n- Row8: shooto\n- Row9: tenkaichi fight\n- Row10: tenkaichi fight\n- Row11: shooto\n- Row12: tenkaichi fight\n- Row13: tenkaichi fight\n- Row14: shooto\n- Row15: tenkaichi fight\n- Row16: shooto\n- Row17: tenkaichi fight\n- Row18: shooto\n- Row19: shooto\n\nSo, 'shooto' and 'tenkaichi fight' are different events or promotions. So within each promotion, the events are grouped.\n\nNow, looking for any KO defeat (rows where method is tko) in the same event as a draw.\n\nWait, but in the data provided, I don't see any rows where res is KO. The only KO would be if the method is tko, which is technical knockout, leading to a KO victory or loss.\n\nIn row19, the result is loss via tko. So that's a KO defeat.\n\nNow, in the same event (shooto), are there any draws?\n\nLooking at 'event' as shooto:\n\nRows 0,1,4,5,8,11,14,16,18,19: these are all shooto events.\n\nIn row8, res is draw. So in shooto event, one fight ended in a draw (row8), and another fight in the same event (say row19) resulted in KO via tko (loss).\n\nSo that would mean in the same tournament (same event), there's both a KO defeat and a draw.\n\nThus, the claim is false because they do occur in the same tournament. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where a knockout defeat (\"loss\" via tko) and a drawn match exist within the same event. Specifically, row 8 has a draw and row 19 has a KO defeat under the same 'shooto' event.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"hayate usui,\" which seems like a name, and the phrase \"be never defeat.\" So, the claim is asserting that Hayate Usui has never been defeated in any of his matches listed in the table.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure: it's a JSON with columns like \"res\" (result), \"record\", \"opponent\", etc. The data rows list various fight outcomes, including wins, losses, and draws for different fighters.\n\nMy goal is to check if there are any instances where Hayate Usui has lost a match. If such an instance exists, the claim would be false; otherwise, it's true.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\n1. The first few rows have opponents like \"issei tamura,\" \"hiroshi nakamura,\" etc., but none of these seem to be Hayate Usui. I'm assuming the name \"usui\" is key here.\n2. Scanning through all 19 rows, I need to find any row where the fighter's name is \"hayate usui.\" If such a row exists and the result is a loss, that would support the claim being false.\n\nBut in this table, I don't see any entries with \"usui\" as the opponent or the fighter. The opponents listed are names like \"ishizawa,\" \"inoue,\" etc., none of which include \"usui.\" Similarly, the column for the result doesn't mention a loss for any \"usui\" related entry.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data indicating that Hayate Usui has ever lost a match in this table, the claim stands as true. The relevant cells are those where the fighter is Hayate Usui and the result is a loss, but since none exist, they don't need to be highlighted because there's nothing to verify against.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"none of usui 's fight end before the 5 - minute period be up.\" Hmm, let me parse this.\n\nFirst, I think the key points are:\n1. The fighter's name is \"usui\".\n2. None of usui's fights ended before the 5-minute mark.\n3. So, all of usui's fights must have lasted at least 5 minutes or more.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight event with various details. The columns relevant here are probably 'opponent', 'method', and 'time' since those relate to how the fight ended and its duration.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions the fight ending before the 5-minute period. So I should check if any of usui's fights ended (like a loss or win) before 5 minutes. If none did, then the claim is true; otherwise, false.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: res - loss, opponent is issei tamura, method decision (unanimous), time 5:00. Time is exactly 5 mins, so it's not ending before.\nRow 1: loss, hiroshi... same as above, time 5:00.\nRows 2-10: wins or losses, but let me check the times.\n\nWait, in row 12: \"loss\", \"0 - 3\", method decision (majority), time 5:00. So that's still at 5 minutes.\n\nBut wait, I need to look for any fights where the time is less than 5:00? Because if any fight ended before 5 minutes, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Most times are 5:00.\n- A few have different times:\nRow 13: \"loss\", time 2:06. So that's a loss at 2:06, which is less than 5 minutes.\nWait, but this row has res as 'loss', opponent is hiroyuki takaya.\n\nSo usui (assuming the fighter name is usui) has a fight that ended before 5 minutes. Therefore, the claim is false because not all of usui's fights ended after 5 minutes; at least one did earlier.\n\nBut wait, does the table have any usui? Let me check the 'opponent' column for any mentions of 'usui'. Hmm, looking through the opponents: tamura, nakamura, kumazawa, kasuya, etc. I don't see a fighter named usui in the opponent list. Wait, perhaps I misread the table.\n\nWait, maybe the rows are about different fighters. So each row is about a fight where usui was involved? Or is each row a separate event where someone else's fight ended?\n\nWait, no. The claim is about usui's fights ending before 5 minutes. So we need to find any row where 'res' is about usui's fight ending before 5:00.\n\nBut in the table, the opponents are various names; perhaps usui is one of them. Let me look for a fighter named usui.\n\nLooking through the opponent column:\n\nRows:\n0: issei tamura\n1: hiroshi nakamura\n2: shinya kumazawa\n3: sakae kasuya\n4: daisuke ishizawa\n5: shintaro ishiwatari\n6: eiji murayama\n7: hiroki kita\n8: ed newalu\n9: manabu inoue\n10: michihisa asano\n11: akitoshi tamura\n12: naosuke mizoguchi\n13: takeshi inoue\n14: takeshi matsushita\n15: keisuke yamada\n16: takashi inoue\n17: hiroyuki takaya\n\nNo usui here. So perhaps the claim is about a fighter named 'usui' who isn't listed as an opponent, meaning maybe they didn't have any fights in this table? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, but if the claim is about usui's fights, and none ended before 5 minutes, then we need to check all usui's fights. But since there are no usui opponents here, does that mean usui isn't present? So maybe all their fights (if any) didn't end before 5 minutes.\n\nBut if usui isn't in the table, then there's no evidence of their fights ending early. Therefore, the claim would be true because we have no data showing any of usui's fights ended before 5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misinterpreted. Maybe it's about a fighter who ends others' fights before 5 minutes, not themselves. So if usui is the one causing other fighters to end early, then we need to see usui's methods. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, but the original claim says \"none of usui's fight end before...\" which probably refers to usui's own fights ending before 5 minutes. Since there are no such rows with usui as the fighter, it would be true by default.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought row 13 had a time less than 5 minutes, but that was another fighter, not usui. So if usui isn't in the table, then all their fights (if any) didn't end before 5 minutes. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that none of usui's fights ended before the 5-minute mark. Since there are no entries for usui as an opponent, there is no data indicating any of his fights ended early. Thus, the claim holds.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"only 1 of usui 's win be by majority decision\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that among Usui's wins, only one was decided by a majority decision. So I need to check all of Usui's wins in the table and count how many were majority decisions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, time. The key columns for this analysis are \"res\" and \"method\". Specifically, I'm interested in when the result is a win and the method is a \"decision (majority)\".\n\nSo I'll go through each row to see if Usui has any wins where the method is \"decision (majority)\". \n\nI start by scanning the \"opponent\" column for names that might be Usui. Wait, actually, in the table provided, I need to check all rows where res is \"win\". Then among those, count how many have method as \"decision (majority)\".\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First fight: res is loss.\n2. Second: loss again.\n3. Third win. Opponent is Shinya Kumazawa. The method here is \"decision (unanimous)\". So that's not a majority decision.\n4. Fourth win: opponent Sakae Kasuya, method \"decision (majority)\". That's one so far.\n5. Fifth win: Daisuke Ishizawa, method \"decision (unanimous)\". Not counting this.\n6. Sixth: loss.\n7. Seventh win: Eiji Murayama, method \"decision (unanimous)\".\n8. Eighth win: Hiroki Kita, same method.\n9. Ninth row: draw.\n10. Tenth win: Manabu Inoue, method is \"decision (majority)\". That's the second one.\n11. Eleventh win: Michihisa Asano, method \"unanimous\".\n12. Twelfth loss.\n13. Thirteenth win: Naosuke Mizoguchi, submission, so not a decision.\n14. Fourteenth loss.\n15. Fifteenth win: Seigi Fujioka, method is \"decision (majority)\". That's the third one.\n16. Sixteenth win: Takeshi Matsushita, same method as above.\n17. Seventeenth loss.\n18. Eighteenth loss.\n\nSo now I count how many times Usui won with a majority decision. The rows where res is win and method is \"decision (majority)\" are:\n\n- Row 4\n- Row 10\n- Row 15\n\nThat's three instances. So the claim says only one, but there are three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me double-check in case I missed something. Maybe the names of the opponents include Usui? Wait, no, looking at the table, the opponents listed are:\n\n- issei tamura\n- hiroshi nakamura\n- shinya kumazawa\n- sakae kasuya\n- daisuke ishizawa\n- shintaro ishiwatari\n- eiji murayama\n- hiroki kita\n- ed newalu\n- manabu inoue\n- michihisa asano\n- akitoshi tamura\n- naosuke mizoguchi\n- takeshi inoue\n- seigi fujioka\n- takeshi matsushita\n\nI don't see \"Usui\" in the opponent names. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood. Is the claim referring to Usui's wins where the method is majority? Or perhaps Usui is the one who has a specific number of such wins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't list all of Usui's fights, but only some. So if we're considering only the provided data, then in this table, Usui (if that's the name) has three wins by majority decision. Therefore, the claim stating only one is incorrect, making it false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and I need to indicate which cells are relevant: all rows where res is \"win\" and method is \"decision (majority)\". From the table, these are rows 4, 10, and 15. Their row indices are 3, 9, and 14.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that only one of Usui's wins was by majority decision is false because there are three such instances in the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the defeat by a ko occur in the same tournament as the drawn match.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. A \"defeat by a ko\" refers to a loss caused by a Knock-Out (KO). In the context of mixed martial arts (MMA), KO is a method where a fighter is disqualified due to a strike that renders them unable to continue fighting.\n\nA \"drawn match\" would be when two fighters end up with the same score, leading to a draw. The table has a column called \"record\" which seems to represent the outcome of each fight. The outcomes include win, loss, and draw. For the drawn matches, the \"record\" is \"draw.\"\n\nSo, the claim suggests that there's at least one KO defeat and at least one drawn match in the same tournament. I need to check if both these events happened in the same tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight event with various details like opponent, method, etc. The \"event\" column might refer to the specific tournament or event name. But wait, in the provided data, the \"event\" column has entries like \"shooto,\" \"tenkaichi fight,\" \"pip - east vs west,\" and others. These seem more like fighting styles or specific events within a larger tournament rather than the names of tournaments.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, perhaps each row is an individual fight event, and they might all be part of the same overall tournament. For example, in some leagues, multiple fights occur under a single tournament umbrella. So if any KO loss and any draw happened within the same set of events, then the claim holds.\n\nI need to find rows where the outcome was a loss (which could be by KO) and another row where the outcome was a draw. Then check if these two are part of the same tournament.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row is an individual event. So perhaps each row is a fight that occurred in a tournament. The claim says that within the same tournament, there's both a KO defeat and a drawn match.\n\nSo I need to find at least one instance where a KO loss occurred in the same tournament as a draw. But how are tournaments represented? The \"event\" column might not directly indicate the tournament name but perhaps the style or type of event. Alternatively, maybe each row is part of the same tournament, and thus any draw and any KO within the table would be considered in the same tournament.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is a different tournament. Wait, looking at the \"record\" column, the outcomes include wins, losses, and draws. So if in one tournament there was both a draw and a KO loss, then the claim is true.\n\nWait, but in the table, each fight seems to be an individual event. So for example, row 0: loss by decision, row1: another loss, etc. But I'm looking for any instance where a KO happened (method like tko or ko) and also a draw in the same tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"event\" column represents different tournaments or events within a single tournament. For example, if the same event name appears multiple times, it might indicate different rounds of the same tournament.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is a separate fight event, possibly in different tournaments.\n\nBut without clear identifiers for which rows belong to the same tournament, this becomes tricky. Maybe I need to look at whether any draw and any KO happened within the same column or not.\n\nWait, let me check the data again. The \"method\" column indicates how the fighter lost or won. For losses, methods include \"decision (unanimous),\" \"submission (rear naked choke),\" etc. Looking for a KO method: I see in row 13, the method is \"tko (tko)\", which is likely a typo but refers to a Knock-Out.\n\nSo row 13 has a loss via tko. Now, does any other row have a draw? Yes, row 8 has a draw. So if both these rows are part of the same tournament, then the claim holds.\n\nBut how can I know if they're in the same tournament? Since each row is an individual event, perhaps the tournament isn't specified here, so we don't know. However, since all the events in the table might be part of a single dataset representing a single tournament, it's possible that both a KO and a draw occurred within this dataset.\n\nAlternatively, if all the rows are from different tournaments, then even though there's a KO and a draw, they're not in the same tournament.\n\nWait, but without any clear indication of which events belong to which tournaments, perhaps the safest assumption is that all the rows in the table represent part of the same tournament. Therefore, since there exists at least one KO loss (row13) and at least one draw (row8), both within this dataset, the claim holds.\n\nSo, the answer would be TRUE, with relevant cells being row8 for draw and row13 for KO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"usui defeat daisuke ishizawa in the same manner he defeat manabu inoue.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It seems to be saying that Usui defeated Daisuke Ishizawa using the same method he used when he defeated Manabu Inoue.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight. The relevant columns here are \"res\" (result), \"opponent\", and \"method\". So I need to find the fights involving Usui vs Daisuke Ishizawa and Usui vs Manabu Inoue.\n\nFrom the data, I see that there's a fight where Usui defeated Daisuke ishizawa. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 5: \"win\", opponent is Daisuke ishizawa, method is \"decision (unanimous)\", event is shooto, round 2, time 5:00.\n- Another row shows a win for Usui against Manabu inoue. Let me find that one.\n\nLooking through the rows, I spot row 9: opponent is Takeshi matsushita, not Inoue. Wait, maybe I missed it. Wait, let's go step by step.\n\nWait, actually, looking again:\n\nRow 3: win against Shinya kumazawa.\n\nRow 4: win against Sakae kasuya.\n\nRow 5: win against Daisuke ishizawa with method \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nRow 6: loss to Shinjtarou ishiwatari.\n\nWait, I might have missed the row where Usui defeated Manabu Inoue. Let me check all rows:\n\nRows go from 0 to 14.\n\nLooking for opponents named Manabu inoue: Only row 10 mentions Manabu inoue as the opponent? Wait, no. Let's check each row's \"opponent\" column.\n\nWait, actually, looking at each entry:\n\nRow 0: opponent is issei tamura\n\nRow1: hiroshi\n\nRow2: shinya\n\nRow3: sakae\n\nRow4: daisuke ishizawa (row5)\n\nRow5: shintaro\n\nRow6: eiji\n\nRow7: hiroki\n\nRow8: ed newalu\n\nRow9: manabu inoue\n\nAh, here it is. Row 9: Usui defeated Manabu Inoue with a \"decision (majority)\" method.\n\nSo now I need to compare the methods used in both fights.\n\nIn row5: Daisuke ishizawa was defeated via \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nIn row9: Manabu inoue was defeated via \"decision (majority)\".\n\nThe claim says that Usui defeated Daisuke in the same manner as he did against Manabu. But the methods are different: one is \"unanimous\", the other is \"majority\". Therefore, the methods aren't the same.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect, which means it's FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify the relevant cells for this verification. The columns involved are \"res\", \"opponent\", and \"method\".\n\nFor Daisuke ishizawa: row index 5 (since row0 starts at 0). So row5, columns res, opponent, method.\n\nFor Manabu inoue: row9, same columns.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"res\"}\n- {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"opponent\"}\n- {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"method\"}\n\nAnd for Manabu Inoue:\n\n- {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"res\"}\n- {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"opponent\"}\n- {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"method\"}\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because the methods differ.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"res\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"res\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
