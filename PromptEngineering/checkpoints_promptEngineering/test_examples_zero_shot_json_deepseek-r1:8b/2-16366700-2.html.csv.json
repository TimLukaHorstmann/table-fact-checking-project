    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Bobby Hull has scored the most playoff goals of all Chicago Blackhawks players\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. Each row represents a player with their respective statistics. The claim is about Bobby Hull's playoff goals being the highest among all Blackhawks players.\n\nLooking through the data, I see that Bobby Hull is in the first row (row index 0). His playoff column has the value 62. Now, to verify if he has the most, I need to check all other players' playoff numbers.\n\nI'll go through each player one by one:\n\n1. Stan Mikita (row 1): Playoffs = 59\n2. Steve Larmer (row 2): Playoffs = 45\n3. Denis Savard (row 3): Playoffs = 61\n4. Dennis Hull (row 4): Playoffs = 33\n5. Jeremy Roenick (row 5): Playoffs = 35\n6. Tony Amonte (row 6): Playoffs = 13\n7. Hubert Pit Martin (row 7): Playoffs = 26\n8. Bill Mosienko (row 8): Playoffs = 10\n9. Ken Wharram (row 9): Playoffs = 16\n\nFrom this list, Bobby Hull's 62 playoff goals are higher than all the other players listed. Wait, but I notice Denis Savard has 61, which is close. Are there any other Blackhawks players not in this table with higher numbers? The claim specifies \"all Chicago Blackhawks players,\" so if Bobby Hull truly has the highest, he must be ahead of all others, including those not listed.\n\nBut looking at the data provided, since none of the other players have a higher playoff count than 62, and Bobby's is 62, I think the statement holds. However, I should check for any possible oversight. For example, if there are multiple players with the same or higher counts, but based on this table, Bobby is indeed the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Bobby Hull having the most playoff goals among Chicago Blackhawks players, we need to check his playoff score against all other listed players.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Bobby Hull's Data**: He is found in row index 0 under the \"playoffs\" column with a value of 62.\n2. **Compare with All Players**: Check each player's playoff goals to ensure no one else has a higher count.\n   - Stan Mikita: 59\n   - Steve Larmer: 45\n   - Denis Savard: 61\n   - Dennis Hull: 33\n   - Jeremy Roenick: 35\n   - Tony Amonte: 13\n   - Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n   - Bill Mosienko: 10\n   - Ken Wharram: 16\n\n3. **Determine the Highest**: Bobby Hull's 62 is higher than all listed players, including Denis Savard's 61.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Bill Mosienko having scored the fewest number of postseason goals is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Bill Mosienko in the table. Looking at the \"name\" column, he's listed as the 9th entry with name \"bill mosienko\". So his row index is 9.\n\nNext, the claim specifically mentions \"postseason goal\", which relates to the \"playoffs\" column because that's where postseason data would be tracked. I should check the value in the playoffs column for Bill Mosienko. From the table, it says his playoff goals are 10.\n\nNow, I need to see if this is indeed the fewest compared to others. So, I'll look at the \"playoffs\" column for all other players:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nBill's playoff goals are 10. Comparing this to others, 10 is indeed lower than all except maybe Tony Amonte with 13, which is higher. So Bill has the lowest number of postseason goals in this group.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because his playoff score is the fewest among all listed players.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether Bill Mosienko scored the fewest postseason goals, we need to check his \"playoffs\" column value against others. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Bill Mosienko in the Table:** He's found in row index 9 under the \"name\" column.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column for Postseason Goals:** The \"playoffs\" column contains his postseason goal count.\n\n3. **Extract Data:**\n   - Bill Mosienko: 10\n   - Other Players' Playoff Goals: \n     - Bobby Hull: 62\n     - Stan Mikita: 59\n     - Steve Larmer: 45\n     - Denis Savard: 61\n     - Dennis Hull: 33\n     - Jeremy Roenick: 35\n     - Tony Amonte: 13\n     - Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n     - Ken Wharram: 16\n\n4. **Determine the Fewest:** Bill Mosienko's 10 is lower than all other players' numbers, making it the fewest.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if a claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it. It seems like it's saying there's a difference of 398 goals between the highest and lowest scorers.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a player with their name, years, regular season goals, playoff goals, and total goals. The columns relevant here are \"regular season\", \"playoffs\", and \"total\". The claim is about the difference in goals, so probably between the highest and lowest total goals.\n\nNext step is to find out which cells we need to check. We'll look at each player's total goals to see if any pair has a difference of 398.\n\nLet me list out all the players with their total goals:\n\n1. Bobby Hull - 666\n2. Stan Mikita - 600\n3. Steve Larmer - 451\n4. Denis Savard - 438\n5. Dennis Hull - 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick - 302\n7. Tony Amonte - 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin - 269\n9. Bill Mosienko - 268\n10. Ken Wharram - 268\n\nNow, I need to find the highest and lowest total goals here. The highest is Bobby Hull with 666, and the lowest seems to be either Tony Amonte or Hubert Pit Martin, both at 281.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Looking at the numbers: 666 (highest), then 600, 451, 438, 331, 302, 281, 269, 268, 268. So the lowest is 268, achieved by Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, looking at the data:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nSo the lowest total is indeed 268, and the highest is 666. The difference between them is 666 - 268 = 398. So yes, there's a 398 goal difference between the highest scorer (Bobby Hull) and the lowest scorer (Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram).\n\nWait, but in the data, it's Bill Mosienko with 268 and Ken Wharram also with 268. So both are at the bottom. But the claim says \"the highest scorer from the lowest scorer,\" so it's about one high and one low.\n\nSo Bobby Hull is the highest at 666, and either Bill or Ken is the lowest at 268. Their difference is indeed 398.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a 398 goal difference between the highest and lowest scorers as per the table.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The column in question for total goals is \"total\". So each row has their total goals in that column. Therefore, we need to check all rows where \"total\" is either the highest or the lowest. That includes Bobby Hull (row 0) and Bill Mosienko (row 8) or Ken Wharram (row 9).\n\nWait, but since both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram have the same total, they are tied for the lowest. So the relevant rows would be row 0 (Bobby Hull, column \"total\") and either row 8 or row 9 (for Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram). However, in the answer, we need to list all relevant cells. Since both Bill and Ken have the same total, but their individual rows are separate.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- Bobby Hull's \"total\" cell (row 0)\n- Bill Mosienko's \"total\" cell (row 8)\n- Ken Wharram's \"total\" cell (row 9)\n\nWait, but in the JSON example, it's a list of objects with row_index and column_name. So we need to include each of these.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row 0, column \"total\"\n- row 8, column \"total\"\n- row 9, column \"total\"\n\nI think that's correct because those are the cells where the highest and lowest totals are recorded.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the difference between Bobby Hull's total goals (666) and either Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram's total goals (268) is 398. The relevant cells are the \"total\" column for these specific rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"In the regular season, only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The regular season refers to the data in the \"regular season\" column. The claim is about the number of players who scored more than 300 goals in that regular season.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, total. For this task, I'm focusing on the 'regular season' column because the claim mentions scoring more than 300 goals in the regular season.\n\nEach row represents a different player with their respective stats. So for each player, I need to check if their regular season score is above 300. Then count how many players meet that criterion and see if it's only four.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Bobby Hull: His regular season score is 604. That's way over 300.\n2. Stan Mikita: 541 goals. Also well above 300.\n3. Steve Larmer: 406. Above 300.\n4. Denis Savard: 377. Over 300 as well.\n5. Dennis Hull: 298. Hmm, that's just under 300. So he doesn't qualify.\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 267. That's below 300.\n7. Tony Amonte: 268. Also below.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 243. No, not above 300.\n9. Bill Mosienko: 258. Below as well.\n10. Ken Wharram: 252. Again, below.\n\nWait, so let me count how many players scored more than 300 in the regular season:\n\n- Bobby Hull: Yes\n- Stan Mikita: Yes\n- Steve Larmer: Yes\n- Denis Savard: Yes\n\nThat's four players. Dennis Hull has 298, which is just under 300, so he doesn't make it.\n\nSo the claim says \"only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\" Based on this count, that seems accurate. There are exactly four players with scores above 300 in the regular season.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. For each of these four players, I need their row index and the column name \"regular season\".\n\nSo:\n\n- Bobby Hull is at row index 0.\n- Stan Mikita is at row index 1.\n- Steve Larmer is at row index 2.\n- Denis Savard is at row index 3.\n\nI think that's all.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bobby hull have score the least playoff goal of all chicago blackhawk player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Bobby Hull in the table. Looking at the data, there are two entries with \"Bobby Hull\": one is Bobby Hull and another is Dennis Hull. Wait, no, actually, the first row has \"bobby hull\" as the name, and the fifth row is \"dennis hull\". So Bobby Hull is the first entry.\n\nNow, the claim is about Bobby Hull scoring the least playoff goals among all Chicago Blackhawks players. To verify this, I need to look at the playoff column for Bobby Hull and compare it with other players' playoff goals.\n\nFrom the table, each player has a \"playoffs\" value. Bobby Hull's playoffs are 62. Let me check if any other player has fewer than 62 playoff goals. \n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- Stanley Cup champion: Stan Mikita has 59.\n- Steve Larmer has 45.\n- Denis Savard has 61.\n- Dennis Hull has 33.\n- Jeremy Roenick has 35.\n- Tony Amonte has 13.\n- Hubert Pit Martin has 26.\n- Bill Mosienko has 10.\n- Ken Wharram has 16.\n\nSo, the lowest among these is Bill Mosienko with 10 playoff goals. Then Denis Savard at 61, Steve Larmer at 45, etc. But Bobby Hull is at 62. Wait, that's higher than several but lower than some.\n\nWait, no: 62 is more than 59 (Stan Mikita) and 61 (Denis Savard), but less than Steve Larmer's 45? No, wait, 62 is more than 45. So Bobby Hull has 62 playoff goals, which is higher than several players but lower than others like Stan Mikita (59) and Denis Savard (61). So he doesn't have the least.\n\nWait, but in the table, Bill Mosienko has 10 playoff goals, which is the lowest I can see. Let me check again:\n\nBill Mosienko: 10\nHubert Pit Martin: 26\nKen Wharram:16\nTony Amonte:13\nJeremy Roenick:35\nDennis Hull:33\nSteve Larmer:45\nDenis Savard:61\nStan Mikita:59\nBobby Hull:62\n\nSo Bill Mosienko has the lowest at 10. Then Tony Amonte with 13, then Hubert Pit Martin with 26, Ken Wharram with 16, Dennis Hull with 33, Steve Larmer with 45, Denis Savard with 61, Stan Mikita with 59, Bobby Hull with 62.\n\nSo Bobby Hull does not have the least playoff goals. Instead, Bill Mosienko holds that record. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if the claim is about \"least playoff goal of all Chicago Blackhawks players.\" So in the table, are these all the Blackhawks players? It seems so, as they all have names like Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, etc., who are known Blackhawks. So Bill Mosienko is a Blackhawks player with 10 playoff goals, which is less than Bobby Hull's 62.\n\nSo the claim that Bobby Hull has the least playoff goals is incorrect because Bill Mosienko has fewer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Bill Mosienko has the lowest playoff goals in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Bill Mosienko is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Bill Mosienko have score the most number of postseason goal with 33 goal.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Bill Mosienko scored the highest number of goals in the playoffs with 33 goals. So I need to check his playoff goal count and compare it to others.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different player, including their name, years, regular season stats, playoff stats, and total. So for Bill Mosienko, let's find his row. Scanning through the names, I spot \"bill mosienko\" in one of the rows.\n\nNow, focusing on that row: His regular season is 258, but I'm interested in playoffs. The column name for playoffs is the third one, which has a value of 10. That doesn't seem right because the claim is about scoring 33 goals, which is much higher than 10. Wait, maybe I misread something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. The row for Bill Mosienko: His name is there, years are \"1942 - 1955\", regular season is 258, playoffs is 10, total is 268. So his playoff goals are 10, not 33. That doesn't match the claim at all.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me make sure of the column meanings. The table has \"name,\" \"years,\" \"regular season,\" \"playoffs,\" and \"total.\" So playoffs is indeed the third number in each row.\n\nLooking at other players to see if any have 33 playoff goals. For example, Bobby Hull has 62 in regular season and 62 in total, but his playoff goals are 62? Wait no, wait: Let's look again.\n\nWait, Bobby Hull's data is [\"bobby hull\", \"1957 - 1972\", 604, 62, 666]. So the fourth number is 62 for playoffs. Hmm, that's a lot. Steve Larmer has 45 playoff goals, Denis Savard 61, Dennis Hull 33, and Jeremy Roenick 35, Tony Amonte 13, Hubert Pit Martin 26, Ken Wharram 16.\n\nWait, so the highest among these is Bobby Hull with 62 playoff goals? Wait no, wait. Let me check each row properly.\n\nLooking at each player's playoffs column:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte:13\n- Hubert Pit Martin:26\n- Bill Mosienko:10\n- Ken Wharram:16\n\nSo the highest is Bobby Hull with 62, followed by Stan Mikita with 59. Then Steve Larmer at 45, Denis Savard 61, Dennis Hull 33, Jeremy Roenick 35, Tony Amonte 13, Hubert Pit Martin 26, Bill Mosienko 10, Ken Wharram 16.\n\nSo none of the other players have more than 62 playoff goals. But the claim is that Bill Mosienko has 33 playoff goals. Looking at his row, his playoff goals are 10. So he definitely doesn't have 33. \n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misinterpreting the data. Let me double-check each player's row to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62 playoff goals\n- Stan Mikita:59\n- Steve Larmer:45\n- Denis Savard:61\n- Dennis Hull:33\n- Jeremy Roenick:35\n- Tony Amonte:13\n- Hubert Pit Martin:26\n- Bill Mosienko:10\n- Ken Wharram:16\n\nSo the claim is that Bill Mosienko has 33 playoff goals, but according to the table, he actually has 10. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I see that Dennis Hull has 33 playoff goals. Maybe the claim should be about Dennis Hull? Let me check the name again. The player in question is Bill Mosienko, whose playoff goals are 10. So the claim is incorrect because he doesn't have 33; it's another player.\n\nSo to verify, I need to look at Bill Mosienko's playoff column which is 10. That doesn't support the claim of 33. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Bill Mosienko scored 33 postseason goals is incorrect because his playoff goal count in the table is 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about hockey players and their stats. The claim says, \"there be only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" Hmm, I need to figure out whether this is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim better. It's talking about two specific statistics: goals scored by the highest scorer and the goals scored by the lowest scorer. The difference between these two should be 20. So, if the highest scorer has, say, 666 goals and the lowest has 646, then 666 - 646 = 20. That would make the claim true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their name, years, regular season goals, playoffs goals, and total goals. The relevant columns here are \"regular season\" and \"total.\" Wait, no\u2014the claim is about the highest scorer's total goals minus the lowest scorer's total goals being 20.\n\nWait, actually, I need to check if the difference between the highest total goals and the lowest total goals in the table is exactly 20. So I should look at the \"total\" column for each player.\n\nLet me list out all the \"total\" goals from the data:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nNow, I need to find the highest total and the lowest total. The highest is Bobby Hull with 666. Now, looking for the lowest, it seems like the next lowest is either Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram both at 268.\n\nSo, let's compute the difference: 666 - 268 = 398. That's way more than 20. So the claim that there's only a 20 goal difference isn't true because the actual difference is much larger.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the columns. The user mentioned \"goal separate,\" but in the table, it's \"regular season\" and \"playoffs.\" Wait no, the claim refers to total goals. Let me double-check.\n\nThe claim says, \"there be only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" So, it's about the total goals. Therefore, the difference is between the highest and lowest totals. As I calculated, that's 666 - 268 = 398. That's a big number, not 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they meant regular season goals? Let me check that as well.\n\nRegular season goals:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 604\n- Stan Mikita: 541\n- Steve Larmer: 406\n- Denis Savard: 377\n- Dennis Hull: 298\n- Jeremy Roenick: 267\n- Tony Amonte: 268\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 243\n- Bill Mosienko: 258\n- Ken Wharram: 252\n\nThe highest is Bobby Hull with 604, and the lowest is Ken Wharram at 252. The difference here is 604 - 252 = 352, which is also not 20.\n\nSo regardless of whether it's regular season or total goals, the difference is nowhere near 20. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that the highest scorer and the lowest scorer have a goal difference of exactly 20. By examining both the \"regular season\" and \"total\" columns, we find that the differences are significantly larger than 20 in each case. Thus, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"In the regular season, all players have scores less than 300 goals.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are name, years, regular season, playoffs, total. The claim specifically mentions the regular season, so I should focus on the 'regular season' column. \n\nI need to check each row's 'regular season' value to see if it's less than 300. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 604 goals. That's way above 300.\n2. Stan Mikita: 541. Also over 300.\n3. Steve Larmer: 406. Above 300.\n4. Denis Savard: 377. Hmm, that's under 300.\n5. Dennis Hull: 298. Just under 300.\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 267. Under.\n7. Tony Amonte: 268. Under.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 243. Under.\n9. Bill Mosienko: 258. Under.\n10. Ken Wharram: 252. Also under.\n\nSo, most players have scores below 300, but Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita have scores well above that. Therefore, the claim isn't true because not all players meet this condition.\n\nNow, to find relevant cells, I should list the rows where 'regular season' is a key factor. That includes all ten rows since each has a 'regular season' value. But since some are over 300 and others under, maybe only those over are relevant? Or perhaps all because the claim requires checking all players.\n\nWait, the claim says \"all have scores less than 300,\" so to disprove it, I need to find any player with >=300. Bobby Hull (604) and Stan Mikita (541) fit that. So their rows' 'regular season' column are relevant because they violate the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells should be all rows where regular season is above 300, which are row indices 0,1,2,3,4? Wait no, let me check each:\n\nRow 0: Bobby Hull - 604 (above)\nRow1: Stan Mikita -541 (above)\nRows2-9: Steve Larmer 406, Denis Savard 377, Dennis Hull 298, Jeremy Roenick 267, Tony Amonte 268, Hubert Pit Martin 243, Bill Mosienko 258, Ken Wharram 252. So only rows 0 and1 have scores above 300.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are row indices 0 (Bobby Hull) and 1 (Stan Mikita), both in the 'regular season' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because not all players have scores less than 300 goals in the regular season. Specifically, Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita exceed this threshold. The relevant cells are their respective rows in the 'regular season' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"no 2 players have the same total number of goals\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the table has several columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. Each row represents a different player with their stats broken down into these categories. The claim is specifically about the \"total\" column; it says that no two players have the same total number of goals in their careers.\n\nSo my task is to check each player's total goal count and see if any two players share the exact same number. If they do, then the claim is FALSE because there are at least two players with the same total. If none do, it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the \"total\" column first:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nWait, I notice that Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have a total of 268. That means two players share the same number. So this directly contradicts the claim because it states \"no 2 players have the same total.\" Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nI should also check if there are any other duplicates just to be thorough. Let's go through each:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666 (unique)\n- Stan Mikita: 600 (unique)\n- Steve Larmer: 451 (unique)\n- Denis Savard: 438 (unique)\n- Dennis Hull: 331 (unique)\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302 (unique)\n- Tony Amonte: 281 (unique)\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269 (unique)\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nOnly Bill and Ken share the same total. So that's two players with the same number, making the claim FALSE.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. Since we're focusing on the \"total\" column, all rows have a value here. Therefore, every row's total cell is relevant. The other columns like name, years, regular season, and playoffs don't directly relate to the claim, so they can be excluded from the relevant_cells list.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because there are two players with the same total number of goals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
