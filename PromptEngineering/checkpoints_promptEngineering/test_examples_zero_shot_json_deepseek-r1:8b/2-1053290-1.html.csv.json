    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the brighton hotel bombing happened in brighton, uk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It mentions an event called the \"brighton hotel bombing\" that occurred in Brighton, UK. So, my task is to find if there's a row in the data that matches both the event name and the location specified in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an event with various details: year, event, location, perpetrator(s), and deaths. The columns are: year, event, location, perpetrator(s), deaths. So, I need to check these for any occurrence of \"brighton hotel bombing\" as the event and \"brighton, uk\" as the location.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Year 1871, Event: \"attack on the mosel (ship)\", Location: Bremerhaven. Not relevant.\n2. **Row 1:** Year 1910, Event: \"los angeles times bombing\", Location: Los Angeles. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 2:** Year 1916, Event: \"preparedness day bombing\", Location: San Francisco. No match.\n4. **Row 3:** Year 1920, Event: \"wall street bombing\", Location: New York City. Doesn't match.\n5. **Row 4:** Year 1939, Event: \"b\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller\", Location: Munich. Not our event or location.\n6. **Row 5:** Year 1942, Event: \"st nazaire raid\", Location: St Nazaire, France. No match.\n7. **Row 6:** Year 1944, Event: \"july plot\", Location: Wolf's Lair, Poland. Not relevant.\n8. **Row 7:** Year 1955, Event: \"united airlines flight 629\", Location: Overlongmont, Colorado. Doesn't fit.\n9. **Row 8:** Year 1972, Event: \"aldershot bombing\", Location: Aldershot, UK. Close, but the event is different.\n10. **Row 9:** Year 1974, Event: \"m62 coach bombing\", Location: West Yorkshire. Not relevant.\n11. **Row 10:** Year 1974, Event: \"birmingham pub bombings\", Location: Birmingham, UK. Different event.\n12. **Row 11:** Year 1974, Event: \"guildford pub bombings\", Location: Guildford, UK. No match for Brighton.\n13. **Row 12:** Year 1977, Event: \"lucona sinking\", Location: Indian Ocean. Doesn't fit.\n14. **Row 13:** Year 1984, Event: \"brighton hotel bombing\", Location: Brighton, UK. Oh, here we go! This matches both the event and location in the claim.\n15. **Rows beyond 13:** The rest don't have any mention of Brighton again.\n\nSo, there's exactly one row (row index 13) where the event is \"brighton hotel bombing\" and the location is \"brighton, uk\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE, supported by this specific row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happen in enniskillen , uk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components: the event is the Brighton Hotel Bombing, it occurred in Enniskillen, UK. So, my task is to find if there's a matching entry in the table for both the event and the location.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an incident with details like year, event name, location, perpetrator(s), and deaths. My focus will be on the \"event\" and \"location\" columns to check against the claim.\n\nI'll scan through each row:\n\n- The first row mentions the Attack on the Mosel (ship) in Bremenhausen\u2014doesn't match.\n- Next, the Los Angeles Times bombing in LA\u2014nope.\n- Then San Francisco's Preparedness Day Bombing\u2014still not matching.\n- Wall Street Bombing in NYC\u2014wrong place.\n- Munich's Burgerbr\u00e4ukeller incident\u2014nope.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n- St Nazaire Raid in France during WWII\u2014not Enniskillen.\n- July Plot in Poland\u2014wrong location.\n- United Airlines Flight 629 over Colorado\u2014doesn't match.\n- Aldershot Bombing in the UK but no, it's Aldershot, not Enniskillen.\n- M62 Coach Bombing in West Yorkshire\u2014nope.\n\nThen Birmingham Pub Bombings\u2014but that's in Birmingham, not Enniskillen. Guildford Pub Bombings\u2014Guildford either.\n\nNext is Lucona Sinking in the Indian Ocean\u2014wrong place.\n\nBrighton Hotel Bombing: Here we go. The event is \"brighton hotel bombing,\" and its location is \"brighton , uk.\" So that's a match for the event, but not the location in Enniskillen.\n\nThen Korean Air Flight 858 in the Andaman Sea\u2014nope.\n\nRemembrance Day Bombing in Enniskillen: Wait, this row says the event is Remembrance Day bombing, location Enniskillen. So the location matches, but the event doesn't match Brighton Hotel.\n\nNext is Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie\u2014wrong place.\n\nDeal Barracks Bombing in Deal, Kent\u2014nope.\n\nPhilippine Airlines Flight 434 between Cebu and Tokyo\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nCentennial Olympic Park Bombing in Atlanta\u2014wrong location.\n\nOmagh Bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland\u2014it's a different event but same location as Enniskillen? Wait, Omagh is a town in Northern Ireland. So the location isn't Brighton Hotel, so no match here either.\n\nRussian Apartment Bombings in Moscow areas\u2014nope.\n\nMoscow Market Bombing in Moscow\u2014not Enniskillen.\n\nFinally, the Brighton Hotel Bombing: Yes, this row's event is \"brighton hotel bombing\" and the location is \"brighton , uk.\" So it matches the event but not the location mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says it happened in Enniskillen. In the table, I found that the Remembrance Day Bombing was in Enniskillen, but that's a different event from the Brighton Hotel Bombing which is in Brighton, UK. So the claim combines both event and location incorrectly.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where both the event is \"brighton hotel bombing\" and the location is \"enniskillen , uk.\" They are separate events in different locations.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because it inaccurately links the event and location.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
