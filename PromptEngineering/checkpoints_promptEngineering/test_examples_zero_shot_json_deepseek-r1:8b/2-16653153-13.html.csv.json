    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game with a score of 103 - 101.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. I think the user wants to verify if every row that includes a game with the score \"103 - 101\" has the \"box score\" filled out. So, I need to check each row where the score is \"103 - 101\" and see if the corresponding column for box score contains that string.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report. The data has several rows. Now, I'll go through each row to find where the score is \"103 - 101.\"\n\nStarting from row 0: The score is \"103 - 101\". So, for this row, I need to check the \"box score\" column. From the table, it's \"-\", so that doesn't match. That means this entry doesn't have a box score.\n\nWait, but the claim says that all entries include the game with a score of 103-101 should have box scores. So, if there are multiple games with that score, each must have a box score.\n\nBut in row 0, it's \"-\". So, does that mean it doesn't have a box score? If so, then the claim is false because not all such entries have a box score.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other rows have \"103 - 101\" as their score. Looking at all rows:\n\n- Row 0: 103 - 101\n- Rows 1 to 7 don't seem to have that score again. So only row 0 has the score of 103 - 101, and its box score is \"-\".\n\nTherefore, since not all entries with this score have a box score filled in, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. The claim says \"box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game...\" So, does it mean that every row should have \"box score\" as their column? Or does it mean that the \"box score\" column should contain some value?\n\nWait, the claim is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it again: \"box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game with a score of 103 - 101.\" So, perhaps it's saying that for every game where the score is 103-101, the box score column should have the value \"box score\" or something. But looking at the table, the box score column has either \"-\" or \"box score\".\n\nIn row 0, the box score is \"-\", not \"box score\". So, it doesn't meet the condition.\n\nTherefore, since there's at least one game with a score of 103-101 that doesn't have a box score (it's \"-\"), the claim is false. Hence, answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"box score\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the melbourne tiger play their home game at state netball and hockey centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It says that Melbourne Tigers have a home game at the State Netball and Hockey Centre. So, I need to find evidence in the table supporting this statement.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report. The data rows provide specific match details.\n\nI'll search for any row where the home team is \"Melbourne Tigers\" and the venue is \"State Netball and Hockey Centre.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Home team is Townsville Crocodiles, venue is Townsville Entertainment Centre. Not relevant.\nRow 1: Home team Cairns Taipans, venue Cairns Convention Centre. No.\nRow 2: Wollongong Hawks at Win Entertainment Centre. Not Melbourne Tigers.\nRow 3: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats at Distinctive Homes Dome. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Gold Coast Blaze hosts New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre. Not Melbourne Tigers.\nRow 5: Melbourne Tigers play Townsville Crocodiles at State Netball and Hockey Centre. This seems to match.\nRow 6: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans at Hisense Arena. Not relevant.\nRow 7: Sydney Spirit hosts Wollongong Hawks at State Sports Centre. Not Melbourne Tigers.\n\nSo, only row 5 has Melbourne Tigers as the home team and the venue is State Netball and Hockey Centre. This fully supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being row_index=5 and column_name=\"venue\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"All entries in the table be labeled 'box score' even the game where the away team is Sydney Spirit.\" So, the claim is asserting that every single entry in the table under the \"report\" column should have the value \"box score\". This includes any row where the away team is Sydney Spirit.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The first thing I notice is that in some rows, the \"box score\" cell is labeled as \"-\", while in others it's just left blank or maybe doesn't have any text.\n\nWait, but according to the table provided, the \"box score\" column has \"-\" in several rows. For example, the first row has \"box score\" and \"-\", then another row with \"-\". So that means not all entries are labeled \"box score\", right? Some are just a dash.\n\nNow, checking if this applies specifically when the away team is Sydney Spirit. Looking through each row to see which ones have \"Sydney Spirit\" as the away team. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. First row: away team is \"Sydney Spirit\". The \"box score\" column here is \"-\".\n2. Second row: away team is \"New Zealand Breakers\". So not Sydney Spirit.\n3. Third row: away team is \"Gold Coast Blaze\".\n4. Fourth row: away team is \"Perth Wildcats\".\n5. Fifth row: away team is \"Sydney Spirit\". Wait, no, looking again, the fifth row's away team is \"Townsville Crocodiles\"? No, wait, let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me list out each row with their away teams:\n\n- Row 0: away team is \"Sydney Spirit\" \u2192 \"box score\" is \"-\".\n- Row 1: away team is \"New Zealand Breakers\" \u2192 \"box score\" is \"-\".\n- Row 2: away team is \"Gold Coast Blaze\" \u2192 \"box score\" is \"-\".\n- Row 3: away team is \"Perth Wildcats\" \u2192 \"box score\" is \"-\".\n- Row 4: away team is \"Sydney Spirit\"? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the fifth row (index 4) has away team as \"New Zealand Breakers\". The sixth row (index 5): away team is \"Townsville Crocodiles\". Seventh row (index 6): away team is \"Cairns Taipans\".\n\nWait, actually, in the data provided:\n\nLooking at each sub-array in data:\n\nRow 0: away team is \"Sydney Spirit\" \u2192 box score is \"-\".\nRow 1: away team is \"New Zealand Breakers\" \u2192 box score is \"-\".\nRow 2: away team is \"Gold Coast Blaze\" \u2192 box score is \"-\".\nRow 3: away team is \"Perth Wildcats\" \u2192 box score is \"-\".\nRow 4: away team is \"Sydney Spirit\"? Wait no, let me look:\n\nWait, the data array has eight rows. Let me list them clearly:\n\n1. Row 0: date=22 october, home team=Townsville Crocodiles, score=103 - 101, away team=Sydney Spirit, venue=..., box score=\"-\", report=...\n2. Row 1: date=22 october, home team=Cairns Taipans, score=101-92, away team=New Zealand Breakers, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n3. Row 2: date=24 october, home team=Wollongong Hawks, score=98-96, away team=Gold Coast Blaze, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n4. Row 3: date=25 october, home team=Adelaide 36ers, score=93-104, away team=Perth Wildcats, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n5. Row 4: date=25 october, home team=Gold Coast Blaze, score=113-116, away team=New Zealand Breakers, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n6. Row 5: date=25 october, home team=Melbourne Tigers, score=110-97, away team=Townsville Crocodiles, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n7. Row 6: date=25 october, home team=South Dragons, score=94-65, away team=Cairns Taipans, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n8. Row 7: date=26 october, home team=Sydney Spirit, score=99-86, away team=Wollongong Hawks, venue=..., box score=\"-\", ...\n\nSo in row 0 and row 7, the away team is Sydney Spirit. In both cases, the \"box score\" column is \"-\".\n\nNow, according to the claim, all entries should be labeled \"box score\", even when the away team is Sydney Spirit. But in these two rows where the away team is Sydney Spirit, the box score is \"-\", not \"box score\". Therefore, the claim is false because not all entries are labeled as \"box score\".\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, to find the relevant cells: we need to check every row's \"report\" column. Wait, no, wait\u2014 the claim mentions that all entries in the table (presumably each cell) should be labeled \"box score\". But looking at the columns, it's the \"box score\" and \"report\".\n\nWait, but the original instruction says: \"all entry in the table be labled box score even the game where the away team be sydney spirit.\"\n\nSo does that mean all cells, or just specific ones? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is about the \"report\" column being labeled \"box score\". Or perhaps it's about other columns.\n\nWait, let me re-read the claim: \"all entry in the table be labled box score even the game where the away team be sydney spirit.\" So maybe every cell should have the value \"box score\"? That doesn't make much sense because most of the columns like \"date\", \"home team\", etc., aren't related to box scores.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the \"report\" column. But in the table, the \"report\" column also has \"-\" entries. So maybe the claim is that all reports are labeled \"box score\".\n\nBut looking at the data, in row 0 and row7, the away team is Sydney Spirit, and their report columns might be \"-\" as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"entry\" refers to each game's data, so for each game (each row), the box score should be present. But in all rows, the box score is \"-\", not \"box score\".\n\nWait, but the claim says that all entries should be labeled \"box score\". So every single cell across all columns? That doesn't make sense because, for example, date can't be a box score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about each game having both a box score and a report. But in this table, each row has \"score\" as the home team and away team, which is presumably their scores. Then the \"box score\" column might represent something else, like combined stats or something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the claim is about the existence of a \"box score\" in each game's data. So for each row, there should be a \"box score\" entry. But looking at the columns, they have: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report.\n\nSo yes, each row has a \"box score\", which is \"-\" in all cases except maybe some that are missing? No, in all rows it's \"-\".\n\nBut perhaps the claim is that the \"report\" column should say \"box score\". But that doesn't make sense because each report is presumably about something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"entry\" refers to each game having a box score entry. So regardless of what it says, each row must have a box score. In this case, all rows do have a box score (it's just \"-\"). But perhaps the claim is that the value should be \"box score\", not \"-\" in those columns.\n\nIn that case, looking at row 0: away team Sydney Spirit \u2192 box score is \"-\", which doesn't equal \"box score\". Therefore, it's false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be all rows where the away team is Sydney Spirit, specifically their \"box score\" column entries (which are in index 5 and 15, but I think indexes 0 and 7).\n\nWait, let me get back. The task is to find which cells correspond to the claim. Since the claim is that all entries should be labeled \"box score\", but only specific ones are not.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, each game (row) should have a box score entry, and for games where the away team is Sydney Spirit, their box score entry must be present.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check which cells correspond to the games where the away team is Sydney Spirit. So in row 0 and row7, their \"box score\" columns are \"-\", so they don't have a box score. Therefore, these entries are wrong because they should be labeled as \"box score\".\n\nSo the relevant cells would be those two boxes: for row 0 and row7, their \"box score\" columns.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, it's about the report column? Wait, no, in each row, there is a \"box score\" column. So if the claim is that all entries (in the table) must have a box score, then all cells under the \"box score\" column should be \"box score\". But in reality, they are \"-\".\n\nThus, perhaps every cell in the \"box score\" column across all rows should be \"box score\", but in the data, it's \"-\", so that's why it's false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be each \"box score\" entry, as they don't have the correct label. But since the claim is specifically about games where the away team is Sydney Spirit, maybe only those specific rows' box score entries are wrong.\n\nSo to sum up: the answer is that the claim is false because in at least two cases (where the away team is Sydney Spirit), the box score entry is \"-\", not \"box score\". Thus, it's incorrect. Therefore, the relevant cells would be the \"box score\" columns for those specific games.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine if all entries in the table are labeled as \"box score,\" specifically focusing on games where the away team is the Sydney Spirit.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Table Structure:** Each row represents a game with multiple columns, including \"date,\" \"home team,\" \"score,\" \"away team,\" \"venue,\" \"box score,\" and \"report.\"\n\n2. **Claim Evaluation:** The claim states that every entry in the table should be labeled \"box score,\" even for games where the away team is the Sydney Spirit.\n\n3. **Focus on Specific Rows:**\n   - **Row 0:** Date=22 October, Home Team=Townsville Crocodiles, Score=103-101, Away Team=Sydney Spirit, Venue=..., Box Score=\"-\", Report=...\n   - **Row 7:** Date=26 October, Home Team=Sydney Spirit, Score=99-86, Away Team=Wollongong Hawks, Venue=..., Box Score=\"-\", Report=...\n\n4. **Box Score Evaluation:**\n   - For both identified rows (0 and 7), the \"box score\" column contains \"-\", not \"box score.\"\n   - This violates the claim's condition that all entries should be labeled as \"box score.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because specific entries in games where the away team is the Sydney Spirit do not have their \"box score\" correctly labeled.\n\n**Relevant Cells:** The \"box score\" columns for both Row 0 and Row 7 are incorrect.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nThe task requires identifying that certain table entries do not meet the claim's criteria. Specifically, in games where the away team is the Sydney Spirit, the box score entry is missing or incorrect. \n\nAnswer:  \n\\boxed{\\text{Specific \"box score\" entries for games with the Sydney Spirit as away team are incorrect}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"gold coast blaze have their home game in the venue of gold coast convention centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that the Gold Coast Blaze have a home game played at the Gold Coast Convention Centre. So, I need to check if there's any row in the table where the home team is \"Gold Coast Blaze\" and the venue is \"Gold Coast Convention Centre\".\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report. The data rows follow these columns.\n\nI'll go through each row to find relevant information:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Townsville Crocodiles. Venue is Townsville Entertainment Centre. Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Home team is Cairns Taipans. Venue is Cairns Convention Centre. Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: Home team is Wollongong Hawks. Venue is Win Entertainment Centre. Not relevant.\n4. Row 3: Home team is Adelaide 36ers. Venue is Distinctive Homes Dome. Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Home team is Gold Coast Blaze. Venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre. This matches the claim.\n6. Row 5: Home team is Melbourne Tigers. Venue is State Netball and Hockey Centre. Not relevant.\n7. Row 6: Home team is South Dragons. Venue is Hisense Arena. Not relevant.\n8. Row 7: Home team is Sydney Spirit. Venue is State Sports Centre. Not relevant.\n\nSo, in row 4, the home team is Gold Coast Blaze, and the venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre. This directly supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'row_index' for this row is 4 (since it's zero-indexed). The columns involved are 'home team' and 'venue'. Therefore, the relevant cells are at row index 4 for both these columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where the Gold Coast Blaze play a home game at the Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the match on 24 october at venue state netball and hockey centre with score of 113 - 116 have melbourne tiger as home team.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions a specific date (24 October), a venue (state netball and hockey centre), a score (113-116), and the home team (Melbourne Tigers).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. So I should go through each row to find if there's a match that matches all these details.\n\nLet me start by examining the 'date' column. The claim mentions 24 October. Scanning through the dates in the table:\n\n- Row 0: 22 October\n- Row 1: 22 October\n- Row 2: 24 October\n- Row 3: 25 October\n- Row 4: 25 October\n- Row 5: 25 October\n- Row 6: 25 October\n- Row 7: 26 October\n\nOnly row 2 has the date 24 October. So that's our relevant row.\n\nNow, let's check the 'venue' for row 2. The venue is \"win entertainment centre.\" Hmm, but the claim says \"state netball and hockey centre.\" That doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check. No, in row 2, under 'venue', it's written as \"win entertainment centre.\"\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here: the venue in the table is different from what's stated in the claim. So that might mean the claim is false already.\n\nBut let's check other parts just to be thorough. The score given in the claim is 113-116. Looking at row 2, under 'score', it says \"98 - 96.\" That doesn't match either. So both the venue and the score don't align with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, the home team in row 2 is listed as \"wollongong hawks,\" not \"melbourne tiger\" as stated in the claim. Therefore, all three components mentioned in the claim (date, venue, score) do not match any single row in the table on 24 October.\n\nWait a second, but maybe I misread the data. Let me look again at row 2:\n\n[\n  \"24 october\",\n  \"wollongong hawks\",\n  \"98 - 96\",\n  \"gold coast blaze\",\n  \"win entertainment centre\",\n  \"box score\",\n  \"-\"\n]\n\nNope, that's correct. So the home team is wollongong hawks, not melbourne tigers.\n\nAnother thing to consider: could there be multiple matches on 24 October? Looking at the table, only row 2 has 24 October. So no, it's just one match on that date.\n\nWait, but in row 5 and row 6, I see \"state netball and hockey centre\" as the venue for different dates (25 October). But the claim is about 24 October, so those rows are irrelevant here.\n\nSo putting it all together: the claim has a mismatched date (it should be 24 October but row 2 is correct), mismatched venue (\"win entertainment centre\" vs \"state netball and hockey centre\"), mismatched score (\"98-96\" vs \"113-116\"), and the home team doesn't match either.\n\nTherefore, none of these elements in the claim correspond to a single match on 24 October.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the match on 26 october have box score type of box score with south dragon as home team and score of 103 - 101.\"\n\nI need to verify each part of this claim against the provided table. The table has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report.\n\nStarting with the date: 26 October. I should look for a row where the date is \"26 october\". Scanning through the data, I see that there's only one entry for \"26 october,\" which is row index 6.\n\nNext, checking the home team. The claim mentions \"south dragons.\" Looking at row 6, the home team is \"sydney spirit.\" Hmm, that doesn't match \"south dragons,\" so this part might be a problem. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. No, row 6's home team is indeed Sydney Spirit.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows to make sure I'm not missing another date or something. The dates are on 22 October (three times), 24 October, and 25 October (four times). So only row 6 is on the 26th. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nMoving on, the score in the claim is \"103 - 101.\" Looking at row 6, the score is listed as \"99 - 86.\" That doesn't match either. So the score part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim says the score is 103-101, but the table shows 99-86 for that date. Definitely not matching.\n\nAlso, regarding the box score type, the claim mentions \"box score\" which is present in all rows as the fifth column, so that part checks out.\n\nPutting it all together: the date matches, but home team and score don't.

So, this is a relevant row because it's when they are away.\n- Row 3: away team is perth wildcats.\n- Row 4: away team is new zealand breakers.\n- Row 5: away team is townsville crocodiles.\n- Row 6: away team is cairns taipans.\n\nSo, the only row where gold coast is the away team is row 2. Now, let's check the score for that row. The score is \"98 - 96.\" That doesn't match \"101 - 92\" at all. Therefore, the claim about the score being 101-92 when gold coast is away isn't supported.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the match on 25 october have gold coast blaze as home team with score of 93 - 104 at venue gold coast convention centre.\"\n\nFirst, let me look through the table data. The columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. So each row has these details.\n\nI'll start by checking for matches on October 25th. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 3: Date is \"25 october\", home team is \"gold coast blaze\", score is \"93 - 104\". The away team is \"perth wildcats\", venue is \"distinctive homes dome\".\n\nWait, but the claim says the venue is \"gold coast convention centre\". So in this row, the venue is different. That might be an issue.\n\nThen there's another row: Row 4? Wait, no, rows are indexed from 0 to 7. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: Oct 22, Townsville Crocodiles vs Sydney Spirit\nRow 1: Oct 22, Cairns Taipans vs New Zealand Breakers\nRow 2: Oct 24, Wollongong Hawks vs Gold Coast Blaze\nRow 3: Oct 25, Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats\nRow 4: Oct 25, Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers\nRow 5: Oct 25, Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles\nRow 6: Oct 25, South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The data array has rows from index 0 to 6. So:\n\nLooking at each row for October 25:\n\n- Index 3: date \"25 october\", home team \"adelaide 36ers\", score \"93 - 104\", away \"perth wildcats\", venue \"distinctive homes dome\"\n\n- Index 4: \"gold coast blaze\" as home, score \"113 - 116\", away \"new zealand breakers\", venue \"gold coast convention centre\"\n\n- Index 5: \"melbourne tigers\" as home, score \"110 - 97\", away \"townsville crocodiles\", venue \"state netball and hockey centre\"\n\n- Index 6: \"south dragons\" as home, score \"94 - 65\", away \"cairns taipans\", venue \"hisense arena\"\n\nSo the claim is about a match on Oct 25 where Gold Coast Blaze is the home team with a score of 93-104. Looking through each row for Oct 25:\n\nRow 3: Home team is Adelaide 36ers, not Gold Coast Blaze.\n\nRow 4: Gold Coast Blaze as home, but their score is 113-116 against New Zealand Breakers.\n\nWait, so where is the game with a 93-104 score? Let me check all rows. The only row on Oct 25 with a score around that is index 3: Adelaide 36ers scored 93-104, but they were the home team, not Gold Coast Blaze.\n\nSo in the table, there's no row where on October 25, Gold Coast Blaze is the home team with a 93-104 score. Instead, it's Adelaide 36ers that have that score. So the claim seems to be incorrect because the venue doesn't match either\u2014Adelaide's game was at \"distinctive homes dome\", not \"gold coast convention centre\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row in the table for October 25 matches involving Gold Coast Blaze. The relevant data shows that on October 25, Gold Coast Blaze had a match with a score of 113-116 at the Gold Coast Convention Centre. However, this doesn't include a game with a score of 93-104.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
