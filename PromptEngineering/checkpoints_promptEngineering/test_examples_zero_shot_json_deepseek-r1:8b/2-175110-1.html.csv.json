    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Rhodesia's medals is true based on the given table. The claim says, \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal, 5 silver medal, and 10 gold medal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. Each row corresponds to a different nation with their medal counts.\n\nI need to find Rhodesia in the data. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: United States\n- Row 1: Great Britain\n- Row 2: Italy\n- Row 3: Australia\n- Row 4: Rhodesia\n- Row 5: South Africa\n- And so on.\n\nSo, Rhodesia is in row index 4. Now, looking at the columns for this row:\n\n- gold: 10\n- silver: 5\n- bronze: 2\n\nThat matches exactly what the claim states. The numbers are correct: 10 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze.\n\nI should also make sure there are no discrepancies in how the data is presented. For example, checking if \"Rhodesia\" is correctly spelled as such in the table. From the table, yes, it's spelled Rhodesia in row 4.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}]}",
