    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography do not go to william ivey long.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see what information it provides. The table has several columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents a different award.\n\nI'll start by focusing on the specific claim. It mentions the 2005 Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography. So I need to find the relevant rows in the table where the award is a Drama Desk Award and the category is \"outstanding choreography.\"\n\nLooking at the data, I see that there are two entries related to the Drama Desk Award:\n\n1. Row index 5: \n   - Award: drama desk award\n   - Category: outstanding choreography\n   - Nominee: jerry mitchell\n   - Result: won\n\n2. Row index 6:\n   - Award: drama desk award\n   - Category: outstanding costume design\n   - Nominee: william ivey long\n   - Result: nominated\n\nWait, but the claim is about the choreography category. So row 5 is the one we need. In that row, the nominee for outstanding choreography is jerry mitchell, and the result is \"won.\" William Ivey Long is in another category (costume design) and was only nominated.\n\nSo according to the table, the 2005 Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography went to jerry mitchell, not William Ivey Long. Therefore, the claim that it did not go to him is true.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" For the first entry (row 5), the columns are award, category, nominee, and result. So all these columns are relevant for verifying who won the choreography award. Similarly, William Ivey Long is in another row and category, so only the relevant cells for the claim are from row 5.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim is TRUE because in the table, the choreography award went to jerry mitchell, not William Ivey Long.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as true based on the data provided. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me first understand the claim: it says, \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different award category and whether someone won, was nominated, etc. The columns are year, award, category, nominee, result.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the best costume design at the Tony Award in 2005. So I need to find the relevant row where the category is \"best costume design,\" the award is \"tony award,\" the year is 2005, and the result is \"nominated.\" Then check if the nominee's name matches \"qilliam ivey long.\"\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nRow 0: 2005, tony award, best revival of a musical, best revival of a musical, won.\nRow 1: 2005, tony award, best performance by a leading actor in a musical, gary beach, nominated.\nRow 2: 2005, tony award, best choreography, jerry mitchell, won.\nRow 3: 2005, tony award, best costume design, william ivey long, nominated.\n\nSo the relevant row is row index 3. The column for the nominee is \"nominee,\" which in this case has the value \"william ivey long.\" However, the claim says it should be \"qilliam ivey long.\" Wait, that's a typo: it's spelled as \"qilliam\" instead of \"William.\"\n\nSo the name in the table is \"william ivey long,\" but the claim says \"qilliam ivey long.\" Since these are different spellings (q vs. w), this would mean the claim is incorrect because the nominee's last name doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there's another row with the same category and award. Looking through the table:\n\nThe next row after row 3 is for drama desk awards, not tony awards. So only row 3 is relevant for best costume design at tony awards in 2005.\n\nSo, to recap: The claim states that William Ivey Long was nominated for best costume design at the Tony Award in 2005. However, in the table, the nominee's name is \"william ivey long,\" which is correct, but the claim has a typo with \"qilliam\" instead of \"William.\" Therefore, the claim is false because the names don't match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 2 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim and then check against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Jerry Mitchell being one of two winners of a Tony Award. So I'm looking for rows where \"jerry mitchell\" is in the nominee column and the result is \"won.\" Also, there should be another winner with them in that same category or award.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award, which can be either a Tony or Drama Desk. Each row has information about the year, the award name, the category, the nominee, and the result.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to find where \"jerry mitchell\" appears as the nominee.\n\nRow 1: Year 2005, Tony Award, Category is \"best choreography,\" Nominee is Jerry Mitchell. Result is \"won.\" So this seems relevant because he won a Tony in the category of Best Choreography.\n\nRow 2: Nominee is Gary Beach, so not Jerry.\n\nRow 3: Same as row 1, since it's another entry for Jerry Mitchell and result is \"won.\"\n\nRow 4: Nominee is William Ivey Long, so not Jerry.\n\nRow 5: Drama Desk Award, category outstanding revival of musical. Not Jerry.\n\nRow 6: Drama Desk Award, category outstanding choreography. Nominee is Jerry Mitchell, result is \"won.\" So this is another instance where he won a Drama Desk in choreography.\n\nRow 7: Same as row 4, nominee is William Ivey Long, not Jerry.\n\nSo from the table, Jerry Mitchell has two entries where he was a nominee and won: one for Tony Award (choreography) and one for Drama Desk Award (choreography). Wait, no\u2014actually, in the table, the award names are either \"tony award\" or \"drama desk award.\" So in row 1, it's a Tony, row 6 is a Drama Desk. So he won both awards, each in their respective categories.\n\nBut the claim says he was one of two winners of a Tony Award. Wait, let me check that. The first two rows are under \"tony award\" for different categories: best revival and performance by leading actor, but those aren't Jerry's. Then row 3 is \"best choreography\" won by Jerry. So in the Tony Award category, he was one of the winners for choreography.\n\nLooking at other entries, I don't see another person winning a Tony for choreography that year. The only other award is Drama Desk. So in the context of Tony Awards, Jerry Mitchell won in Best Choreography. Is there another winner in that same category? From the table data provided, it doesn't show any other nominees for \"best choreography\" under Tony Award except Jerry. Wait, no\u2014each row is a separate entry, so I'm not sure if it's possible that he was one of two winners.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row represents an individual award or category. So if there were two people winning in the same category, their rows would both be present. But looking at the data, only Jerry Mitchell is listed for \"best choreography\" under Tony Award (row 3). Therefore, it's unclear from this table whether he was one of two winners or the sole winner.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says he was one of two winners. So to confirm that, we need to see if there was another nominee in that category who also won.\n\nLooking at the data, for the Tony Award in 2005 for Best Choreography (row 3), the nominee is Jerry Mitchell and the result is \"won.\" There's no other row for the same award with the same year and category indicating another winner. Therefore, it seems he was the sole winner in that category.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each row is a separate entry, so perhaps each person can have multiple wins. But the claim says \"1 of 2 winners,\" implying there were two people who won Tony Awards that year in their respective categories, and Jerry was one of them.\n\nBut looking at the table, in the same year (2005), for Tony Award, the categories are:\n\n- Best revival: 1 winner\n- Best performance by leading actor: 1 winner\n- Best choreography: 1 winner (Jerry Mitchell)\n- Best costume design: 1 winner (nominated but didn't win)\n\nSimilarly, Drama Desk Awards have their own categories.\n\nSo in the Tony Award category for Best Choreography, Jerry was the only one who won. Therefore, there were no two winners that year in that specific category, at least based on the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is about being one of two winners in any Tony Award, regardless of the category. But looking at the table, he has two wins: one for choreography and one for outstanding choreography (Drama Desk). So maybe across both awards, but that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about being \"1 of 2 winner of a tony award.\" So in the context of the same award category, was he part of two winners? From row 3, he won Best Choreography Tony Award. But no other row for that specific category shows another winner. Therefore, he might have been the sole winner.\n\nAlternatively, if \"a tony award\" refers to any Tony Award, not necessarily the same category, then perhaps there are multiple awards given in 2005. But the claim specifically mentions being one of two winners in a single award, I think.\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 2 winner of a tony award.\" So it's about a specific Tony Award (like Best Choreography) having two winners, with Jerry being one. But from the table, he is the only winner in that category.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, there's no evidence that Jerry Mitchell was part of two winners for any Tony Award. He won his own category, but it doesn't show another person winning alongside him. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because the data doesn't support that he was one of two in a single award.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about being a winner of any Tony Award, regardless of category, and there were others, then maybe it's TRUE. But the wording suggests \"1 of 2 winner of a tony award,\" which implies a specific category with two winners.\n\nBut looking at the table, I only see one person winning in each relevant category for the Tony Awards. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. The data includes several rows, each representing an award with details about the nominees and results.\n\nThe claim mentions Jerry Mitchell being one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award. So, I need to check if there's any row in the table where Jerry Mitchell is a nominee in the 'Drama Desk Award' category.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The first few rows are about Tony Awards, so those can be ignored since the claim is specifically about a Drama Desk Award.\n2. Starting from row 4:\n   - Row 4: Drama Desk Award, outstanding revival of a musical, nominee is William Ivey Long. Not Jerry Mitchell.\n3. Next, row 5: Drama Desk Award, outstanding choreography, nominee is Jerry Mitchell. This seems relevant because it mentions Jerry Mitchell as a nominee for the Drama Desk Award.\n4. Row 6: Drama Desk Award, outstanding costume design, nominee is William Ivey Long again. Not Jerry Mitchell.\n\nSo, in row 5, column 'nominee' is Jerry Mitchell, and the award is Drama Desk. This directly supports the claim that he was a nominee for a Drama Desk Award.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 of 3 nominees.\" The table shows only one entry where Jerry Mitchell is nominated for a Drama Desk Award. There's no information about how many other nominees there were in this category or if it's specified as three. Since the table doesn't provide additional context on the number of nominees beyond what's shown, I can only verify based on the data given.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions being \"1 of 3,\" but the table only shows one instance where Jerry Mitchell was a nominee for a Drama Desk Award. Without knowing if there were two others or not from the table, it's tricky. But the instruction is to check whether the claim is fully supported by the table.\n\nSince the table confirms that Jerry Mitchell was a nominee for a Drama Desk Award, even without information on the exact number of nominees in that category, the claim is at least partially true based on the data provided. However, since the claim specifies being \"1 of 3,\" and the table only shows one instance, it might not fully support the claim as stated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The task is to determine if the claim is fully supported by the table. The claim says Jerry Mitchell was a nominee for a Drama Desk Award. The table shows exactly that in row 5. It doesn't specify the number of nominees but confirms his nomination. So, even though it's \"1 of 3,\" the table does support that he was at least one of the nominees.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim had stated that there were three nominees and Jerry was one, the table might not fully support that because we don't know the other two. But since the claim is about being a nominee without specifying the total number, the table supports it.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being row 5, column 'nominee'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"gary beach be 1 of 4 nominee for a tony award.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result.\n\nThe data shows that in 2005, there were several Tony Award and Drama Desk Award nominations and results. I'm focusing on the 'nominee' column to see if Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: award is \"tony award\", nominee is \"best revival of a musical\" \u2013 not Gary.\n- Row 1: award is \"tony award\", nominee is \"gary beach\" \u2013 so he's a nominee here.\n- Row 2: different award, so irrelevant.\n- Row 3: same category as row 1 but different nominee and result, so not relevant unless there are four nominees.\n- Row 4: drama desk award, so not relevant to Tony Award.\n- Rows 5 and 6 also have Drama Desk Awards, so ignore those.\n\nSo, Gary Beach was a nominee for a Tony Award in 2005. Now, the claim says he's one of four nominees. I need to check if there were three other nominees for that specific award category.\n\nLooking at row 1: The category is \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical.\" So, the nominees are Gary Beach and others? Wait, from the table, each row represents a single nomination. So, if the claim says he was one of four nominees, we need to ensure that exactly four people were nominated for that award.\n\nIn 2005, for the Tony Award category \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical,\" how many nominees were there? The data shows only Gary Beach as the nominee in row 1. Wait, but maybe the table doesn't list all four nominees because it's just a sample.\n\nWait, no. Each row in the data is an individual nomination. So for the Tony Award category \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\" (row 1), Gary Beach was nominated. But were there three others? The table doesn't show that, so perhaps it's incomplete or maybe each award has only one nominee per row.\n\nWait, but in reality, each award typically has several nominees. For example, the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor usually has five nominees. If the table only shows Gary Beach as a nominee, maybe the rest aren't listed here. So, it's possible that he was indeed one of four or more.\n\nBut since the data provided doesn't show the other three nominees, how can we confirm? The claim is about whether Gary Beach was one of four nominees. From the table, it shows at least one nominee (Gary Beach), but without knowing if there are exactly four, including others, I can't be certain based on the table alone.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"1 of 4,\" implying that in total, four people were nominated for that award. Since the table only lists Gary as a nominee, maybe it's missing the other three. Or perhaps each row represents one of the four. Looking back at the data:\n\nRow 0: Best revival of a musical \u2013 same category but different nominees.\nRow 1: Best performance by a leading actor \u2013 Gary Beach is a nominee.\nRows 2 and 3: Choreography and Costume Design, also with other nominees.\n\nWait, maybe each award category has multiple nominees. For the \"best performance by a leading actor\" category, was there only one nominee in the table? That can't be right because that would mean Gary was alone, making it not one of four.\n\nBut typically, awards have several nominees. So perhaps the data is incomplete, showing only one out of four or more. Since the table doesn't list all the nominees for that category, we can't confirm if there were exactly four. Therefore, based on the given data, I cannot verify whether Gary Beach was one of four nominees because it's unclear from the table.\n\nWait, but looking at row 1: the category is \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\" and the award is \"tony award\". The nominee is Gary Beach. So if this is one of four, then yes, he's included. But without knowing how many others were nominated, we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents an individual, so for that specific category, there might have been only one nominee listed in the table, but actually, there could have been more elsewhere. So, perhaps the data isn't complete.\n\nBut since the claim is about being one of four, and based on the table, we can only see that he was at least a nominee. However, without knowing if others were also nominated for the same award in this context, it's unclear.\n\nWait, but looking back, each row is a separate entry. So, for the Tony Award \"best performance by a leading actor,\" Gary Beach is one of possibly more than one nominee. But in the table, only his nomination is listed. Therefore, without knowing if there were three others also nominated (which would make four total), we can't confirm.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't provide all the information about whether there were exactly four nominees for that award, we can't definitively say if Gary Beach was one of four.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"willam ivey long win the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim itself. It mentions three main points: William Ivey Long won an award in 2005, specifically a Drama Desk Award, and it was for outstanding choreography. \n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to find any relevant rows and columns that might support or contradict this claim.\n\nThe table has the following columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. Each row represents an entry from 2005 because all the entries in 'year' are 2005. So we can focus on the other columns.\n\nI'm looking for a row where:\n- The 'nominee' is William Ivey Long.\n- The 'category' is \"outstanding choreography\".\n- The 'award' is \"Drama Desk Award\".\n- The 'result' should be \"won\" since he supposedly won it.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. First row: award is \"tony award\", nominee is \"best revival of a musical\". Doesn't match.\n2. Second row: same year, but nominee is \"gary beach\", so not relevant.\n3. Third row: nominee is \"jerry mitchell\" and category is \"best choreography\". Not matching.\n4. Fourth row: nominee is \"william ivey long\", category is \"outstanding costume design\". Not the right category.\n5. Fifth row: same as third but for Drama Desk, category is \"outstanding revival\". Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: nominee is \"jerry mitchell\" again, category is \"outstanding choreography\". So this is interesting. But the nominee here is Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long.\n\nWait, so in row 5 (index 5?), no, wait, let me count correctly. The data array starts with index 0:\n\n- Index 0: Tony Award, best revival\n- Index 1: Gary Beach, different category\n- Index 2: Jerry Mitchell won for choreography\n- Index 3: William Ivey Long nominated for costume design\n- Index 4: Drama Desk, outstanding revival (nominee same as category)\n- Index 5: Drama Desk, outstanding choreography, nominee is Jerry Mitchell\n- Index 6: Drama Desk, outstanding costume design, nominee is William Ivey Long\n\nSo in row index 6, the award is \"Drama Desk Award\", the category is \"outstanding costume design\", and the nominee is William Ivey Long. But the claim says he won for choreography. So in this case, he was nominated but didn't win in that category.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify: In row 6, the result is \"nominated\". So he was only nominated for outstanding costume design, not for choreography. Therefore, there's no row where William Ivey Long won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other entries, Jerry Mitchell did win for outstanding choreography in 2005 (row index 2 and 5). But that's a different person.\n\nSo based on the table, the claim is incorrect. There's no entry where William Ivey Long won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award.\" This suggests that Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several rows and columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. My focus is on finding any entries where Jerry Mitchell was a nominee and the result is \"won,\" specifically checking if this happened twice in the same year.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: The nominee is \"best revival of a musical\" and it's won, but the individual is not Jerry Mitchell.\n2. Row 1: This row has \"gary beach\" as the nominee, so no relevance here.\n3. Row 2: Here, the nominee is \"jerry mitchell,\" and the result is \"won.\" So that's one win for him.\n4. Row 3: The nominee is \"william ivey long,\" so not relevant.\n5. Row 4: This row is about \"outstanding revival of a musical\" and it's won, but the individual isn't Jerry Mitchell.\n6. Row 5: This row has \"jerry mitchell\" as the nominee, and the result is \"won.\" That's another win.\n\nSo, in row 2 and row 5, Jerry Mitchell is listed as the nominee for different categories (choreography and outstanding choreography) both resulting in wins. Therefore, he won two Tony Awards in 2005.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries that might affect this conclusion. Are there multiple entries for Jerry Mitchell? Let me scan through all rows again. Only rows 2 and 5 list him as the nominee with \"won.\" There's no indication of more than two wins in the same year.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the column names: award could refer to either a Tony or a Drama Desk, but since both are listed as awards, I need to consider them as separate. However, the claim specifically mentions \"tony award,\" so I should check if Jerry Mitchell's wins were indeed Tony Awards. Rows 2 and 5 both list \"tony award\" in the 'award' column, so that checks out.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards as per the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each row to see if Jerry Mitchell was a nominee and if he won. In rows 2 and 5, he was the nominee with \"won\" results for both categories. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim: \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time.\" So, the claim states that Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award three times. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows, each representing an award and its outcomes. The columns relevant here are 'nominee', 'category', and 'result' because these relate to who was nominated, what category they were in, and whether they won or were nominated.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for mentions of Jerry Mitchell.\n\n- Row 0: nominee is \"best revival of a musical\" \u2013 not Jerry.\n- Row 1: nominee is \"gary beach\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: nominee is \"jerry mitchell\" and the award is a Drama Desk, category is outstanding choreography. The result is \"won.\" So this shows he won once.\n- Row 3: nominee is William Ivey Long \u2013 not Jerry.\n- Row 4: same as row 2 but for drama desk in another category; again, he's nominated? Wait, no, looking at the data:\n\nWait, row 2: award is \"drama desk award\", and result is \"won\". So that's one win. Row 5: same person, same award, different category, also won. So two wins so far.\n\nRow 6: same as above, another category but again he was nominated? Wait, no, the row 2,5,6 have 'result' as 'won', which means he won in those categories.\n\nWait, actually, let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 2: year 2005, tony award, best choreography, jerry mitchell, result \"won\". So that's a win for him.\nRow 5: same year and award (drama desk), category outstanding choreography, jerry mitchell, won. Another win.\nRow 6: outstanding costume design, same award, jerry mitchell, result is \"nominated.\" Wait, no\u2014 in row 2,5,6:\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- columns: year, award, category, nominee, result\nSo row 2: 2005, tony award, best choreography, jerry mitchell, won. So that's a win.\n\nRow 5: same as row 2 but drama desk and outstanding choreography; jerry mitchell, won.\n\nRow 6: drama desk, outstanding costume design, jerry mitchell, result is \"nominated.\" So he was only nominated once in the table provided. \n\nWait, wait, looking at rows:\n\nRow 0: tony award, category same as nominee, so not Jerry.\nRow1: gary beach, not Jerry.\nRow2: jerry mitchell, drama desk? No, row2 is tony award.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The table has:\n\nEach row represents a different award. For example, rows 0-4 are tony awards (since columns show \"tony award\" or \"drama desk award\"), so I need to parse each row correctly.\n\nLooking at the data again:\n\n[\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"tony award\",\n    \"best revival of a musical\",\n    \"best revival of a musical\",\n    \"won\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"tony award\",\n    \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\",\n    \"gary beach\",\n    \"nominated\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"tony award\",\n    \"best choreography\",\n    \"jerry mitchell\",\n    \"won\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"tony award\",\n    \"best costume design\",\n    \"william ivey long\",\n    \"nominated\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"drama desk award\",\n    \"outstanding revival of a musical\",\n    \"outstanding revival of a musical\",\n    \"won\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"drama desk award\",\n    \"outstanding choreography\",\n    \"jerry mitchell\",\n    \"won\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2005,\n    \"drama desk award\",\n    \"outstanding costume design\",\n    \"william ivey long\",\n    \"nominated\"\n  ]\n]\n\nSo, the rows are:\n\n0: tony award\n1: tony award\n2: tony award\n3: tony award\n4: drama desk award\n5: drama desk award\n6: drama desk award\n\nNow, looking for jerry mitchell in each row.\n\nRow 2: tony award, best choreography, jerry mitchell, result \"won\" \u2192 he won once.\n\nRow 5: drama desk, outstanding choreography, jerry mitchell, result \"won\" \u2192 another win.\n\nRow 6: drama desk, outstanding costume design, jerry mitchell, result \"nominated.\" So here, he was only nominated, not won.\n\nSo in total, how many times was he nominated? In row 5 and row6. Wait, no\u2014 in the table, each row represents an individual award entry. So for drama desk awards:\n\nRow4: category outstanding revival of musical \u2192 nominee is same as category, so he's the one who won it.\n\nRow5: he was in outstanding choreography and result is \"won\".\n\nRow6: he was in outstanding costume design but result is \"nominated\".\n\nSo from the table, how many times was Jerry Mitchell nominated? He was a winner twice (rows 2 and 5) and once nominated (row6). So he has two wins and one nomination.\n\nWait, no. Because each row represents an individual award entry. For example, in row2: tony award, best choreography; jerry mitchell won it. That's one win. In row5: drama desk, outstanding choreography; he won again. So that's two wins. Row6: he was nominated but didn't win. So he has been a winner twice and once nominated.\n\nBut the claim is that he was nominated three times. Wait, the claim says \"be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time.\" So it's about being nominated three times, not winning.\n\nSo in the table, looking for rows where his result is \"nominated.\"\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow2: won \u2192 not nominated.\nRow5: won \u2192 not nominated.\nRow6: nominated \u2192 count as one.\n\nBut wait, are there more? Let me check each row's 'result' column for jerry mitchell.\n\nIn the table, jerry mitchell appears in row2 (tony award), result \"won\"; row5 (drama desk), result \"won\"; and row6 (drama desk), result \"nominated.\" So only once was he nominated, in row6. Therefore, based on the table provided, Jerry Mitchell has been nominated once for a Drama Desk Award.\n\nThe claim says he was nominated three times. Since the table shows only one nomination, that would mean the claim is false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- tony award rows (0,1,2,3): no jerry mitchell except row2 where he won.\n- drama desk rows (4,5,6):\n  - row4: someone else won.\n  - row5: jerry won.\n  - row6: jerry was nominated.\n\nSo in total, only one nomination. Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the information given.\n\nThus, the answer should be that he has not been nominated three times; rather, he has only been nominated once and won twice.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I misread other rows where jerry might have been a nominee but didn't win. Let me check all 'nominated' results:\n\nLooking at all rows where result is \"nominated\":\n\nRow1: gary beach\nRow3: william ivey long\nRow6: jerry mitchell\n\nSo only jerry in row6 was nominated and not won.\n\nTherefore, he has been nominated once. So the claim that he's been nominated three times is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Jerry Mitchell has been nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award is incorrect based on the provided information. From the table, Jerry Mitchell was only nominated once (for Outstanding Costume Design in 2005). Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; Jerry Mitchell has been nominated for a Drama Desk Award only once, not three times.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents an entry for one of these categories, with data filled in for each column.\n\nThe claim mentions \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award.\" So I need to check if Gary Beach won a Tony Award in 2005, specifically as part of a group of four winners. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the 'nominee' is Gary Beach. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Nominee is \"best revival of a musical\", not Gary Beach.\n2. Second row: The award is Tony Award, category is \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\", nominee is Gary Beach, and result is \"nominated\". So he was nominated for this category but didn't win.\n3. Third row: Different award, different category, different nominee.\n4. Fourth row: Another Tony Award entry, but nominee is someone else.\n5. Fifth and sixth rows: Drama Desk Awards, so not relevant to the claim about Tony Awards.\n6. Seventh row: Same as fourth.\n\nSo in the second row, Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award in 2005 for \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical.\" The result column says \"nominated,\" meaning he didn't win that category. \n\nNow, the claim says he is \"1 of 4 winner.\" To be a winner, the 'result' should be \"won.\" Since it's \"nominated,\" he didn't win.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if there were four winners in any Tony Award categories for 2005. Looking at the data:\n\nIn the first row: won\nThird row: won\nFifth row: won\n\nWait, that's three wins, but perhaps other rows might have more. Let me count all 'won' entries across categories.\n\n1. Row 0: won\n2. Row 2: won\n3. Row 4: won\n4. Row 5: won\n\nThat's four Tony Award winners in total (rows 0, 2, 4, 5). So if the claim is that Gary Beach was one of four, but he didn't win, it's false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because although there were four Tony Award winners in 2005, Gary Beach wasn't among them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach was one of four winners of a Tony Award. However, upon reviewing the table, Gary Beach was only nominated for a Tony Award but did not win. Additionally, there were indeed four Tony Award winners (from rows 0, 2, 4, and 5), but Gary Beach is not among them.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
