    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Tevita Vaikona scoring 100 points on 25 tries is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries.\" The key elements here are his name, the points scored (100), and the number of tries he attempted (25).\n\nNow, I need to examine the table provided. The table has columns: player, position, tries, goals, and points. My goal is to find Tevita Vaikona's data in this table and check if the claim matches his stats.\n\nLooking through each row, I'll search for \"tevita vaikona.\" Scanning down, I see that he is indeed one of the players listed in the second row (row_index: 1). His position is \"wing,\" which seems correct. \n\nNext, I need to check the number of tries and points. According to the claim, he should have 25 tries and 100 points. Looking at his row, the \"tries\" column has a value of 25, and the \"points\" column shows 100. So both numbers match exactly.\n\nWait, is there any chance that another player with a similar name could be confused? The table doesn't seem to have anyone else named Tevita Vaikona, so it's safe to assume this is his only entry.\n\nTherefore, all the relevant data points in the claim are found and verified in the table. There's no discrepancy or missing information that would make the claim false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries,\" we locate Tevita Vaikona's row (row_index: 1) and check his \"tries\" and \"points\" columns. Both values match the claim, confirming it is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"tevita vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find Tevita Vaikona's data. Let me scan each row under the 'player' column.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Robbie Paul\n- Row 1: Tevita Vaikona\n- Row 2: Leon Pryce\n- And so on until Row 18: Stuart Fielden\n\nSo, Tevita Vaikona is in row 1. Now, I need to check his 'position', 'tries', and 'goals' (points) columns.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Position: wing\n- Tries: 25\n- Goals: 100\n\nNow, the claim says he scores at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries. So, two conditions must be met:\n\n1. His goals (points) are >=100.\n2. His tries are >23.\n\nLooking at his data:\n- Goals: 100 which is >=100, so that's good.\n- Tries: 25 which is greater than 23, so that also satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, I need to check if he is the only player meeting both these criteria. So I have to look through all players and see if any other player has goals >=100 and tries >23.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Robbie Paul - fullback, 23 tries (not >23), so no.\nRow1: Tevita Vaikona - wing, 25>23 and 100 points. Meets both conditions.\n\nRow2: Leon Pryce - centre, 16<23, so doesn't meet the second condition.\nRow3: Nathan McAvoy - centre, 4<23, nope.\nRow4: Michael Withers - fullback,31>23? Yes, 31 tries. But goals:0 <100. So only meets one condition.\nRow5: Henry Paul - stand off,9<23. No.\nRow6: Paul Deacon -scrum half,6<23. No.\nRow7: Joe Vagana -prop,2<23. No.\nRow8: James Lowes -hooker,13<23. No.\nRow9: Paul Anderson-prop,8<23. No.\nRow10: Daniel Gartner-second row,14<23. No.\nRow11: Mike Forshaw-loose forward,6<23. No.\nRow12: Lee Gilmour-second row,8<23. No.\nRow13: Shane Rigon-centre,12<23. No.\nRow14: Alex Wilkinson-wing,0<23. No.\nRow15: Lee Radford-prop,2<23. No.\nRow16: Jamie Peacock-second row,8<23. No.\nRow17: Scott Naylor-centre,14<23. No.\nRow18: Brian Mc Dermott-prop,3<23. No.\nRow19: Graham McKay-wing,12<23. No.\nRow20: Paul Sykes-centre,0<23. No.\nRow21: Rob Parker-prop,0<23. No.\nRow22: Stuart Spruce-fullback,6<23. No.\nRow23: Stuart Fielden-prop,3<23. No.\n\nSo, from this, only Tevita Vaikona meets both conditions. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 1, columns 'tries' (25) and 'goals' (100).\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has five columns: player, position, tries, goals, points.\n\nSo for Tevita Vaikona, the relevant columns would be 'tries' and 'goals', which correspond to column indices 2 and 3. But the instructions say to provide \"column_name\" as a string, not the index. So, I should use the names: \"tries\" and \"goals\".\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- Row 1 (index 1), columns \"tries\" and \"goals\".\n\nSo, in JSON format, it's an array of objects with each object having row_index and column_name.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are these two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
