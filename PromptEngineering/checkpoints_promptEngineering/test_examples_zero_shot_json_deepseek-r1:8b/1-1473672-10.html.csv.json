    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Rene Lambert is true based on the given table. The claim says, \"rene lambert play right wing and be draft with the 146th pick.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: one about his position and another about his draft pick number. I need to check both aspects against the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"pick,\" \"player,\" \"position,\" etc. So for Rene Lambert, I should look in the data rows under these columns. \n\nI'll start by searching for Rene Lambert in the player column. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Garry Howatt\n2. Row 1: Steve Lyon\n3. Row 2: Rene Lambert - found him here.\n\nNow, looking at his details: pick is 146, position is right wing, nationality Canada, NHL team is New York Islanders, and college/junior team is St. Jerome Alouettes (QMJHL).\n\nSo the first part of the claim says he plays right wing. According to the table, yes, that's correct.\n\nThe second part says he was drafted with the 146th pick. The table also shows pick number 144, 145, etc., so 146 is indeed his pick number. That matches too.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are other Rene Lamberts or if I'm looking at the right row. Let me confirm: rows are numbered from 0 to 5, with 6 players total. So Row 2 (index 2) corresponds to 146th pick and player Rene Lambert.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"right wing , rene lampert , be pick 145th\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three things: \"right wing\", \"rene lampert\", and being picked at position 145. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with various attributes. The columns are: pick, player, position, nationality, NHL team, and college/junior/club team. \n\nI need to check if there's a player named Rene Lambert who is listed as a right wing and was picked 145th. \n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\nRow 0: Player is Garry Howatt, position left wing. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Steve Lyon, defence. No.\nRow 2: Rene Lambert, right wing. Position matches. Pick number? The pick column here is 145. Wait, no, looking at row indices, the first data row is index 0, so row 2 corresponds to pick number 146. So that's not matching 145.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list out all the picks:\n\nRow 0: Pick 144\nRow 1: Pick 145\nRow 2: Pick 146\nRow 3: Pick 147\nRow 4: Pick 148\nRow 5: Pick 149\nRow 6: Pick 150\nRow 7: Pick 151\n\nSo, the claim is about pick number 145. Looking at row indices:\n\nRow 0: 144\nRow 1: 145 \u2192 Player Steve Lyon, position defence.\nRow 2: 146 \u2192 Rene Lambert, right wing.\n\nSo, in row 1, the player is Steve Lyon, not Rene Lambert, and he's a defence. So, there's no player named Rene Lambert at pick 145 with the position of right wing.\n\nWait, but looking again, maybe I got the rows wrong. Let me count:\n\nData array starts at index 0: so data[0] is row 1, data[1] is row 2, etc. Wait, no. The first element in data is [144, \"garry howatt\", ...], which would be row_index 0.\n\nSo, row 0: pick 144\nrow 1: pick 145 \u2192 Steve Lyon, defence\nrow 2: pick 146 \u2192 Rene Lambert, right wing\n\nThus, the claim says that pick 145 is a right wing named Rene Lambert. However, in reality, at pick 145 (row 1), it's Steve Lyon, a defence. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the player at pick 145 isn't a right wing or Rene Lambert.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"rene lampert\" which I think is a typo for Rene Lambert. So, in row 2 (pick 146), the player is Rene Lambert, right wing. So the claim mentions pick 145, but the correct pick number should be 146 for Rene Lambert.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no player named Rene Lambert picked at position 145 as a right wing. Instead, he was picked at 146 and is a right wing.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes pick number 145 to Rene Lambert when in fact he was picked at 146 and is a right winger.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
