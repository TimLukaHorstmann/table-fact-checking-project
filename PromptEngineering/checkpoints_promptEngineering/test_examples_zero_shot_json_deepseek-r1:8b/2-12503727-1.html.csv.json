    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all broadcast frequency in megahertz be in class d\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that for all broadcast frequencies listed in MHz, their corresponding station class is 'd'. So I need to check each row in the table and see if the frequency (MHz) column matches the class column as 'd'.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info.\n- There are 7 rows of data.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Frequency MHz: 93.5\n   - Class: 'd'\n   So this row supports the claim for frequency 93.5 MHz.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Frequency MHz: 107.5\n   - Class: 'd'\n   This also matches, supporting the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Frequency MHz: 103.9\n   - Class: 'd'\n   Matches again.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Frequency MHz: 100.5\n   - Class: 'd'\n   Another match.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Frequency MHz: 106.7\n   - Class: 'd'\n   This supports the claim.\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Frequency MHz: 93.3\n   - Class: 'd'\n   Matches.\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - Frequency MHz: 96.7\n   - Class: 'd'\n   Also matches.\n\nSince all rows where there is a frequency in MHz have their class as 'd', the claim seems to hold true across all applicable data points. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and all relevant cells are those where both 'frequency mhz' and 'class' columns exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"each call sign be unique to the frequency that be broadcast.\" So, for each call sign, it should correspond uniquely to one frequency.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns provided in the table: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info. The relevant columns here are \"call sign\" and \"frequency mhz\".\n\nI need to check if each call sign is unique for a given frequency. So, for each row, I'll note down the call sign and frequency.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: Call Sign - w228by, Frequency - 93.5\nRow 1: Call Sign - w298ak, Frequency - 107.5\nRow 2: Call Sign - w280du, Frequency - 103.9\nRow 3: Call Sign - w263bb, Frequency - 100.5\nRow 4: Call Sign - w294 am, Frequency - 106.7\nRow 5: Call Sign - w227bt, Frequency - 93.3\nRow 6: Call Sign - w244bd, Frequency - 96.7\n\nNow, I'll check if each frequency has only one call sign.\n\nLooking at Row 0 and Row 5:\n- Row 0: 93.5 MHz with w228by\n- Row 5: 93.3 MHz with w227bt\nThese are different frequencies (93.5 vs 93.3), so no conflict here.\n\nNext, I'll check for any duplicates or same frequency with different call signs.\n\nRow 6 has 96.7 MHz with w244bd. Does any other row have 96.7? Checking through all rows, it seems to be unique.\n\nLooking at Row 4: 106.7 MHz with w294 am. No other row has 106.7.\n\nSimilarly, Row 1: 107.5 is unique. Row 2: 103.9 is unique. Row 3: 100.5 is unique.\n\nSo, all frequencies in the table are unique, and each call sign is paired with a unique frequency.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because each call sign corresponds to exactly one frequency without any duplicates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because each call sign uniquely identifies a single frequency.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the ERP W have more value over 100 than under 100.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: there's a columns array with six elements\u2014call sign, frequency MHz, city of license, ERP W, class, FCC info. The data is an array of seven rows, each containing these attributes.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"ERP W\" column. So I need to focus on that column in each row. Let's list out the ERP W values from each row:\n\n1. 120\n2. 27\n3. 10\n4. 50\n5. 170\n6. 13\n7. 800\n\nNow, I need to check how many of these are over 100 and how many are under 100.\n\nLooking at the list:\n- The first value is 120: that's over 100.\n- Second is 27: under 100.\n- Third is 10: under 100.\n- Fourth is 50: under 100.\n- Fifth is 170: over 100.\n- Sixth is 13: under 100.\n- Seventh is 800: definitely over 100.\n\nSo, counting the over 100 values: rows 0 (120), 4 (170), and 6 (800). That's three instances where ERP W is over 100.\n\nUnder 100: rows 1 (27), 2 (10), 3 (50), 5 (13). That's four instances under 100.\n\nWait, the claim says that there are more values over 100 than under 100. But in this case, three over and four under. So actually, it's not true that ERP W has more over 100 than under. The opposite is almost happening\u2014more under 100.\n\nBut let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nRow 0: 120 \u2192 over\nRow 1:27\u2192under\nRow2:10\u2192under\nRow3:50\u2192under\nRow4:170\u2192over\nRow5:13\u2192under\nRow6:800\u2192over\n\nSo yes, three over and four under. So the claim is FALSE because more ERP W values are under 100 than over.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the ERP W have more value over 100 than under 100\" is true, we analyze the \"ERP W\" column in the provided table.\n\n- **Values Over 100**: \n  - Row 0: 120\n  - Row 4: 170\n  - Row 6: 800\n\n- **Total Over 100**: 3 instances.\n\n- **Values Under 100**:\n  - Row 1:27\n  - Row2:10\n  - Row3:50\n  - Row5:13\n\n- **Total Under 100**:4 instances.\n\nSince there are more values under 100 than over, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Florida be the only state that way - fm broadcast in\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim seems to suggest that Florida is unique in a specific aspect related to FM broadcasting. Looking at the table, it lists various radio stations with their call signs, frequencies, cities of license, ERP (effective radiated power), class, and FCC info.\n\nMy first step is to identify which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"fm broadcast in,\" so I'm thinking about columns like frequency MHz and city of license since those relate directly to the station's operations. But more importantly, I need to see if Florida is the only state listed or if other states are also present.\n\nLooking at the data, each row has a city of license. Let me list them out:\n1. Allapattah, Florida\n2. Fort Pierce, Florida\n3. Greenacres, Florida\n4. Okeechobee, Florida\n5. Tradition, Florida\n6. Port St Lucie, Florida\n7. Stuart, Florida\n\nSo all the cities listed are in Florida. That means all the FM broadcasts in this table are from Florida stations. Therefore, Florida is indeed the only state represented here.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"Florida be the only state that way.\" I should check if there are any other states in the data or not. Since all the entries are from Florida, it's correct to say Florida is the only state in this context.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be those that indicate the city of license for each station because they all belong to Florida. Each row has a \"city of license\" column, so each row's city of license is a relevant cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Florida is the sole state with FM broadcasts listed in the table.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"there be more frequency over 100.00 than under 100.00.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It's about the distribution of frequencies\u2014more are above 100 MHz than below. So I should look at each row and see whether their frequencies fall into either over 100 or under 100.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a columns array where \"frequency mhz\" is one of them. The data rows have numbers for this column. I need to check each frequency value against 100.00. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: 93.5 MHz. That's under 100.\n2. Row 1: 107.5 MHz. That's over 100.\n3. Row 2: 103.9 MHz. Over 100.\n4. Row 3: 100.5 MHz. Hmm, exactly 100.50. Wait, the claim says \"over 100.00.\" Is 100.5 considered over? Probably yes because it's more than 100. So this is over.\n5. Row 4: 106.7 MHz. Over 100.\n6. Row 5: 93.3 MHz. Under 100.\n7. Row 6: 96.7 MHz. Under 100.\n8. Wait, no\u2014the last row is 96.7, which is under.\n\nWait, let me count correctly:\n\nRow 0: 93.5 \u2013 under\nRow 1: 107.5 \u2013 over\nRow 2: 103.9 \u2013 over\nRow 3: 100.5 \u2013 over\nRow 4: 106.7 \u2013 over\nRow 5: 93.3 \u2013 under\nRow 6: 96.7 \u2013 under\n\nSo frequencies over 100 are in rows 1,2,3,4 (four instances), and under 100 are in rows 0,5,6 (three instances). \n\nThe claim is whether there are more frequencies over 100 than under. Here, four over vs three under. So yes, there are more over.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the data has exactly these numbers or if I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nRows:\n0:93.5 \u2013 under\n1:107.5 \u2013 over\n2:103.9 \u2013 over\n3:100.5 \u2013 over (since 100.5 > 100)\n4:106.7 \u2013 over\n5:93.3 \u2013 under\n6:96.7 \u2013 under\n\nYes, that's four over and three under.\n\nSo the claim is true because there are more frequencies over 100 than under. Now, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. Each row's frequency is a cell in \"frequency mhz\" column, so each relevant row's index and the column name.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include all rows where frequency > 100. So rows 1,2,3,4,6? Wait no: row 3 is 100.5, which is over, but row 6 is 96.7, which is under.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list each row's frequency:\n\nRow 0:93.5 \u2013 under\nRow1:107.5 \u2013 over (index 1)\nRow2:103.9 \u2013 over (index2)\nRow3:100.5 \u2013 over (index3)\nRow4:106.7 \u2013 over (index4)\nRow5:93.3 \u2013 under (index5)\nRow6:96.7 \u2013 under (index6)\n\nSo rows 1,2,3,4 have frequencies over 100, that's four rows. Rows 0,5,6 are under, three rows.\n\nTherefore, the number of over is higher than under.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Each row where frequency >100 is important because it contributes to the count.\n\nSo for each such row, I need their row_index and column name (\"frequency mhz\").\n\nThus, the relevant_cells will be:\n\n- Row 1 (index 1)\n- Row2 (index2)\n- Row3 (index3)\n- Row4 (index4)\n\nEach with column \"frequency mhz\".\n\nSo the JSON should include these four cells.\n\nWait, but in the table, data is an array of arrays. So each row is at index 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and relevant_cells are rows 1,2,3,4 for the frequency over 100.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are more frequencies over 100 MHz than under 100 MHz. After examining each row's \"frequency mhz\" column, we find that four frequencies (rows 1, 2, 3, and 4) exceed 100 MHz, while three do not (rows 0, 5, and 6). This confirms the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So this one is in Class D.\nRow 1: Frequency is 107.5 MHz, Class is \"d\".\nRow 2: 103.9 MHz, Class \"d\".\nRow 3: 100.5 MHz, Class \"d\".\nRow 4: 106.7 MHz, Class \"d\".\nRow 5: 93.3 MHz, Class \"d\".\nRow 6: 96.7 MHz, Class \"d\".\n\nFrom this, it's clear that every single frequency listed is classified as \"d\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"none of the call sign be unique to the frequency that be broadcast.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The term \"call sign\" refers to the identifier for a radio station, like \"w228by\". The \"frequency mhz\" is the operating frequency, such as 93.5 MHz. \n\nThe claim suggests that for every call sign in the table, there isn't a unique frequency associated with it. In other words, each call sign should not be tied exclusively to one frequency.\n\nLooking at the data, I see multiple entries with different call signs and frequencies. Each row has a unique combination of call sign and frequency. But does that mean any call sign is unique to its frequency?\n\nWait, the claim says \"none of the call sign be unique to the frequency.\" So for every call sign listed, it shouldn't be unique to just one frequency across all entries.\n\nBut each call sign appears only once in the table. So if a call sign appears only once, then that call sign is unique to that particular frequency. For example, \"w263bb\" has 100.5 MHz and doesn't appear again. If another call sign had the same frequency, it wouldn't be unique anymore.\n\nHowever, looking at the table, all frequencies are unique as well. Each row's frequency isn't repeated with any other call sign. So each combination is unique in terms of both call sign and frequency.\n\nBut the claim is about whether a call sign is unique to a frequency. If a call sign only appears once in the data, that would mean it's unique to that specific frequency. Therefore, if all call signs are unique to their frequencies (since they don't repeat), then the statement \"none of the call sign be unique to the frequency\" would be false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. The claim is stating that none of the call signs have a unique relationship with their frequency. But in reality, each call sign has only one associated frequency, making each call sign unique to its own frequency. So the statement is incorrect because actually, each call sign does have a unique frequency.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the erp w have less value over 100 than under 100",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the ERP W have less value over 100 than under 100\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to be comparing the ERP W values where the value is above 100 MHz versus those below 100 MHz. Specifically, it's asserting that the ERP W values are lower when they're over 100 than when they're under 100.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has a \"ERP W\" column with numerical values. My task is to check if this claim holds true based on these numbers.\n\nI'll start by extracting all the ERP W values from the table and categorize them into two groups: those above or equal to 100 and those below 100.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Row 0: 120\n- Row 1: 27\n- Row 2: 10\n- Row 3: 50\n- Row 4: 170\n- Row 5: 13\n- Row 6: 800\n\nNow, let's separate them:\n\nERP W >=100:\nRow 0: 120\nRow 4: 170\nRow 6: 800\n\nERP W <100:\nRow 1:27\nRow2:10\nRow3:50\nRow5:13\n\nSo, for the group above or equal to 100, the values are 120, 170, and 800.\n\nFor the group below 100, the values are 27, 10, 50, and 13.\n\nNow, the claim says that in the over 100 group, these ERP W have \"less value\" than those under 100. So, I need to check if each ERP W in the first group is less than each ERP W in the second group.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFirst group (>=100): 120,170,800\nSecond group (<100):27,10,50,13\n\nI'll compare each value from the first group with all values from the second group to see if they are indeed less.\n\nStarting with 120:\n- Compare 120 vs 27: 120 >27 \u2192 Doesn't satisfy \"less than\" condition.\n- 120 vs10: 120>10\n- 120 vs50: 120>50\n- 120 vs13: 120>13\n\nSo, for the first group's value of 120, it's greater than all in the second group. Therefore, this value doesn't support the claim.\n\nNext, 170:\n- 170 vs27: >27\n- 170 vs10: >10\n- 170 vs50: >50\n- 170 vs13: >13\n\nAgain, 170 is greater than all under 100 values. Doesn't satisfy the claim.\n\nNow, 800:\n- 800 vs27: >27\n- 800 vs10: >10\n- 800 vs50: >50\n- 800 vs13: >13\n\nSame here; 800 is much higher than all under 100 values.\n\nSo, none of the ERP W values in the over 100 group are less than any in the under 100 group. In fact, they're all greater. This means the claim that \"ERP W have less value over 100 than under 100\" is false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's a case where an over 100 ERP W might be less than some specific under 100 value, but since all over 100 are higher than any under 100, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the data provided. None of the ERP W values above or equal to 100 are less than those below 100; instead, they are all greater. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Maryland be the only state that way - fm broadcast in.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Maryland is the sole state where a certain type of FM broadcasting occurs. From the context of radio broadcasting, when someone refers to \"fm broadcast in,\" they're likely talking about an FM radio station. The term \"way\" might be vague here, but given the table has columns related to FM frequencies and licensing, it's probably referring to FM radio stations operating within Maryland.\n\nNow, looking at the table: it lists several entries with details like call sign, frequency in MHz, city of license, ERP W, class, and FCC info. The data is from various locations in Florida and one from Tradition, Florida, which might be near Maryland? Or maybe not. Wait, no, all the cities listed are in Florida except for one, but actually, looking closer:\n\nWait, the table only lists entries from Florida-based cities like Allapattah, Fort Pierce, Greenacres, Okeechobee, Tradition, Port St Lucie, and Stuart\u2014all in Florida. So none of these are from Maryland.\n\nThe claim says \"Maryland be the only state that way.\" If all FM broadcasts in those entries are licensed to cities in Florida, then does that mean there are no FM broadcasts in Maryland? Or is it implying something else?\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The claim could be saying that Maryland has the only such FM broadcast setup, meaning perhaps a specific type not present elsewhere. But looking at the table, all the entries are from different cities in Florida, each with their own call signs and frequencies.\n\nSo, the claim is about whether Maryland is the only state where this particular FM broadcasting occurs. The table shows multiple states are involved\u2014since all these entries are licensed to cities in Florida, but none in Maryland. So if the claim is that Maryland is the only one, that would be false because there are other states (like Florida) with such broadcasts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"way\" refers to a specific aspect not covered by the table's columns, like a unique class or ERP. But looking at the data:\n\nEach entry has \"class\" as \"d,\" which probably refers to a certain broadcasting class, perhaps AM or FM. Wait, no\u2014AM and FM classes are different. Class A is for higher power AM, etc. Maybe \"d\" here isn't about AM/FM but another classification.\n\nWait, the column names in the table include \"class,\" but the values are all \"d.\" So maybe that's a key factor. If the claim is referring to FM broadcasts with class \"d,\" then I need to see if Maryland has such stations or if others do too.\n\nLooking at the data: The entries have \"class\" as \"d,\" which might indicate that these are Class D FM stations, which typically have lower power and may be considered 'small' stations. So if the claim is stating that only Maryland does this, but in reality, all the listed stations are from Florida, not Maryland.\n\nTherefore, since none of the entries in the table relate to Maryland, and all are in Florida, the claim that Maryland is the only state with such FM broadcasts would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maryland is the only state with a specific type of FM broadcasting. However, examining the provided table shows that all entries are licensed to cities in Florida, not Maryland. Since none of the data pertains to Maryland, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be less frequency over 100.00 than under 100.0.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim means. It's comparing frequencies in two ranges: over 100.00 MHz and under 100.0 MHz. The statement is that there are fewer frequencies above 100 MHz compared to those below 100 MHz.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a radio station with details like call sign, frequency, city, ERP, etc. The relevant column here is \"frequency mhz.\" I need to check how many entries fall into each category: over 100.00 and under 100.0.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the frequencies from the table:\n\n1. 93.5\n2. 107.5\n3. 103.9\n4. 100.5\n5. 106.7\n6. 93.3\n7. 96.7\n8. 800\n\nNow, let's categorize each frequency:\n\n- Over 100.00 MHz: This would be frequencies greater than 100.0.\n  - 107.5 (above 100)\n  - 103.9 (above 100)\n  - 100.5 (exactly 100.5, which is over 100)\n  - 106.7 (over 100)\n  - 800 (way above 100)\n\nWait, but the cut-off seems to be at 100.0. So any frequency equal to or above 100.00 would fall into the \"over\" category.\n\nSo:\n\nOver 100.00:\n- 107.5\n- 103.9\n- 100.5\n- 106.7\n- 800\n\nUnder 100.0:\n- 93.5\n- 93.3\n- 96.7\n\nWait, 93.5 is under 100? Yes. Similarly for the others.\n\nNow, count how many are over and under.\n\nOver: Let's see each row:\n\nRow 0: 93.5 \u2192 Under\nRow 1: 107.5 \u2192 Over\nRow 2: 103.9 \u2192 Over\nRow 3: 100.5 \u2192 Over\nRow 4: 106.7 \u2192 Over\nRow 5: 93.3 \u2192 Under\nRow 6: 96.7 \u2192 Under\nRow 7: 800 \u2192 Over\n\nWait, that's 5 entries over and 3 under.\n\nSo the claim says there are less frequencies over than under. But here, over is more than under (5 vs 3). So the claim would be FALSE because it's not true that there are fewer over 100 than under 100; in fact, there are more over.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the rows:\n\nLooking back at the table data:\n\nRow 0: 93.5 \u2192 Under\nRow 1:107.5\u2192Over\nRow2:103.9\u2192Over\nRow3:100.5\u2192Over\nRow4:106.7\u2192Over\nRow5:93.3\u2192Under\nRow6:96.7\u2192Under\nRow7:800\u2192Over\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo over frequencies are 107.5,103.9,100.5,106.7,800 \u2192 5 entries.\n\nUnder: 93.5,93.3,96.7 \u2192 3 entries.\n\nThus, the claim says \"less frequency over 100.00 than under\" but in reality, there's more over, so it's FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me check if any frequencies are exactly at 100.0. In the table, I don't see any entry with exactly 100.0. The closest is 100.5 which is over.\n\nSo the count stands as 5 over and 3 under.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are more frequencies over 100 than under.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"},{\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"],[\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"],[\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"],[\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"]]}",
