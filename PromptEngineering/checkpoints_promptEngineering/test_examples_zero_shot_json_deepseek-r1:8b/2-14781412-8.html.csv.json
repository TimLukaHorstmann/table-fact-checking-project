    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games happen every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that equestrian events occur every four years starting from 1982 up until 2010, but they didn't happen in 1990.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the \"year\" column and each row represents a specific year with corresponding medalists. The \"location\" varies each year as well.\n\nI need to check if there's an event in every four years from 1982 onwards, skipping only 1990.\n\nLet me list out the years present in the table: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010. \n\nWait a minute, that's not consecutive fours. From 1982 to 1986 is four years, but then the next event is in 1994, which is a jump of two years from 1986 to 1994. So that skips 1990 as mentioned in the claim.\n\nThen 1994 to 1998 is also four years, so that's correct. Then 1998 to 2002 is again four years, then 2002 to 2006 is four, and finally 2006 to 2010 is four. So except for 1990, all the other years from 1982 to 2010 have events every four years.\n\nSo the claim seems correct because there's no event in 1990, which fits the exception mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant information is in the \"year\" column and possibly the \"location\" or other columns to confirm that each event happened in the specified locations during those years except for 1990.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be all rows where the year is either 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, or 2010. Also, since the claim mentions the location each time, maybe including that as well.\n\nSo for each of these years, I should include their row_index and column_name. Since \"year\" is the column in question, perhaps also checking the other columns might be necessary to confirm the event happened, but the main point is the years listed.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if equestrian events occurred every four years from 1982 to 2010 except for 1990. The table confirms this pattern.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Nadia Al-Moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. Each row represents a different year, with corresponding athletes for each medal category.\n\nI need to find if Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold in equestrian. So I should check the 'gold' column and see who that is each year. The first occurrence of someone named Nadia Al-Moutawaa would indicate if she's the first to do so.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 1982: Gold is Nadia Al-Moutawaa.\n- 1986: Takashi Tomura\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- 1998: Jin Kano\n- 2002: Mikaela Mar'ada Jaworski\n- 2006: Ali Yousof Al-Rumaihi\n- 2010: Ramzy Al-Duhami\n\nSo Nadia is the gold winner in 1982. That's the first year she appears, and there's no one else before her in the 'gold' column with that name. Therefore, she was indeed the first to win gold in equestrian at the Asian Games.\n\nNow, I should identify which cells are relevant. The row for 1982 is index 0, and the column is 'gold'.

It suggests that each year the Asian Games took place, the event was hosted in a new city. So, every subsequent year should have a different location from the previous ones.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists the years 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. The corresponding locations are New Delhi, Seoul, Hiroshima, Bangkok, Busan, Doha, and Guangzhou.\n\nI should check if each location is indeed different from the one before it.

So, the claim seems to hold true based on the table.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there are any breaks or repeats in the locations. From the list, all locations are unique and each is new compared to the prior year. There's no repetition, so the claim that each occurrence was in a different city every year stands.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be the entire 'location' column because each row's location needs to be checked.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have been different in every year they have occurred.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is asserting. It's suggesting that each year the Asian Games took place, a different person won the gold medal in equestrian. So, for each year listed, there should be a unique gold medalist.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, location, gold, silver, bronze. The data shows seven rows, each corresponding to a different Asian Games from 1982 to 2010. \n\nI need to check if the gold medalists are all different across these years. So I'll list out the gold medalists per row:\n\n1. 1982: nadia al - moutawaa\n2. 1986: takashi tomura\n3. 1994: konoshin kuwahara\n4. 1998: jin Kann\n5. 2002: mikaela marada jaworski\n6. 2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi\n7. 2010: ramzy al duhami\n\nNow, I can see that each of these names is distinct.

The table has information about various years, locations, and medalists in equestrian events.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's saying that equestrian events at the Asian Games occur every four years starting from 1982 up to 2010. So, I need to check if there are equestrian competitions listed in each of these years: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. The columns include \"year,\" \"location,\" \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze.\" Since we're focusing on equestrian events, I should look for any mention of medalists in these categories to confirm that the event took place each year.\n\nStarting with 1982: The first row has entries under \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze\" with names like Nadia Al-Moutawaa, Jamila Al-Moutawaa, etc. This indicates that equestrian events were held in 1982.\n\nNext, checking for each subsequent year:\n\n- 1986: The second row shows entries under the same medal categories, so equestrian events were likely held here as well.\n- 1994: Third row also has gold, silver, and bronze medalists listed. So, yes, equestrian events occurred in 1994.\n- 1998: Fourth row again lists medalists for these categories, confirming events in 1998.\n- 2002: Fifth row shows the same structure with medalists, so events took place that year.\n- 2006: Sixth row has entries for gold, silver, and bronze, indicating equestrian competitions were held.\n- 2010: The last row also lists these categories with medalists, confirming events in 2010.\n\nSo, all the years from 1982 to 2010 have equestrian medal listings.

Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time, in Seoul and Doha (and incheon, but that be only find elsewhere on the source page).\"\n\nSo, I need to check if South Korea is the only country mentioned in the table that has hosted the equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once. The relevant columns for this are \"location\" and \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\" perhaps? Wait, no, the main thing is the location and whether it's South Korea multiple times.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe table lists various years, locations, and names of medalists. The columns are year, location, gold, silver, bronze.\n\nI need to check if any other countries besides South Korea have hosted more than once in the equestrian events.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 1982 - New Delhi: Only one occurrence.\n2. 1986 - Seoul: This is South Korea's first hosting.\n3. 1994 - Hiroshima: First time.\n4. 1998 - Bangkok: First time.\n5. 2002 - Busan: First time.\n6. 2006 - Doha: First time.\n7. 2010 - Guangzhou: First time.\n\nWait, so the claim says South Korea hosted in Seoul and Doha, but looking at the table, Seoul is 1986 and Doha is 2006. Are these both South Korea?\n\nYes, because Seoul and Doha are locations where South Korea (South Korea's cities) have hosted. So South Korea has hosted twice: Seoul in 1986 and Doha in 2006.\n\nNow, the claim says \"the only country\" to host more than once. So I need to check if any other countries have done so beyond that.\n\nLooking at all the locations:\n\n- New Delhi (1982)\n- Seoul (1986, 2006)\n- Hiroshima (1994)\n- Bangkok (1998)\n- Busan (2002)\n- Doha (2006)\n- Guangzhou (2010)\n\nWait, Doha is 2006, which is South Korea again. So that's two times for South Korea.\n\nBut the table only shows these seven events. I don't see any other country hosting more than once in equestrian events.\n\nTherefore, South Korea is indeed the only country that has hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time (Seoul and Doha). So the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul and doha\". But looking back, Seoul is 1986 and Doha is 2006. Are those both South Korea? Yes, because Seoul is the capital of South Korea, and Doha is a city in Qatar, but wait, no\u2014Doha is the location for equestrian events in 2006. Wait, no, actually, in the table, each row's location is where the Asian Games were held. So in 1986, it was Seoul (South Korea), 2006 was Doha (Qatar). Wait, that would mean South Korea hosted in 1986 and 2006? No, wait: no, wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the claim says \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul and doha\". So it's saying that South Korea hosted in both Seoul and Doha. But looking at the table:\n\n- 1986: Seoul (South Korea)\n- 2006: Doha (Qatar)\n\nSo those are two different countries hosting, not South Korea twice. Oh, I see! That changes things.\n\nWait, so South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul), and then Qatar hosted in 2006 (Doha). So the claim is wrong because it's saying South Korea hosted in both Seoul and Doha. But Doha is in Qatar, not South Korea. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly attributes hosting to South Korea for Doha.\n\nSo I need to correct my earlier analysis. The relevant cells would be the rows where the location is Seoul (1986) and Doha (2006). But since these are different countries, South Korea only hosted once in 1986. Therefore, the claim's assertion that South Korea hosted twice is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that South Korea hosted both Seoul and Doha. Upon reviewing the table, South Korea hosted in Seoul (1986), while Doha was hosted by Qatar in 2006. Since the claim attributes both events to South Korea, it is FALSE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

She won gold in equestrian at the Asian Games.\n2. She also won silver another year.\n\nLooking at the table data, I'll search for any rows where \"Nadia Al-Moutawaa\" is listed under the 'gold' column because that's where she supposedly won gold. \n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0 (1982): Gold is Nadia Al-Moutawaa. So in 1982, she won gold.\n- Next, I need to see if she also won silver in another year.\n\nLooking at the 'silver' column for other years where she might have placed second. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0 (1982): Silver is Jamila Al-Moutawaa, not Nadia. So that's different.\nRow 1 (1986): Gold is Takashi Tomura, so no.\nRow 2 (1994): Gold is Konoshin Kuwahara, no.\nRow 3 (1998): No mention of Nadia in gold or silver.\nRow 4 (2002): Gold is Mikaela Maronada Jaworski, no.\nRow 5 (2006): Gold is Ali Yousof Al-Rumaihi, no.\nRow 6 (2010): Gold is Ramzy Al-Duhami, no.\n\nSo in the table, Nadia Al-Moutawaa only won gold in 1982. There's no record of her winning silver in any other year. Therefore, the claim that she was the first to win gold and also win silver another year isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not fully supported because the table shows Nadia Al-Moutawaa only won gold in 1982; there's no evidence she won silver in another year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games have been located in a different city every year that it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that each year the Asian Games were held, the event was hosted in a different city from the previous year, except for 1994 and 1998, where it stayed in the same city as the previous year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are seven rows of data, each representing a different year: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. Each row lists five columns: year, location, gold medalist, silver medalist, and bronze medalist.\n\nMy task is to check the locations each year to see if they are in different cities compared to the previous year, except for 1994 and 1998. \n\nLet me list out the years and their corresponding locations:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nNow, I need to check each consecutive pair of years to see if the location changed.\n\nStarting with 1982 to 1986: New Delhi to Seoul. Different cities, so that's okay because the claim allows for different locations except in two cases.\n\nNext, 1986 to 1994: Seoul to Hiroshima. Different again, which is fine as per the claim.\n\nNow comes 1994 to 1998: Hiroshima to Bangkok. Different cities, but according to the claim, this should not be a change because it's one of the exceptions (along with 1998). Wait, actually, 1994 is the starting point for an exception. Let me clarify: The claim says that except in 1994 and 1998, the location changes every year. So, 1994 is one of the two years where it doesn't change, meaning before 1994, locations were changing, but in 1994, perhaps it didn't change from the previous year, or maybe it's referring to that specific year being an exception.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to look at each pair and see if all except two have different locations. So, let me list all consecutive pairs:\n\n- 1982 vs 1986: Different\n- 1986 vs 1994: Different\n- 1994 vs 1998: Same? Let's check. Wait, the location in 1994 is Hiroshima and in 1998 is Bangkok. Are they the same city? No, so that would mean it did change, but according to the claim, 1994 and 1998 are exceptions where it doesn't change.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase: The claim says except for 1994 and 1998, every other year had a different location from the previous one. So in 1994 and 1998, the location didn't change compared to the prior year. Therefore, I need to check if those two years indeed did not have their locations changed.\n\nLooking at 1982: New Delhi\n\nThen 1986: Seoul (different)\n\n1986 to 1994: Hiroshima (different)\n\nNow, from 1994 to 1998: Is Bangkok the same as Hiroshima? No, so that would mean it changed, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, this suggests that either I'm misunderstanding or the data doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that in 1994 and 1998, the location remained the same as previous years (i.e., not changing from the prior year). So, for example, if 1994 was held in a city that had hosted it before, but according to the table, 1994's location is Hiroshima, which hadn't been used before in the Asian Games. The previous one was Seoul in 1986, so it's a change.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because the locations didn't always change except for those two years. But looking at the data:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul (change)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (change from 1986)\n- 1998: Bangkok (change from 1994)\nWait, that's a problem because according to the claim, 1994 and 1998 should not have changed, but in reality, they did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that the Asian Games were held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998. So meaning that in those two years, the location remained the same as before, but looking at the data:\n\n- From 1982 to 1986: Changed\n- 1986 to 1994: Changed\n- 1994 to 1998: Changed (Hiroshima to Bangkok)\nWait, so that's a change, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it means that every year except 1994 and 1998, the location was different from the prior year. So in those two years, it stayed in the same city as before.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- After 1982 (New Delhi), next is 1986 (Seoul): changed\n- After 1986 (Seoul), next is 1994 (Hiroshima): changed\n- After 1994 (Hiroshima), next is 1998: If it's supposed to not change, but in reality, it did. So the claim would be false because in 1998, it should have stayed in Hiroshima, but it went to Bangkok.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the years. Let me list all the locations with their respective years:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nNow, checking each pair:\n\n- 1982 to 1986: Different (okay)\n- 1986 to 1994: Different (okay)\n- 1994 to 1998: Different (not okay if the claim is that only 1994 and 1998 are exceptions)\nWait, perhaps the two exceptions are years where it didn't change from the prior year. So in 1994, maybe it was held in the same city as a previous Asian Games? But according to the table, 1982, 1986, etc., all have different locations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that every year except for 1994 and 1998, the location changed from the prior year. So in those two years, it didn't change.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 1982 to 1986: Changed\n- 1986 to 1994: Changed (from Seoul to Hiroshima)\nBut according to the claim, 1994 should not have a change, meaning it stayed in the same city as before. But from 1986 to 1994, it's a change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two exceptions are that in those years, the location was the same as two years prior? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to check each pair:\n\n- After 1982: 1986 (change)\n- After 1986: 1994 (change)\n- After 1994: 1998 (change) \u2192 but claim says only 1994 and 1998 are exceptions, meaning in those years it didn't change. So this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be incorrect because the data shows that locations changed even in those two years. Therefore, the answer would be that the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the exceptions. Maybe the exception is that only 1994 and 1998 had the same location as their previous year, meaning they didn't change. But according to the data:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul (change)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (change from 1986)\n- 1998: Bangkok (change from 1994)\n\nSo in all these cases, locations changed except for potentially within the exception years.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the claim is that the Asian Games were held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998, where they stayed in the same city as the previous year.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul (changed)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (changed from 1986)\n- 1998: Bangkok (changed from 1994)\n\nSo in none of these two years did it stay in the same city as previous. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Maybe the exceptions are that in 1994 and 1998, they didn't change compared to their immediate previous years. But looking at the data:\n\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima (changed)\n- 1998: Bangkok (changed from 1994)\n\nSo no, it did change.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the Asian Games were held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998 is false because even those two years had changes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Asian Games were held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998 is incorrect based on the provided data. In each of the mentioned years, including 1994 and 1998, the location changed from the previous year's host city.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because the Asian Games did not remain in the same city for both 1994 and 1998 as their immediate predecessor events; each year saw a change in location.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul twice.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if there's a column that mentions countries or locations where the Asian Games were held. Looking at the table's columns, I see 'location'. That's relevant because it lists the host cities.\n\nNext, I need to look into the 'data' rows for specific instances of South Korea hosting. The data shows each row has a year, location, and names which might be athletes or winners, but the location is key here. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: 1982, \"new delhi\" \u2013 not Seoul.\nRow 2: 1986, \"seoul\" \u2013 South Korea as host? Wait, actually, each row's location is the host city. So in 1986, Seoul hosted. The claim says Seoul hosted twice, so I need to check if Seoul appears more than once.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n1982: new delhi\n1986: seoul\n1994: hiroshima\n1998: bangkok\n2002: busan\n2006: doha\n2010: guangzhou\n\nSo Seoul is only mentioned once, in 1986. The claim says they hosted more than once, specifically twice in Seoul. That's not true because there's only one instance where Seoul was the host.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. Now, I need to find which cells are relevant. The 'location' column is relevant because it lists each host city. Each row's location should be checked for being Seoul or another country.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be all rows where the location is \"seoul\" to check if there's more than one occurrence. But since there's only one, that row (index 1) is the only relevant cell in the 'location' column. Also, maybe checking the year could be relevant because it's about multiple hosts over time, but the claim doesn't specify years.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about being the only country to host equestrian more than once, so the key columns are 'year' and 'location'. So for each occurrence where location is Seoul, I should note their row indices in the location column.\n\nBut since there's only one instance of Seoul, that's the only relevant cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because South Korea hosted the Asian Games only once in Seoul. The relevant cell is the location of the 1986 event.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" So, it's suggesting that each year, the gold medalist was a different person, except for 1994 and 1998 where maybe someone who had won before might have won again.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the years covered are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. The \"gold\" column lists the names of the medalists for each year. To check the claim, I need to verify if, except for 1994 and 1998, all other years have unique gold medalists who didn't repeat.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the gold medalists by year:\n\n1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n1986: Takashi Tomura\n1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n1998: Jin Kano\n2002: Mikaela Maroney\n2006: Ali Youssuf Al-Rumaihi\n2010: Ramzy Al-Duhami\n\nNow, checking for repetitions:\n\n- 1982: Only occurrence.\n- 1986: Only occurrence.\n- 1994: Only occurrence.\n- 1998: Only occurrence.\n- 2002: Only occurrence.\n- 2006: Only occurrence.\n- 2010: Only occurrence.\n\nWait a minute, all the gold medalists in different years are unique. So there's no repetition except perhaps if any name repeats in non-consecutive years. Let me double-check each year:\n\nLooking at each row's gold column:\n\n1982 - Nadia\n1986 - Takashi\n1994 - Konoshin\n1998 - Jin\n2002 - Mikaela\n2006 - Ali\n2010 - Ramzy\n\nNo names repeat here. So the claim says that except 1994 and 1998, all other years have different medalists. But according to this data, even in 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists are unique and haven't repeated in any year. Therefore, the claim is false because it claims there's a repetition except for those two years, but actually, there's no repetition at all.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" So perhaps implying that in those two years, the same person might have won again. But looking at the table, each gold medalist is unique across all years listed.\n\nSo for example, Nadia from 1982 didn't win again later, Takashi only in 1986, etc. So actually, there are no repeats except maybe if a participant from 1994 or 1998 also won earlier, but looking at the names:\n\nNadia was in 1982 only.\nTakashi only in 1986.\nKonoshin only in 1994.\nJin only in 1998.\nMikaela only in 2002.\nAli only in 2006.\nRamzy only in 2010.\n\nNo overlaps. So the claim is incorrect because it suggests that only 1994 and 1998 had new medalists, but actually, every year had a unique gold medalist. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The claim talks about the gold medalist each year, so I need to find all the rows where \"gold\" is mentioned. Looking at the table structure, each row has a \"gold\" entry in the second column (index 1). So for each row, the relevant cell is the \"gold\" column.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be each row's gold column data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that except for 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists differ every year. However, upon reviewing the table, all gold medalists are unique across years, meaning there are no repetitions. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
