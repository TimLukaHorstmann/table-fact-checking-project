    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"artist maggie toal have draw 7 for the song fee him with love.\" So, the claim is stating that Maggie Toal has a draw number of 7 for a song titled \"feed him with love.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: draw, artist, song, points, place. The data rows have these attributes for each entry.\n\nI need to find if there's an entry where the artist is Maggie Toal, the draw number is 7, and the song is \"feed him with love.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Draw=1, Artist=\"the memories\", Song=\"if it means losing you\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Draw=2, Artist=\"ann breen\", Song=\"oh , darling\" \u2192 No.\nRow 2: Draw=3, Artist=\"fran meen\", Song=\"say that you love me\" \u2192 No.\nRow 3: Draw=4, Artist=\"dreams\", Song=\"sin sin (that 's that)\" \u2192 No.\nRow 4: Draw=5, Artist=\"connor stevens\", Song=\"count on me\" \u2192 No.\nRow 5: Draw=6, Artist=\"linda martin and friends\", Song=\"all the people in the world\" \u2192 No.\nRow 6: Draw=7, Artist=\"maggie toal\", Song=\"feed him with love\" \u2192 Yes! This matches all criteria.\nRow 7: Draw=8, Artist=\"liam reilly\", Song=\"somewhere in europe\" \u2192 No.\n\nSo, there is exactly one row that satisfies the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones where draw is 7, artist is Maggie Toal, song is \"feed him with love.\" Looking at the table, these correspond to row index 6.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should list each column for that row: draw (7), artist (\"maggie toal\"), song (\"feed him with love\"). But wait, the instruction says each relevant cell is an object with row_index and column_name. So, I need to extract which columns are part of the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions \"artist maggie toal,\" so that's the 'artist' column. It also specifies \"draw 7\" for the song, so 'draw' and 'song' are relevant. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index=6, column_name=\"draw\"\n- row_index=6, column_name=\"artist\"\n- row_index=6, column_name=\"song\"\n\nWait, but in the example given, each relevant cell is a single column. So maybe I should list all three columns? Or perhaps just the ones that directly match. The claim refers to artist, draw number, and song title.\n\nSo, yes, all three columns are relevant because they are the specific data points being checked in the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include 'draw', 'artist', and 'song' from row 6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
