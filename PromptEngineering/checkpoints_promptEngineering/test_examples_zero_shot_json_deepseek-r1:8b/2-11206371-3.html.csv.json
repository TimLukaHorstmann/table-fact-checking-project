    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true based on the table provided. The claim says two things: first, that paddock's last appearance was in \"Blood Is Thicker Than Water,\" and second, that red squirrel's last appearance was in \"A Hero's Welcome.\"\n\nLet me start by looking for Paddock in the table. I'll go through each row one by one until I find a reference to Paddock.\n\nLooking at Row 25: \"Paddock\" is listed with their last appearance as \"Blood Is Thicker Than Water\" (2x12). That matches the first part of the claim. So that's good, it seems true so far.\n\nNow, for red squirrel. I need to find where Red Squirrels are mentioned. Row 27 talks about red squirrels, stating their last appearance was in \"A Hero's Welcome\" (2x01). That lines up with the second part of the claim. So that also checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't any other entries for red squirrel or paddock that might change this. For Paddock, I see Row 25 is the only one mentioning their last appearance in \"Blood Is Thicker Than Water.\" And for red squirrels, it's definitely Row 27 stating their last appearance as \"A Hero's Welcome.\"\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. For Paddock, that's row 25 and column \"Blood Is Thicker Than Water.\" And for red squirrel, it's row 27 and column \"A Hero's Welcome.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones from rows 25 and 27, specifically the columns mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Blood Is Thicker Than Water\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"A Hero's Welcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the male bounder book be no\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"the male bounder book be no\" seems a bit unclear at first glance, so I'll try to parse it. It might be referring to whether there's a male bounder that has a specific attribute or status, and that this attribute shouldn't exist (\"be no\"). \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an entity (like \"the edible frogs,\" \"red squirrels,\" etc.), and each column seems to represent different attributes. The columns I can see from the example include things like \"Species,\" \"Status,\" \"Type,\" \"Number of Individuals,\" and maybe others.\n\nThe term \"bounder\" isn't immediately clear, but in some contexts, it might refer to an animal that bounds or leaps, which could be a category within the table. Alternatively, it might be a specific entity listed in one of the rows.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to find any relevant information about \"male bounder.\" Starting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: \"the edible frogs\" - Doesn't seem related.\n- Row 1: \"red squirrels\" - Doesn't mention anything specific about males or a category called \"bounder.\"\n- Row 2: \"stoat\" - Only mentions \"stoat\" and doesn't reference \"male bounder.\"\n- Row 3: \"blaze\" - Probably refers to an individual fox named Blaze, but no mention of \"bounder\" or male status.\n- Continuing down, I notice a row labeled \"the white deer park voles\" (Row 30) and \"the large town rat\" (Row 31), neither seems related. \n\nWait, there's a row labeled \"the male bounder\" which is actually Row 10. This row has species as \"bounder,\" and the status might be relevant. Let me check that row more carefully.\n\nIn Row 10: \n- Species: bounder\n- Status: yes (I think this means they do exist)\n- Type: no (other animals appear, so maybe it's not exclusively a bounder)\n- Number of Individuals: both\n- Other columns like \"Group\" and \"Behavior\" might be relevant.\n\nSo, the row for \"the male bounder\" exists. The status is marked as \"yes,\" which likely means that males of this species are present or considered. Therefore, the statement \"the male bounder book be no\" would imply that there should not be a male bounder, but according to Row 10, they do exist. \n\nTherefore, the claim seems to contradict the information in the table because the male bounders do exist as per the data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Status\"}]}",
