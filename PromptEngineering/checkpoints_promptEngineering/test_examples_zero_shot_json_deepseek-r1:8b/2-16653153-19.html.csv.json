    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about basketball games with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The claim in question is: \"On December 4, a game was played at the North Shore Event Centre.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any data in the table related to December 4. Looking at the table, each row has a date column. Scanning through the dates provided: 3 december, 4 december, 5 december, 6 december (twice), and 7 december. So December 4 is definitely one of the rows.\n\nNext, I should look at which columns are relevant for verifying the claim. The claim mentions both the date and the venue. Therefore, I need to check the row where the date is December 4 and see what the venue was for that game.\n\nLooking at the data rows again, the second row (row index 1) has the date as \"4 december.\" The corresponding venue for this row is listed as \"north shore events centre.\"\n\nNow, comparing this with the claim: it says the venue was the North Shore Event Centre. Wait a minute, there's a slight difference in capitalization\u2014\"North Shore Event Centre\" versus \"north shore events centre.\" I wonder if that matters. In real life, venue names might have consistent capitalization, but here both are written as such. Assuming they're referring to the same place, regardless of case, it's still a match.\n\nSo, both the date and the venue in the claim correspond correctly with the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The row index where December 4 occurs is 1. The relevant columns are \"date\" and \"venue.\" So the relevant_cells would include the row index (1) for both those columns.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells pointing to row 1 in the date and venue columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the table's December 4 entry, which matches the date and venue specified. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the game at the north shore event centre be play on december 4\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions a game taking place at the North Shore Event Centre on December 4th. So, my task is to check if such a game exists in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The data rows contain specific information about each game.\n\nI'll start by checking the \"venue\" column because the claim mentions the North Shore Event Centre. Scanning through the venues in the table:\n\n- Row 0: win entertainment centre\n- Row 1: north shore events centre\n- Row 2: cairns convention centre\n- Row 3: distinctive homes dome\n- Row 4: townsville entertainment centre\n- Row 5: hisense arena\n- Row 6: gold coast convention centre\n\nI see that the venue \"north shore event centre\" is present in row 1. Now, I need to check if this game was indeed played on December 4th.\n\nLooking at row 1, the date is \"4 december\". The home team is \"new zealand breakers\", and the away team is \"townsville crocodiles\". The score is \"88 - 104\", which seems correct for a basketball game. The venue is \"north shore events centre\", matching the claim.\n\nSo, all details in row 1 match the claim: date, venue, teams involved, and a valid score are present. Therefore, this specific game did take place on December 4th at North Shore Event Centre.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or missing information that would contradict the claim. The relevant cells to check are the \"venue\" and \"date\" columns for row 1.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's a game at the North Shore Event Centre on December 4th. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 1** has the venue as \"north shore events centre\" and the date as \"4 december\".\n- The score and teams align correctly with other details in the row.\n\nThus, all information in Row 1 supports the claim fully.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"On December 4, a game was played at the distinctive home dome event center.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table data to see if there's any information related to games played on December 4th and the venue mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The data rows contain specific details for each game. \n\nI'll start by checking if there's a row where the date is December 4. Scanning through each row: the first row is Dec 3, second is Dec 4. So row index 1 (since it starts from 0) has the date \"4 december\". That matches the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check the venue column for that row. The data says \"north shore events centre\" for December 4th game. Now, the claim mentions \"distinctive home dome event center.\" These venues don't match exactly. The claim's venue is a combination of two names: distinctive home and dome event center, but in the table, it's just \"north shore events centre.\" \n\nSo the venue doesn't fully match the claim. Therefore, even though there was a game on December 4th, it wasn't at the specific venue mentioned in the claim. \n\nI should also verify if any other rows might have a date of December 4, but from the table, only one row matches that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table data because while there was a game on Dec 4th, it wasn't at the venue stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a game on December 4 at \"distinctive home dome event center.\" The table shows a game on that date at \"north shore events centre,\" which doesn't match. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the match play on december 4 record a score of 102 - 94 with north shore event centre as its venue.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about a match that happened on December 4th. The score was 102-94 in favor of one team, and the venue was North Shore Event Centre.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see it has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The data is given in rows corresponding to each day.\n\nI need to find the row for December 4th because that's when the match took place. So I'll scan through each row until I find the one with \"4 december\" as the date.\n\nOnce I locate the correct row, I'll check each relevant piece of information from the claim against this row.\n\nStarting with the date: In the data, the second row (row index 1) is for December 4th. So that's where the match happened. That means the row_index is 1 and column_name is \"date.\"\n\nNext, the score mentioned in the claim is \"102 - 94.\" I need to see what the score was on that day. In the same row (row index 1), the \"score\" column has \"88 - 104\". Wait, that's not matching because the claim says 102-94. That seems different.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. The second row is:\n\n[\n  \"4 december\",\n  \"new zealand breakers\",\n  \"88 - 104\",\n  \"townsville crocodiles\",\n  \"north shore events centre\",\n  \"box score\",\n  \"-\"\n]\n\nSo the home team is New Zealand Breakers, away team Townsville Crocodiles, and the score is 88-104. The venue is North Shore Events Centre.\n\nThe claim states the score was 102-94 with the same venue. So there's a discrepancy in the score. That would mean the claim is false because the actual score on December 4th was 88-104, not 102-94.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me confirm again. The row for December 4th has a score of \"88 - 104.\" So that's home team's points minus away team's. Therefore, the claim's score doesn't match, which would mean the answer is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, the venue in the table is indeed North Shore Events Centre, so that part matches. But since the score doesn't match, the entire claim is false.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row_index 1 (December 4th) for date and venue.\nBut wait, the score is also a relevant cell because it's different from what's claimed.\n\nWait, the instructions say to include all relevant cells that verify or refute the claim. So since the claim has two parts: score and venue. The venue matches, so the venue cell is relevant, but the score doesn't match, making the overall claim false.\n\nSo in terms of relevant cells for verification, we have:\n\n- row 1 (December 4th), columns date and venue.\n- row 1, column score because it's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The task is to check each condition in the claim against the table. So the two conditions are: score and venue.\n\nSo, for the score part, we look at the score column in the relevant row. For the venue, we look at the venue column.\n\nTherefore, both columns need to be checked because they are part of the claim. The date is not directly a condition but the match happened on that date, so perhaps it's necessary too? Or maybe just verifying that there was a match on that day with those other details.\n\nI think for thoroughness, I should include all relevant cells that help verify or contradict the claim. So:\n\n- row_index 1 (December 4th)\n- columns: date, score, venue\n\nBecause the claim includes both the score and venue along with the date. So all three pieces of information are being claimed.\n\nSo in the table, for December 4th, the score is 88-104, not 102-94. The venue is correct as North Shore Events Centre. Therefore, while part of the claim is true (venue), another part is false (score), making the entire claim false.\n\nThus, I need to mark the answer as FALSE and include all relevant cells that check these parts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes three pieces: date, score, and venue. The table confirms the correct date and venue but shows a different score than what's claimed. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",
