    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the player with 66 points have the first place.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table and see if there's a player with exactly 66 points and check their position. The table has several columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. \n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- The first row has a score of 66. So that's the only row where the score is 66.\n- The \"place\" for this row is listed as \"1\", which means they're in first place.\n- The player's name here is Kenny Perry.\n\nSo, Kenny Perry has a score of 66 and is in first place. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nI should also check if there are any other players with 66 points to see if someone else might be in first place, but from the data provided, only Kenny Perry has 66. All others have higher scores or tied at lower positions like t2, t4, etc.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe player with a score of 66 is Kenny Perry, who is listed as first place (1). \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"Phil Mickelson from the United States have a score of 67.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row in the data corresponds to a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions Phil Mickelson, so I need to find his row in the table. Looking through the 'player' column, there's a row where the player is \"Phil Mickelson\". That should be the third entry (index 2 since we start counting from 0).\n\nNow, checking the score for Phil Mickelson: according to the data, it's 67. So that part matches. The country is also listed as \"united states,\" which aligns with the claim stating he's from the United States.\n\nSo the claim is true because all the relevant information in the table supports it. \n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells. Since we're looking at Phil Mickelson's row, the relevant columns are 'player' and 'score'. So their respective row indices are 2 for player and 2 for score.\n\nWait, no, actually, each column in the row is separate. So each relevant cell corresponds to the specific data point in that row. So for the player, it's column \"player\" at row index 2. For the score, it's column \"score\" at row index 2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are two: one for the player name and one for the score.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Phil Mickelson from the United States has a score of 67, we check the table. The third entry (row index 2) lists his score as 67 in the \"score\" column and his country as \"united states\" in the \"country\" column.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Phil Mickelson's row for player (row index 2, column \"player\").\n- Phil Mickelson's score (row index 2, column \"score\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"t2 be the place for a 66 score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the position \"t2\" corresponds to a score of 66 in the table. So I need to check if there's any row where the \"place\" column has \"t2\" and the \"score\" is 66.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: place, player, country, score, to par. Each row represents a player with their respective details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: place is \"1\", score is 66.\n2. Row 1: place is \"t2\", score is 67.\n3. Row 2: place is \"t2\", score is 67.\n4. Rows 3-9 have places like \"t4\" and scores ranging from 68 to 68.\n\nSo, for the first row (row_index 0), the place is \"1\" and score is 66. The claim says \"t2 be the place for a 66 score,\" so this row isn't relevant because the place is not t2.\n\nNext, rows 1 and 2: both have place as \"t2\", but their scores are 67 each. The claim specifically mentions a score of 66, not 67. Therefore, these rows don't support the claim either.\n\nRows 3-9: All have place as \"t4\" except some, but none have a score of 66. So they're irrelevant.\n\nWait, looking again at row 0, it's \"1\", which isn't t2, and scores 66. There are no rows with both place \"t2\" and score 66.\n\nSo the claim is saying that in the table, the position t2 corresponds to a score of 66. But checking each row, there's no such occurrence. The t2 positions have higher scores (67) instead.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there isn't any data point where place is t2 and score is 66.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that \"t2\" corresponds to a 66 score. However, reviewing each row shows that \"t2\" places have scores of 67, not 66. Thus, the claim is unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"the united state have a 67 score by greg norman.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part of the claim means.\n\n1. **\"the united state\"**: This seems to refer to a country named \"United State.\" Wait, but in the table, there's a column called \"country\" with entries like \"united states,\" which is singular, and \"australia,\" etc. So I think it's possible that the claim refers to the \"country\" column, perhaps looking for a match where the country is \"United States.\"\n\n2. **\"have a 67 score\"**: Looking at the table, there's a \"score\" column with values like 66, 67, 68, etc. So we need to check if any player from the United States has a score of 67.\n\n3. **\"by greg norman\"**: There's a player named \"greg norman\" in the table. So we're looking for Greg Norman from the United States with a score of 67.\n\nNow, let me look through the table to find relevant cells.\n\nStarting with the data rows:\n\n- First row: place=1, player=kenny perry, country=united states, score=66, to par=-6.\n- Second row: t2, steve elkington, australia, 67, -5.\n- Third row: t2, phil mickelson, united states, 67, -5.\n- Fourth row: t4, mark brooks, united states, 68, -4.\n- Fifth row: t4, russ cochran, united states, 68, -4.\n- Sixth row: t4, joel edwards, united states, 68, -4.\n- Seventh row: t4, lee janzen, united states, 68, -4.\n- Eighth row: t4, greg norman, australia, 68, -4. Wait, here Greg Norman is listed as from Australia with a score of 68.\n- Ninth row: t4, nick price, zimbabwe, 68, -4.\n- Tenth row: t4, ian woosnam, wales, 68, -4.\n\nSo in the table, Greg Norman's country is Australia. That means he isn't from the United States as per the claim. Also, his score is 68, not 67.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Looking back:\n\n- In row 2: steve elkington is from Australia with a 67.\n- Row 3: phil mickelson is from the US with a 67, but he's not Greg Norman.\n- So Greg Norman isn't in the US with a 67.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the united state have a 67 score by greg norman\" is false because Greg Norman is from Australia and his score is 68. There's no entry in the table where Greg Norman is from the United States with a score of 67.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Greg Norman is listed as being from Australia, not the United States, and he has a score of 68, not 67.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
