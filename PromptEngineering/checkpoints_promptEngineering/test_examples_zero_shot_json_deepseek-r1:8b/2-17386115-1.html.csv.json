    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should locate where \"ken irvin\" is mentioned in the table. Looking at the data rows:\n\nRow 0: [\"1\", \"14\", \"ruben brown\", \"guard\", \"pittsburgh\"]\nRow 1: [\"2\", \"45\", \"todd collins\", \"quarterback\", \"michigan\"]\nRow 2: [\"3\", \"76\", \"marlon kerner\", \"defensive back\", \"ohio state\"]\nRow 3: [\"3\", \"96\", \"damien covington\", \"linebacker\", \"north carolina state\"]\nRow 4: [\"4\", \"109\", \"ken irvin\", \"defensive back\", \"memphis\"]\nRow 5: [\"4\", \"113\", \"justin armour\", \"wide receiver\", \"stanford\"]\nRow 6: [\"4\", \"131\", \"tony cline\", \"tight end\", \"stanford\"]\nRow 7: [\"5\", \"144\", \"john holecek\", \"linebacker\", \"illinois\"]\nRow 8: [\"6\", \"185\", \"shannon clavelle\", \"defensive tackle\", \"colorado\"]\nRow 9: [\"7\", \"221\", \"tom n\u00fcckten\", \"center\", \"western michigan\"]\nRow 10: [\"7\", \"244\", \"darick holmes\", \"running back\", \"portland state\"]\n\nI see that \"ken irvin\" is in row index 4, which is the fifth element (since rows start at 0). So row_index is 4.\n\nNow, looking at the columns: round, pick, player, position, school/club team.\n\nThe claim mentions \"fourth round\", so I should check the 'round' column for that row. In row 4, the value under 'round' is 4. That matches the fourth round.\n\nNext part: \"be drag\". Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo or unclear phrasing. It could be \"be drafted\" instead of \"dragged.\" So perhaps the claim is trying to say that Ken Irvin was drafted in the fourth round.\n\nLooking at the data, row 4 has 'ken irvin' as the player, and under 'round', it's 4. So this supports that he was drafted (assuming 'pick' number refers to draft pick order) in the fourth round.\n\nSo all parts of the claim seem supported: Ken Irvin is in the fourth round, and assuming \"drag\" was meant to say \"drafted,\" that also checks out.\n\nI should note which cells are relevant. The key columns here are 'round' and possibly 'pick', but since the claim only mentions the round, I'll include the 'round' column for row 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's another Ken Irvin? Looking through all players:\n\nRow 0: ruben brown\nRow1: todd collins\nRow2: marlon kerner\nRow3: damien covington\nRow4: ken irvin\nRow5: justin armour\nRow6: tony cline\nRow7: john holecek\nRow8: shannon clavelle\nRow9: tom n\u00fcckten\nRow10: darick holmes\n\nNo, only one Ken Irvin in row 4. So that's the only relevant cell.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are for round in row 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is true, I first locate where \"ken irvin\" appears in the table. He is found in row index 4 with a 'round' value of 4. This confirms he was drafted in the fourth round. The term \"drag\" likely refers to being drafted, making the claim supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"in 1st round , ken irvin be draft\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two things: the first round and Ken Irvin being drafted. So I need to check if there's a player named Ken Irvin who was drafted in the first round.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different draft pick with various details. The columns are \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"school / club team\". \n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's a player named Ken Irvin in the first round. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Round 1, Pick 14, Player Ruben Brown. Not Ken.\n- Row 1: Round 2, so not first round. Todd Collins is here.\n- Row 2: Round 3, Marlon Kerner. No.\n- Row 3: Also Round 3, Damien Covington. Not him.\n- Row 4: This row catches my attention because the player's name is Ken Irvin. Let me check the numbers. Round is 4, pick 109. So it's in the fourth round, not first. Therefore, Ken Irvin was drafted in the 4th round, not 1st.\n- The other rows don't mention Ken Irvin either.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are multiple entries for Ken Irvin or any typo. Looking again at the \"player\" column:\n- Row 0: Ruben Brown\n- Row 1: Todd Collins\n- Row 2: Marlon Kerner\n- Row 3: Damien Covington\n- Row 4: Ken Irvin\n- Rows after that don't have him either.\n\nSo, Ken Irvin was indeed drafted in the fourth round, not the first. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 4th round player from michigan select\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking for.\n\nFirst, breaking down the claim: It mentions \"4th round,\" which refers to the draft round number, probably in the NFL since we're dealing with players and positions common there. Then it specifies a player from Michigan. So I need to look into the table for any entries that fit this description.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"round,\" \"pick,\" \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"school / club team.\" Each row represents a different draft pick with details about the player.\n\nMy goal is to find rows where the round is 4 (since it's the 4th round) and the school or team listed is Michigan. Then, check if such a player exists in the data provided.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: Round 1, Pick 14, Player Ruben Brown, Position Guard, School Pittsburgh. Not round 4 and not from Michigan.\n2. Second row: Round 2, Pick 45, Todd Collins, QB, Michigan. This is round 2, so doesn't match the claim which specifies 4th round.\n3. Third row: Round 3, Pick 76, Marlon Kerner, Defensive Back, Ohio State. Not round 4 and not Michigan.\n4. Fourth row: Round 3 again? Wait, no\u2014looking closely, this is actually round 3 with pick 96, but wait, that's incorrect because the initial data shows for round 3, pick 76 and then another entry with round 3, pick 96. So it seems like there are two picks in round 3. But regardless, not round 4 and Michigan.\n5. Fifth row: Round 4, Pick 109, Ken Irvin, Defensive Back, Memphis. Round is 4 but school is Memphis, not Michigan.\n6. Sixth row: Round 4, Pick 113, Justin Armour, Wide Receiver, Stanford. Again, round 4 but not Michigan.\n7. Seventh row: Round 4 again with pick 131, Tony Cline, Tight End, Stanford. Same issue\u2014school isn't Michigan.\n8. Eighth row: Round 5, Pick 144, John Holecek, Linebacker, Illinois. Not round 4 and not Michigan.\n9. Ninth row: Round 6, Pick 185, Shannon Clavelle, Defensive Tackle, Colorado. Not relevant.\n10. Tenth row: Round 7, Pick 221, Tom Nutten, Center, Western Michigan. Wait, Western Michigan is in Michigan. But round is 7, so not 4.\n\nEleventh row: Round 7 again, Darick Holmes, Running Back, Portland State. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo after going through all the rows, I don't see any entry where the round is 4 and the school or team is Michigan. The closest is Todd Collins in round 2 from Michigan, but that's not the 4th round as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, there's no data supporting the claim \"in 4th round player from michigan select.\" So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any data in the table. There are no entries where a player was selected in the 4th round from Michigan.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
