    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the penguin and blue game on march 6 have an attendance of 9092.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's about a specific game involving the Penguins and the Blues that happened on March 6th. The key points are:\n- Home team is either Penguins or Blues (I need to figure this out)\n- Attendance was 9092\n- Date is March 6\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, and points.\n\nI should look for rows where:\n1. The date is March 6.\n2. One of the teams is Penguins and the other is Blues (since the claim mentions both as participants).\n3. The attendance matches 9092.\n\nFirst step: Find the row with March 6th. Scanning through, I see that the second row in the data array has \"march 6\" as the date.\n\nNext, check which teams played on that day. The visitor is \"penguins\" and the home team is \"blues\". So yes, both Penguins and Blues were involved.\n\nNow, check the attendance for that game. The number listed under \"attendance\" is 9092. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells used in verification.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim: \"the blue and penguin game on march 20 , score be 2 - 4.\" \n\nSo, key points here are:\n- The game involves Blue (probably the Blues) and Penguins.\n- It happened on March 20.\n- The score was 2 - 4.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with various details. Let me go through the table to find any game that matches these criteria.\n\nThe columns are: date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, points.\n\nI'll look for a row where:\n- Date is March 20.\n- Visitor is either Blues or Penguins (since it's Blue vs Penguin).\n- Score is 2 - 4. The format in the table uses \"score\" as a column with values like \"2 - 4\", so I can match that directly.\n\nNow, let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: March 2, visitor is Seals, score 6 - 6. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: March 6, visitor is Penguins vs Blues, score 2-4. Wait, but the date here is March 6, not 20. So that's a game on the wrong date.\n\nWait, let me count correctly. The first row is index 0, second is 1, and so on. Let me list them out properly:\n\nRow 0: March 2\nRow 1: March 6\nRow 2: March 7\nRow 3: March 9\nRow 4: March 13\nRow 5: March 16\nRow 6: March 17\nRow 7: March 20\nRow 8: March 23\nRow 9: March 24\nRow 10: March 26\nRow 11: March 27\nRow 12: March 30\nRow 13: March 31\n\nSo, the game on March 20 is row 7. Let's check row 7:\n\nVisitor is Blues, home is Penguins, score is 2 - 4.\n\nThat matches all the criteria in the claim. So the score is indeed 2-4 for that game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: we need the row index (which is 7) and the column names that are used to verify the claim. The columns needed are 'date', 'visitor', and 'score'. Let me confirm each:\n\n- Date: March 20 is in the date column at row 7.\n- Visitor: Blues is the visitor, which is in the visitor column at row 7.\n- Score: 2 - 4 is directly listed in the score column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'date' (row 7), 'visitor' (row 7), and 'score' (row 7).\n\nSo, I'll list each with their respective row index and column name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is about a specific game: \"the king and penguin game on march 20 have score of 2 - 4.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the data. There's a JSON table with columns: date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, points.\n\nThe claim mentions March 20th, so I should look for that date in the table. Looking through each row, I find that there is indeed a row with \"march 20\". \n\nNow, checking what happened on March 20th: the visitor was \"blues\" and the home team was \"penguins\". The score is listed as \"2 - 4\". That's exactly the game the claim is talking about.\n\nWait, the claim says it's a \"king and penguin game.\" Hmm. The visitor is the blues, so maybe I'm missing something here. Wait no, the home team is penguins. So the home team is Penguins and the visitor is Blues. So the game was between Blues and Penguins. The claim mentions \"king and penguin,\" but the data shows that on March 20th, it's Blues vs. Penguins.\n\nSo there might be a discrepancy here. The claim refers to Kings as one of the teams, but according to the table, it's Blues against Penguins on March 20th.\n\nTherefore, since the score listed for March 20th is indeed 2-4, but the opposing teams are not King and Penguin as per the claim, does that make the claim false? Or maybe I'm misreading the claim.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The claim says \"king and penguin game,\" which might mean the Kings are playing against Penguins. But in the table, on March 20th, it's Blues vs. Penguins. So unless there's a typo or misunderstanding, the teams don't match.\n\nSo the score is correct for March 20th as per the data, but the opponent of the Penguins isn't the Kings; it's the Blues. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it refers to the wrong opposing team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on March 20th, a game between Kings and Penguins had a score of 2-4. However, upon reviewing the table, the game on March 20th features the Blues against the Penguins with a 2-4 score. Since the opponent isn't the Kings as claimed, the assertion is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
