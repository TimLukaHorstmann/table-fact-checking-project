    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"if xweera be singular, then xweer (a) du be plural.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means in relation to the table. Let me look at the table structure. The columns are \"singular\", \"singular gender\", \"plural\", \"plural gender\", and \"meaning\". Each row represents a different word.\n\nThe claim is making a relationship between two forms of the same word: singular and plural. Specifically, it's stating that if xweera is singular, then its plural form (xweer (a) du) should be in the plural category with the appropriate gender.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- The row for \"xweera\" has:\n  - singular: xweera\n  - singular gender: n (neuter)\n  - plural: xweer (a) du\n  - plural gender: n (neuter)\n  - meaning: night\n\nSo, when xweera is singular, its plural form is \"xweer (a) du,\" and both are listed as neuter. That matches the claim's statement.\n\nI should check if there's a direct dependency where singular leads to plural in terms of grammatical category (gender). In this case, both singular and plural forms of xweera have the same gender, which is neuter. So, when xweera is singular (n), its plural form (xweer (a) du) is also n.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are found by identifying \"singular\" and \"plural\" columns for \"xweera\". The singular row shows xweera as male, but wait, no\u2014the singular gender is neuter. Wait, no, in the given data, the first column is \"singular\", which is \"xweera\", and the second column is its gender, \"n\". So when it's singular, the plural form is listed as \"xweer (a) du\" with gender \"n\". Therefore, when xweera is singular (n), the plural is also n. This matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"singular gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural gender\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"when mean python and the plural gender be 'n', use the word hlaneemo.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. There are two main parts here:\n\n1. Mean python.\n2. Plural gender is 'n'.\n3. Use the word hlaneemo.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different word with several columns: singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, and meaning.\n\nI need to find in the table where both conditions are met:\n- The singular form refers to \"python.\"\n- The plural gender is 'n'.\n\nSo I'll go through each row to check for these conditions.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Singular: \"awu\", which isn't python.\nSecond row: \"bila'\" \u2013 not python.\nThird row: \"nyaqot\" \u2013 no, it's a colobus monkey.\nFourth row: \"hhampa\" \u2013 no.\nFifth row: \"tlanka\" \u2013 no, bridge.\nSixth row: \"lama\" \u2013 no, lie.\nSeventh row: \"hlan\u03b5\", singular is python! Wait, the singular column says \"hlan\u03b5\". So this might be the relevant row.\n\nNow, checking the plural gender for \"hlan\u03b5\": plural gender is 'n' as per the table. And the plural form is \"hlaneemo.\" The claim suggests using \"hlaneemo\" when these conditions are met. \n\nSo yes, in the seventh row, both conditions apply: singular is python and plural gender is 'n'. Therefore, the word to use is hlaneemo.\n\nThus, the claim should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being the 7th row's singular, plural gender, and meaning columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"meaning\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For example, the first row has \"awu\" as singular, \"m\" as singular gender, \"awe\" as plural, \"f\" as plural gender, and meaning is bull.\n\nSo for the word \"bull,\" in the table, the singular form is \"awu\" (row 0), and the plural is \"awe\" (same row). That matches the claim exactly: singular is awu, plural is awe. \n\nI should check other rows to make sure there's no conflicting information or another entry for bull.

So the only row relevant here is the first one.\n\nSo the claim is fully supported by the data in row 0 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the singular form \"awu\" and plural form \"awe\" for \"bull\" exactly match the corresponding columns in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"plural\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are: singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, meaning. So each row represents a different word with these attributes.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row where the singular form is \"xweera\". Let me go through each row in the data array.\n\nRow 0: singular is \"awu\" \u2013 not xweera.\nRow 1: \"bila'\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"nyaqot\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: \"hhampa\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: \"tlanka\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 5: \"lama\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 6: \"hlan\u1d49\" \u2013 maybe, but not xweera.\nRow 7: singular is \"xweera\". That's the row I'm looking for. So row index is 7.\n\nNow, check if it's in the correct column. Yes, singular form is at index 0 of each row, so that's the first element in the row array. Therefore, the relevant cell is {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"singular\"}.\n\nNext part: does xweera mean night? Look at the meaning column. For row 7, the singular form is \"xweera\" and the meaning is \"night\". So that's correct.\n\nSo the claim is true because xweera is indeed the singular form of a word that means night. Now I need to list the relevant cells. The key columns here are singular and meaning.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other relevant parts. The claim mentions \"singular form... which mean night.\" So both singular form and meaning are needed. Therefore, the singular cell (row 7) and the meaning column (row 7) are both relevant.\n\nBut in the example provided, only two cells were listed with their row indices and column names. In this case, I need to include both the singular and meaning columns from the same row.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be: first, the cell for \"singular\" at row 7, and second, the cell for \"meaning\" at row 7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"meaning\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"xweer (a) du be the plural form of a word which mean night.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see how it relates to the claim. The table has columns: singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, meaning.\n\nThe relevant part here is the plural form. So I need to find in the data row where the word is \"xweer (a) du\" because that's mentioned in the claim as the plural form. \n\nLooking at the data section of the table, there's a row with [\"xweera\", \"n\", \"xweer (a) du\", \"n\", \"night\"]. Wait, actually, the first entry is singular, then singular gender, then plural, etc. So for this row:\n\nsingular: xweera\nsingular gender: n\nplural: xweer (a) du\nplural gender: n\nmeaning: night\n\nSo the word in the plural column is \"xweer (a) du\", which matches what the claim says as the plural form. The meaning is also 'night', which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says that xweer (a) du is the plural form of a word that means night. In the table, the singular form is \"xweera\" and its plural is correctly given as \"xweer (a) du\". So both parts of the claim seem to hold true.\n\nI need to check each part. The claim states two things: 1) xweer (a) du is the plural form, and 2) the word (singular form) means night.\n\nLooking at the table row for \"xweera\" (singular), its meaning is 'night', so that's correct.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, and meaning. Each row represents a different word with its related grammatical information and meaning.\n\nThe claim mentions \"awu\" as the singular for \"night\". So I need to find the row where the singular column is \"awu\" and see what the meaning is.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. The first row has singular: \"awu\", which matches. The meaning here is \"bull\". Wait, that's not night. Hmm, that's a problem.\n2. Let me check if there's another row with \"awu\" in the singular column. Scanning through, I don't see any other rows where singular is \"awu\". So it seems like only the first row has \"awu\".\n\nBut according to the claim, \"awu\" should mean night. However, in the table, \"awu\" is listed under the meaning of \"bull\". That's contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check each relevant cell. The singular column for row 0 is \"awu\", and the meaning is \"bull\". So if the claim says \"awu be the singular for the meaning of night,\" that would mean the meaning should be night, but it's actually bull.\n\nSo this suggests that the claim is incorrect because \"awu\" doesn't mean night in the table\u2014it means bull.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells from the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"nyaqootma be the plural form of the singular word nyaqot.\" So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that supports this statement.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, and meaning. Each row represents a different word, with its singular and plural forms, as well as their genders and meanings.\n\nI should focus on the rows where \"nyaqot\" is mentioned because that's the singular form in the claim. Let me scan through each row to find where \"nyaqot\" appears as the singular term.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0: singular is \"awu\", not nyaqot.\n- Row 1: singular is \"bila'\", nope.\n- Row 2: singular is \"nyaqot\". That's the one. Now, in this row, the plural form should be checked. The plural column here says \"nyaqootma'\". Does that match what the claim says about nyaqootma?\n\nThe claim refers to \"nyaqootma\" as the plural form of \"nyaqot.\" In the table, the plural is listed as \"nyaqootma'\". There's a slight difference in spelling: one has a single quote after nyaqootma and the other just ends with ma. Wait, no, looking again, the claim says \"nyaqootma\" while the table's plural is \"nyaqootma'\". So there's an apostrophe at the end in the table.\n\nSo, are these considered different? The claim uses \"nyaqootma\", and the table has \"nyaqootma'\". Is that a significant difference? Or is it just a typo or variation in how the plural is written?\n\nAdditionally, I should check for any possible discrepancies. If the plural form in the table doesn't exactly match what's claimed, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that \"nyaqot\" is indeed masculine, as per the singular gender column. The table says \"m\", so the singular word is masculine. That part checks out.\n\nBut the main issue is whether \"nyaqootma'\" is the correct plural form corresponding to \"nyaqot.\" If there's a mismatch in the plural form's spelling or if it doesn't correspond correctly, then the claim is false.\n\nAnother thing to consider: is the plural form correctly derived from the singular? For example, adding certain suffixes or prefixes. In this case, the plural seems to have been formed by appending \"ma'\" (with an apostrophe) to \"nyaqot.\" So if that's consistent with standard pluralization rules for the language in question, then it's correct.\n\nI don't know the specific grammatical rules of the language behind these words, but based on what's provided, I can only compare the given forms. The claim states \"nyaqootma\" is the plural, and the table shows \"nyaqootma'\". So the spelling differs slightly. Is that a material difference?\n\nIf in the context of the data, both forms are acceptable or if it's just a minor variation like an apostrophe placement, then it might still be considered the same. However, if they're different enough to mean different words, then it would not match.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards the claim being false because \"nyaqootma'\" is different from what the claim states as the plural form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo in the table, and the correct plural should be \"nyaqootma\" without the apostrophe, which would make the claim true.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I should check other rows to see if similar patterns exist. For example, looking at row 0: singular is \"awu\", plural is \"awe\". So here, plural is formed by adding 'e' perhaps? Similarly, in row 1: singular is \"bila'\", plural is \"bil'aawe\"\u2014so adding an apostrophe and 'awe'. So the plural forms can vary with apostrophes.\n\nIn row 2, \"nyaqot\" becomes \"nyaqootma'\", which seems to follow a similar pattern of adding a suffix. The claim states that \"nyaqootma\" is the plural. However, in the table, it's listed as \"nyaqootma'\". So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be false because it doesn't exactly match the plural form shown in the table. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting rows or missing something.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows. The third row is index 2 (since starting at 0). Yes, that's where \"nyaqot\" appears as singular. The plural is \"nyaqootma'\", which doesn't exactly match \"nyaqootma.\" So the claim says \"nyaqootma,\" but the table has \"nyaqootma'\". That might be a significant difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apostrophe is just part of the meaning or pronunciation rather than affecting the form. But without more context, it's hard to say. If the plural is indeed \"nyaqootma'\", then the claim is false because it doesn't match exactly.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other instances where similar plural forms are used. For example, in row 5: singular is \"lama\", plural is \"lameemo.\" That's adding 'memo' perhaps. So each plural seems to have a unique formation.\n\nIn the case of \"nyaqot,\" it becomes \"nyaqootma'\", so maybe the correct plural is with an apostrophe. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because it states \"nyaqootma\" without the apostrophe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apostrophe isn't part of the word's plural form but a possessive or something else, which would mean that \"nyaqootma'\" isn't the correct plural.\n\nBut based purely on the table data, the plural is listed as \"nyaqootma'\". So if the claim states it's \"nyaqootma,\" that doesn't match exactly. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The columns for plural and singular are separate, so perhaps the plural form in the table is \"nyaqootma'\", which would make the claim incorrect because it claims the plural is \"nyaqootma.\"\n\nSo, to verify the claim: does \"nyaqootma\" appear as the plural of \"nyaqot\"? In the table, no\u2014the plural is \"nyaqootma'\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again:\n\nRow 2:\nsingular: nyaqot\nplural: nyaqootma'\n\nSo the plural is \"nyaqootma'\". The claim says the plural is \"nyaqootma.\" So they're not exactly the same. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo in the table and should be \"nyaqootma\" without the apostrophe. But as per the given data, it's \"nyaqootma'\". Thus, the claim doesn't match the table's plural form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column\": \"plural\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column\": \"singular\"}]}",

Each row represents a different word.\n\nLet me scan through each row to find where \"hhampa\" is the plural of \"nyaqot\". \n\nStarting from the first row, I see:\n- singular: awu\n- plural: awe\n\nNot relevant here. Second row:\n- singular: bila'\n- plural: bil'aawe\n\nThird row:\n- singular: nyaqot\n- plural: nyaqootma'\n\nAh, so \"nyaqot\" is the singular form, and its plural is \"nyaqootma'\". Now, looking for \"hhampa\", I check each row. The fourth row has singular as \"hhampa\":\n- singular: hhampa\n- plural: hhampeeri\n\nSo \"hhampa\" in singular becomes \"hhampeeri\" in plural. But the claim says that if \"nyaqot\" is the singular, then \"hhampa\" is its plural. However, according to the table, when \"hhampa\" is the singular, its plural is \"hhampeeri\", not \"nyaqootma'\". \n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. The claim states that \"hhampa\" is the plural of \"nyaqot\". So in the table, \"nyaqot\" has a plural form \"nyaqootma'\", but \"hhampa\" is another singular word whose plural is different.\n\nSo the claim seems to be suggesting that when the singular is \"nyaqot\", then the plural would be \"hhampa\". But according to the table, when \"nyaqot\" is singular, its plural is \"nyaqootma'\". Therefore, \"hhampa\" isn't the plural of \"nyaqot\"; instead, it's a different word with its own plural.\n\nSo the claim doesn't hold because the plural of \"nyaqot\" is not \"hhampa\", but rather \"nyaqootma'\", and \"hhampa\" itself has a different plural form. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that \"hhampa\" is the plural of \"nyaqot,\" but the table shows that when \"nyaqot\" is singular, its plural is \"nyaqootma'\". \"hhampa\" is another singular word with its own plural, making the claim incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"plural\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"hhampeeri be the plural if the meaning be python and the plural gender be n.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It's making two conditions:\n1. If the meaning is \"python\", then the plural form should be \"hhampeeri\".\n2. The plural gender for \"python\" is \"n\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a singular noun, its singular gender, plural form, plural gender, and meaning.\n\nI'll start by finding the row where the meaning is \"python\". Scanning through the data, I see that in row 6 (since indexing starts at 0), the meaning is \"python\". The columns for this row are:\n- singular: \"hlan\u025b\",\n- singular gender: \"m\",\n- plural: \"hlaneemo\",\n- plural gender: \"n\",\n- meaning: \"python\".\n\nSo, when the meaning is \"python\", the plural form is \"hlaneemo\" not \"hhampeeri\". That means the claim's first condition isn't met because it claims the plural should be \"hhampeeri\".\n\nNow, checking the second part of the claim about the plural gender. The claim says the plural gender is \"n\". Looking at row 6 again, the plural gender is indeed \"n\", so this part holds true.\n\nHowever, since the first condition (plural form) isn't correct, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural gender\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"the singular if the plural be xweer (a) du be tlanka.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means in terms of the table's columns. The table has columns for singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, and meaning. So, the claim is talking about some relationship between singular and plural forms, specifically involving \"xweer (a) du\" and \"tlanka.\"\n\nLooking at the claim: \"the singular if the plural be xweer (a) du be tlanka.\" It seems like it's saying that when you have the plural form as \"xweer (a) du,\" the singular should be \"tlanka.\" So, I need to check in the table whether for any row, the plural is \"xweer (a) du\" and the singular is \"tlanka.\"\n\nLet me go through each row of the data:\n\n1. First row: plural is \"awe,\" not xweer.\n2. Second row: plural is \"bil'aawe,\" nope.\n3. Third row: plural is \"nyaqootma',\" no.\n4. Fourth row: plural is \"hhampeeri,\" not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: plural is \"tlankadu.\" Wait, the claim mentions \"tlanka\" as singular, so I need to see if the plural of \"tlanka\" is \"tlankadu.\" Yes, that's correct. But does this relate to the xweer part? No, because here plural is \"tlankadu,\" and singular is \"tlanka.\"\n\n6. Sixth row: plural is \"lameemo,\" not relevant.\n7. Seventh row: plural is \"hlaneemo,\" nope.\n8. Eighth row: plural is \"xweer (a) du.\" Ah, this is the plural form we're looking for.\n\nNow, checking the singular column for this row. The singular is listed as \"hlan\u03b5.\" Wait, that doesn't match \"tlanka\" at all. So, when the plural is \"xweer (a) du,\" the singular should be \"tlanka,\" but according to the table, it's actually \"hlan\u03b5.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the singular doesn't correspond to \"tlanka\" when the plural is \"xweer (a) du.\" The relevant cells would be the eighth row, columns for plural and singular.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE with these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"singular\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some data and a claim to check. The claim is: \"bila' be the plural if the singular be awu.\" Hmm, I need to figure out if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. It has columns: singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, and meaning. The data rows each have five entries corresponding to these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions \"bila' be the plural if the singular be awu.\" So I need to find rows where the singular is \"awu\" and the plural starts with \"bila'\". Wait, no, the claim says that bila' is the plural of awu. So I think it's saying that when the singular is 'awu', the plural is 'bila'.\n\nLooking at the table, I should search for a row where the singular column is 'awu'. Let me scan through each row.\n\nRow 0: Singular is \"awu\", so this seems relevant. Then I check the plural column. The plural for row 0 is \"awe\". Hmm, that's not matching bila'. So according to this, when the singular is awu, the plural is awe, not bila'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is saying that bila' is a plural form of awu in some other context. Let me check if there's another row where singular is something else but plural is bila'. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is implying that bila' is derived from awu.\n\nLooking further, in row 1: Singular is \"bila'\", which is different. The singular here is bila', and its plural is bil'aawe. That's a different word entirely.\n\nRow 2: Singular is nyaqot, plural is nyaqootma'. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Singular is hhampa, plural is hhampeeri. No match.\n\nRow 4: Singular is tlanka, plural is tlankadu. Not matching awu or bila'.\n\nRow 5: Singular is lama, plural is lameemo. No match.\n\nRow 6: Singular is hlan\u00e9, plural is hlaneemo. Also not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Singular is xweera, plural is xweer (a) du. Hmm, that's another form but doesn't relate to awu or bila'.\n\nWait a second, I didn't see any row where the singular is 'awu' and the plural is 'bila'. Instead, in row 0, the plural of 'awu' is 'awe', not 'bila'. So that contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that bila' is the plural form of awu. But according to the table, when singular is awu, plural is awe. So that's a contradiction.\n\nIs there any other way this could be true? Let me check again. Maybe I'm misreading the columns. The columns are singular, singular gender, plural, plural gender, meaning. So for row 0: singular 'awu' (m), plural 'awe' (f). That means when you have one awu (male), it's 'awu', but when you have more than one, it becomes 'awe' (female). So the plural of awu is awe, not bila'.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"bila' be the plural if the singular be awu\" is false because in reality, the plural of awu is awe.\n\nSo I should answer \"FALSE\". Now, to find the relevant cells. The claim refers to when the singular is 'awu', so we look at row 0, columns singular (row_index 0, column_name singular) and plural (row 0, column_name plural). Also, perhaps the singular gender and plural gender are not directly needed for this check, but since the user's example includes two cells per relevant_cells, maybe I should include both. Wait, in the example, they included two columns for each row_index, but that might be a mistake because the claim only refers to two columns. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to just mark the relevant rows and their plural columns.\n\nWait, the instruction says: determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim. So for the claim, we need to check if in any row where singular is 'awu', the plural is 'bila'. But from the table, no such row exists because when singular is awu (row 0), the plural is awe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that bila' is a plural derived from awu. So perhaps looking at another row where singular starts with 'b' or something else. For example, in row 1: singular is bila', and its plural is bil'aawe. But that doesn't relate to awu.\n\nSo the only relevant cell would be row 0, checking if plural is bila'. Since it's not, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\", with relevant_cells being row 0's singular and plural columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"plural\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
