    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"the home team st kilda score 12.15 (87) at moorabbin oval.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row in the data represents a different game.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific things: the home team is St Kilda, their score is 12.15 (87), and the venue is Moorabbin Oval.\n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the table. So, I'll go through each row to see if any match these details.\n\nLooking at the first column, \"home team,\" I'm searching for \"st kilda.\" Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 0: home team is Hawthorn \u2013 no.\n- Row 1: Collingwood \u2013 no.\n- Row 2: South Melbourne \u2013 no.\n- Row 3: St Kilda \u2013 yes! This is the relevant row. So, row_index is 3.\n\nNow, check the \"home team score\" column for this row. The score is listed as \"12.15 (87).\" That matches exactly what's in the claim.\n\nNext, the venue. The claim says it's at Moorabbin Oval. Checking the fifth column (venue) for row 3: Moorabbin oval \u2013 yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. There's no contradiction or missing information here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"when the home team score 12.15 (87), the game be hold at moorabbin oval.\" \n\nFirst, I'll carefully check each part of the claim against the table. Let's break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. Home team scored 12.15 (87).\n2. The game was held at Moorabbin Oval.\n\nI need to find corresponding data in the table that supports these two statements.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nFor the first part of the claim, I'm looking for any home team score that exactly matches \"12.15 (87)\". Scanning through each row's home team scores:\n\n- Row 0: Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110)\n- Row 1: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33)\n- Row 2: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74)\n- Row 3: St Kilda scored 12.15 (87) \u2013 This matches the score in the claim.\n- Row 4: Richmond scored 5.10 (40)\n- Row 5: Geelong scored 7.13 (55)\n\nSo, in row 3, the home team is St Kilda with a score of 12.15 (87). That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I check where this game was held. The venue for row 3 is Moorabbin Oval. This matches the second part of the claim that the game was held there.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by data in the table. Both the score and the venue align correctly with one of the rows provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table as both the home team's score and the venue match exactly for one of the matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim: \"When Melbourne be the away team, the crowd size be 7912.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the data in the table. The columns are:\n- home team\n- home team score\n- away team\n- away team score\n- venue\n- crowd\n- date\n\nThe data is a list of rows, each containing information about a game. Each row represents one match with details about both teams, their scores, where it was held, how many people attended, and the date.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: it's saying that when Melbourne is the away team, the crowd size is 7912. So, I need to find in the table any instance where Melbourne is listed as an away team and see what the corresponding crowd number is.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First row**: Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Melbourne. The crowd is 7912. Here, Melbourne is indeed the away team, and the crowd is exactly 7912. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows to make sure there isn't another instance where Melbourne is an away team with a different crowd size.\n\n2. **Second row**: Away team is Fitzroy. So, not relevant.\n3. **Third row**: Away team is North Melbourne. Not Melbourne.\n4. **Fourth row**: Away team is Footscray. Nope.\n5. **Fifth row**: Away team is Carlton. No match.\n6. **Sixth row**: Away team is Essendon. Not Melbourne.\n\nSo, the only occurrence where Melbourne is the away team is in the first row with a crowd of 7912. Therefore, the claim holds true because there's at least one instance that matches.\n\nI should also consider if the claim is making a general statement or just pointing to a specific instance. The way it's phrased seems like it's asserting that whenever Melbourne is away, the crowd is 7912. But in the table provided, we only see one such case, so without more data, we can't confirm it universally, but since at least one exists, it might be considered TRUE.\n\nHowever, sometimes claims require all instances to match. If the claim had said \"Melbourne's away games always have 7912 people,\" then without seeing other rows where Melbourne is away, it would be FALSE. But here, the claim doesn't specify whether it's referring to all or any cases, so I think it's acceptable to say TRUE based on the one match.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions a crowd number of 7912 attending Melbourne's away game. So I'm looking for an entry in the table where the home team is \"Melbourne\" and the crowd was 7912.\n\nLooking at the table structure: columns are home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nNow, let me scan through each row to find Melbourne as the home team. \n\nRow 0: Home team is Hawthorn \u2013 not Melbourne.\nRow 1: Home team is Collingwood \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: South Melbourne is the home team here; they have a crowd of 8484, which doesn't match.\nRow 3: St Kilda is home with 11948 attendees. Not matching.\nRow 4: Richmond has 64207 spectators. No.\nRow 5: Geelong is home with 75221 people. None of these are Melbourne as the home team.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"Melbourne's away game,\" which would mean that in some row, Melbourne is the away team, and their game had 7912 attendees.\n\nSo perhaps I should look for rows where the away team is Melbourne.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Away team is Melbourne with a crowd of 7912. Yes! That matches exactly what the claim states. So this row has \"Melbourne\" as the away team and the crowd number 7912. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nSo I need to verify that in the table, there's a row where the away team is Melbourne with a crowd of 7912. Indeed, row index 0 meets both conditions: away team is Melbourne, crowd is 7912.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 0, specifically under the \"crowd\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and data. The claim says: \"when the away team score 15.17 (107) the home team scored10.14 (74).\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It's in JSON format with columns like \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" etc. The data is a list of lists, each containing information about a particular match.\n\nThe claim is specifically about two scores: one from an away team and one from the home team. I need to find in the table if there's a row where the away team scored 15.17 (107) and the home team scored 10.14 (74).\n\nLooking at each row in the data:\n\n1. First row:\n   - Home team: hawthorn, score: 15.20 (110)\n   - Away team: melbourne, score: 8.9 (57)\n   No match here.\n\n2. Second row:\n   - Home team: collingwood, score:4.9 (33)\n   - Away team: fitzroy, score:8.11 (59)\n   Doesn't match either.\n\n3. Third row:\n   - Home team: south melbourne, score:10.14 (74)\n   - Away team: north melbourne, score:15.17 (107)\n   Wait, here the away team's score is 15.17 (107), and the home team's score is 10.14 (74). That seems to match the claim.\n\nBut I should check all rows just in case there are multiple matches or if any other row might also satisfy this condition, though it's unlikely given the scores.\n\n4. Fourth row:\n   - Home: st kilda, score:12.15 (87)\n   - Away: footscray, score:5.8 (38)\n   No match here.\n\n5. Fifth row:\n   - Home: richmond, score:5.10 (40)\n   - Away: carlton, score:9.13 (67)\n   Doesn't fit.\n\n6. Sixth row:\n   - Home: geelong, score:7.13 (55)\n   - Away: essendon, score:6.11 (47)\n   Not matching.\n\nSo the only row where away team's score is 15.17 (107) is the third one, and in that same row, the home team scored 10.14 (74). That directly supports the claim.\n\nI need to make sure I'm looking at the correct columns for each piece of information. The claim refers to \"away team score\" and \"home team score,\" so those would correspond to the respective columns in the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the third row's \"away team score\" and \"home team score.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because there is a match in the data where the away team scored 15.17 (107) and the home team scored 10.14 (74).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"when the away team score 15.17 (107) the home team be north melbourne.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this claim means. It seems like it's stating that when the away team scores 15.17 (107), the home team is North Melbourne. So I need to find in the table if there's a match where the away team scored exactly 15.17 (107) points and the home team is indeed North Melbourne.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date. The data is provided in rows with these details.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any match meets both conditions: away team score being 15.17 (107) and the home team being North Melbourne.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- Home team: Hawthorn\n- Away team: Melbourne\n- Away team score: 8.9 (57)\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: Collingwood\n- Away team: Fitzroy\n- Away team score: 8.11 (59)\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: South Melbourne\n- Away team: North Melbourne\n- Away team score: 15.17 (107)\n\nAh, here in row 2, the away team is North Melbourne, and their score is exactly 15.17 (107). So this matches both conditions of the claim.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check all rows to ensure there's no other occurrence, but since each row represents a different match on August 29, 1981, it's unlikely another entry would have the same away team score and home team. However, for completeness:\n\nRow 3:\n- Home team: St Kilda\n- Away team: Footscray\n- Score: 12.15 (87)\n\nRow 4:\n- Home team: Richmond\n- Away team: Carlton\n- Score: 5.10 (40)\n\nRow 5:\n- Home team: Geelong\n- Away team: Essendon\n- Score: 7.13 (55)\n\nNo other rows match the away team score of 15.17 (107) and home team as North Melbourne.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because in row 2, when the away team scored 15.17 (107), the home team was indeed North Melbourne.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"10.14 (74) be the team's score when the away team score 15.17 (107).\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. I need to break it down into parts.\n\nFirst, I think the claim is stating two things about a specific game:\n1. The home team scored 10.14 (74).\n2. The away team scored 15.17 (107).\n\nI should look through the table data to see if any row matches both of these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Home team: hawthorn\n- Home score: 15.20 (110)\n- Away team: melbourne\n- Away score: 8.9 (57)\nDoesn't match the claim's home or away scores.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Home score: 4.9 (33)\n- Away team: fitzroy\n- Away score: 8.11 (59)\nAgain, doesn't match.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: south melbourne\n- Home score: 10.14 (74) \u2190 This matches the first part of the claim.\n- Away team: north melbourne\n- Away score: 15.17 (107) \u2190 This matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, so in this row, the home team's score is 10.14 (74), and the away team's score is 15.17 (107). That's exactly what the claim is stating. So, this row supports both parts of the claim.\n\nI should check if any other rows might also fit, just to be thorough.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home team: st kilda\n- Home score: 12.15 (87)\n- Away team: footscray\n- Away score: 5.8 (38)\nNo match here.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home team: richmond\n- Home score: 5.10 (40)\n- Away team: carlton\n- Away score: 9.13 (67)\nNot a match.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home team: geelong\n- Home score: 7.13 (55)\n- Away team: essendon\n- Away score: 6.11 (47)\nNope, doesn't fit.\n\nSo, only row 2 matches both conditions specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is true based on that row.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim mentions two things: the home team's score and the away team's score. So, the columns involved are \"home team score\" and \"away team score\". \n\nLooking at row 2, which is index 2 (since we start counting from 0), the relevant columns are:\n- column_name for home score: \"home team score\"\n- column_name for away score: \"away team score\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row_index 2 for both columns mentioned.\n\nI think that's all. The claim is fully supported by the data in row 2 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there exists a row where the home team scored 10.14 (74) and the away team scored 15.17 (107).

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions a crowd size of 32,393 attending Melbourne's away game. So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different game with various details. The columns include home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The \"crowd\" column seems directly relevant because it lists the number of people attending each game.\n\nNext, I need to find which rows have a crowd size close to 32,393.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the game where the home team score 12.15 (87) be hold at mcg\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the data in the table to see if there's a match for these specific details. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Home team: hawthorn\n- Score: 15.20 (110)\n- Venue: princes park\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Score: 4.9 (33)\n- Venue: victoria park\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: south melbourne\n- Score: 10.14 (74)\n- Venue: lake oval\n\nRow 3:\n- Home team: st kilda\n- Score: 12.15 (87)\n- Venue: moorabbin oval\n\nRow 4:\n- Home team: richmond\n- Score: 5.10 (40)\n- Venue: mcg\n\nRow 5:\n- Home team: geelong\n- Score: 7.13 (55)\n- Venue: vfl park\n\nNow, the claim mentions a game where the home team scored 12.15 (87) and it was held at mcg. Let's check each row:\n\nLooking for home team score of 12.15 (87). That happens in Row 3.\n\nIn Row 3, the venue is moorabbin oval, not mcg. So that doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The claim says \"be hold at mcg\", so the venue should be mcg. Let me check which row has mcg as the venue. Looking through the data:\n\nRow 4: Venue is mcg.\n\nIn Row 4, the home team is richmond with a score of 5.10 (40). So that's not the same as 12.15 (87).\n\nTherefore, there's no game in the table where the home team scored 12.15 (87) at mcg.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check all rows for both conditions. The claim requires two things: the home team score is 12.15 (87), and the venue is mcg.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3 has the correct score but wrong venue.\nRow 4 has the correct venue but wrong score.\nNo other rows match both criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a game with a home team score of 12.15 (87) was held at McG. Checking each row:\n\n- **Row 3** has the correct score but the venue is Moorabbin oval, not McG.\n- **Row 4** has the correct venue but the wrong score.\n\nSince no row matches both criteria, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"lake oval be the venue of the game that the home team score 15.20 (110)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main parts:\n\n1. Lake Oval is the venue.\n2. The home team scored 15.20 (110).\n\nSo, I need to check if there's a row in the table where \"lake oval\" is listed as the venue and the home team's score is exactly 15.20 (110). \n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.\n- There are six rows of data.\n\nI need to go through each row and check for both conditions in each relevant column.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking if any row has \"lake oval\" as the venue. Scanning through the 'venue' column:\n\n1. princes park\n2. victoria park\n3. lake oval\n4. moorabbin oval\n5. mcg\n6. vfl park\n\nSo, in row index 2 (third row), the venue is \"lake oval\". That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, check if the home team's score in this row is 15.20 (110). Looking at the 'home team score' column for each row:\n\nRow 0: 15.20 (110) \u2013 Wait, no, actually, let me look again. The first row has \"hawthorn\" as home team with a score of 15.20 (110). Hmm, wait, that's in row index 0.\n\nWait, but in the third row (row index 2), the venue is lake oval. Let me check if that row also has the home team score 15.20 (110).\n\nLooking at row index 2: The home team is \"south melbourne\" and their score is \"10.14 (74)\". So, the home team isn't scoring 15.20 in this row.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have confused something. Let me go back.\n\nThe first row (row index 0): home team is hawthorn with 15.20 (110). The venue is princes park, so that doesn't match the venue part of the claim.\n\nSecond row: collingwood vs fitzroy at victoria park, score is 4.9 and 8.11. Doesn't apply.\n\nThird row: south melbourne vs north melbourne at lake oval. Their scores are 10.14 and 15.17. So home team score here is 74, which isn't 110.\n\nFourth row: st kilda scored 12.15 (87) at moorabbin oval. Not relevant.\n\nFifth row: richmond vs carlton at mcg, scores are 40 and 67. No match.\n\nSixth row: geelong vs essendon at vfl park, scores are 55 and 47. No match.\n\nWait, so the only row with venue as lake oval is row index 2 (south melbourne home game). But in that row, the home team scored 74, not 110.\n\nThe other row that matches the score of 15.20 (110) is row index 0, but the venue there is princes park, which isn't the claimed venue.\n\nSo, there's no row where both \"lake oval\" is the venue and the home team scored 15.20 (110). Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"lake oval be the venue of the game that the home team score 15.20 (110)\". Checking each row:\n\n- The venue \"lake oval\" is in row index 2, but the home team score there is 10.14 (74).\n- The home team with 15.20 (110) is in row index 0, where the venue is princes park.\n\nSince no row satisfies both conditions, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
