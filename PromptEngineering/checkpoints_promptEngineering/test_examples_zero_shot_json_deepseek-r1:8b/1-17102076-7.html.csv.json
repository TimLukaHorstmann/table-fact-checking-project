    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the score of game 35 be l90 - 98 (ot)\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a specific game number, which is game 35. The score it refers to is \"l90 - 98 (ot)\", which stands for a loss with the final score of 90-98 in overtime.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, etc. So, I need to focus on the 'game' and 'score' columns.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to game 35. The first column is 'game', and each row has a number in that column. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: game 33\nRow 1: game 34\nRow 2: game 35\n\nSo, game 35 is found at row index 2.\n\nNow, I need to check the 'score' for this game. The score is given as \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". Looking at the 'score' column in row 2, it's written as \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
