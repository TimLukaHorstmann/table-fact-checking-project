    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Rob Emerson having the highest win record of 13-10 in his MMA career is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. Each row represents a fight outcome with details about the fighter's performance.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Rob Emerson having a 13-10 win record. So, I need to find any entries in the 'res' column where \"Rob Emerson\" is mentioned and check if his win-loss record matches this.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first entry has res as \"win\", but the opponent is \"jared downing\". No mention of Rob Emerson here.\n2. The second row mentions \"savant young\" as the opponent; still not Rob.\n3. Third row: \"justin salas\" \u2013 nope.\n4. Fourth: \"eric reynolds\" \u2013 no.\n5. Fifth: \"rodney rhoden\" \u2013 not him.\n6. Sixth: \"nik lentz\" \u2013 no.\n7. Seventh: \"phillipe nover\" \u2013 nope.\n8. Eighth: \"rafael dos anjos\" \u2013 not Rob.\n9. Ninth row: \"kurt pellegrino\" \u2013 still no.\n10. Tenth: \"manny gamburyan\" \u2013 not Rob.\n11. Eleventh: \"keita nakamura\" \u2013 no.\n12. Twelfth: \"gray maynard\" \u2013 nope.\n13. Thirteenth: \"kenji arai\" \u2013 not Rob.\n14. Fourteenth: \"takafumi ito\" \u2013 no.\n15. Fifteenth: \"jamie schmidt\" \u2013 not him.\n16. Sixteenth: \"julian samaniego\" \u2013 no.\n17. Seventeenth: \"melvin guillard\" \u2013 nope.\n18. Eighteenth: \"randy velarde\" \u2013 no.\n19. Nineteenth: \"joe camacho\" \u2013 not Rob.\n20. Twentieth: \"justin berkley\" \u2013 nope.\n21. Twenty-first: \"dokonjonosuke mishima\" \u2013 no.\n22. Twenty-second: \"javier vazquez\" \u2013 no.\n23. Twenty-third: \"jamal perkins\" \u2013 not Rob.\n24. Twenty-fourth: \"jens pulver\" \u2013 no.\n\nWait, so in the entire table provided, I don't see any entry where 'res' is \"win\" and the opponent is Rob Emerson. That's concerning because if there are no wins attributed to him, his record might be worse or nonexistent here.\n\nBut the claim mentions a 13-10 record, which implies he has 13 wins. Since none of the rows have Rob Emerson as the fighter with a win, perhaps he isn't included in this table or it's from another event. However, without any wins listed for him, his record would be 0-4 or something similar, not 13-10.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, there is no evidence supporting the claim that Rob Emerson has a 13-10 win record. The answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"there be only 1 ko (punches) method for win by rob emerson.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim is saying. It's stating that in all of Rob Emerson's wins where he used a KO via punches as the method, there is exactly one such instance. So I need to look through the table and see if Rob Emerson has only one KO (punches) win.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight event with various details. The relevant columns for this claim are \"res\" (result), \"method\", and possibly \"opponent\". But since the claim is specifically about Rob Emerson's wins via KO punches, I need to focus on the rows where:\n\n1. The result (\"res\") is a win.\n2. The method is \"ko (punches)\".\n3. The opponent is Rob Emerson.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I don't see an \"opponent\" column listed among the columns. Let me check again: the columns are res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location. Oh, yes, \"opponent\" is a column. So each row has an \"opponent\" field.\n\nSo I need to go through each row and check if any of them have:\n\n- res = win\n- method = ko (punches)\n- opponent = Rob Emerson\n\nLet me scan through the table rows one by one.\n\nRow 0: res=win, method=submission (inverted heel hook), opponent=jared downing. Not applicable.\nRow1: res=win, method=rear naked choke, opponent=savant young. No.\nRow2: loss, so irrelevant.\nRow3: win, method=decision (split). No.\nRow4: win, method=tko (punches). Opponent=rodney rhoden. Not Rob Emerson.\nRow5: loss, irrelevant.\nRow6: win, method=decision (unanimous). Opponent=Phillipe nover.\nRow7: loss, irrelevant.\nRow8: loss, irrelevant.\nRow9: win, method=tko. Opponent=manny gamburyan.\nRow10: win, method=decision. Opponent=joe camacho.\nRow11: win, method=submission (choke). Opponent=justin berkley.\nRow12: loss, irrelevant.\nRow13: loss, opponent=dokonjonosuke mishima.\nRow14: loss, opponent=javier vazquez.\nRow15: loss, opponent=jamal perkins.\nRow16: loss, opponent=jens pulver.\n\nI don't see any row where res is win, method is ko (punches), and opponent is Rob Emerson. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss anything. Each row's \"opponent\" seems to be different from Rob Emerson. There's no mention of Rob Emerson as an opponent in any of these rows.\n\nTherefore, there are zero instances where Rob Emerson has a win via KO (punches). So the claim says \"there be only 1,\" but in reality, it's zero. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Rob Emerson has exactly one win using the KO (punches) method.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The columns needed are \"res\" (result), \"method\", and \"opponent\".\n2. **Filter Rows for Win and KO Punches:** Look for rows where \"res\" is \"win\" and \"method\" is \"ko (punches)\".\n3. **Check Opponent in Each Relevant Row:** Ensure the opponent is Rob Emerson in these rows.\n\nUpon scanning all rows, no such instances were found. Therefore, there are zero wins by Rob Emerson via KO punches.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether a certain claim about a table is true or false and then provide relevant cells. The claim is: \"match against eric reynolds be 1 of the 4 match to have decision (split) method.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim. It's saying that there was one match involving Eric Reynolds where the method was a decision split, and this should be among the top four matches with such methods.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. The columns are \"res,\" \"record,\" \"opponent,\" \"method,\" \"event,\" \"round,\" and \"location.\"\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to find all matches where the result is a decision split and count how many there are, specifically looking for Eric Reynolds' fights.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row in the data. Let's see:\n\n1. The first row: res is \"win,\" method is \"submission (inverted heel hook).\" Not a decision split.\n2. Second row: res is \"win,\" method is \"submission (rear naked choke).\" Also not a split decision.\n3. Third row: loss, but the method is \"decision (unanimous).\" Different type of decision, not split.\n4. Fourth row: win, opponent Eric Reynolds, method \"decision (split).\" That's one match.\n\nContinuing:\n5. Fifth row: win by tko, not a split decision.\n6. Sixth row: loss, but the method is another kind of decision, not split.\n7. Seventh row: win by decision, but again, it's unanimous, not split.\n8. Eighth row: nc, so not applicable.\n9. Ninth row: Eric Reynolds isn't mentioned here; opponent is kenji arai.\n10. Tenth row: different opponent, method is decision (unanimous).\n11. Eleventh row: Eric Reynolds isn't involved here, either.\n12. Twelfth row: different fighter, tko.\n13. Thirteenth row: loss against melvin guillard, but not Eric.\n14. Fourteenth row: Randy Velarde's fight, no split decision.\n15. Fifteenth row: Joe Camacho's win, method is choke.\n16. Sixteenth row: Justin Berkley wins by submission.\n17. Seventeenth row: Dokonjonosuke Mishima's fight, not Eric.\n18. Eighteenth row: Javier Vazquez's fight, no split.\n19. Nineteenth row: Jamal Perkins loses, no split involved.\n20. Twentieth row: Jens Pulver's fight, method is just \"decision,\" but not specified as split.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed Eric Reynolds in another row. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the fourth row was Eric Reynolds' match with opponent unknown, and the result is a decision (split). So that's one match. Are there any others?\n\nI don't see any other rows where Eric Reynolds is listed as the opponent or participant with a split decision method. Therefore, only one match meets this criterion.\n\nThe claim says it should be one of four such matches. Since there's only one, the claim would be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row for \"decision (split)\" and Eric Reynolds.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 4: method is decision (split), opponent is Eric Reynolds. So that's the only one.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it's one of four is incorrect because there's only one such match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that among four matches, a fight against Eric Reynolds was decided by a split method. However, upon reviewing the table, only one match involving Eric Reynolds uses the decision (split) method. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"rob emerson never play at the ufc 87 event\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents in the table. The columns are: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location.\n\nThe claim is about Rob Emerson and a specific UFC event, which is \"ufc 87\". So, I'm looking for any row where \"event\" is \"ufc 87\" and the fighter's name is associated with Rob Emerson. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 9: res is win, opponent is Manny Gamburyan, method is KO (punches), event is ufc 87, round is 1, location Minneapolis, MN.\n  \nHere, the event is \"ufc 87\" and the fighter's name isn't explicitly stated here. Wait, actually, I need to check if Rob Emerson is the one who played in this event. But looking at the table, each row starts with \"res\", which is win, loss, etc., followed by opponent, method, etc. There's no column for the fighter's name, only opponent.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed a column. Let me check again: columns are res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location. So, there's no direct column indicating who the fighter is\u2014only the opponent.\n\nSo, in this case, how can I find Rob Emerson? Maybe Rob Emerson isn't listed as an opponent here. Alternatively, perhaps Rob Emerson is not involved in any of these events.\n\nWait, let me check each row to see if Rob Emerson is mentioned as the opponent or anywhere else. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is jared downing.\n- Row 1: Opponent is savant young.\n- Row 2: Opponent is justin salas.\n- Row 3: Opponent is eric reynolds.\n- Row 4: Opponent is rodney rhoden.\n- Row 5: Opponent is nik lentz.\n- Row 6: Opponent is phillipe nover.\n- Row 7: Opponent is rafael dos anjos.\n- Row 8: Opponent is kurt pellegrino.\n- Row 9: Opponent is Manny Gamburyan. (But Rob Emerson isn't here)\n- Row 10: Opponent is justin berkley.\n- Row 11: Opponent is dokonjonosuke mishima.\n- Row 12: Opponent is javier vazquez.\n- Row 13: Opponent is jamal perkins.\n- Row 14: Opponent is jens pulver.\n\nNone of the opponents are named Rob Emerson. So, if Rob Emerson never played in any of these events, including ufc 87, then the claim could be TRUE. But wait, I need to check if there's a row where event is \"ufc 87\" and whether Rob Emerson was involved somehow.\n\nIn row 9, the event is ufc 87, but the opponent is Manny Gamburyan. Since there's no indication that the fighter (who isn't listed as an opponent here) is Rob Emerson, it suggests that Rob Emerson wasn't involved in this event or any other events listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"rob emerson never play at the ufc 87 event\" seems to be TRUE because there's no evidence in the table that Rob Emerson participated in UFC 87 against Manny Gamburyan or anyone else.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether Rob Emerson did not participate in UFC 87, I checked all rows for the event \"ufc 87\". In one row (row 9), the opponent is Manny Gamburyan, but there's no mention of Rob Emerson as an opponent. Since none of the opponents match Rob Emerson and he isn't listed elsewhere, it confirms he didn't participate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Rob Emerson having lost a total of 10 matches in his career is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Rob Emerson is. From the data provided, I see that most of the opponents are other fighters with last names like Downing, Young, Salas, etc., but I don't immediately recognize Rob Emerson as one of them. This makes me think that perhaps Rob Emerson isn't included in this table or is represented under a different name.\n\nNext, I should look through each row of the table to see if there's any mention of \"Rob Emerson.\" Scanning through the data, I go row by row:\n\n1. The first entry has the opponent as \"jared downing\" \u2013 not Rob Emerson.\n2. Second row: \"savant young\" \u2013 no match.\n3. Third row: \"justin salas\" \u2013 still not matching.\n4. Fourth row: \"eric reynolds\" \u2013 no.\n5. Fifth row: \"rodney rhoden\" \u2013 not him.\n6. Sixth row: \"nik lentz\" \u2013 not relevant.\n7. Seventh row: \"phillipe nover\" \u2013 nope.\n8. Eighth row: \"rafael dos anjos\" \u2013 not Rob.\n9. Ninth row: \"kurt pellegrino\" \u2013 no match.\n10. Tenth row: \"manny gamburyan\" \u2013 still not him.\n11. Eleventh row: \"keita nakamura\" \u2013 no.\n12. Twelfth row: \"gray maynard\" \u2013 different name.\n13. Thirteenth row: \"kenji arai\" \u2013 no.\n14. Fourteenth row: \"takafumi ito\" \u2013 not matching.\n15. Fifteenth row: \"jamie schmidt\" \u2013 nope.\n16. Sixteenth row: \"julian samaniego\" \u2013 no.\n17. Seventeenth row: \"melvin guillard\" \u2013 different person.\n18. Eighteenth row: \"randy velarde\" \u2013 not Rob.\n19. Nineteenth row: \"joe camacho\" \u2013 no match.\n20. Twentieth row: \"justin berkley\" \u2013 still not him.\n21. Twenty-first row: \"dokonjonosuke mishima\" \u2013 different name.\n22. Twenty-second row: \"javier vazquez\" \u2013 no.\n23. Twenty-third row: \"jamal perkins\" \u2013 not Rob.\n24. Twenty-fourth row: \"jens pulver\" \u2013 different fighter.\n\nAfter going through all the rows, I don't see any mention of \"Rob Emerson.\" This suggests that either Rob Emerson isn't included in this table or perhaps his name appears under a different alias or spelling. Since the claim is about Rob Emerson specifically, and he's not present here, I can infer that there might be no information available in this table to confirm or deny the claim.\n\nNow, considering the instruction to check each condition in the claim against the table, I need to verify if \"lose a total of 10 match\" refers to losses. In the table, the column related to losses is likely \"Losses.\" Looking at the structure provided earlier, the columns are:\n\n- Opponent\n- Result (e.g., Win, Loss)\n- Details\n\nSo, the relevant column for losses would be \"Result\" where it's marked as \"Loss.\"\n\nTherefore, I should look for any row where the opponent is Rob Emerson and the result is a loss. Since none of the rows have Rob Emerson as the opponent, there are no relevant cells that can confirm or deny the claim.\n\nHence, without evidence in the table, the claim cannot be fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Rob Emerson losing 10 matches isn't supported by the data provided, as his name doesn't appear in any row. There are no relevant cells to confirm the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Rob Emerson's lowest win record is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"Rob Emerson has the lowest win record of 12 - 9 in his MMA career.\" So, they're saying that in all of his fights, his wins are 12 and losses are 9, which would give him a record of 12-9. But wait, I remember hearing that Rob Emerson had more than 15 wins in his career, so this might be incorrect.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a fight event with details like the outcome (win/loss), score, opponent, method, event name, round, and location. My task is to check if there's any data that directly supports or contradicts the claim about his 12-9 record.\n\nFirst, I'll need to find Rob Emerson in the table. Let me scan through each row's \"opponent\" column to see if \"Rob Emerson\" appears. \n\nWait, looking at the first few rows:\n\n1. Opponent: jared downing\n2. Opponent: savant young\n3. Opponent: justin salas\n4. Opponent: eric reynolds\n5. Opponent: rodney rhoden\n6. Opponent: nik lentz\n7. Opponent: phillipe nover\n8. Opponent: rafael dos anjos\n9. Opponent: kurt pellegrino\n10. Opponent: manny gamburyan\n11. Opponent: keita nakamura\n12. Opponent: gray maynard\n13. Opponent: kenji arai\n14. Opponent: takafumi ito\n15. Opponent: jamie schmidt\n16. Opponent: julian samaniego\n17. Opponent: melvin guillard\n18. Opponent: randy velarde\n19. Opponent: joe camacho\n20. Opponent: justin berkley\n21. Opponent: dokonjonosuke mishima\n22. Opponent: javier vazquez\n23. Opponent: jamal perkins\n24. Opponent: jens pulver\n\nHmm, I don't see \"Rob Emerson\" listed as an opponent in any of these rows. That's odd because if he's not listed here, perhaps the table doesn't include all his fights, or maybe the data is presented differently.\n\nWait a second, maybe Rob Emerson is one of the opponents somewhere. Let me check again more carefully. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 0: jared downing\n- Row 1: savant young\n- Row 2: justin salas\n- Row 3: eric reynolds\n- Row 4: rodney rhoden\n- Row 5: nik lentz\n- Row 6: phillipe nover\n- Row 7: rafael dos anjos\n- Row 8: kurt pellegrino\n- Row 9: manny gamburyan\n- Row10: keita nakamura\n- Row11: gray maynard\n- Row12: kenji arai\n- Row13: takafumi ito\n- Row14: jamie schmidt\n- Row15: julian samaniego\n- Row16: melvin guillard\n- Row17: randy velarde\n- Row18: joe camacho\n- Row19: justin berkley\n- Row20: dokonjonosuke mishima\n- Row21: javier vazquez\n- Row22: jamal perkins\n- Row23: jens pulver\n\nNo, I still don't see Rob Emerson as an opponent. That's strange because if he's a significant fighter, his fights should be listed here. Maybe the table is incomplete or structured differently, perhaps only listing certain opponents or events.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes both wins and losses, but in this case, since the claim is about 12-9, I need to check whether Rob Emerson has 12 wins and 9 losses in total. Alternatively, if he has more than 15 wins, then the claim would be false.\n\nBut without his data in the table, perhaps the answer is that there's no relevant data here, meaning the claim cannot be verified from this table. However, the instructions say to check each condition against the table and find relevant cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson isn't listed as an opponent because he's not a fighter in this dataset. But if the claim is about his record, then regardless of whether he's listed, we need to see if his total wins are 12-9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The table might be listing all the opponents, but Rob Emerson could be a fighter who has a 12-9 record. So maybe I should look for the row where the outcome is a win or loss and tally up the numbers accordingly.\n\nBut without knowing which row corresponds to Rob Emerson, it's impossible to verify directly from this table. Alternatively, perhaps Rob Emerson isn't in the table, meaning that his data isn't provided here, so we can't confirm the claim based on this information.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again for \"Rob Emerson\" in the opponent column. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: jared downing\nRow1: savant young\nRow2: justin salas\nRow3: eric reynolds\nRow4: rodney rhoden\nRow5: nik lentz\nRow6: phillipe nover\nRow7: rafael dos anjos\nRow8: kurt pellegrino\nRow9: manny gamburyan\nRow10: keita nakamura\nRow11: gray maynard\nRow12: kenji arai\nRow13: takafumi ito\nRow14: jamie schmidt\nRow15: julian samaniego\nRow16: melvin guillard\nRow17: randy velarde\nRow18: joe camacho\nRow19: justin berkley\nRow20: dokonjonosuke mishima\nRow21: javier vazquez\nRow22: jamal perkins\nRow23: jens pulver\n\nNope, no Rob Emerson there. So either the table doesn't include his fights, or he's not listed here for some reason.\n\nAssuming that the table includes all his relevant fights, if Rob Emerson isn't in the opponent column, then we can't verify his record from this data. Therefore, the claim might be false because it's not supported by the provided information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't include all his fights, so we can't confirm whether he has a 12-9 record or higher. But since the claim is about his lowest win record being 12-9, and if he actually has more wins, then the answer would be false.\n\nWait, but without his data in the table, I can't know for sure. So perhaps the relevant cells are those where the fighter has a win or loss, but without knowing which row is Rob Emerson, it's impossible to say.\n\nTherefore, I think there might be no relevant data here to verify the claim, so the answer would be that we can't confirm the claim based on this information.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the provided table of opponents to determine if the claim about Rob Emerson having a 12-9 win-loss record is supported. After thoroughly examining each row in the table, \"Rob Emerson\" does not appear as an opponent in any of them. This absence suggests that the necessary data to verify the claim is missing from this dataset. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot confirm or deny the claim.\n\n**Answer:** There is insufficient information provided in the table to verify the claim about Rob Emerson's win-loss record.",

Row 0: res - win, method - submission (inverted heel hook)\n2. Row 1: res - win, method - submission (rear naked choke)\n3. Row 2: res - loss\n4. Row 3: res - win, method - decision (split)\n5. Row 4: res - win, method - tko (punches)\n6. Row 5: res - loss\n7. Row 6: res - win, method - decision (unanimous)\n8. Row 7: res - nc\n9. Row 8: res - win, method - decision (unanimous)\n10. Row 9: res - win, method - submission (choke)\n11. Row 10: res - loss\n12. Row 11: res - loss\n13. Row 12: res - loss\n14. Row 13: res - loss\n15. Row 14: res - loss\n16. Row 15: res - loss\n\nWait, but looking at the data, I see that Rob Emerson's name isn't appearing in any of these rows. The opponents listed are jared downing, savant young, justin salas, eric reynolds, rodney rhoden, nik lentz, phillipe nover, rafael dos anjos, kurt pellerin, etc. I don't see Rob Emerson as the opponent in any of these rows.\n\nSo that means there are zero instances where Rob Emerson won using a KO method. The claim says \"there be 3,\" which is clearly not true based on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"Rob Emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions Rob Emerson's career wins being exactly 10 matches. So, I need to check if there are any entries in the table for Rob Emerson and whether he has only won 10 fights. If there are no entries for him or if his total wins don't add up to exactly 10, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at the table's data, each row represents a fight event with details like outcome (win, loss, etc.), the score, opponent, method of victory or defeat, event name, round number, and location. The first column is \"res,\" which stands for result\u2014so that's where I should look to see if Rob Emerson has any wins or losses.\n\nI need to scan through each row to find any mention of Rob Emerson in the \"opponent\" column because that's where his name would appear as he was defeated by other fighters. If his name is there, we can count his wins and losses from those rows.\n\nLet me go through each fight:\n\n1. The first few rows don't mention Rob Emerson in the opponent column.\n2. Row 5 has \"rodney rhoden\" vs Rob Emerson? Wait, no, it's Rodney Rhoden fighting someone else. Wait, actually, looking at row 5: Opponent is \"rodney rhoden,\" so that's one of his wins, but that doesn't help because the claim is about Rob Emerson's wins.\n\nWait, I think I might be misunderstanding. The table lists each fight from different fighters' perspectives. So if a fighter won or lost against others, it's from their own records. So to find Rob Emerson's record, we need rows where the opponent is Rob Emerson.\n\nSo for example, if someone fought and defeated Rob Emerson, that row would show a loss for him. Similarly, if he fought and won, that row shows a win for him.\n\nTherefore, I should look through each row's opponent and see if any are \"Rob Emerson.\" Each time his name appears as the opponent, it means another fighter has beaten him, resulting in a loss for Rob. If he is listed as the fighter who won, then it's a win for him.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- None of the opponents are \"Rob Emerson.\" Instead, fighters like Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Javier Vazquez, Jamal Perkins, and others fought against other opponents, but I don't see Rob Emerson in any opponent column. That suggests that either Rob Emerson hasn't had any fights listed here, or perhaps he's represented differently.\n\nWait, maybe the names are slightly different? Let me check again. Looking at each row:\n\nRows 0 to 35 have opponents like \"dokonjonosuke mishima,\" \"javier vazquez,\" \"jamal perkins,\" etc. None of these seem to be Rob Emerson. So either there are no fights involving Rob Emerson in this table, or he's represented by another name.\n\nIf Rob Emerson isn't present as an opponent in any row, that means the data doesn't support his total wins being 10. Alternatively, if he is present but only with a certain number of wins, we can determine accordingly.\n\nBut since I don't see Rob Emerson's name in any opponent column, it implies that he hasn't fought anyone listed here, or perhaps the table doesn't cover all his fights. Therefore, there's no data to confirm whether he has exactly 10 wins. Without evidence in the table supporting this claim, it must be considered false.\n\nWait, but maybe Rob Emerson is not in the opponent column because the perspective is from other fighters. So for example, if Rob Emerson won a fight, that would be someone else's loss, and his own record would show a win. But since I don't see any rows where he is the winner or loser, it suggests that there are no entries for him.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the data provided because there's no information about Rob Emerson's wins or losses in this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"Rob Emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" cannot be verified as TRUE because there is no evidence of Rob Emerson's fights in the table. None of the opponents listed are Rob Emerson, and thus no data supports the claim of exactly 10 wins.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    ...\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"rob emerson play at the ufc 87 event 3 time in his career.\" So, I need to find if Rob Emerson has fought at UFC 87, specifically three times during his career.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any have \"Rob Emerson\" listed as the opponent. The columns relevant here are \"opponent,\" \"event,\" and possibly others like \"record\" for counting fights.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is \"jared downing.\" Not Rob Emerson.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is \"savant young.\" Nope.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is \"justin salas.\" No.\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is \"eric reynolds.\" Still no.\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is \"rodney rhoden.\" Not him either.\n6. **Row 5**: Opponent is \"nik lentz.\" No match.\n7. **Row 6**: Opponent is \"phillipe nover.\" Hmm, wait, Rob Emerson's last name might be spelled differently?\n8. **Row 7**: Opponent is \"rafael dos anjos.\" Not him.\n9. **Row 8**: Opponent is \"kurt pellegrino.\" No match.\n10. **Row 9**: Opponent is \"manny gamburyan.\" Still not Rob Emerson.\n11. **Row 10**: Opponent is \"keita nakamura.\" Nope.\n12. **Row 11**: Opponent is \"gray maynard.\" Not him either.\n13. **Row 12**: Opponent is \"kenji arai.\" No match.\n14. **Row 13**: Opponent is \"takafumi ito.\" Still not Rob Emerson.\n15. **Row 14**: Opponent is \"jamie schmidt.\" No.\n16. **Row 15**: Opponent is \"julian samaniego.\" Not him.\n17. **Row 16**: Opponent is \"melvin guillard.\" Nope.\n18. **Row 17**: Opponent is \"randy Berkley.\" Wait, there's a row where the opponent might be Rob Emerson.\n\nWait, let me check again. I think I might have missed something earlier. Let me go back:\n\n- Row 6: Opponent is \"phillipe nover.\" Maybe I'm misremembering Rob Emerson's name. Could it be Phillippe or another variation?\nWait, the claim mentions \"Rob Emerson,\" so the opponent should be \"Rob Emerson\" or similar.\n\nLooking again, in row 9: Opponent is \"manny gamburyan.\" No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 27.\n\nLooking for the row where the opponent is \"Rob Emerson.\" But in the table provided, none of the opponents seem to be Rob Emerson. Wait, but maybe his name is listed differently? Or maybe he's not in the table?\n\nWait, perhaps I confused Rob Emerson with another fighter. Let me think about UFC events and fighters. Rob Emerson was an American kickboxer who competed in MMA. He fought in the UFC around 2003-2004.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 6: Opponent is \"phillipe nover.\" Maybe it's Phil Collins? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing names. Let me check the columns again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson isn't in this table, which would mean he didn't fight at UFC 87 or any other events listed here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: UFC 87 took place on October 19, 2007, in Las Vegas. The main event was Chuck Liddell vs. Wanderlei Silva. Rob Emerson fought earlier in his career; perhaps he was scheduled for a later card or a different event.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see \"Rob Emerson\" listed as an opponent in any of these rows. So perhaps he wasn't part of this table, meaning he didn't fight at UFC 87 or not three times.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think again: Rob Emerson was a fighter known for his striking and kickboxing background. He fought in the UFC, but perhaps not as many times as claimed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes him under another name or at a different row. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn row 6: Opponent is \"phillipe nover.\" Could this be Rob Emerson? Maybe a typo.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row's event column to see if any of them are UFC 87. So, the \"event\" column might have \"UFC 87.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: Event is \"deep - 14th impact.\" No.\nRow 1: Event is \"shooto usa...\" No.\n...\nWait, let me check each row's event to see if any are UFC 87.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 6: Opponent is \"phillipe nover,\" and the event is \"deep - 14th impact.\" No, that's a Japanese event.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for an event named \"UFC 87\" in the table. Let me scan each row's \"event\" column:\n\nLooking at the list of events in each row, none seem to be \"UFC 87.\"\n\nTherefore, it's possible that Rob Emerson didn't fight at UFC 87, or if he did, it wasn't recorded here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't include all his fights. But according to this data, there's no entry for Rob Emerson fighting at any event listed here, including UFC 87.\n\nSo, based on the table provided, there is no evidence that Rob Emerson fought three times at UFC 87 in his career.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: The relevant cells are in row 6 where the opponent is \"phillipe nover\" and the event is \"deep - 14th impact,\" which doesn't match Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87 three times.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds be the only match to have a decision method.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which matches involve Rob Emerson and Eric Reynolds. Looking at the table, each row represents a different fight. Each row has several columns: res (result), record (probably the fighter's name?), opponent, method, event, round, and location.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Rob Emerson fought Eric Reynolds. Let me scan the \"opponent\" column because if Rob Emerson is the one fighting, then the opponent would be Eric Reynolds. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- The fourth row has \"eric reynolds\" as the opponent. The result there is a win by decision (split). So that's Rob Emerson vs. Eric Reynolds.\n- Any other matches involving these two? Let me check all rows.\n\nFrom what I see, only one match in the table is between Rob Emerson and Eric Reynolds. It\u2019s row 3 (if we start counting from 0, it's index 3) with result \"win\", method \"decision (split)\", event \"art of fighting 10\". \n\nNow, the claim says that this is the only match to have a decision method. I need to check if any other fights in the table also ended with a decision.\n\nI'll go through each row and look at the method column:\n- Row 0: submission\n- Row 1: submission\n- Row 2: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 3: decision (split) \u2192 this is our target match.\n- Row 4: tko\n- Row 5: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 6: no contest\n- Row 7: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 8: tko\n- Row 9: submission\n- Row 10: tko\n- Row 11: decision (split)\n- Row 12: submission\n- Row 13: decision (split)\n- Row 14: no contest (double ko)\n- Row 15: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 16: tko\n- Row 17: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 18: decision (split)\n- Row 19: submission\n- Row 20: tko\n- Row 21: decision (split)\n- Row 22: submission (choke)\n- Row 23: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 24: tko\n- Row 25: decision (split)\n- Row 26: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 27: tko\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me recount each row's method:\n\nRow 0: submission\nRow 1: submission\nRow 2: decision (unanimous)\nRow 3: decision (split) \u2192 target match\nRow 4: tko\nRow 5: decision (unanimous)\nRow 6: no contest\nRow 7: submission\nRow 8: tko\nRow 9: submission\nRow10: tko\nRow11: decision (split)\nRow12: submission\nRow13: tko\nRow14: no contest\nRow15: decision (unanimous)\nRow16: submission\nRow17: decision (unanimous)\nRow18: tko\nRow19: submission\nRow20: tko\nRow21: decision (split)\nRow22: submission\nRow23: tko\nRow24: submission\nRow25: tko\nRow26: decision (split)\nRow27: tko\n\nWait, no, perhaps I went beyond the table. The original table has 28 rows? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the table ends at row 27 (0-based), which is the last entry for Jens Pulver vs. Jens Pulver? Or maybe I miscounted. Regardless, I need to check all rows for decision methods besides our target match.\n\nFrom this list, other than Rob Emerson's fight with Eric Reynolds (row3), there are several fights that ended with a decision:\n\n- Row2: decision (unanimous)\n- Row5: decision (unanimous)\n- Row7: submission? No, wait, row7 is \"submission\" or tko? Wait, let me check each again.\n\nWait, actually, the method column for each row needs to be checked properly. Let me list all rows with their results:\n\nRow0: res=win, method=submission\nRow1: res=win, method=submission\nRow2: res=win, method=decision (unanimous)\nRow3: res=win, method=decision (split) \u2192 target match\nRow4: res=win, method=tko\nRow5: res=loss, method=decision (unanimous)\nWait no, row5's result is a loss for Rob Emerson? Wait, no, let me check each row's \"res\" column.\n\nActually, the \"res\" column indicates whether it was a win or loss. For example:\n\n- Row0: res=win \u2192 so the fighter won\n- Row1: res=win\n- Row2: res=loss\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the columns. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row has multiple columns: res (result), record (maybe fighter's name?), opponent, method, event, round, location.\n\nSo, for each fight, res is either \"win\" or \"loss\". So, if a fighter won, then the opponent lost.\n\nBut regardless of that, I need to check all rows where the method is decision, not just wins. Because the claim is about any match having a decision method, regardless of who won.\n\nSo in our table:\n\nLooking for any row where the method is \"decision\".\n\nFrom my initial list, let's see:\n\nRow2: res=loss (so opponent won), method=decision (unanimous)\nRow3: res=win, method=decision (split) \u2192 target match\nRow5: res=loss (opponent won), method=decision (unanimous)\nRow7: res=win, method=submission? Or maybe it's tko. Wait, row7's method is submission.\nWait no, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me list each row with the correct method:\n\nRow0: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow1: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow2: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (unanimous)\nRow3: res=win, opponent=eric reynolds, method=decision (split)\nRow4: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow5: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (unanimous)\nRow6: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=no contest\nRow7: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow8: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow9: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow10: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow11: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (split)\nRow12: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow13: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow14: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=no contest\nRow15: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (unanimous)\nRow16: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow17: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (unanimous)\nRow18: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow19: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow20: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow21: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (split)\nRow22: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow23: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow24: res=win, opponent=unknown, method=submission\nRow25: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=tko\nRow26: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=decision (split)\nRow27: res=loss, opponent=unknown, method=tko\n\nWait, no. I think I'm miscounting the rows. Let me make it clear:\n\nFrom the original list, each row's result is a win or loss for the fighter in that row.\n\nNow, focusing on the \"method\" column, regardless of who won, we need to count all matches where the method was a decision (either unanimous or split).\n\nSo from the table, rows 2,3,5,11,15,17,21,26 have methods as decision (unanimous) or decision (split). That's more than just row3.\n\nTherefore, besides our target match in row3, there are at least 8 other matches where the method was a decision. Therefore, the claim is false because there are other matches with a decision method.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that only one match ended with a decision is incorrect. There are multiple matches in the provided data where the method of resolution was a decision.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false. There are multiple matches where the method of resolution was a decision, including matches not involving Rob Emerson and Eric Reynolds.",
