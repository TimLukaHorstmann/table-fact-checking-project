    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the 200 m individual medley take place on 19 december 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll try to understand what's being claimed here. The event in question is the \"200 m individual medley,\" and it's stated that this took place on December 19, 2009.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an event with details like the name of the event, time, date, meet, and location. My task is to find a row where both the event is \"200 m individual medley\" and the date matches \"19 december 2009.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to see which ones match these criteria. Let's go step by step.\n\nThe first row is about \"50 m freestyle,\" so that's not relevant. Next, \"100 m freestyle\" also doesn't match. The third row talks about \"200 m freestyle,\" but again, it's a different event. Fourth row is \"400 m freestyle,\" so no. Fifth and sixth rows are about \"800 m freestyle\" and \"1500 m freestyle\"\u2014still not the individual medley.\n\nSeventh row is about \"50 m backstroke.\" Eighth row is \"100 m backstroke,\" and ninth is \"200 m backstroke.\" None of these match the event name. Then, tenth row is \"50 m breaststroke,\" eleventh is \"100 m breaststroke,\" twelfth is \"200 m breaststroke\"\u2014none are individual medley.\n\nThirteenth row is about the butterfly events: \"50 m butterfly\" and \"100 m butterfly.\" Fourteenth is \"200 m butterfly.\" Fifteenth row is the \"100 m individual medley\"\u2014that's a different event. Sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth rows are about breaststroke again. Nineteenth is \"200 m individual medley.\" Wait, that seems promising.\n\nLet me check the date for this row. The date listed is \"19 december 2009,\" which matches exactly what the claim states. So, this row has both the correct event name and the date specified in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to verify if there's another row that also matches these two criteria. Scanning further, I see that rows beyond the nineteenth don't include the \"200 m individual medley\" event anymore; they're about relay events like \"450 m freestyle relay,\" etc., which are different. So, only one row matches both the event and date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. The relevant cells would be the specific row indices and column names where these conditions are met.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the 200 m individual medley be the only event on 19 december 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that on December 19th, 2009, there was only one event: the 200 m individual medley. So, I need to check if any other events occurred on that date.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an event with various details including the event name, time, date, meet, and location. The columns are \"event,\" \"time,\" \"date,\" \"meet,\" and \"location.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the \"date\" is December 19, 2009. I'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 3: 400 m freestyle at 18 Dec 2009\n2. Row 6: 1500 m freestyle at 14 Oct 2007\n3. Row 8: 50 m backstroke on Dec 16, 2012\n4. Row 10: 100 m backstroke on Dec 16, 2011\n5. Row 13: 50 m breaststroke on Nov 15, 2009\n6. Row 14: 100 m breaststroke on Dec 19, 2009\n7. Row 15: 200 m breaststroke on Dec 18, 2009\n8. Row 16: 50 m butterfly on Nov 15, 2009\n9. Row 17: 100 m butterfly on Oct 30, 2010\n10. Row 20: 200 m individual medley on Dec 19, 2009 (this is the event we're focusing on)\n11. Row 21: 400 m individual medley on Dec 18, 2009\n12. Row 22: 450 m freestyle relay on Mar 18, 2004\n13. Row 23: 4100 m medley relay on Dec 16, 2011\n\nFrom this, I can see that multiple events took place on December 19th and 18th of 2009. Specifically, on Dec 19, there's the 100 m breaststroke and the 200 m individual medley. So, there are at least two events on that date.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me check again. The claim is about December 19, 2009. Looking at row 20, it's the 200 m individual medley on Dec 19, 2009. Then, row 14 is 100 m breaststroke also on Dec 19, 2009. So that makes two events.\n\nSo, there are multiple events on December 19th, which means the claim is incorrect\u2014it's not the only event that day. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to find all rows where the date is Dec 19, 2009 and check their \"event\" column. So, row indices 14 (100 m breaststroke) and 20 (200 m individual medley). Thus, these two are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
