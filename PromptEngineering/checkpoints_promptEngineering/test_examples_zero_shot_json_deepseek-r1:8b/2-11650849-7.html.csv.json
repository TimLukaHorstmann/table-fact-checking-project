    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"On Sunday, September 30, the Chicago Bear beat the Green Bay Packers 31 - 21.\" Wait, no, actually looking back at the claim, it says the Chicago Bear beat the Packers with a score of 31-20. Hmm, but in the table, I'll need to check if there's a game on that specific date and whether the result matches.\n\nFirst, I should go through each row of the table and see if any match the date \"Sunday, September 30.\" The columns are year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, location. So I'm looking for rows where the date is exactly \"sunday , september 30\" as per the format in the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 2: 1950, \"sunday , october 15\", ...\nRow 3: 1951, \"sunday , september 30\", ...\nSo that's row index 2 (since it starts from 0) with columns:\n- year: 1951\n- date: \"sunday , september 30\"\n- winner: chicago bears\n- result: 31 - 20\n- loser: green bay packers\n\nWait, the claim says Chicago Bear beat Packers 31-21. But in the table, that game resulted in 31-20. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nRow index 2 (third row) is:\nyear:1951\ndate:\"sunday , september 30\"\nwinner:chicago bears\nresult:31 - 20\nloser:green bay packers\n\nSo the result was 31-20, not 31-21. Therefore, the claim's score doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading the row index. Let me count again:\n\nThe first data array is row 0, second row1, up to row13 for 1959.\n\nLooking for \"sunday , september 30\" as date.\n\nRow2: yes, that's 1951, September 30.\n\nSo the result was 31-20, so the claim says 31-21. Therefore, it's incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are row2, columns date, winner, result, loser, etc., but only those columns that have data relevant to verifying the claim.\n\nWait, what exactly is needed? The instruction says:\n\nCarefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n\nThe claim has four main points: date, teams involved (Chicago Bear vs Green Bay Packers), result score, and location. Wait, no, location isn't mentioned in the claim. So the relevant columns would be date, winner, result, loser.\n\nSo for the date, I need to check if there's a row with \"sunday , september 30\". For teams, check if Chicago is winner and Packers are loser. Then check if the result matches.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow index2 (since that's the only one matching September 30), columns: date, winner, result, loser.\n\nWait, but in the table, for each row, all the data points are present, so to verify the claim, I need to check if any of those columns don't match. So for the date, it does exist, but the result doesn't match. Therefore, the cells that confirm this would be:\n\n- The row with \"sunday , september 30\" as date: that's row index2.\n\nSo in terms of columns, we need to check:\n\n- winner: chicago bears\n- result: 31 - 20 (not 31 -21)\n- loser: green bay packers\n\nThus, the relevant cells are all these four columns for that specific row.\n\nWait, but the column names in the table are year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, location. So for each of these columns, we need to check if they match.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include each of these four columns (date, winner, result, loser) from that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"loser\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the chicago bear be the loser against the green bay packer more than 10 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the Chicago Bears lost against the Green Bay Packers more than 10 times. So I need to check how many times the Bears were the losers when playing against the Packers in the games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with several columns: year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, and location. The relevant columns for this claim are \"winner\" and \"loser,\" specifically looking at which team lost each game where they played against each other.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to identify the games where Chicago Bears (Bears) were the losers against Green Bay Packers (Packers). For each such occurrence, I'll count it.\n\nLet me list out all the rows and note down when Bears are the loser against Packers:\n\n1. First row: Year 1950, Bears vs Packers at Green Bay. Result is Packers won 31-21. So Packers won; Bears lost here.\n2. Second row: 1950, Packers won again with 28-14. Bears lost.\n3. Third row: 1951, Bears won against Packers (31-20). Not a loss for Bears.\n4. Fourth row: 1951, Bears won again (24-13). Packers lost here.\n5. Fifth row: 1952, Bears lost to Packers 24-14 at Green Bay.\n6. Sixth row: 1952, Packers won against Bears 41-28 at Chicago.\n7. Seventh row: 1953, Bears won 17-13 at Green Bay.\n8. Eighth row: 1953, Bears won again with a tie (21-21) at Chicago.\n9. Ninth row: 1954, Bears lost to Packers 10-3 at Green Bay.\n10. Tenth row: 1954, Bears won against Packers 28-23 at Chicago.\n11. Eleventh row: 1955, Packers won against Bears 24-3 at Green Bay.\n12. Twelfth row: 1955, Bears lost to Packers 52-31 at Chicago.\n13. Thirteenth row: 1956, Bears lost to Packers 37-21 at Green Bay.\n14. Fourteenth row: 1956, Bears won against Packers 38-14 at Chicago.\n15. Fifteenth row: 1957, Packers won against Bears 21-17 at Green Bay.\n16. Sixteenth row: 1957, Bears lost to Packers 21-14 at Chicago.\n17. Seventeenth row: 1958, Bears lost to Packers 34-20 at Green Bay.\n18. Eighteenth row: 1958, Bears won against Packers 24-10 at Chicago.\n19. Nineteenth row: 1959, Packers won against Bears 9-6 at Green Bay.\n20. Twentieth row: 1959, Bears lost to Packers 28-17 at Chicago.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times Bears were losers against Packers:\n\nFrom rows 1 (loss), 2 (loss), 5 (loss), 6 (loss), 9 (loss), 11 (loss), 12 (loss), 13 (loss), 15 (loss), 16 (loss), 17 (loss), 19 (loss). Wait, that seems more than 10. Let me recount each row where Bears lost:\n\n1. Row 0: loss\n2. Row 1: loss\n3. Row 4: loss\n4. Row 5: loss\n5. Row 12: loss\n6. Row 13: loss\n7. Row 16: loss\n8. Row 17: loss\n9. Row 19: loss\n\nWait, that's nine times? Let me count again properly:\n\nRows where Bears lost against Packers:\n\n- 0: Yes\n- 1: Yes\n- 4: Yes (1952)\n- 5: Yes (Packers won at Chicago)\n- 12: Yes (1955, lost at Chicago)\n- 13: Yes (lost in 1956)\n- 16: Yes (lost in 1957)\n- 17: Yes (lost in 1958)\n- 19: Yes (lost in 1959)\n\nWait, that's only 9 times. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: loss\nRow1: loss\nRow4: loss (Packers won at Green Bay)\nRow5: Packers won at Chicago (Bears lost)\nRow6: Packers won but it's a home game for Packers, Bears are the loser.\nWait, row6 is 1952, result Packers 41-28. So yes, Bears lost.\n\nThen row12: Packers won, so Bears lost.\nRow13: Packers won, so Bears lost.\nRow16: Packers won at Chicago (Bears lost)\nRow17: Packers won at Green Bay, Bears lost.\nRow19: Packers won at Green Bay, Bears lost.\n\nSo that's:\n\nRows 0,1,4,5,6,12,13,16,17,19. That's 10 times where Bears lost against Packers.\n\nWait, row5 is Packers winning in their home game (Green Bay), so Bears are the loser.\n\nSimilarly, row6: Packers won at Chicago, so Bears lost.\n\nRow12: Packers won at Green Bay.\nRow13: Packers won at Chicago.\nRow16: Packers won at Chicago.\nRow17: Packers won at Green Bay.\nRow19: Packers won at Green Bay.\n\nSo that's:\n\n0,1,4,5,6,12,13,16,17,19: total of 10 times.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"more than 10 times,\" but according to this count, it's exactly 10 times. So is 10 more than 10? No, because \"more than\" implies greater than 10, so 10 is not more than 10.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all the rows where Bears lost:\n\n- Row0: loss\n- Row1: loss\n- Row4: loss\n- Row5: loss (Packers won at Chicago)\n- Row6: loss (Packers won at Chicago)\n- Row12: loss\n- Row13: loss\n- Row16: loss\n- Row17: loss\n- Row19: loss\n\nThat's 10 times. So the claim says \"more than 10,\" which is false because it's exactly 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed some rows. Let me check all 20 rows:\n\nRow0: Packers won (loss for Bears)\nRow1: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow2: Bears won\nRow3: Bears won\nRow4: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow5: Packers won at Chicago (Bears lost)\nRow6: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow7: Bears won\nRow8: Bears tied (not a loss)\nRow9: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow10: Bears won\nRow11: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow12: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow13: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow14: Bears won\nRow15: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow16: Packers won at Chicago (Bears lost)\nRow17: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow18: Bears won\nRow19: Packers won (Bears lost)\nRow20: Not present.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the times when Packers won, which would mean Bears lost:\n\nLooking for \"loser\" column where it's Bears and \"winner\" is Packers.\n\nAlternatively, since the \"loser\" column has either Bears or Packers, we can just count how many times \"Chicago Bear\" appears in the loser column against Packers as winner.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: Loser - Chicago Bear (Packers won)\nRow1: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow4: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow5: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow6: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow12: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow13: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow16: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow17: Loser - Chicago Bear\nRow19: Loser - Chicago Bear\n\nThat's 10 times. So the claim is that they lost more than 10 times, which would be false because it's exactly 10 times.\n\nWait, but in row8 and others, there are ties or wins by Bears, so only losses where Packers won are counted. So yes, 10 times.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Bears lost to the Green Bay Packers at least 10 times. The claim that they lost more than 10 times is false.\n\nAnswer: The Chicago Bears lost to the Green Bay Packers exactly 10 times, not more than 10 times.",
