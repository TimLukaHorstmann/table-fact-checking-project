    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a friendly competition is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the friendly competition on 26 may 1999 take place at lugo , emilia - romagna.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to see what information it's providing. It mentions a friendly competition that happened on May 26, 1999, in Lugo, Emilia-Romagna.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an event with several attributes: goal, date, venue, result, competition, and scored. The columns are: goal, date, venue, result, competition, scored.\n\nI'll need to search through each row to see if any match all the criteria of the claim. Let's go step by step.\n\n1. **Date**: The claim specifies the date as May 26, 1999. So I should look for a row where the \"date\" column is exactly that. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: 25 september 1993 \u2192 Not matching.\n- Row 1: 6 november 1993 \u2192 No.\n- Row 2: 13 march 1994 \u2192 No.\n- Row 3: 17 april 1994 \u2192 No.\n- Row 4: 8 june 1995 \u2192 No.\n- Row 5: 19 november 1995 \u2192 No.\n- Row 6: 23 may 1998 \u2192 Close, but May 23 vs. May 26.\n- Row 7: 13 september 1998 \u2192 No.\n- Row 8: 11 october 1998 \u2192 No.\n- Row 9: 26 may 1999 \u2192 This matches the date in the claim.\n\nSo row 9 has the correct date.\n\n2. **Venue**: The claim mentions the venue as Lugo, Emilia-Romagna. Let's check row 9's \"venue\" column.\n\nRow 9's venue is listed as \"lugo , emilia - romagna.\" This matches exactly with the claim.\n\n3. **Competition Type**: The claim refers to a friendly competition. Looking at the table, I need to see what competition type row 9 has.\n\nRow 9's competition is \"friendly,\" which aligns with the claim's description of it being a friendly match.\n\n4. **Any Other Rows?**: I should ensure there are no other rows that might also fit the criteria to prevent any confusion.\n\nLooking back, row 6 has a date in May but on the 23rd and venue is different. No other rows have both the correct date and competition type mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by row 9. So, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"lugo , emilia - romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 may 1999 and the result be 2 - 4.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if any match all these conditions. The columns we need to check are \"venue\", \"competition\", \"date\", and \"result\".\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. **Row 17**: The venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna\". The competition is listed as \"friendly\", which matches. The date is \"26 may 1999\". Let's look at the result: it says \"1 - 4\". Hmm, that doesn't match the claim's \"2 - 4\".\n\nWait, maybe I should check other rows just in case there are multiple entries for the same venue and competition, but I don't think so. Let me see if any other row matches.\n\n2. **Row 18**: Venue is \"odense stadion , odense\", so not matching. \n\n3. **Row 19**: Doesn't match. \n\n4. And so on; none of the others have venue as \"lugo , emilia - romagna\" with competition as friendly except row 17, but its result doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in checking row 17's result. Let me confirm: yes, it's \"1 - 4\", not \"2 - 4\". So the result is different from what the claim says.\n\nIs there another row with all four conditions? Let me go through each one again.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column for \"26 may 1999\": only row 17 has that date. The competition in that row is \"friendly\", and venue is correct, but the result isn't matching. So none of the rows fully satisfy all conditions: venue, competition, date, and result as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no matching row with all those specifics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any row in the table as it doesn't match the specified venue, competition, date, and result. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
