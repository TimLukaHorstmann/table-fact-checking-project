    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 0 drawn for 7 game with 4 loss , 19 - 19 point differential and 6 point.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here. It probably means \"there should be\" instead of \"there be,\" so let me rephrase it as: \"There should be 0 drawn games in 7 matches with 4 losses, a points difference of 19 - 19 and a total of 6 points.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a game or set of games. The columns are: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into key parts:\n\n1. **0 drawn games in 7 matches:** So, we're looking for rows where the \"drawn\" column is 0 and the \"games\" column is 7.\n2. **4 losses in 7 matches:** So, each of these rows should have a \"lost\" count of 4 when combined across 7 games, but since each row seems to represent a single game or set of games, maybe each row has specific numbers for drawn and lost per game.\n3. **Points difference of 19 - 19:** That's 0 points difference because 19 -19 is zero.\n4. **Total points scored is 6:** So the \"points\" column should be 6.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row seems to represent a single game or perhaps a group of games. The first column is labeled \"games,\" which might indicate how many games were played in that row. But looking at the data, all rows have \"7\" under the \"games\" column except for the last two, which also have 7. So each row represents something related to 7 games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the columns again: \"games,\" \"drawn,\" \"lost,\" \"points difference,\" and \"points.\" It seems like each row is a record of a game or a set of games. For example, the first row has 7 games, 1 drawn, 0 lost, points difference of 41-16, and total points 13.\n\nSo for the claim, we're looking for rows where:\n\n- \"drawn\" = 0\n- \"lost\" = 4 (since 4 loss)\n- \"points difference\" = 19 - 19 = 0\n- \"points\" = 6\n\nWait, but the points difference is given as a string like \"41 - 16,\" so I can't directly compare it numerically unless I parse it. That might complicate things.\n\nLet me go through each row and see which ones match these criteria.\n\nRow 0: games=7, drawn=1, lost=0, points diff=41-16 (so 25), points=13 \u2192 Doesn't match because drawn isn't 0, lost is 0, but not 4. Points are 13, not 6.\n\nRow 1: games=7, drawn=4, lost=0, points diff=30-21=9, points=10 \u2192 Drawn isn't 0, lost isn't 4.\n\nRow 2: games=7, drawn=1, lost=2, points diff=24-20=4, points=9 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nRow3: games=7, drawn=2, lost=2, points diff=23-28=-5 (but as a string), points=8 \u2192 No.\n\nRow4: games=7, drawn=1, lost=3, points diff=22-15=7, points=7 \u2192 No.\n\nRow5: games=7, drawn=0, lost=4, points diff=19-19=0, points=6 \u2192 This seems to match exactly. Drawn is 0, lost is 4, points difference is 0, and points are 6.\n\nRow6: games=7, drawn=0, lost=6, points diff=13-26=-13, points=2 \u2192 Doesn't match because lost isn't 4.\n\nRow7: games=7, drawn=1, lost=6, points diff=13-40=-27, points=1 \u2192 No.\n\nSo only row5 matches all the criteria in the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row5's \"drawn,\" \"lost,\" \"points difference,\" and \"points\" columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
