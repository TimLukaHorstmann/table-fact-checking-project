    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"since gp / g did not play in 2004 , no goal be score that year.\" So, the claim is stating that because 'gp/gs' (which I assume stands for games played/games started) didn't play in 2004, there were no goals scored that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to verify if this statement holds true. To do this, I should check the relevant data points mentioned in the claim.\n\nThe key terms here are 'gp/gs' and 'goals'. So, I'll look for these columns in the table. From the 'columns' array, I see 'gp / gs' and 'goals', so those are the relevant columns.\n\nNext, I need to find the data corresponding to 2004. Scanning through the 'data' rows, I notice that there's a row with \"2004\" as the year, but all its values are \"did not play\". So, in 2004, the player didn't play any games, which means he wasn't on the ice or participating in matches that season.\n\nSince 'gp/gs' for 2004 is \"did not play\", this supports the claim's premise. Now, looking at the 'goals' column for 2004, it's also marked as \"did not play\". This means there were no goals scored because the player didn't play.\n\nTherefore, the claim that since 'gp/gs' didn't play in 2004, there were no goals that year is supported by the data. The relevant cells are the ones for 2004 under both 'gp / gs' and 'goals'.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other columns or rows. The claim doesn't mention 'assists' or 'total points', so those aren't needed here. Only 'gp/gs' and 'goals' are relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement is true because both 'gp/gs' and goals show that the player didn't play in 2004, leading to no goals scored.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no assist in the year with a total of 2 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. The user is saying that there are no assists recorded for a specific year where the total points were 2. So, I need to find if any row in the table has both \"assists\" as 0 and \"total points\" equal to 2.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: year, gp/gs, goals, assists, total points. The data includes multiple rows from 1996 to 2005, plus a totals row at the end.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for assists and total points:\n\n1. 1996: assists=2, total points=8 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n2. 1997: assists=1, total points=3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n3. 1998: assists=0, total points=0 \u2192 No assists but points aren't 2.\n4. 1999: assists=4, total points=18 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n5. 2000: all fields are \"did not play\" \u2192 Ignore as no data.\n6. 2001: same as 2000 \u2192 Ignore.\n7. 2002: assists=0, total points=2 \u2192 This matches the condition (assists=0 and total points=2).\n8. 2003-2004: all \"did not play\" \u2192 Ignore.\n9. 2005: assists=0, total points=8 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n10. Totals row: assists=7, total points=39 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nSo in 2002, the year with total points of 2 does have assists recorded as 0. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there was a year (2002) with total points 2 and no assists. Wait, but the claim says \"no assist,\" implying that it should have no assists for that year. However, in 2002, assists are 0, so technically, there were no assists, which would make the statement TRUE? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the claim is about a year with total points of 2 having no assists. The table shows that in 2002, total points=2 and assists=0. So does that mean the statement is FALSE because it claims there are no assists (which is correct), but actually, there were none? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is stating that \"there be no assist,\" meaning that for the year with 2 points, there were zero assists. Since 2002 has total points=2 and assists=0, it supports the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because in the year where total points are 2, there are indeed no assists.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"there be no assist,\" which might mean that for all years with 2 points, there's no assists. But looking at the table, only 2002 has total points=2 and assists=0. So the claim is specifically about a year (the one with 2 points) having no assists. Since that's true, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me clarify: The claim says \"there be no assist in the year with a total of 2 point.\" That implies that for that specific year, there are zero assists. In 2002, total points=2 and assists=0, which fits this condition. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the answer was FALSE because I misread the claim. Let me make sure: The user's instruction says to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table. So in 2002, total points=2 and assists=0, so the claim is supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where \"total points\" is 2 (which is in row 7) and \"assists\" is 0 (also in row 7). \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the total number of points in the year with 7 assists be 39.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key terms here are \"total number of points\" and \"year with 7 assists.\" \n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for year, gp/gs, goals, assists, and total points. Each row represents a different year from 1996 to 2005, except the last row which is labeled as \"totals.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if any year in the table had exactly 7 assists and calculate the total points for that year. If such a year exists and its total points equal 39, then the claim is true.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- 1996: assist = 2\n- 1997: assist = 1\n- 1998: assist = 0\n- 1999: assist = 4\n- 2000 and 2001: did not play, so assists are N/A\n- 2002: assist = 0\n- 2003 to 2004: did not play\n- 2005: assist = 0\n\nNone of the years have an assist count of exactly 7.

Therefore, the claim might be false.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"year with 7 assists.\" Perhaps it's not about a specific year but cumulatively over all years? No, that doesn't make sense because each row is for a specific year except the last one which is totals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"7 assist\" refers to the total across all seasons. But the claim says \"in the year,\" so it's probably about a single year.\n\nSince none of the rows have 7 assists in a single year, the claim can't be true based on the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a row or misread. Let me list out all the assist numbers again:\n\n1996:2\n1997:1\n1998:0\n1999:4\n2000:N/A\n2001:N/A\n2002:0\n2003-2004:N/A\n2005:0\n\nNo, none of these are 7. So the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a year where a player had exactly 7 assists and accumulated 39 total points. Checking each year's data in the table reveals that no single year has 7 assists.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the gp / g in the year that have 1 assist be 6 / 0\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"gp / g\" refers to \"games played / games started,\" I think. Then, it mentions a specific situation: in the year where the team had exactly 1 assist, their gp/g should be 6/0. So I need to look for rows where the assists are 1 and check what their gp/g is.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year from 1996 to 2005, plus a totals row. The columns include year, gp/gs, goals, assists, and total points. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find where the assists column has a value of 1.\n\nStarting with 1996: assists are 2. Not 1.\n1997: assists are 1. Okay, this is a relevant row. Let's check their gp/gs. The row says \"6 / 0\". So in 1997, when they had 1 assist, the gp/g was 6/0.\n\nWait, does that match the claim? The claim is about the year with 1 assist having a gp/g of 6/0. Yes, exactly. So this row seems to support the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where assists equal 1 because maybe the claim is about all such years or just one. Looking further: \n\n2002 has assists as 0.\n2005 has assists as 0.\nSo only 1997 and possibly others, but in this table, only 1997 has 1 assist.\n\nTherefore, since 1997's gp/g is 6/0 when they had 1 assist, the claim holds true based on that row. So I think the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being 1997's row for the \"assists\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the year 1997 where the assists were 1 and the gp/g was 6/0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"10 goal be score in the year 1996 to 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It says that there was a situation where a player scored 10 goals within the years from 1996 to 2005. However, upon reading it again, it's a bit unclear whether \"10 goal be score\" refers to a specific event or an average. But looking at the table, each row represents a year and some statistics about a player's performance that season.\n\nNext, I should go through each relevant year in the claim: 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005. For each of these years, I need to check if there was a player who scored exactly 10 goals.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1996 (row index 0), the \"goals\" column shows 3.\n- 1997: 1 goal\n- 1998: 0 goals\n- 1999: 7 goals\n- 2002: 1 goal\n- 2005: 4 goals\n\nI notice that none of these years have a player scoring exactly 10 goals. The closest is 7 in 1999 and 4 in 2005, but nothing reaches 10.\n\nAdditionally, the last row (row index 9) labeled \"totals\" has a total points of 39, which might imply cumulative stats across all those years, but it doesn't specify individual yearly goals. However, since each year's data is separate, the totals aren't directly relevant to individual year performance.\n\nThe claim also mentions years from 1996 to 2005, so I should check each one for a 10-goal score, but as per the table, none meet this criterion. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because there was no player who scored exactly 10 goals in any of those years listed.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The columns we need are \"year\" and \"goals\". So for each year (1996-2005), I'll note their row indices and check the goals. Even though none have 10 goals, all these rows are relevant to assess whether the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a given table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the gp / g be mark as did not play in 2003 when the total point be mark as did not play as well.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems to state that for the year 2003, both the \"gp / gs\" and \"total points\" columns have entries marked as \"did not play\". So, my job is to check if in the provided table, for the year 2003, both these two cells are marked as \"did not play\".\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has a list of columns which include \"year\", \"gp / gs\", \"goals\", \"assists\", and \"total points\". The data rows represent different years from 1996 to 2005, with some entries showing \"did not play\" for certain years.\n\nSo, I need to find the row corresponding to 2003. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- 1996: All cells filled normally.\n- 1997: Similarly filled.\n- 1998: Same as above.\n- 1999: Normal entries except \"gp / gs\" is 17/1, so that's fine.\n- 2000: All marked as \"did not play\".\n- 2001: Same as 2000.\n- 2002: 4/0 in gp/gs, which seems normal since he played but didn't score or assist? Wait, no, 4/0 means he played 4 games, started none. But does that count as \"did not play\"? Hmm, maybe, but let me check the claim again.\n- 2003: Now, looking at this row. According to the table, in 2003, all cells are marked as \"did not play\". So, both \"gp / gs\" and \"total points\" for 2003 are marked as \"did not play\".\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that. Let me check each year:\n\nLooking at the data array, the rows are structured with each sub-array representing a year. The last sub-array before totals is [ \"2003\", \"did not play\", ... ]. So yes, for 2003, \"gp / gs\" is \"did not play\", and \"total points\" is also \"did not play\".\n\nSo, both conditions in the claim are met: in 2003, \"gp / gs\" is marked as \"did not play\" and \"total points\" is also marked as \"did not play\". Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. I need to list which cells correspond to these two entries.\n\nFor \"gp / gs\" in 2003: It's in row 7 (since rows start from 0, so index 7). The column is \"gp / gs\".\n\nFor \"total points\" in 2003: Same row, column \"total points\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are at row indices 7 and 8? Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, each sub-array represents a year. The data array starts with 1996 as index 0:\n\n0: 1996\n1: 1997\n2: 1998\n3: 1999\n4: 2000\n5: 2001\n6: 2002\n7: 2003\n8: 2004\n9: 2005\n\nWait, no, the data array is as follows:\n\n[\n    [\n      \"1996\",\n      \"2 / 1\",\n      \"3\",\n      \"2\",\n      \"8\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"1997\",\n      \"6 / 0\",\n      \"1\",\n      \"1\",\n      \"3\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"1998\",\n      \"1 / 0\",\n      \"0\",\n      \"0\",\n      \"0\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"1999\",\n      \"17 / 1\",\n      \"7\",\n      \"4\",\n      \"18\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"2000\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"2001\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"2002\",\n      \"4 / 0\",\n      \"1\",\n      \"0\",\n      \"2\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"2003\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"2004\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\",\n      \"did not play\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"2005\",\n      \"5 / 1\",\n      \"4\",\n      \"0\",\n      \"8\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"totals\",\n      \"35 / 3\",\n      \"16\",\n      \"7\",\n      \"39\"\n    ]\n]\n\nSo, the 2003 row is at index 7. Therefore:\n\n- For \"gp / gs\", column name is \"gp / gs\" in row 7.\n- For \"total points\", column name is \"total points\" in row 7.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has the same structure: columns are as per the \"columns\" array. So for row 7 (2003), all cells except the first one (year) are \"did not play\".\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should be:\n\n- row_index:7, column_name:\"gp / gs\"\n- row_index:7, column_name:\"total points\"\n\nSo in the JSON response, these two cells are marked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both \"gp / g\" and \"total points\" for 2003 are marked as \"did not play\". The relevant cells are found at row index 7.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be only 1 assist in the year 2002\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: year, gp / gs, goals, assists, and total points. The data rows include various years from 1996 to 2005, along with some totals at the end. \n\nThe claim is specifically about the year 2002, so I should focus on the row where the year is 2002. Let me find that in the table. Scanning through the data, I see a row for 2002: \"2002\", \"4 / 0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"2\". \n\nNow, looking at the 'assists' column for this row, it's listed as 0. The claim says there should be only 1 assist in 2002. But here, the assists are 0, not 1. That seems to contradict the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Could there be another way to interpret 'assists'? Let me double-check the row for 2002 again. The data is: \"4 / 0\" in gp/gs, which probably means they played 4 games and didn't start any. Then goals are 1, assists 0, total points 2. So no, it's definitely 0.\n\nTherefore, since the table shows that in 2002, there were 0 assists, not 1, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the g in the year that have less than 1 assist be always 0.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's talking about the 'goals' column in the years where the number of assists is less than 1. Wait, no, actually, the term \"g\" might refer to goals. So, for any year where the number of assists is less than 1, the goals should be zero. \n\nLooking at the table columns: it's \"year,\" \"gp / gs,\" \"goals,\" \"assists,\" and \"total points.\" So, I need to check each row (each year) and see if in years with assists <1, the goals are always 0.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year 1996. Assists = 2. Since 2 >=1, doesn't apply.\nRow 1: Year 1997. Assists=1. Again, 1>=1, so no.\nRow 2: Year 1998. Assists=0. Now, since 0<1, we check goals. Goals here are 0. So it's 0 as claimed.\nRow 3: Year 1999. Assists=4. Doesn't apply.\nRows 4-5: Years 2000 and 2001 have \"did not play,\" so assists would be zero, but these are non-playing years. The claim talks about years with less than 1 assist, so maybe they don't count as regular years.\nRow 6: Year 2002. Assists=0. Goals are 1 here. Wait, that's a problem. If the year has assists <1 (which is 0), but goals are 1, which isn't 0. So this contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, in row 6, even though assists are 0, goals are 1. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not always zero in such cases.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for any year with less than 1 assist, the goals should be zero. However, looking at Year 2002 (row index 6), the assists are 0 but goals are 1, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the year with 18 points have 7 total assist\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then analyze each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific things: a year with 18 points and that year having 7 total assists. So, I need to find a year in the table where the \"total points\" column is 18 and check if the \"assists\" column for that year is 7.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, gp/gs, goals, assists, and total points. The data rows include various years, with some entries being \"did not play\". The last row is labeled as \"totals\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the total points are 18.\n\nStarting from the first data row (row index 0):\n- Year: 1996\n- Total points: 8 \u2192 Not 18\n\nRow index 1:\n- 1997, 3 points \u2192 No\n\nRow index 2:\n- 1998, 0 points \u2192 No\n\nRow index 3:\n- 1999, 18 total points. Now, I need to check the assists for this year.\n\nAssists in 1999: Looking at row index 3 under \"assists\" column, it's 4. So that's not 7. \n\nNext, any other rows with 18 points? Let me check:\n\nRow index 5 is 2002, total points 2 \u2192 No\n\nRow index 6 and onwards are all \"did not play\", so no points.\n\nWait, what about the \"totals\" row at row index 9 (since data starts from 0). The totals row shows total points as 39. That's not 18 either.\n\nSo, only in 1999 do we have 18 total points, but assists are 4, not 7. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no year with both 18 points and 7 assists.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The row where year=1999, columns: \"total points\" (to check for 18) and \"assists\" (to find it's not 7).\n2. Since no other rows have 18 points, I don't need to include others.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3, column_name \"total points\"\n- Row index 3, column_name \"assists\"\n\nThat should be all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in 1999, which has 18 total points, the assists are 4, not 7. The relevant cells confirming this are for 1999's total points and assists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the gp / g in 2003 , when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the gp / g in 2003 , when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal.\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down. I think the claim is saying that for the year 2003, whenever the 'total points' column is marked as \"did not play,\" there is exactly 1 goal scored.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find all rows related to 2003. The columns are year, gp/gs, goals, assists, total points.\n\nIn the data section, I see the following rows for 2003:\n\n[\n  \"2003\",\n  \"did not play\",\n  \"did not play\",\n  \"did not play\",\n  \"did not play\"\n]\n\nSo in 2003, all entries for 'total points' are \"did not play,\" and according to the claim, each of these should correspond to exactly 1 goal. But looking at the goals column for that row, it's also \"did not play.\" So does that mean the number of goals is zero or not considered? \n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the claim. Perhaps it's saying that whenever a player didn't play (total points as did not play), they scored exactly 1 goal in that year. But for 2003, all players marked 'did not play' have 0 goals. So does \"did not play\" mean zero or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that whenever a player didn't play (i.e., total points are did not play), their goals in that season were exactly 1. But in the table, for 2003, all 'did not play' have 0 goals.\n\nSo let's check other years where 'total points' is marked as \"did not play\" and see if they have 1 goal.\n\nLooking at 2000 and 2001: both have 'did not play' in all columns. So for those years, the number of goals is also did not play, which is zero or undefined. The claim says when total points are marked as did not play, there's always 1 goal. But these don't support that.\n\nNow, let's check other instances where 'did not play' appears in total points and see if they have 1 goal elsewhere. For example, in 1998, the row is:\n\n[\n  \"1998\",\n  \"1 / 0\",\n  \"0\",\n  \"0\",\n  \"0\"\n]\n\nHere, total points are 0, which isn't exactly 'did not play' as it's marked explicitly. So maybe I'm looking for rows where 'total points' column says 'did not play.'\n\nWait, the only row where 'total points' is 'did not play' is 2003, and in that case, goals are also 'did not play.' So does that mean the claim is incorrect?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that when a player didn't play (so total points are N/A or did not play), their goals are exactly 1. But from the table, it's not so.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim structure. The user wrote: \"the gp / g in 2003 , when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal.\"\n\nSo perhaps for 2003, whenever a player didn't play (i.e., total points are 'did not play'), they scored exactly 1 goal. But in the table, for 2003, all entries under 'goals' are also 'did not play.' So maybe it's implying that if a player didn't play, their goals should be 1, but here they're zero.\n\nTherefore, this would mean the claim is FALSE because in 2003, when total points are marked as did not play, the number of goals isn't 1 but 'did not play' again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret it differently. Maybe the claim is trying to say that whenever a player didn't play (total points = did not play), their goal count is exactly 1. But in reality, for 2003, when total points are did not play, goals are also did not play, which is zero or undefined.\n\nSo that would mean the claim is FALSE because it's asserting something that isn't true based on the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2003, whenever a player didn't play (total points marked as \"did not play\"), they scored exactly 1 goal. However, checking the table for 2003, both 'total points' and 'goals' are \"did not play,\" indicating zero goals. Since this contradicts the claim, it is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
