    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the first place tie be betweem duffy waldorf , jeff sluman and frank nobilo.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at how the table is structured. The columns are place, player, country, score, to par, and money. Each row represents a player's performance, presumably in some event.\n\nThe claim mentions a first place tie between Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo. So I need to check if all three of them tied for first place.\n\nLooking at the \"place\" column: each row shows where they finished. For instance, in the first few rows, players like Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, Loren Roberts are all marked as \"t1,\" which I assume stands for tied for first place. Then, starting from row 3 (Curtis Strange), the places change to \"4,\" \"5,\" etc.\n\nNow, looking specifically for Duffy Waldorf: his row is at index 8 (since indexing starts at 0). His place is listed as \"t9,\" so he finished tied for ninth. That's not first place.\n\nSimilarly, Jeff Sluman is also marked as \"t9\" in his row, which is index 10. So both Duffy Waldorf and Jeff Sluman are tied for ninth, not first.\n\nFrank Nobilo's row is at index 11, also \"t9.\" Wait, that can't be right because the user might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check: in the table provided, Frank Nobilo's place is indeed \"t9,\" same as Duffy and Jeff. So none of them are tied for first.\n\nWait, but I remember sometimes tournaments have multiple players tied at different positions, like t1 to t10 or something. But according to this table, all three are at t9. So the claim that they tied for first place is incorrect because their place is ninth, not first.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo all finished in 9th place, not first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
