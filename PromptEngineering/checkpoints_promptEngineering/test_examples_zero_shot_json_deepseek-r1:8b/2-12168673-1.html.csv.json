The claim is: \"blueeyesintherein win on 2012 , with the owner self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it aligns with the table.\n\nStarting with the winner: \"blueeyesintherein\" should be the winner in 2012. Looking at the table's data, the first row (row_index 0) has the year 2012 and the winner listed as \"blueeyesintherein\". So that checks out for the year and the winner.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the owner as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". In the table, under the same row (row_index 0), the owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". This matches exactly. So both the winner and the owner for that year are correct.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the other rows. Each subsequent row has different winners, owners, etc., but since the claim is specifically about 2012, only row 0 is relevant here.\n\nSo, all the necessary cells in the table support the claim fully.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , and et al be the owner when blueeyesintherein be the winner in 2012.\"\n\nBreaking this down, I need to find the row where the year is 2012, check the winner column for that row, and see if the owner corresponds to \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with a list of columns: year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, time. Each row represents a different race or event with details from 1995 to 2012.\n\nI'll start by locating the 2012 row in the data. Scanning through each sub-array in the data section, I see that the first entry is 2012. So, row_index 0 corresponds to 2012.\n\nNow, looking at the winner for 2012: \"blueeyesintherein\". That matches what the claim says about the winner being blueeyesintherein.\n\nNext, I need to check the owner's name in that same row. The owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". The claim also mentions this exact name for the owner when blueeyesintherein won in 2012.\n\nSo, both the winner and owner conditions from the claim are met in the table's data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to note which columns were checked. From the claim, we checked the 'winner' and 'owner' columns for the 2012 row. So, the relevant_cells should include both these columns for row_index 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"overbrook farm and et al own winner blueeyesintherin after 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three things: overbook farm (or a variation of it) owns the horse named \"blueeyesintherein,\" and this ownership occurred after 2009. I need to check if such a record exists in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time. So, each row represents a specific race with these details.\n\nI'll start by looking for any rows where the owner is \"overbook farm.\" Wait, in the table data, I see an entry for 2008 where the owner is listed as \"twin creeks racing stable.\" Hmm, that's not matching. Then, moving down the list, in 2005, the owner is \"gainesway / george bolton,\" which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a row where overbook farm is the owner. Let me scan each row carefully.\n\nLooking through each year from 1996 up to 2012:\n\n- 2012: Owner is \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\"\n- 2011: Owner is \"barry l king\"\n- 2010: \"eldon farm equine\"\n- 2009: \"westrock stables\"\n- 2008: \"twin creeks racing stable\"\n- 2007: \"heiligbrodt racing et al\"\n- 2006: same as above\n- 2005: \"gainesway / george bolton\"\n- 2004: \"bob & beverly lewis\"\n- 2003: \"thomas f van meter ii\"\n- 2002: \"winstar farm\"\n- 2001: \"team valor\"\n- 2000: \"edward p evans\"\n- 1999: \"stonerside stable\"\n- 1998: \"michael e pegram\"\n- 1997: \"michael tabor\"\n- 1996: \"cherry valley farm\"\n\nI don't see any row where the owner is \"overbook farm.\" Wait, maybe it's spelled differently? In the table, I notice that in some rows, the owner includes names like \"heiligbrodt racing et al\" or \"westrock stables,\" but not \"overbook farm.\"\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"overbrook farm and et al.\" Maybe there was a typo, and it's supposed to be \"overbrook,\" not \"overbook.\" Let me see if any owner is listed as \"overbrook farm\" or similar.\n\nLooking again, I don't see that either. So perhaps the claim is false because overbrook farm isn't listed as an owner in the table for any of the years after 2009.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the ownership and the year. The claim specifies \"after 2009,\" so we need to check if overbook farm owned blueeyesintherin on or after 2010.\n\nSince none of the rows from 2010 onwards have overbook farm as the owner, it seems like there is no such record. Therefore, the claim is likely false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et all own winner flashy lassie after 2009\". This seems to state that a group of people (self, king, Morgenson, Travis, etc.) owned or had possession of the horse named \"flashy lassie\" after the year 2009.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it's structured with columns: year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time. Each row represents a different year from 1995 to 2012.\n\nMy approach should be:\n1. Identify which rows could potentially involve \"flashy lassie\" and whether she was owned by the group mentioned.\n2. Determine if any of these rows are after 2009 since the claim mentions \"after 2009.\"\n\nStarting with the winner column, I look for \"flashy lassie\". Scanning through each row:\n- Row 1: 2011, winner is \"flashy lassie\".\nThis is a potential candidate because it's after 2009.\n\nNow, checking the owner column for this row (row index 1):\nThe data here says \"barry l king\". The claim mentions \"self / king / Morgenson / Travis\" as owners. I need to see if these names match or relate to \"barry l king\".\n\nWait a minute, \"king\" appears in both the claim and the owner's name (Barry L King). So it seems like Barry L King is part of the group mentioned in the claim. Therefore, this row does support the claim.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that this row is after 2009. Since it's from 2011, yes, it's relevant.\n\nAre there any other rows with \"flashy lassie\"? Looking through all rows, I don't see another occurrence of her name. So only row index 1 (2011) is relevant.\n\nNow, checking the columns: For this row, the relevant columns are \"year\" (to confirm it's after 2009), \"winner\" (to check if it's \"flashy lassie\"), and \"owner\" (to verify the ownership matches the claim).\n\nThus, the relevant cells are at row index 1 for \"year\", \"winner\", and \"owner\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one relevant cell in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
