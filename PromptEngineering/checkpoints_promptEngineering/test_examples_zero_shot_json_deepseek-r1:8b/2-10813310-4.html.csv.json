    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"at the venue the stoop , the score be 24 - 28.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to figure out what needs to be checked. The key elements are the venue, the score, and possibly any other related information.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two specific things: the venue is \"the stoop\" and the score should be \"24 - 28.\" So I need to find a row in the table where both of these match.\n\nI'll start by examining each row's 'venue' column to see if any matches \"the stoop.\" Scanning through the list, I notice that the 11th row (index 10) has the venue as \"odsal stadium,\" which doesn't match. The next relevant row is index 13: \n\n- Row 13: \n  - Date: 31 / 8 / 97\n  - Venue: the stoop\n  - Result: l\n  - Score: 24 - 28\n  - Goals: mcnamara 4 / 4\n\nWait, that row does have the venue as \"the stoop\" and the score as \"24 - 28.\" So that matches both parts of the claim. \n\nNow, I should also check if there are any other rows with \"the stoop\" as the venue to ensure there's only one match. From the table, it looks like row 13 is the only one where the venue is \"the stoop.\"\n\nNext, confirming the score for that specific row. The 'score' column does indeed show \"24 - 28.\" \n\nTherefore, since both the venue and the score in that row match the claim, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be 'venue' and 'score.' So I'll list their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe table has a row where the venue is \"the stoop\" and the score is \"24 - 28.\" Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcnamara score 3 / 4 goal when the venue be the stoop\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means and then check the table accordingly.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: Mc Namara scoring 3/4 goals and the venue being \"the stoop.\" So, I need to find in the table any rows where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the columns, they include \"date,\" \"competition,\" \"venue,\" \"result,\" \"score,\" and \"goals.\" The \"goals\" column seems relevant here because it shows how many goals Mc Namara scored. The \"venue\" column will tell me where the match was held.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to see if any match both conditions. \n\nStarting from row 0, the venue is \"odsal stadium,\" which isn't \"the stoop.\" Moving on, I check each row until I find a match for the venue. The rows are:\n\nRow 13: venue is \"the stoop\" with result \"l,\" score \"24 - 28,\" and goals \"mcnamara 4 / 4.\" So here, Mc Namara scored 4/4 goals, not 3/4.\n\nWait, that's different from the claim. The claim says 3/4, but this row shows 4/4. So this doesn't match.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows where the venue is \"the stoop.\" Scanning further, I don't see any others in the table provided. \n\nSo, since there's no row where Mc Namara scored exactly 3/4 goals at \"the stoop,\" the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells. The \"goals\" column is where I check for Mc Namara's score, and the \"venue\" column shows where the match was held. So, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 13 (index 13), \"goals\" column.\n- Row 13, \"venue\" column.\n\nI need to list these as objects in the JSON with their row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
