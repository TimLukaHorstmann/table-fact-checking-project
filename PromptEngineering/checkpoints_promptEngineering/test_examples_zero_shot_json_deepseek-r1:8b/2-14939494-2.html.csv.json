    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Hurricane Agatha having more deaths than Hurricane Blas is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's provided.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The table has several columns: storm name, dates active, max 1 - min wind mph (km/h), min press (mbar), damage in millions USD, and deaths. Each row represents a different storm or aggregate data.\n\nThe claim is about two hurricanes: Agatha and Blas. I need to check their respective data in the table.\n\nLooking at the \"storm name\" column, I can see the rows where the storm names are \"agatha\" and \"blas\". Let's find those rows.\n\nFor Hurricane Agatha, it's the first row after the header. The relevant columns here would be \"deaths\", so that's column index 5 (since counting from 0). It shows 190 deaths.\n\nFor Hurricane Blas, it's one of the later rows before the aggregate data starts. Specifically, it's the third row in the list (index 2). Checking its death column, it says 0 deaths.\n\nSo, Agatha had 190 deaths, and Blas had 0. The claim states that Agatha has more deaths than Blas, which is correct because 190 > 0. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should also verify that these are the correct rows. Let me count the row indices: Agatha is at index 0 (since the first data row after headers is index 0), and Blas is at index 2. That seems right.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are both in the \"deaths\" column for their respective storms.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"In the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, during June there were zero deaths.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table. The claim refers to the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, specifically looking at June for any deaths.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like \"storm name,\" \"dates active,\" \"max wind speed,\" etc., but I'm most interested in the \"damage\" and \"deaths\" columns. Wait, actually, let me check: the columns are \"storm name,\" \"dates active,\" \"max 1 - min wind mph (km / h),\" \"min press (mbar),\" \"damage (millions usd),\" and \"deaths.\" So yes, there's a \"damage\" column and a \"deaths\" column.\n\nNow, I need to see if any storms in June 2010 had zero deaths. But wait, the table starts with the data for various storms, not necessarily all from 2010. The first entries are like \"agatha,\" which might be from earlier years, but then there's a row at the end that says \"season aggregates\" and another one about 13 cyclones spanning May to December. Hmm.\n\nWait, the last two rows seem to aggregate season data. The second last row has all \"season aggregates\" except for \"storm name,\" which is empty. The very last row seems to be the overall season totals: 13 cyclones, active from May 29 to December 21, with max wind speed 160 km/h (260 mph), min press 921 mbar, damage 1608.3 million USD, and deaths 199 with a note \"(44).\" \n\nWait, but that's for the entire season, not specifically June. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about June 2010 having zero deaths.\n\nLooking back at the other rows in the data array: Each row represents a storm with its details. For example, the second row is \"two - e,\" active June 16-17, max wind 35 km/h (55 mph), min press 1007 mbar, damage n/a, deaths 0.\n\nAnother one is \"blas\" on June 17-21, max wind 65 km/h (100 mph), etc., with deaths 0. Similarly, \"celia\" from June 18-28 has no deaths. \"Darby\" and others also show zero deaths in their respective months, but I'm focusing on June.\n\nSo the relevant part is to look at all rows where the dates include June 2010. Wait, but the table's dates are in formats like \"may 29 - 30,\" \"june 16 - 17,\" etc. The claim mentions June 2010, so I need to check any storm active during June.\n\nIn the data array, looking for rows where the date range includes June. For example:\n\n- Row 1: May 29-30 (doesn't include June)\n- Row 2: June 16-17\n- Row 3: June 17-21\n- Row 4: June 18-28\n- Row 5: June 23-28\n- Row 6: July 14-16 (July is after June, so not in question)\n- ... others are August and September.\n\nSo rows 2 to 5 are relevant because their date ranges include June. Each of these has \"deaths\" as 0. So, no deaths occurred during June in the storms listed here.\n\nBut wait, does this cover all possible storms? Probably not, but the table doesn't have more data. The last row is about season aggregates, but that's total for the entire season, not specific to June.\n\nSo, based on the given data, there are no deaths reported for the storms active in June. Therefore, the claim stating zero deaths during June 2010 is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then point out which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"In the 2010 Pacific Hurricane Season, during September there were 3 deaths.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are \"storm name,\" \"dates active,\" \"max 1 - min wind mph (km/h),\" and so on until \"damage (millions usd)\" and \"deaths.\" Each row represents a different storm or aggregated data.\n\nI need to focus on September because the claim mentions that month. So I'll go through each row to see if any storm was active in September 2010 with exactly 3 deaths.\n\nLooking at the table, the first few rows are individual storms like Agatha, Two-E, Blas, etc. Each has their own dates and death counts. Then there's a row for \"season aggregates,\" which might total up all the storms from the season. Finally, the last row is labeled as \"13 cyclones\" with a date range from May 29 to December 21, 2010.\n\nSince the claim refers to September specifically in the 2010 season, I should check each storm that was active during September 2010 and see if any had exactly 3 deaths. \n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n- Agatha: May 29-30. Not September.\n- Two-E: June 16-17. No.\n- Blas: June 17-21. No.\n- Celia: June 18-June 28. Ends in June, so no.\n- Darby: June 23-June 28. Also ends in June.\n- Six-E: July 14-16. No.\n- Estelle: August 6-10. No.\n- Eight-E: August 20-21. Still August.\n- Frank: August 21-August 28. August is before September, so no.\n- Ten-E: Sept 3-4. Now this is in September. Let's check deaths: The row says \"none\" for deaths? Wait, looking again: In the table, the \"deaths\" column for Ten-E is listed as \"0.\" Hmm, but the claim says there were 3 deaths. So maybe not this one.\n- Eleven-E: Sept 3-4. Deaths are listed as \"3 (44)\". That's three deaths with an additional number in parentheses, possibly a footnote or another data point. So this storm had 3 deaths.\n- Georgette: Starts on September 20. Let me check if it goes beyond September? The dates say September 20-23, so yes, it was active in September. Deaths for Georgette are \"0.\"\n- Omeka: December 18-21. Not relevant for September.\n- Season aggregates row: It's a summary, but the death count is 0.\n- Last row: 13 cyclones with dates from May to December. The death total is 199 (44), which is likely a sum of all deaths across the season.\n\nWait, so Eleven-E was active in September and had 3 deaths. That seems to support the claim. But I should check if any other storm in September had exactly 3 deaths. Ten-E had \"none\" or 0, Georgette had 0, so only Eleven-E matches.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be for the row of Eleven-E: column is \"deaths,\" and it's at row index 9 (since rows start from 0; the data array has 12 elements, but indexes 0-11. Wait, let me count the rows properly. The data array starts with Agatha as index 0, then Two-E as 1, up to Eleven-E being index 9? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the data list:\n\nRow 0: Agatha\nRow 1: Two-E\nRow 2: Blas\nRow 3: Celia\nRow 4: Darby\nRow 5: Six-E\nRow 6: Estelle\nRow 7: Eight-E\nRow 8: Frank\nRow 9: Ten-E\nRow 10: Eleven-E\nRow 11: Georgette\nRow 12: Omeka\nRow 13: season aggregates\nRow 14: 13 cyclones\n\nWait, that's 15 rows, but the user provided data array has 15 entries (from index 0 to 14). So Eleven-E is at index 10? Or wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list them:\n\nThe data array is a list of 12 elements, from indices 0 to 11, plus two more, making it 14? Wait, the user provided the table with 14 rows in data, but the columns have 6 items and then season aggregates.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount. Let me list all entries in data:\n\n1. Agatha\n2. Two-E\n3. Blas\n4. Celia\n5. Darby\n6. Six-E\n7. Estelle\n8. Eight-E\n9. Frank\n10. Ten-E\n11. Eleven-E\n12. Georgette\n13. Omeka\n14. season aggregates\n15. 13 cyclones\n\nSo yes, 15 rows. So Eleven-E is row index 10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are: column \"deaths\" in row 10, and perhaps also the \"storm name\" if needed, but probably just the deaths column.\n\nWait, the claim mentions that during September there were 3 deaths. So we need to find a storm active in September with 3 deaths. Eleven-E was active in September (Sept 3-4) and had 3 deaths. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the relevant cells are data[10][5], since columns are [storm name, dates, ... , deaths]. So index-wise, each row is a list, and for data[10], which is Eleven-E, the 6th column (index 5) is \"3 (44)\".\n\nTherefore, the specific cell is data[10][5] = '3 (44)'.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, it's in the \"deaths\" column for that row. So to answer, we can say that the deaths column for Eleven-E has 3 as a value, which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant information supporting the claim is found in the \"deaths\" column of the row corresponding to the storm \"Eleven-E,\" which occurred on September 3\u20134, 2010, and had exactly three fatalities.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe data indicates that there were indeed three deaths during an event in September 2010. Specifically, the storm known as Eleven-E resulted in three fatalities. This information is found in the \"deaths\" column of the corresponding row for Eleven-E, which is listed as '3 (44)'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Storms:** Focus on storms active during September 2010.\n2. **Check Death Counts:** Look at the \"deaths\" column for each relevant storm.\n3. **Find Match:** Eleven-E, active from September 3\u20134, had three fatalities.\n\n**Answer:** There were three fatalities reported in connection with an event that occurred in September 2010. Specifically, the storm known as Eleven-E resulted in three deaths, which is documented in the \"deaths\" column of its respective row.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",

Let's see... The columns in the table are \"storm name,\" \"dates active,\" \"max 1 - min wind mph (km/h),\" \"min press (mbar),\" \"damage (millions usd),\" and \"deaths.\" \n\nI'm looking for Omeka and Georgette in the storm names.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"in the 2010 pacific hurricane season, hurricane frank have the more death than hurricane estelle.\" So, it's comparing the number of deaths caused by Frank and Estelle.\n\nI should start by identifying which rows in the table correspond to Hurricanes Frank and Estelle. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first entry is Agatha, then Two-E, Blas, Celia, Darby, Six-E, Estelle. Wait, Estelle is there on row 6 (index 6). Then later, Frank is listed on row 8 (index 8), and Eleven-E, Georgette, Omega, and the season aggregates.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: rows are indexed from 0. Let me list them out:\n\nRow 0: Agatha\n\n1: Two-E\n\n2: Blas\n\n3: Celia\n\n4: Darby\n\n5: Six-E\n\n6: Estelle\n\n7: Eight-E\n\n8: Frank\n\n9: Ten-E\n\n10: Eleven-E\n\n11: Georgette\n\n12: Omega\n\n13: Season aggregates (this seems to be a total, perhaps)\n\n14: Another entry with \"13 cyclones\" which might be a season summary.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count again:\n\nThe data array has 15 sub-arrays because it goes from 0 to 14? Wait, no, each sub-array is a row, so the first one is index 0, then 1 up to 14.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nAt row 6: [\"estelle\", \"august 6 - 10\", \"65 (100)\", \"994\", \"none\", \"0\"]\n\nSo Estelle has 0 deaths.\n\nAt row 8: [\"frank\", \"august 21 - 28\", \"90 (150)\", \"978\", \"8.3\", \"6\"]\n\nHere, Frank is listed as having 6 deaths.\n\nNow, the claim says that in the 2010 season, Frank had more deaths than Estelle.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe table has several columns: storm name, dates active, max wind speed, min pressure, damage, and deaths. Each row represents a different storm or aggregate data.\n\nI'm looking for information related to June 2010 and deaths in that month. So, I should focus on the rows where the date range includes June and see if there were any deaths reported.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Agatha**: Dates are May 29-30. This is in May, not June. Deaths: 190. But since it's May, it doesn't apply to June.\n2. **Two-E**: June 16-17. Deaths: 0. No deaths in June.\n3. **Blas**: June 17-21. Deaths: 0. No deaths in June.\n4. **Celia**: June 18-28. Deaths: 0. No deaths in June.\n5. **Darby**: June 23-28. Deaths: 0. No deaths in June.\n6. **Six-E**: July 14-16. This is July, not June. Deaths: 0.\n7. **Estelle**: August 6-10. August, so no. Deaths: 0.\n8. **Eight-E**: August 20-21. August. Deaths: 0.\n9. **Frank**: August 21-28. August. Deaths: 6. But in August.\n10. **Ten-E**: September 3-4. September. Deaths: 0.\n11. **Eleven-E**: September 3-4. September. Deaths: 3, but that's later.\n12. **Georgette**: September 20-23. September. Deaths: 0.\n13. **Omeka**: December 18-21. December. Deaths: 0.\n\nThe last row seems to be aggregate data for the season. It says 199 deaths (44 missing?), but that's a season total, not specific to June. So it doesn't support the claim about June specifically.\n\nNow, looking at all the rows with dates in June: two-E, blas, celia, darby, six-E (July), estelle, eight-E, etc. Wait, actually, the only June storms are two-E, blas, celia, darby. Let me check their death columns:\n\n- Two-E: 0 deaths\n- Blas: 0\n- Celia: 0\n- Darby: 0\n\nNone of these had any deaths in June. The only row with a high number of deaths is the aggregate at the end, but that's not specific to June.\n\nSo the claim says there were 190 deaths during June, but according to the table, none of the storms active in June resulted in deaths. The only time 190 deaths occurred was for Agatha in May, which is a different month. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold up.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are no records in the table indicating any deaths during June 2010 related to Pacific hurricanes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim is: \"In the 2010 Pacific Hurricane Season, during August there be 3 deaths.\" So I'm looking for information about hurricanes in August 2010 that resulted in 3 deaths.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find rows related to August. The 'dates active' column shows when each storm was active. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Agatha: May 29-30 \u2013 not August.\n2. Two-E: June 16-17 \u2013 June.\n3. Blas: June 17-21 \u2013 June.\n4. Celia: June 18-28 \u2013 June and July.\n5. Darby: June 23-28 \u2013 June and July.\n6. Six-E: July 14-16 \u2013 July.\n7. Estelle: August 6-10 \u2013 August!\n8. Eight-E: August 20-21 \u2013 August.\n9. Frank: August 21-28 \u2013 August.\n10. Ten-E: September 3-4 \u2013 September.\n11. Eleven-E: September 3-4 \u2013 September and October? Wait, the dates are only up to September here, but I'm not sure about the exact timeline.\n12. Georgette: September 20-23 \u2013 September.\n13. Omeka: December 18-21 \u2013 December.\n14. Season aggregates: This row seems to summarize the season as a whole, so probably not specific to August.\n15. The last row is \"13 cyclones\" which might be a header or another aggregate.\n\nNow, focusing on rows with storms active in August:\n\n- Estelle (August 6-10)\n- Eight-E (August 20-21)\n- Frank (August 21-28)\n\nEach of these has a 'damage' and 'deaths' column. Let's check the relevant columns for these rows.\n\nFor Estelle: damage is none, deaths are 0.\nEight-E: damage is none, deaths are 0.\nFrank: Damage is 8.3 million USD and deaths are 6.\n\nWait, the claim says \"during August there be 3 deaths.\" Looking at Frank's row, there were 6 deaths. But wait, in the table, under Frank, the 'damage' column has \"8.3\" which might mean $8.3 million. Then, the 'deaths' is 6.\n\nHmm, but where does it say 3 deaths? Let me check other rows for August. Only Estelle, Eight-E, and Frank are in August. None of them have 3 deaths; only Frank has 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should look beyond the main storms. The last row is labeled \"season aggregates\" but it's unclear if that's an actual storm or a summary. The data says:\n\n[\n  \"13 cyclones\",\n  \"may 29 - december 21\",\n  \"160 (260)\",\n  \"921\",\n  \"1608.3\",\n  \"199 (44)\"\n]\n\nWait, the last row seems to be a summary for the entire season. So 'damage' is $1608.3 million and deaths are 199 with 44 missing.\n\nBut the claim is about August specifically. So maybe I should check if any of the August storms had 3 deaths. From Estelle (0), Eight-E (0), Frank (6). None have 3 deaths.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their thinking. They thought that because Eleven-E had 3 deaths in September and October, but the claim is about August.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the data. Let me check the 'deaths' column again for each August storm:\n\n- Estelle: 0\n- Eight-E: 0\n- Frank: 6\n\nNo August storms with 3 deaths. So the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during August 2010, there were 3 deaths. The table shows no August hurricanes with exactly 3 deaths; the closest is Frank with 6 deaths in August.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"deaths\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"deaths\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"deaths\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Hurricane Georgette having a lower minimum pressure than Hurricane Omeka in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season is true or false by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows correspond to Hurricanes Georgette and Omeka. Looking at the \"storm name\" column:\n\n- The first row after the header seems to be Agatha.\n- Then Two-E, Blas, etc., until I reach Hurricane Frank, then Ten-E, Eleven-E, Georgette is somewhere down there.\n\nWait, looking through each row's storm name:\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. agatha\n2. two - e\n3. blas\n4. celia\n5. darby\n6. six - e\n7. estelle\n8. eight - e\n9. frank\n10. ten - e\n11. eleven - e\n12. georgette\n13. omeka\n\nSo, Georgette is row 12 and Omeka is row 13.\n\nNow, I need to find the \"min press (mbar)\" for both. The relevant column is the second one in the list: \"min press ( mbar )\". So I'll look at that column for rows 12 and 13.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- For Georgette (row 12), the min press is 999.\n- For Omeka (row 13), the min press is 997.\n\nWait, so Georgette's min pressure is higher than Omeka's. The claim says Georgette has a lower minimum pressure than Omeka, which would mean Georgette's value should be less than Omeka's. But 999 is more than 997, so the claim seems to be false.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm looking at the right rows. Sometimes, rows might be aggregates or season totals, but here, row 12 is \"georgette\" and row 13 is \"omeka\", so those should be individual storms.\n\nAdditionally, checking if any other cells are relevant: The claim only mentions min press, so that's the main one. The column names and their positions are correct.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be FALSE because Georgette's minimum pressure (999) is higher than Omeka's (997).\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"hurricane georgette have a lower minimum pressure than hurricane omeka,\" we compare their respective \"min press (mbar)\" values in the table. \n\n- **Hurricane Georgette**: 999 mbar\n- **Hurricane Omeka**: 997 mbar\n\nSince 999 > 997, Georgette's min pressure is higher, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"min press ( mbar )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"min press ( mbar )\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Hurricane Frank and Hurricane Estelle in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season is true based on the given table. The claim says that Hurricane Frank had fewer deaths than Hurricane Estelle.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns of the table to identify which ones are relevant for this claim. The claim involves two things: the number of deaths each hurricane caused and possibly their names or dates. So, the \"deaths\" column is definitely important here because that's what the comparison is about. \n\nLooking through the data rows, I need to find the entries for both Hurricane Frank and Hurricane Estelle. Let me go row by row.\n\nI start with the first few rows: Agatha, Two-E, Blas, Celia, Darby, Six-E, Estelle, Eight-E, Frank... Wait, here's Estelle in row 6. The data for Estelle is:\n- storm name: estelle\n- dates active: august 6 - 10\n- max 1 - min wind mph (km/h): 65 (100)\n- min press (mbar): 994\n- damage (millions usd): none\n- deaths: 0\n\nThen, further down, I find Frank in row 8. The data for Frank is:\n- storm name: frank\n- dates active: august 21 - 28\n- max 1 - min wind mph (km/h): 90 (150)\n- min press (mbar): 978\n- damage (millions usd): 8.3\n- deaths: 6\n\nWait, so Estelle had 0 deaths and Frank had 6 deaths. That would mean that Hurricane Frank actually caused more deaths than Hurricane Estelle. But the claim says the opposite: it claims that Frank had fewer deaths than Estelle. So that would make the claim false.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any rows. After row 8, there are a few more storms, but they're either 'none' or 'n/a'. Then, the last row is for \"13 cyclones,\" which seems like aggregate data. So, no, I think my initial assessment is correct.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be the ones for Estelle (row 6) and Frank (row 8), specifically their death counts.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Hurricane Frank having fewer deaths than Hurricane Estelle in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, we need to compare their respective \"deaths\" values from the table.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows and columns**:\n   - Both hurricanes are listed in the table under the \"storm name\" column.\n   - The \"deaths\" column is crucial for comparison.\n\n2. **Extract data for both storms**:\n   - **Hurricane Estelle**: Found in row 6 with 0 deaths.\n   - **Hurricane Frank**: Found in row 8 with 6 deaths.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Estelle had 0 deaths, while Frank had 6, meaning Frank had more deaths.\n\nSince the claim states that Frank had fewer deaths than Estelle, which is false based on the data provided.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE  \n**Relevant cells**: Both hurricanes' death counts are key to this comparison.",
