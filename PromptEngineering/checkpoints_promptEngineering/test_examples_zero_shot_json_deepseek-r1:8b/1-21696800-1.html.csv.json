    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the second episode has 2.24 million US viewers.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which part of the table is relevant here. The table has several columns: no, -, title, directed by, written by, us air date, production code, and us viewers (million). \n\nThe key information in the claim is about the \"second episode\" and the number of US viewers, specifically 2.24 million. So I need to find where the second episode is in the table and check its corresponding US viewers figure.\n\nLooking at the data rows, each row represents an episode. The first column seems to be a counter (\"no\") that goes from 175 upwards. So the second episode would correspond to \"no\" value of 176 because it's the second entry after 175. \n\nNow, I need to look for the row where \"no\" is 176. In that row, under the \"us viewers (million)\" column, what's the number? From the data provided, row 1 (since rows are 0-indexed) has us viewers as 2.24 million.\n\nSo yes, the second episode does have 2.24 million US viewers.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the title rabid have 2.30 million viewers in us.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be checked against the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: the title is \"rabid,\" and the number of US viewers is 2.30 million. So, I'll look for these in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns in the table, the relevant ones are likely \"title\" and \"us viewers (million).\" These are the key pieces of information needed to verify the claim.\n\nNow, I need to find where \"rabid\" is the title and check what the corresponding US viewers figure is. \n\nI'll go through each row's \"title\" column:\n\n- Row 0: savior\n- Row 1: metallo\n- Row 2: rabid\n- Row 3: echo\n- And so on until row 19.\n\nSo, \"rabid\" is in row 2. Now I check the \"us viewers (million)\" for row 2. According to the table, it's 2.3. \n\nWait, the claim says 2.30 million, which is 2.30, but the table has 2.3. Hmm, are these the same? Well, in terms of significant figures, sometimes 2.3 can be rounded or represented as 2.30 depending on context. But here, it's explicitly 2.3. So does that mean the claim is accurate?\n\nWait another thought: In the table, row 2 has \"rabid\" with us viewers 2.3. The claim says 2.30 million, which is technically different because of the decimal places. However, sometimes in data, trailing zeros after the decimal might not be significant, but here it's precise. So maybe it's an exact match.\n\nBut looking at other rows, for example, row 179 has \"roulette\" with viewers 2.52, and row 186 has \"warrior\" at 2.48. None of these have a .30 figure except row 2. \n\nWait, let me check row 180: crossfire is 2.57, row 181: kandor 2.63, etc. So the only one close to 2.3 is row 2 with exactly 2.3.\n\nTherefore, the claim's exact figure doesn't match precisely because it's 2.30 vs. 2.3. Unless we consider that 2.3 is equivalent to 2.30 in some contexts, but strictly speaking, they're different numerically. However, sometimes data can be rounded or presented differently, so maybe the claim is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is whether \"rabid\" has 2.30 million viewers. Since the table shows 2.3, and the claim says 2.30, there's a discrepancy in the decimal precision. However, sometimes these figures are just rounded for simplicity or reporting purposes.\n\nBut strictly by the numbers, they don't match exactly. So does that mean the claim is false? Or maybe it's considered true because 2.3 is close enough or represented as 2.30?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any other row has \"rabid\" and a different viewer count. No, only row 2 has \"rabid.\" So the only relevant cells are row 2, column \"title\" and row 2, column \"us viewers (million).\"\n\nThus, the claim's assertion about the viewers is based on that specific row. Since 2.30 isn't exactly matching 2.3, it might be considered false. However, sometimes in data representation, .0 can be added for clarity, so maybe 2.3 is equivalent to 2.30.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the claim could be true because it's a rounded figure or because the table's value is precise enough.\n\nWait, looking at other rows, such as row 179: \"roulette\" has 2.52 million viewers, which is more precise than two decimal places. Similarly, row 192: \"charade\" is 2.23, again two decimals. So maybe the table allows for up to two decimal places, but in row 2, it's exactly 2.3, which could be represented as 2.30 if needed.\n\nBut strictly speaking, 2.30 isn't present; it's only 2.3. Therefore, the claim's figure doesn't exactly match, making it false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference is negligible and the claim is considered true because 2.3 is approximately 2.30 million.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. I think in data verification, exact matches are important unless specified otherwise. Since 2.3 isn't equal to 2.30, it's technically false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user intended 2.30 as a rounded figure, and since the table shows 2.3, it's acceptable. So maybe the answer is true because the number of viewers is approximately 2.30 million.\n\nAlternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. The key points are that \"rabid\" is indeed the title in row 2, and the viewers are 2.3 million. The claim says 2.30, which isn't exactly present, so it's false.\n\nBut considering that sometimes data can be truncated or represented with an extra decimal for emphasis, maybe it's intended to be true.\n\nI think I'll go with the answer being true because \"rabid\" has approximately 2.3 million viewers in the US, and the claim is likely referring to a rounded figure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim about the title \"Kandor\" having 2.63 million US viewers is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are:\n- no\n- -\n- title\n- directed by\n- written by\n- us air date\n- production code\n- us viewers (million)\n\nSo, the relevant information for the claim is about the \"title\" being \"Kandor\" and its corresponding \"us viewers (million)\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the title is \"Kandor\". Scanning through the data:\n\nRow 1: title is \"savior\"\nRow 2: title is \"metallo\"\n...\nRow 7: title is \"kandor\"\n\nSo, Kandor is in row 7. Now, I need to check the \"us viewers (million)\" for this row.\n\nLooking at the data in row 7:\n- The first number is 175? Wait, no, that's probably the \"no\" column. Then 1, which might be an index or something else.\nWait, let me clarify. Each row has multiple columns. Let's list them out:\n\nEach sub-array represents a row, with the following data points:\n- The first number is \"no\", which seems to be the episode number.\nThen comes \"-\", perhaps a placeholder for some information? Or maybe it's another column. Wait, looking back at the table, the second column is \"-\" but in the claim, we're focusing on two columns: title and us viewers.\n\nWait, no. The columns are:\n0: \"no\"\n1: \"-\"\n2: \"title\"\n3: \"directed by\"\n4: \"written by\"\n5: \"us air date\"\n6: \"production code\"\n7: \"us viewers (million)\"\n\nSo each row is indexed from 0 to n-1, and the columns are as listed. So for row 7 (index 7), let's check:\n\nAt index 7, which is the eighth column, \"us viewers (million)\".\n\nLooking at the data in row 6 (since rows start from 0?), wait no. Wait, the first row is index 0, so Kandor is in row 7? Wait, the list starts with row 0 as [175,...] and goes up to 194 for the last entry. So row 7 is indeed where \"kandor\" is.\n\nSo row 7's data: let me count the entries:\n\nLooking at the table, each row has elements like:\n[\n  175,\n  1,\n  \"savior\",\n  ...\n]\nSo for row 7 (index 7?), wait no. Wait, the rows are numbered from 0 to 19, as there are 20 entries.\n\nWait, in the provided data, the first row is [175, 1, \"savior\", ...], so that's row index 0. The 8th entry would be row index 7. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: first entry\n...\nRow 6: seventh entry\nRow 7: eighth entry\n\nYes, so Kandor is in row 7 (index 7). Now, let's check the \"us viewers (million)\" column.\n\nLooking at each row, the last element is the \"us viewers (million)\". So for row 7, what's the value?\n\nLooking at row 7: ... , \"3x5268\", 1.84\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the data provided, each row has elements like:\n\n[175, 1, \"savior\", ..., \"3x5270\", 1.89]\n\nSo for row 7 (index 7), the last element is \"us viewers (million)\" which is 1.84.\n\nWait, but the claim says 2.63 million. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices: 0 to 19\n\nKandor is in row 7 (index 7).\n\nLooking at row 7's data:\n- no: ?\n- -: ?\n- title: \"kandor\"\n- directed by: \"michael rohl\"\n- written by: \"drew landis & julia swift\"\n- us air date: \"april 16 , 2010\"\n- production code: \"3x5268\"\n- us viewers (million): 1.84\n\nSo yes, the us viewers for Kandor is 1.84 million, not 2.63.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in identifying which row corresponds to Kandor.\n\nLet me list out all titles:\n\nRow 0: savior\nRow 1: metallo\nRow 2: charade? Wait, no, let's see the data:\n\nLooking at each row's title:\n\nRow 0: \"savior\"\nRow 1: \"metallo\"\nRow 2: \"charade\" ? No, wait. Let me list all titles properly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each row and note down their titles to find Kandor.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: title is \"savior\"\nRow 1: \"metallo\"\nRow 2: \"charade\"? Or maybe another title. Wait, I think I might be miscounting.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, perhaps each row's title is in column 2 of each sub-array.\n\nSo for example, the first few rows are:\n\n[\n [175, 1, \"savior\", ...],\n [176, 1, \"metallo\", ...],\n ...\n [189, 18, \"charade\", ...],\n [190, 19, \"sacrifice\", ...],\n [191, 20, \"hostage\", ...]\n]\n\nWait no, that doesn't make sense because the indices go up to 194.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is a separate episode, and the titles are as per column 2 of each sub-array.\n\nSo let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: title = \"savior\"\nRow 1: title = \"metallo\"\nRow 2: title = \"charade\"?\nWait no, looking at the data, it's better to check each entry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for where the title is \"Kandor\".\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 7: title = \"kandor\"\n\nYes, so row index 7 (the eighth row) has title \"kandor\". Now, let's get the us viewers.\n\nIn that same row, the last element is the us viewers. So for row 7, it's 1.84 million.\n\nSo the claim says 2.63 million, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting rows. Let me double-check.\n\nThe table has 20 entries, from row 0 to row 19.\n\nLooking for \"kandor\" in column 2:\n\nI see that row 7 has title \"kandor\". So yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the us viewers are 1.84 million, not 2.63. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells are row 7, column \"us viewers (million)\".\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table, perhaps I misread the data for Kandor's us viewers.\n\nWait, in row 7, let me check again:\n\nThe last element is \"1.84\". So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index:7\n- column: \"us viewers (million)\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is accurate, we analyze the provided data to identify the corresponding values.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Row for \"Kandor\":**\n   - The title \"kandor\" appears in row 7 (index 7).\n\n2. **Extract the Us Viewers Value:**\n   - In row 7, the last element is \"1.84\", indicating that \"kandor\" had 1.84 million viewers.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"kandor\" has 2.63 million viewers.\n   - Since the actual figure is 1.84 million, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. The relevant data can be found in row 7 (index 7) of the table under the \"us viewers (million)\" column.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{false}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim to check: \"2.3 million people in Africa saw the episode title 'rabid'.\" Hmm, okay, first I need to figure out which parts of this claim can be verified using the given table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns like \"no\", \"title\", \"directed by\", etc., and each row represents a different episode with various data points. The claim is about viewership in Africa for an episode titled \"rabid.\" So, I need to find if there's an entry where the title is \"rabid\" and check the corresponding viewership number.\n\nLet me start by identifying which column has the episode titles. Scanning through the columns, I see one named \"title,\" so that's definitely relevant. Next, I need to find the row where the title is \"rabid.\" Going through each row in the data array:\n\n- Row 0: title is \"savior\"\n- Row 1: \"metallo\"\n- Row 2: \"rabid\" \u2013 here we go.\n\nSo, row index 2 has the episode titled \"rabid.\" Now, I need to check what the viewership number is for this episode. The column for viewers is labeled \"us viewers (million).\" Looking at row 2's data, the last element is 2.3. So that's the number.\n\nThe claim states \"2.3 million people,\" which matches the value in the table. However, I should check if there's any other aspect to consider. The title is correctly identified as \"rabid,\" and the viewership number is indeed 2.3 million. There doesn't seem to be any conflicting data.\n\nWait a second, but the column for viewers is labeled as \"us viewers (million).\" Does this mean that 2.3 refers to US viewers? The claim mentions Africa specifically. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. If the 2.3 million figure is from the US, then the claim about Africa might be incorrect.\n\nBut wait, in the table, I don't see any separate columns for international viewers or specific regions like Africa. All the data under \"us viewers (million)\" seems to pertain to the United States only. So, if the claim is about Africa, there's no corresponding data provided here. That means the claim might be incorrect because it relies on data that isn't present in the table.\n\nBut hold on, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"us viewers\" refers to a broader term or there's an assumption about global viewership based on the US numbers. However, without explicit data for Africa, it's not possible to confirm that 2.3 million people there saw the episode. So, while the title matches and the US viewers are 2.3 million, we can't be sure about Africa.\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about Africa. The table doesn't have a column for African viewers, so it's unclear if 2.3 million in Africa watched it. It might be that the 2.3 million refers to the US, not Africa. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"us viewers\" is a mislabel and actually refers to global viewership. But without knowing, I can't assume that. So, based on the information in the table, there's no way to confirm that 2.3 million people in Africa saw the episode titled \"rabid.\"\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the viewership number was 2.3, which matches the claim. However, since it's labeled as US viewers, that contradicts the claim about Africa. So, perhaps the answer is FALSE because the data supports a different region or the information isn't available.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me re-examine. The claim says 2.3 million in Africa saw \"rabid.\" The table has an episode titled \"rabid\" with 2.3 million US viewers. There's no info about Africa, so we can't confirm the claim about Africa. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe the title is correct, and the number is right but in the wrong region. So, even though the title matches and the viewership exists, it's not for Africa. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while there is an episode titled \"rabid\" with 2.3 million US viewers, the table does not provide data on viewership in Africa. Therefore, the statement cannot be fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"episode 4.\" Looking at the table, the first column labeled \"no\" seems to represent the episode number. The data starts with 175, which I assume corresponds to episode 1, then 176 for episode 2, and so on. So, episode 4 would be the fourth entry in the data array. Let me check: yes, the fourth row is 178, but wait, that's actually the fifth element because it starts at 175 as 1. Wait no, let me recount.\n\nWait, the first data row is 175 with \"no\" as 1, so each increment by 1 corresponds to an episode number. So:\n\nRow 0: no=175 \u2192 Episode 1\nRow 1: no=176 \u2192 Episode 2\nRow 2: no=177 \u2192 Episode 3\nRow 3: no=178 \u2192 Episode 4\n\nSo the fourth row (index 3) is episode 4.\n\nNext, the claim says \"be see by\" which I think means \"seen by.\" So it's referring to the number of US viewers for that episode. In the table, there's a column labeled \"us viewers (million).\" That must be where we check the viewer count.\n\nLooking at the fourth row (episode 4), the \"us viewers (million)\" cell is 2.61. But wait, the claim says 2.24 million. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the rows. Let me list them out:\n\nRows (row_index) and episode number:\n\n0: no=175 \u2192 Episode 1\n1: no=176 \u2192 Episode 2\n2: no=177 \u2192 Episode 3\n3: no=178 \u2192 Episode 4\n4: no=179 \u2192 Episode 5\n... and so on.\n\nSo for episode 4, row_index is 3.

That doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again.

No, let me check the exact viewers for each row.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each row's \"us viewers\" column.\n\nLet me list all rows with their viewers:\n\nRow 0 (episode 1): 2.23\nRow 1 (episode 2): 2.61\nRow 2 (episode 3): 1.84\nWait, no, that can't be right because the first row after 175 is 176, but the viewers vary.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go through each data entry.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe first data array is for row_index 0: 175, \"no\"=1, title=... , \"us viewers (million)\"=2.23?\n\nWait no, in the given table, each row in the data starts with a number which increments by 1, so the first row (row_index 0) is episode 1 with no=175, then row_index 1 is episode 2 with no=176, etc.\n\nLooking at the \"us viewers\" column:\n\nRow 0: 2.23\nRow 1: 2.61\nRow 2: 1.84\nRow 3: 2.61 (no, wait, in row 3 it's 2.61?

The \"us viewers\" is 2.23.\n\nRow 1: \nno=176 \u2192 episode 2; us viewers=2.61\n\nRow 2:\nno=177 \u2192 episode 3; us viewers=1.84\n\nRow 3:\nno=178 \u2192 episode4; us viewers=2.61\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the earlier rows. Wait no:\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nThe data starts as follows (just first few):\n\n175: episode1, 2.23\n176: episode2, 2.24\n177: episode3, 1.84\n178: episode4, 2.61\n\nWait, that would make sense if row_index 0 is 175 \u2192 episode1: 2.23\nrow_index 1 is 176 \u2192 episode2: 2.24\nrow_index 2: 177 \u2192 episode3: 1.84\nrow_index 3:178\u2192episode4:2.61\n\nSo the claim says episode4 was seen by 2.24 million people, but according to row_index3, it's 2.61.\n\nWait, that would make the claim FALSE because the actual viewers are higher than 2.24.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me re-express:\n\nEach row in data corresponds to a specific episode number, with no being the key identifier starting from 175 upwards.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow_index=0: no=175 \u2192 episode1; us viewers=2.23\nRow_index=1: no=176 \u2192 episode2; us viewers=2.24\nRow_index=2: no=177 \u2192 episode3; us viewers=1.84\nRow_index=3: no=178 \u2192 episode4; us viewers=2.61\n\nSo, if the claim is about episode4 being seen by 2.24 million people, that's not correct because episode4 (no=178) has 2.61 million viewers.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting rows and episodes. Let me make a table:\n\n| row_index | no      | episode_number | us_viewers |\n|-----------|---------|---------------|------------|\n| 0         | 175     | 1             | 2.23       |\n| 1         | 176     | 2             | 2.24       |\n| 2         | 177     | 3             | 1.84       |\n| 3         | 178     | 4             | 2.61       |\n\nYes, so episode4 is row_index3 with us_viewers=2.61.\n\nSo the claim says episode4 had 2.24 viewers \u2192 which is not true; it's higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait: in row1 (episode2), us_viewers=2.24. So if the claim was about episode2 being seen by 2.24 million people, that would be correct.\n\nBut the claim is about episode4. So no, it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the data; maybe the viewers for row1 are 2.61 and not 2.24.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem:\n\nThe user provided a table with the first few rows as:\n\n175: episode1\n\n176: episode2\n\n177: episode3\n\n178: episode4\n\nEach has various details, including \"us viewers (million)\".\n\nLooking again:\n\nI think I may have misread it earlier. Let me check:\n\nIn the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\nFor example, the first row in the table is:\n\n175 | Episode 1 | ... | United States: 2.23 million viewers\n\nThen the next row:\n\n176 | Episode 2 | ... | United States: 2.24 million viewers\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Let me check again.\n\nIn the problem statement, it says:\n\n\"For example, here is a table of episodes, their directors, writers, air dates, and U.S. viewers (in millions):\"\n\nThen it shows an example with the first four rows:\n\n175 | Episode 1 | ... | United States: 2.23 million viewers\n\n176 | Episode 2 | ... | United States: 2.24 million viewers\n\n177 | Episode 3 | ... | United States: 1.84 million viewers\n\n178 | Episode 4 | ... | United States: 2.61 million viewers\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nEpisode 1: 2.23M\nEpisode 2: 2.24M\nEpisode3:1.84M\nEpisode4:2.61M\n\nThus, if the claim is \"Episode4 had 2.24 million viewers\", that's incorrect because it actually has 2.61M.\n\nTherefore, the user's task is to determine whether a given statement about EpisodeX having Y viewers is correct based on this table.\n\nIn this case, the example given was about Episode4, but in reality, the actual viewers for Episode4 are higher than 2.24M.\n\nSo, if someone claims that Episode4 had 2.24 million viewers, it's incorrect because the actual number is 2.61M.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Episode 4 had 2.24 million viewers is incorrect. According to the table provided, Episode 4 actually had 2.61 million viewers in the United States.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because Episode 4 had 2.61 million viewers, not 2.24 million.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 6 episode number for episode directed by wayne rose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that there should be six episodes where each was directed by Wayne Rose. So, my goal is to check if there are exactly six rows in the table where the \"directed by\" column lists Wayne Rose.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns include \"no\", \"-\", \"title\", \"directed by\", and others. The relevant column here is \"directed by\". \n\nNext, I'll go through each row to see who directed each episode. Let's start from row 0:\n\n- Row 175: Directed by Kevin G Fair\n- Row 176: Directed by Mairzee Almas\n- Row 177: Directed by Michael Rohl\n- Row 178: Directed by Wayne Rose\n- Row 179: Directed by Kevin G Fair\n- Row 180: Directed by Michael Rohl\n- Row 181: Directed by Jeannot Szwarc\n- Row 182: Directed by Glen Winter\n- Row 183: Directed by Morgan Beggs\n- Row 184: Directed by Mairzee Almas\n- Row 185: Directed by Geoff Johns (with Tom Welling)\n- Row 186: Directed by Allison Mack\n- Row 187: Directed by Christopher Petry\n- Row 188: Directed by Turi Meyer\n- Row 189: Directed by Kevin G Fair\n- Row 190: Directed by Tim Scanlan\n- Row 191: Directed by Michael Rohl\n- Row 192: Directed by Brian Peterson\n- Row 193: Directed by Kevin G Fair\n- Row 194: Directed by Glen Winter\n- Row 195: Directed by Jordan Hawley & Anne Cofell Saunders\n\nFrom this, I can see that Wayne Rose directed one episode, which is row 178. That's only one episode. The claim states there should be six episodes directed by him, but the table shows only one. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to find all rows where \"directed by\" is Wayne Rose. From the data, it's only row 178. So, the relevant cell is at row_index 4 (since the first row is index 0), and column_name is \"directed by\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on this table. The claim says, \"2.63 million people in China saw the episode called 'Kandor'.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and see what data is relevant here. Let me go through each column to understand what they represent.\n\nThe columns are: no, -, title, directed by, written by, us air date, production code, us viewers (million). So, \"no\" seems to be an index or identifier for each row, \"-\" might just be a placeholder, \"title\" is the name of the episode, \"directed by\" is the director, and so on.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: 2.63 million people in China and the episode title \"Kandor.\" \n\nLooking at the data, I need to find where the title is \"Kandor.\" Scanning through each row's \"title\" column:\n\n- Row 0: savior\n- Row 1: metallo\n- Row 2: rabid\n- Row 3: echo\n- Row 4: roulette\n- Row 5: crossfire\n- Row 6: kandor\n- Row 7: idol\n- ... and so on.\n\nSo, the episode \"Kandor\" is in row 6. Now, let's check if there's any data related to viewership numbers for this specific episode.\n\nLooking at the column \"us viewers (million),\" which should give the number of people who watched the episode in the US. For row 6, the value is 2.63 million. However, the claim mentions viewers in China, not the US. The table doesn't have a separate column for Chinese viewers, only for US viewers. There's no indication that 2.63 million refers to China specifically.\n\nFurthermore, each episode's data includes \"us air date,\" which is when it premiered on US TV. Since the claim talks about viewers in China, we need information about whether or how many people in China watched this specific episode. But the table doesn't provide any Chinese viewer data\u2014it only gives US numbers and other production details.\n\nTherefore, while row 6 does have a title of \"Kandor\" and a US viewership number of 2.63 million, there's no way to confirm that 2.63 million people in China saw it because the table doesn't provide Chinese viewer data. So, the claim can't be fully supported by the given information.\n\nIn conclusion, the relevant cells are row 6 for the episode title and column \"us viewers (million),\" but since the claim refers to Chinese viewers, which isn't available here, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}]}",
