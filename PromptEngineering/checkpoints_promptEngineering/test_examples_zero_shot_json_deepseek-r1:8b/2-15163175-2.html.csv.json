The claim says, \"bnp be the only party to end up with exactly one seat.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the 'seats' column in the table because the claim is about how many seats each party got. Let me go through each row of the data and check the 'party' and 'seats' columns.\n\nStarting from the first data point:\n- Party: conservative, seats: 3\nNext:\n- Labour: 2 seats\nThen:\n- Liberal Democrat: 3 seats\nGreen: 2 seats\nBNP: 1 seat\nChristian Peoples: '-' which I think means no seats?\nAbolish the congestion charge: '-'\nRespect: '-'\nUKIP: 0 seats\nEnglish Democrats: '-'\nLeft List: '-'\nUnity for Peace and Socialism: '-'\nRathy Alagaratnam: '-'\nOne London: '-'\n\nSo, looking at the 'seats' column, the BNP has exactly one seat. Now, I need to check if any other parties also have exactly one seat. From what I see:\n\n- UKIP ended up with 0 seats.\n- All other parties either have more than one seat or '-' which likely means they didn't get any.\n\nSo only BNP has exactly one seat. The claim says they're the only ones, so it should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other parties with one seat. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Conservative: 3\n2. Labour: 2\n3. Liberal Democrat: 3\n4. Green: 2\n5. BNP: 1\n6. Christian Peoples: -\n7. Abolish...: -\n8. Respect: -\n9. UKIP: 0\n10. English Democrats: -\n11. Left List: -\n12.

The data is organized in rows where each row represents a political party along with their associated vote counts and other statistics.\n\nThe claim specifically compares two parties: Labour and Christian People. So I should locate these two in the table to check their vote numbers.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- Labour's row has votes as 665,443.\n- Christian People's row shows votes as 70,294.\n\nTo compare these, I'll convert them to numbers for easier comparison. Labour has about 665k votes, and Christian People have around 70k votes. Clearly, 665,443 is much larger than 70,294.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because Labour's vote count exceeds that of Christian People.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are located at row indices 1 (Labour) and 6 (Christian People).

The claim says, \"UKIP have the largest decrease in vote percentage with a change of -6.3%.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. It has columns: party, votes, share, change, and seats. So, for each party listed, these are the respective data points.\n\nLooking through the data rows, there's a row for UKIP. Let me find that.

Now, I need to check if this is the largest decrease compared to other parties.\n\nI should compare each party's change column. Let's list out all the changes:\n\n- Conservative: +6.2%\n- Labour: +2.7%\n- Liberal Democrat: -5.3%\n- Green: -0.1%\n- BNP: +0.6%\n- Christian Peoples: +0.0%\n- Abolish the congestion charge: n/a\n- Respect: -2.1%\n- Ukip: -6.3%\n- English Democrats: n/a\n- Left List: n/a\n- Unity for Peace and Socialism: n/a\n- Rathy Alagaratnam: n/a\n- One London: n/a\n\nNow, looking at the change column, I need to find which has the largest percentage decrease (most negative). \n\nThe changes are:\n\nConservative: +6.2%\nLabour: +2.7%\nLiberal Democrat: -5.3%\nGreen: -0.1%\nBNP: +0.6%\nChristian Peoples: +0.0%\nAbolish: n/a\nRespect: -2.1%\nUKIP: -6.3%\nEnglish Democrats: n/a\nOthers: n/a.\n\nSo, the most negative change is UKIP at -6.3%. Next is Liberal Democrat at -5.3%, then Respect at -2.1%.\n\nTherefore, UKIP indeed has the largest decrease in vote percentage compared to others. \n\nWait, but I should double-check if any other party has a larger decrease than UKIP's -6.3%. Looking through the changes, no, none have a more negative number. The next is -5.3%, which is less than -6.3.\n\nAlso, checking for the term \"largest\" \u2013 it refers to the biggest in terms of magnitude, so the most negative is indeed the largest decrease.\n\nSo, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that UKIP has the largest decrease in vote percentage with a change of -6.3% is fully supported by the table data.

From the table:\n\n- The \"respect\" party has a vote share of 2.4%, with a change of -2.1%.\n- The \"left list\" has a vote share of 0.9%.\n\nThe claim states that respect earns 1.5% more than left list. To verify this, I'll calculate the difference in their shares.\n\nRespect's share: 2.4%\nLeft List's share: 0.9%\n\nDifference: 2.4 - 0.9 = 1.5%. \n\nThis matches exactly with the claim. However, I should also check if there are any other columns relevant to this comparison, such as seats or change, but since the claim only mentions vote share, I don't need those.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the calculation. Yes, 2.4 minus 0.9 is indeed 1.5%. So it seems correct at first glance. But looking deeper, maybe there's more to consider.\n\nI notice that \"respect\" has a negative change (-2.1%) and \"left list\" doesn't have a change specified beyond its vote share. Does this affect the comparison? The claim is only about the share itself, not the changes in share over time.
