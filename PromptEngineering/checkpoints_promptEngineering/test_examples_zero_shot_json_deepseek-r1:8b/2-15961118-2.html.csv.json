    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the provided table.\n\nThe claim is: \"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 points.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. **Only one team has the machine \"nsr250\"**\n2. **That same team (cup noodle honda) has less than 8 points**\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are:\n- year\n- class\n- team\n- machine\n- points\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Only cup noodle honda has nsr250.\"\n\nFrom the table data:\n- In row 0 (1993), the team is \"cup noodle - honda\" and machine is \"nsr250\".\n- In row 1 (1994), same team and machine.\n- Row 2 (1995) is \"hrc - honda\" with nsr500, so different machine.\n- Rows 3 and 4 are also not cup noodle honda.\n\nSo, only the first two rows (0 and 1) have \"cup noodle - honda\" as the team with \"nsr250\".\n\nNow, checking if they are the only ones. The next part of the claim says they should be the only team with nsr250. Let's see if any other teams in the table use nsr250.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n- Row 0: nsr250\n- Row 1: nsr250\n- Rows 2,3,4 have different machines (nsr500v, etc.)\n\nSo yes, only cup noodle honda has nsr250. Therefore, the first part is correct.\n\nNext, checking if their points are less than 8. The claim says they \"have less than 8 points.\" \n\nLooking at row 0: points = 8\nRow 1: points = 11\n\nSo in both cases, the points are equal to or above 8. But wait, the claim says \"less than 8,\" which would mean strictly less than 8, i.e., less than 7. \n\nIn row 0, they have exactly 8 points, so that's not less than 8. Row 1 has 11, which is also more than 8.\n\nThis means the claim's second part is incorrect because cup noodle honda doesn't have less than 8 points; they have at least 8 or more.\n\nPutting it together: The first part of the claim is true, but the second part is false. Since both parts need to be true for the overall claim to be TRUE, the entire statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"cup noodle honda\" is the only team with \"nsr250\" and has less than 8 points. \n\n- **Only Team with nsr250**: Correct. Only rows 0 and 1 have \"cup noodle - honda\" with \"nsr250\".\n- **Points Less Than 8**: Incorrect. Both rows have points equal to or above 8.\n\nSince one part is incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
