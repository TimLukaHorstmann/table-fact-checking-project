    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the format of season 6 be q145\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"season 6\". So I should look at the 'season' column in the table to find all episodes that are part of season 6. The format of an episode is given by the 'format' column, so my focus will be on matching where the format is \"q145\" for season 6.\n\nLooking at the table's structure, each row represents an episode with several attributes: episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate. To verify the claim, I need to find all episodes that are in season 6 and check their formats.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to identify which ones belong to season 6. The 'season' column has values from 1 to 16, with season numbers increasing as we go down the list. So, season 6 would be the 6th row (since rows are zero-indexed). Let me count: row 0 is season 1, row 1 season 2, up to row 5 being season 6.\n\nNow, I need to check the 'format' column for this specific row. Looking at row 5 (which is the 6th episode in the data), the format is \"q145\". So the claim states that the format of season 6 is \"q145\", which matches exactly with this data point.\n\nTherefore, all conditions of the claim are met: there's a season 6 and its format is indeed \"q145\".\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the format of season 6 be q145,\" I identified the relevant row in the table where the season number is 6. The corresponding format for that episode is indeed \"q145.\" \n\nThe answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are episode, season, format, title, and original airdate. Each row represents a different episode with corresponding data. So, each row has information about an individual episode, including its format.\n\nThe claim is about \"season 6.0 having q245 as its format.\" Hmm, I need to see if there's any data in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the columns, the 'format' column seems relevant because it lists the format for each episode. So, I should check the 'format' column for season 6. But wait, the seasons go from 1 to 16 according to the data provided. Let me confirm: in the data rows, the second value is the season number. For example, the first row has season 1, the next season 2, and so on up to season 16.\n\nSo, I need to find if there's a row where the 'season' column is 6.0, which might be represented as an integer or a float. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: season 1\n- Row 1: season 2\n- Row 2: season 3\n- Row 3: season 4\n- Row 4: season 5\n- Row 5: season 6\n\nWait, in the data provided, let me count:\n\nRow 0: 217,1,... \u2192 season 1\nRow 1: 218,2,... \u2192 season 2\nRow 2: 219,3,... \u2192 season 3\nRow 3: 220,4,... \u2192 season 4\nRow 4: 221,5,... \u2192 season 5\nRow 5: 222,6,... \u2192 season 6\n\nSo yes, there is a row for season 6. Now, what's the format for that season? Let me check the 'format' column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: h75\n- Row 1: h76\n- Row 2: q143\n- Row 3: q144\n- Row 4: h77\n- Row 5: q145\n\nWait, no. The 'format' for season 6 (row 5) is \"q145\". But the claim says it should be \"q245\". So that's a discrepancy.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake in mapping the rows to seasons. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: episode 217, season 1\nRow 1: episode 218, season 2\nRow 2: episode 219, season 3\nRow 3: episode 220, season 4\nRow 4: episode 221, season 5\nRow 5: episode 222, season 6\n\nSo yes, row 5 is season 6 with format \"q145\". Therefore, the claim says it should be \"q245\", but it's actually \"q145\".\n\nWait another thought: maybe the numbering of formats isn't directly sequential or corresponds to the episode number. Or perhaps I'm miscounting the rows.\n\nLooking at the data again:\n\nRow 0 (episode 217): format h75\nRow 1 (218): h76\nRow 2 (219): q143\nRow3(220):q144\nRow4(221):h77\nRow5(222):q145\nRow6(223):q146\nRow7(224):h78\nRow8(225):q147\nRow9(226):h79\nRow10(227):h80\nRow11(228):q148\nRow12(229):q149\nRow13(230):q150\nRow14(231):h81\nRow15(232):h82\n\nSo, the format for season 6 is \"q145\" which doesn't match \"q245\". Therefore, the claim seems to be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the row indices. Let me check: each row corresponds to a different episode, so the first row (row index 0) is episode 217, season 1. The sixth row (row index 5) would be episode 222, season 6. So yes, it's \"q145\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the format for season 6 is \"q145\", not \"q245\". Hence, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is: \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the given table.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: episode, season, format, title, original airdate. The data rows have various values for these columns. Now, the claim is making a specific assertion about episode number 223 and the 'format' being \"q147\". It also mentions that it's the only episode with this format.\n\nSo, my first task is to locate all the rows where the 'format' is \"q147\" and check if 223 is indeed one of them. Then, I need to ensure that no other episode number has the same format.\n\nStarting with row 223, which is in index 7 (since it's a zero-based index? Wait, let me count: the first row is index 0, so row 7 would be the eighth entry, but let me confirm. Wait, looking at the table:\n\nThe rows are numbered from 0 to 23 (since there are 24 episodes listed). So row 223 is actually in the data array as the 8th element because arrays start at zero. Wait no, wait: each sublist in data represents a row. For example, the first sublist is [217,1,\"h75\",...], which would correspond to episode 217, season 1, etc.\n\nWait, but the episodes go from 217 up to 232, so the rows are arranged such that each row is an individual episode with its own details.\n\nSo, to find all instances where 'format' is \"q147\", I need to scan through each row's format column and see which ones match. Let me look at each row:\n\nRow 0: h75\nRow 1: h76\nRow 2: q143\nRow 3: q144\nRow 4: h77\nRow 5: q145\nRow 6: q146\nRow 7: q147 \u2192 this is episode 223, so yes.\nRow 8: h78\nRow9: q147 \u2192 this is episode 225\nWait, row 9 (index 9) has \"q147\" as the format. So that's another episode with the same format.\n\nTherefore, there are at least two episodes with 'format' q147: episode 223 and 225. That would mean the claim stating that 223 is the only one is false because 225 also shares this format.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each row. Let me go through each entry:\n\n- Row 7 (index 7): q147 \u2192 episode 223\n- Row9 (index 9): q147 \u2192 episode 225\n\nSo that's two episodes with the same format. Therefore, the claim is false because there are multiple episodes with 'q147' format.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all the formats:\n\nLooking at each row's format:\n\n0: h75\n1: h76\n2: q143\n3: q144\n4: h77\n5: q145\n6: q146\n7: q147 \u2192 223\n8: h78\n9: q147 \u2192 225\n10: q147? Wait no, row10 is index10: \"h79\" for episode 226. So no.\n\nWait, wait, let me list each row with their format:\n\nRow 0: h75\n1: h76\n2: q143\n3: q144\n4: h77\n5: q145\n6: q146\n7: q147 \u2192 223\n8: h78\n9: q147 \u2192 225\n10: h79\n11: h80\n12: q148\n13: q149\n14: q150\n15: h81\n16: h82\n\nSo, only two rows have format \"q147\": row7 and row9. So both episodes 223 and 225 are in the 'format' column as \"q147\". Therefore, the claim that 223 is the only one is false.\n\nThus, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's another episode (225) with the same format.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check each relevant cell in the table. The claim states that episode number 223 has a unique 'q147' format and is the only one. However, upon reviewing the data, we find that both episode 223 (row index 7) and episode 225 (row index 9) have the 'format' as \"q147\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
