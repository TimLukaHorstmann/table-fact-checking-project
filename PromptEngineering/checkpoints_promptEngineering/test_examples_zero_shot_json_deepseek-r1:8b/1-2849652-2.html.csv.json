    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the 2011 - 2012 soccer state tournament be held in crew stadium, columbus\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, year of the first tournament, and location of the 2011-2012 state tournament. Each row in the data represents a different sport or event for a specific season.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the 2011-2012 soccer state tournament and its location. So, I should look for the relevant row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the \"sport\" column, there are entries for cross country, field hockey, soccer, bowling, gymnastics, and swimming and diving. Soccer is one of them, so that's a good start.\n\nNext, I check the season for the soccer entry. The data shows \"fall\" as the season. So, we're looking at the fall season tournament.\n\nNow, the claim mentions the 2011-2012 state tournament. Let me look at the year column. Wait, in the table, each row lists a different year: 1978, 1979, 1985, 2007, 1977, and another 1977. Hmm, I don't see a 2011 or 2012 here. That's odd because the claim is about 2011-2012.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again. The columns are \"season,\" \"sport,\" \"tournament structure,\" \"of divisions,\" \"1st tournament,\" and \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location.\" Oh, wait! There's a specific column for the 2011-2012 state tournament location. So perhaps that's where I should look.\n\nLooking at each row, only some have data in the sixth column (the last one). Let me check each row:\n\n1. First row: 1978 - Not relevant.\n2. Second row: 1979 - Also not relevant.\n3. Third row: 1985 - No.\n4. Fourth row: 2007 - No.\n5. Fifth row: 1977 - No.\n6. Sixth row: 1977 - Still no.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows have data in the sixth column for 2011-2012. So does that mean the table doesn't provide information about the 2011-2012 tournament? If so, then I can't confirm whether crew stadium was used because there's no data point for that year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"1st tournament\" column is for when each sport started, not necessarily related to 2011-2012. So perhaps the 2011-2012 state tournament location isn't listed in the table at all.\n\nGiven that, I can't find any relevant data that supports the claim about the location of the 2011-2012 soccer tournament being held at crew stadium in columbus. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no evidence in the provided table to support it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is made about a specific event not listed in the table, thus lacking support.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"winter gymnastics have 1 division in the 2011 - 2012 state tournament.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Winter gymnastics refers to a specific sport season, which likely corresponds to one of the rows in the data. The claim mentions the 2011-2012 state tournament location, so I should look for that year and see if winter gymnastics is listed there with the correct number of divisions.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: season, sport, tournament structure, of divisions, 1st tournament, and 2011 - 2012 state tournament location. Each row represents a different sport. \n\nI'll go through each row to find where winter gymnastics is mentioned and check if it relates to the 2011-2012 state tournament.\n\nRow 4: season is winter, sport is gymnastics. The tournament structure is \"sectional , district , & state\". The number of divisions (of divisions) is 1. This seems relevant because the claim mentions winter gymnastics with 1 division in 2011-2012. \n\nWait, but does this row have information about the 2011-2012 state tournament location? No, it's talking about 1977. So maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nRow 5: winter, swimming and diving. Their tournament structure is similar with 2 divisions, but that's for swimming, not gymnastics.\n\nRow 6: Same as row 4, but with different information. Wait, no, row 4 is gymnastics in 1977. The claim refers to 2011-2012. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait a second, the data seems to have more rows than just these. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: fall, cross country, tournament structure includes district, regional, state with 3 divisions, but it's for 1978, so not relevant.\nRow 1: fall, field hockey, 1 division in 1979, also not the right year or sport.\nRow 2: fall, soccer, 3 divisions in 1985, again wrong season and year.\nRow 3: winter, bowling, 2 divisions in 2007, nope.\nRow 4: winter, gymnastics, tournament structure has sectional, district, state with 1 division (of divisions), but the first tournament is 1977. So this doesn't mention 2011-2012.\nRow 5: winter, swimming and diving, 2 divisions in 1977, not relevant.\n\nWait, so none of the rows for winter gymnastics mention the 2011-2012 state tournament location. The only information about gymnastics is in row 4, which refers to 1977. So where is the data for 2011-2012?\n\nLooking back at the table, I realize that each row might not include all columns. Wait, no\u2014the table has \"columns\" and \"data\". Each data row must have values corresponding to each column in order.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again:\n\nColumns are:\n0: season\n1: sport\n2: tournament structure\n3: of divisions\n4: 1st tournament\n5: 2011 - 2012 state tournament location\n\nSo for each row, columns 0-5 should be filled. Let me check row by row.\n\nRow 0:\nseason: fall\nsport: cross country\ntournament structure: district , regional , & state\nof divisions:3\n1st tournament:1978\nstate tournament location: national trail raceway, hebron\n\nRow 1:\nfall\nfield hockey\nstate qualifying & state\n1 division (but wait, column 3 is \"of divisions\", so row 1 says 1 division? Wait no, in the data it's written as 1. So for row 1, of divisions is 1.\n\nWait, but the claim is about winter gymnastics having 1 division in 2011-2012. So I need to find a row where season is winter, sport is gymnastics, and in that same row, column 5 (2011-2012 state tournament location) exists, and also check if column 3 is 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the data provided, the only winter sports are rows 3,4,5. So:\n\nRow 3: bowling\nRow 4: gymnastics\nRow5: swimming\n\nSo row 4 is winter, gymnastics. The tournament structure is \"sectional , district , & state\". Column 3 (of divisions) is 1. But what about column 5? Does it have the location for 2011-2012?\n\nIn the given data, each row has all columns filled. So in row4:\n\ncolumns: season (winter), sport (gymnastics), tournament structure (sectional , district , & state), of divisions (1), 1st tournament (1977), and 2011-2012 location.\n\nWait, but looking at the data, each sub-array has six elements. So in row4, [ \"winter\", \"gymnastics\", ..., ... , \"hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\" ] which is column5.\n\nSo for row4:\n\ncolumn0: winter\ncolumn1: gymnastics\ncolumn2: tournament structure: sectional, district, & state\ncolumn3: of divisions: 1\ncolumn4: 1st tournament:1977\ncolumn5: location: hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\n\nSo the claim is that in 2011-2012, winter gymnastics had 1 division. But looking at column3, it's 1, but when is this applicable? The 1st tournament is 1977.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the number of divisions refers to how many levels or steps in the tournament structure, not necessarily for a specific year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row has data for different years. So for example, row4: gymnastics with 1 division in the 2011-2012 state tournament.\n\nWait, but column5 is \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\". So in row4, it's hilliard bradley high school. But does this mean that in the 2011-2012 state tournament for gymnastics, there was 1 division?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"winter gymnastics have 1 division in the 2011 - 2012 state tournament.\" So to verify, I need to find a row where:\n\n- season is winter\n- sport is gymnastics\n- in that same row, column3 (of divisions) is 1\n- and also, since the claim refers to 2011-2012, perhaps column5 should match? Or maybe it's about the state tournament location for that year.\n\nWait, but the columns are:\n\ncolumns = [\n  \"season\",\n  \"sport\",\n  \"tournament structure\",\n  \"of divisions\",\n  \"1st tournament\",\n  \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\"\n]\n\nSo each row has six elements: season, sport, tournament structure, of divisions, first tournament (year), and the location in 2011-2012.\n\nTherefore, to verify the claim, we need a row where:\n\n- season is winter\n- sport is gymnastics\n- of divisions is 1\n- The row must have data for 2011-2012 state tournament location, which it does (column5)\n\nLooking at the data, only row4 is winter and gymnastics.\n\nIn row4:\n\nseason: winter\n\nsport: gymnastics\n\ntournament structure: sectional, district, & state\n\nof divisions:1\n\nfirst tournament:1977\n\nstate tournament location: hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\n\nSo for the claim to be true, in 2011-2012, winter gymnastics had 1 division. But the row4's of divisions is 1, but that's for the 1977 first tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe \"of divisions\" refers to how many levels or steps in the tournament structure, not necessarily per year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each state has its own number of divisions. So if the row4 says \"of divisions:1\", then regardless of when it was held, for gymnastics, there's 1 division.\n\nBut the claim is specifically about 2011-2012.\n\nWait, but looking at the data, perhaps there's no row that includes both winter, gymnastics, and 2011-2012. Because in row4, the first tournament is 1977, which is different from 2011-2012.\n\nSo maybe there's no data for 2011-2012 in any of the rows provided. Therefore, the claim might not be supported by the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to interpret it. Maybe \"of divisions\" refers to how many divisions existed at the state level during a particular year, but without knowing which year each row corresponds to, beyond the first tournament and 2011-2012 location, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in row4, for gymnastics, of divisions is 1, so regardless of when, it had 1 division. Therefore, even if the first tournament was in 1977, it might still have 1 division in 2011-2012.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The claim says \"in the 2011 - 2012 state tournament,\" so perhaps that's referring to a specific event where they had 1 division.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is structured such that each row corresponds to a specific year's state tournament. So if row4 refers to 1977, then it wouldn't apply to 2011-2012.\n\nTherefore, without any row for winter gymnastics in 2011-2012, the claim isn't supported by the given data.\n\nSo, in conclusion, based on the provided data, there is no evidence that winter gymnastics had 1 division in the 2011-2012 state tournament.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying whether winter gymnastics had 1 division during the 2011-2012 state tournament. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- The table lists each sport's details, including the number of divisions (column3).\n- Only row4 pertains to winter gymnastics:\n  - Season: Winter\n  - Sport: Gymnastics\n  - Of divisions: 1\n  - First tournament: 1977\n  - Location in 2011-2012: Hilliard Bradley High School, Hilliard\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no data indicating that winter gymnastics had a division in the 2011-2012 state tournament. The information provided only mentions the 1977 tournament.\n\n**Answer:**  \nNo, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that winter gymnastics had 1 division during the 2011-2012 state tournament based on the provided data.",

The claim says: \"in 1978 there be 1 winter season with exactly 1 division.\" \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific year, 1978, and is talking about a winter season. It refers to having exactly 1 division. So, in the table provided, I need to look for rows that correspond to 1978, winter season, and specifically check if there's only one division mentioned under \"tournament structure.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different sports with their respective details. The columns are: season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, year, and location.\n\nSo, I need to filter the rows where:\n- Season is winter (since the claim is about a winter season)\n- The year is 1978\n- And the \"tournament structure\" has exactly one division\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\n1. First row: season is fall, so not relevant for winter.\n2. Second row: season is fall again, same reason.\n3. Third row: season is winter, but the year is 1985, which doesn't match 1978.\n4. Fourth row: season is winter and year is 2007, not 1978.\n5. Fifth row: season is winter, year is 1977, not 1978.\n6. Sixth row: same as fifth, year is 1977.\n\nSo, looking at the relevant rows for winter and 1978, there are none. The only winters in the table are from 1977, 2007, and 1985, none of which are 1978. Therefore, there's no data point that matches both winter season and year 1978.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's look again at each row:\n\n- Row 3: winter, 1985\n- Row 4: winter, 2007\n- Rows 5 and 6: winter, 1977\n\nNo 1978 rows exist for winter.\n\nSince there are no entries in the table that match both winter season and the year 1978, the claim can't be supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 1st tournament of bowling be in 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It mentions the \"1st tournament of bowling.\" So I'm looking for an entry in the table where the sport is bowling and it refers to the first tournament. The year mentioned in the claim is 2007, so I need to check if any row has bowling as the sport and indicates that the 1st tournament took place in 2007.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided:\n\nThe columns are: season, sport, tournament structure, of divisions, 1st tournament, and 2011 - 2012 state tournament location. The data rows have information corresponding to these columns.\n\nNow, let's look through each row to see which ones match the criteria.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Season: fall\n- Sport: cross country\n- Tournament structure: district , regional , & state\n- Of divisions: 3\n- 1st tournament: 1978\n- Location: national trail raceway , hebron\n\nThis is for cross country, not bowling, so it doesn't apply.\n\nSecond row:\n- Season: fall\n- Sport: field hockey\n- Tournament structure: state qualifying & state\n- Of divisions: 1\n- 1st tournament: 1979\n- Location: upper arlington high school , upper arlington\n\nAgain, not relevant to bowling.\n\nThird row:\n- Season: fall\n- Sport: soccer\n- Tournament structure: sectional , district , regional & state\n- Of divisions: 3\n- 1st tournament: 1985\n- Location: crew stadium , columbus\n\nNot related to bowling either.\n\nFourth row:\n- Season: winter\n- Sport: bowling\n- Tournament structure: sectional , district , & state\n- Of divisions: 2\n- 1st tournament: 2007\n- Location: wayne webb 's columbus bowl , columbus\n\nThis looks promising. The sport is bowling, and the first tournament occurred in 2007. So this row seems to directly support the claim.\n\nLet me check the remaining rows just in case there's another relevant one.\n\nFifth row:\n- Season: winter\n- Sport: gymnastics\n- Tournament structure: sectional , district , & state\n- Of divisions: 1\n- 1st tournament: 1977\n- Location: hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\n\nNot relevant.\n\nSixth row:\n- Season: winter\n- Sport: swimming and diving\n- Tournament structure: sectional , district , & state\n- Of divisions: 2\n- 1st tournament: 1977\n- Location: branin natatorium , canton\n\nAlso not applicable.\n\nSo, only the fourth row has bowling as the sport with the first tournament in 2007. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data point.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim mentions two specific parts: \"the 1st tournament of bowling\" and the year \"2007.\"\n\nIn the table, these correspond to the columns \"1st tournament\" and the year in that row. So for the fourth row:\n\n- The value under \"1st tournament\" is 2007.\n- The location is provided as well, but since the claim doesn't mention the location, we only need the column where it's specified as the first tournament.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row index 3 (since arrays are zero-indexed) for both the \"1st tournament\" and the year. Wait, actually, in JSON, array indices start at 0. So the fourth row is index 3. The columns we need to extract are \"1st tournament\" and \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location,\" but since the claim only refers to the first tournament's year, maybe I should include both relevant columns.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: the claim is about the 1st tournament of bowling being in 2007. So we need the cell that indicates the 1st tournament and the cell that has the year. But actually, each row already contains the year in the specific column. Wait, no, looking at the table again:\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. The columns are:\n\n- season\n- sport\n- tournament structure\n- of divisions\n- 1st tournament\n- 2011 - 2012 state tournament location\n\nSo each row has values for all these columns. For example, the fourth row's data is [ \"winter\", \"bowling\", \"sectional , district , & state\", 2, 2007, \"wayne webb 's columbus bowl , columbus\" ]\n\nSo, in this row, the 5th element (index 4) is the 1st tournament year, which is 2007. Therefore, the cell for \"1st tournament\" is 2007.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the 1st tournament of bowling be in 2007.\" So we need to find the row where sport is bowling and the first tournament occurred in 2007.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the column \"1st tournament\" for the value 2007, which is at index 4. Also, since the claim refers to the 1st tournament, maybe also include the column name \"1st tournament\". But looking back at the example given, it's about checking each condition against the table. So in this case, the two conditions are: 1) the sport is bowling, and 2) the first tournament was in 2007.\n\nTherefore, to check these conditions, we need to look for rows where:\n\n- Sport = bowling\n- 1st tournament = 2007\n\nSo, in the table, only one row satisfies both conditions: the fourth row (index 3). Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the sport being bowling: the \"sport\" column.\n- For the first tournament year: the \"1st tournament\" column.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include both these columns for that specific row. So in the JSON, we'll have two objects: one pointing to row 3 and \"sport\", and another pointing to row 3 and \"1st tournament\". Wait, no, each row is a list of values, so each value corresponds to a column.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify:\n\nEach data row has multiple cells (columns), so for the fourth row (index 3):\n\n- The columns are:\n  0: season\n  1: sport\n  2: tournament structure\n  3: of divisions\n  4: 1st tournament\n  5: 2011 - 2012 state tournament location\n\nSo, the cells relevant to verify the claim \"the 1st tournament of bowling be in 2007\" are:\n\n- The cell for the sport (column 1) which is \"bowling\" at row index 3.\n- The cell for the first tournament year (column 4), which is 2007 at row index 3.\n\nTherefore, both columns need to be checked: one because it's bowling, and another because the first tournament was in 2007. Thus, both cells are relevant.\n\nSo, in the JSON, the relevant_cells array should include objects for each of these columns in row 3.\n\nHence, two entries:\n\n{\n  \"row\": 3,\n  \"column\": \"1st tournament\",\n  \"value\": \"2007\"\n},\n{\n  \"row\": 3,\n  \"column\": \"sport\",\n  \"value\": \"bowling\"\n}\n\nBut the example given in the problem statement's initial part shows a similar structure, I think. However, perhaps the columns are identified by their names, so each cell is addressed by its column name.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should include both cells: one for the sport and one for the 1st tournament year.\n\nSo, final answer would be that the claim is supported because in row 3 (winter), the sport is bowling, and the first tournament occurred in 2007. Therefore, the relevant cells are the \"sport\" column with value \"bowling\" and the \"1st tournament\" column with value \"2007\".\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying that the \"1st tournament of bowling\" occurred in 2007 by examining specific columns in a provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** To verify the claim, we need to check two specific pieces of information:\n   - The sport for the row.\n   - The year of the first tournament for that row.\n\n2. **Locate the Appropriate Row:** We look for a row where the sport is \"bowling.\" In this case, it's found in the fourth row (index 3).\n\n3. **Extract the Year from the First Tournament Column:** Within the identified row, the year of the first tournament is specified as 2007.\n\n4. **Determine Relevant Cells:** The relevant cells are:\n   - The \"sport\" column for the value \"bowling.\"\n   - The \"1st tournament\" column for the value \"2007.\"\n\n5. **Construct the Answer:** Based on the above, the JSON structure includes both cells as evidence supporting the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 3,\n      \"column\": \"sport\",\n      \"value\": \"bowling\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 3,\n      \"column\": \"1st tournament\",\n      \"value\": \"2007\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are: season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, year of the 1st tournament, and the location of that 1st tournament. The data rows provide information for each sport during a specific season.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the 1st tournament associated with bowling.\" So I need to look at the row where the sport is bowling and check two things: when was its first tournament, and what year does the claim refer to (2006).\n\nLooking at the table, there's only one row for bowling. Let me locate that row. The columns in order are season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, 1st tournament year, and location.\n\nThe bowling row is the fourth one:\n[\n  \"winter\",\n  \"bowling\",\n  \"sectional , district , & state\",\n  2,\n  2007,\n  \"wayne webb 's columbus bowl , columbus\"\n]\n\nWait, that's strange.

The fifth column is labeled \"1st tournament\" and has values like 1978, 1979, 1985, etc. For the bowling row, it's 2007. So the first tournament for bowling happened in 2007, not 2006.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it was in 2006 is FALSE because the actual year is 2007. I need to find which cells are relevant.

It mentions the winter season, specifically the 2011-2012 state tournament location at Crew Stadium in Columbus.\n\nLooking at the table, I should identify which columns and rows are relevant. The table has several columns: season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, first tournament, and 2011-2012 state tournament location.\n\nThe claim is about the 2011-2012 state tournament location, so the column I need to look at is \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\". The row index will help me find which row corresponds to the winter season.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Season is fall. So not relevant for winter.\nRow 1: Also fall, so no.\nRow 2: Winter, but the year here is 1985, which is before 2011-2012. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Winter again, but the year is 2007, still earlier than 2011-2012.\nRow 4: Winter with year 1977, not matching.\nRow 5: Winter and year 1977 as well.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. All winter rows have years before 2011-2012 except for maybe one? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nThe fifth row (index 4) is winter with gymnastics, tournament structure as sectional, district, & state, number of divisions 1, and location \"hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\". The sixth row (index 5) is also winter but for swimming and diving, location Branin Natatorium, Canton.\n\nHmm, so in the table provided, there's no entry for the 2011-2012 state tournament. All entries are from earlier years: 1977, 1978, 1985, 2007. Therefore, the claim is about a year not present in the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"2011 - 2012\", which isn't in the data. So does that mean it's false?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n0: Fall\n1: Fall\n2: Winter (1985)\n3: Winter (2007)\n4: Winter (1977)\n5: Winter (1977)\n\nNone of these are for 2011-2012. So, the claim is about a location in 2011-2012, which isn't listed in any row's \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\" column.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure again: The columns are \"season\", \"sport\", etc., but I think each row has all the data. So for each row, we have details like season (fall or winter), sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, first tournament year, and 2011-2012 location.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the table's column definitions:\n\nThe \"data\" is an array of arrays, each with six elements corresponding to the columns listed. So, for each row, the sixth element (index 5) is the \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\".\n\nSo, in the data provided, let's list out those locations:\n\nRow 0: national trail raceway , hebron\nRow 1: upper arlington high school , upper arlington\nRow 2: crew stadium , columbus\nRow 3: wayne webb 's columbus bowl , columbus\nRow 4: hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\nRow 5: branin natatorium , canton\n\nWait, row 2 is the third row (index 2) and it's for soccer in 1985. So the location there is Crew Stadium, Columbus.\n\nBut the claim is about the winter season, specifically 2011-2012. Looking at all rows, none have a location for the winter season in 2011-2012. All winter entries are from 1977 onwards but not reaching 2011-2012.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data in the table for the winter season in 2011-2012, the claim is false because the information isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a location that doesn't exist in the provided table. Since there are no entries for the 2011-2012 state tournament in the winter season, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
