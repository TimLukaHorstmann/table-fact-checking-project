    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Patty Sheehan be the runner up in the Corning Classic on May 30, 1982\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the claim. The key elements are:\n- **Person**: Patty Sheehan\n- **Position**: Runner-up (or did she win? Wait, the claim says \"runner up\", which is a type of finish, not necessarily the position in the tournament.)\nWait, actually, looking at the table, I see that each row has a \"runner(s) - up\" column. So maybe Patty Sheehan was the runner-up in that specific tournament.\n\nNext, I need to find the relevant data in the table. The claim mentions the Corning Classic on May 30, 1982. Let me check if there's an entry for this date and tournament in the data section of the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The first row is July 3, 1966.\n- Second: August 3, 1969.\n- Third: May 5, 1974.\n- Fourth: May 29, 1977.\n- Fifth: September 7, 1980.\n- Sixth row: May 30, 1982. This matches the date in the claim.\n- Seventh row: September 12, 1982.\n\nSo the relevant row is index 5 (since it's zero-based? Wait, the first data row is index 0, so May 30, 1982 would be row 5? Let me confirm:\n\nIndex 0: Jul 3,1966\n1: Aug 3,1969\n2: May 5,1974\n3: May29,1977\n4: Sep7,1980\n5: May30,1982\n6: Sep12,1982\n\nYes, row index is 5.\n\nNow, looking at the columns for this row:\n- date: May30,1982\n- tournament: Corning Classic\n- winning score: -8 (69+72+70+69=280)\n- margin of victory: playoff\n- runner(s) - up: Patty Sheehan\n\nSo in this row, the \"runner(s) - up\" column is Patty Sheehan. The claim says she was the runner-up in that tournament.\n\nTherefore, the data fully supports the claim. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are at row index 5, column \"runner (s) - up\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner(s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"judy rankin be the runner up on aug 3 , 1969\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and then analyze the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table columns: they are date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runners-up. The data rows provide specific details for each tournament on certain dates.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Judy Rankin being the runner-up in the tournament held on August 3, 1969. So I should look for that exact date and the relevant columns to check if Judy Rankin was indeed a runner-up.\n\nLooking at the table's data rows:\n\n1. The first row has the date as \"jul 3 , 1966\" which is July 3, 1966, not August 3, so I can ignore this.\n2. The second row is for \"aug 3 , 1969\", which matches the date in the claim. This seems relevant because it's the exact tournament and date mentioned.\n3. The third row is May 5, 1974, so that's not August 3, 1969.\n4. Similarly, the other rows have dates like May 29, 1977; September 7, 1980; May 30, 1982; and September 12, 1982\u2014all of which are either different years or months, so they don't match August 3, 1969.\n\nSo the only relevant row for this claim is the second one, which corresponds to August 3, 1969. Now I need to check what the \"runner(s) - up\" column says for that specific row.\n\nLooking at the data for August 3, 1969, the runner-up is listed as \"judy rankin\". This exactly matches the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by this information from the table.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells beyond the direct match I found. For instance, does the tournament name or date affect anything? The claim specifies both the runner-up and the date, so only the cell with \"runner (s) - up\" in that specific row is directly relevant. The other columns like date, tournament, winning score, etc., might not be necessary unless they somehow contradict or add to the claim, but in this case, they just provide context.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant cell is the one at row index 1 (since it's the second element in the data array) and the column \"runner (s) - up\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table is in JSON format and contains information about various golf tournaments, including details like the date, tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and runners-up. \n\nThe claim given is: \"On Sep 12, 1982, Carole Charbonnier was a runner-up with a 1-stroke margin of victory.\" I need to check each part of this claim against the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Date**: September 12, 1982.\n2. **Name**: Carole Charbonnier.\n3. **Role**: Runner-up.\n4. **Margin of Victory**: 1 stroke.\n\nNow, I need to find the relevant row and column in the table that corresponds to these details.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, runner(s) - up.\n- Each row represents a different tournament with its associated details.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\n**Row 0:**\n- Date: Jul 3, 1966\n- Tournament: US Women's Open\n- Runner-up: Carol Mann\n- Margin: 1 stroke (but the winning score is +9)\n\nDoesn't match because date is July 3, 1966, not Sep 12, 1982. Also, the runner-up here is Carol Mann, not Carole Charbonnier.\n\n**Row 1:**\n- Date: Aug 3, 1969\n- Tournament: Buckeye Savings Invitational\n- Runner-up: Judy Rankin\n- Margin: 3 strokes\n\nAgain, date doesn't match, and the runner-up is Judy Rankin. So not relevant.\n\n**Row 2:**\n- Date: May 5, 1974\n- Tournament: Lady Tara Classic\n- Runner(s): Donna Caponi, Kathy Whitworth\n- Margin: Playoff\n\nNo match here either; date is May 1974, and runners are two women.\n\n**Row 3:**\n- Date: May 29, 1977\n- Tournament: Lady Keystone Open\n- Runner-up: Silvia Bertolaccini\n- Margin: 1 stroke (winning score is -9)\n\nDate doesn't match, and runner-up is different.

Also, runners are different people.\n\n**Row 5:**\n- Date: May 30, 1982\n- Tournament: Corning Classic\n- Runner-up: Patty Sheehan\n- Margin: Playoff\n\nDate is May 30, 1982, which doesn't match September 12. So no relevance here.\n\n**Row 6:**\n- Date: Sep 12, 1982\n- Tournament: Mary Kay Classic\n- Runner-up: Carole Charbonnier\n- Margin of victory: 1 stroke\n\nWait, this row matches all the criteria given in the claim. The date is September 12, 1982, and the runner-up is indeed Carole Charbonnier with a 1-stroke margin.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in Row 6 (which is index 6) for columns \"runner(s) - up\" and \"margin of victory\".\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The columns are:\n\n- date\n- tournament\n- winning score\n- margin of victory\n- runner(s) - up\n\nSo the row indices start at 0. Therefore, Row 6 is index 6.\n\nHence, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index: 6\n- column_name: \"runner (s) - up\"\n- And also, since the claim mentions the margin of victory, which is another column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}]}",

The claim is: \"the margin of victory on may 29 , 1977 be 4 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the row that matches the date May 29, 1977. Let me go through each row in the data array.\n\nRow 0: Jul 3, 1966 \u2013 not May 29, 1977.\nRow 1: Aug 3, 1969 \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: May 5, 1974 \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 3: May 29, 1977 \u2013 yes, this is the row we're interested in.\nRow 4: Sep 7, 1980 \u2013 different date.\nRows 5 and 6 are later dates as well.\n\nNow that I've found the correct row, I need to look at the \"margin of victory\" column.

Wait, that seems off because the claim is about a positive margin, but here it's negative. The value is -9, which means the winner was ahead by 9 strokes.\n\nSo the margin of victory is -9, not +4. Therefore, the claim is incorrect; it should be FALSE.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells. The columns involved are \"margin of victory\" and \"date\". So the row for May 29, 1977 has these details in specific columns.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- columns: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, runner(s) - up\nSo each row corresponds to a column. The date is the first element (column 0), and the margin is the third element (column 3).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are for row_index 3, column_name \"margin of victory\" and also \"date\" since the claim mentions both the date and the margin.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on May 29, 1977, the margin of victory was 4 strokes.

The claim mentions \"runner-up,\" which relates to the \"runner (s) - up\" column.

The table has five columns: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner(s) - up. Each row corresponds to a specific event with details filled in each column.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Donna Caponi being a runner-up on August 3, 1969. So my task is to find the relevant cells in the table that might support or contradict this claim.\n\nI'll start by checking which rows correspond to August 3, 1969. Looking at the \"date\" column, I see that each row has a date string formatted as \"month day , year\". Let me list out all the dates:\n\n1. jul 3 , 1966\n2. aug 3 , 1969\n3. may 5 , 1974\n4. may 29 , 1977\n5. sep 7 , 1980\n6. may 30 , 1982\n7. sep 12 , 1982\n\nSo the second row is the one for August 3, 1969.\n\nNow, looking at that row:\n\n- date: aug 3 , 1969\n- tournament: buckeye savings invitational\n- winning score: + 3 (71 + 72 + 70 = 213)\n- margin of victory: 3 strokes\n- runner(s) - up: judy rankin\n\nWait, the claim is about Donna Caponi being a runner-up. So I need to check if in that row, the \"runner(s) - up\" column has any mention of her.\n\nLooking at the runners-up list for that specific date (aug 3 , 1969), it says \"judy rankin\". There's no mention of Donna Caponi there. So this suggests she wasn't a runner-up in that tournament.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check other rows to see if there's any instance where Donna Caponi was a runner-up elsewhere, just to be thorough. However, the claim specifically refers to August 3, 1969, so only that row is relevant here.\n\nSo, in the second row (index 1), the column \"runner(s) - up\" doesn't list Donna Caponi.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the date when the win score be - 10 (69 - 72 - 70 - 59 - 280) be sep 12 , 1982\". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Wait, the way it's phrased isn't entirely clear. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe claim is talking about a date when there was a win score of -10, which is calculated as (69 -72 -70 -59) totaling 280? Or wait, maybe the calculation inside the parentheses is incorrect. Let me check: 69 minus 72 is -3, minus 70 is another -73, and then minus 59 would be -132. But that doesn't add up to 280. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row has a \"winning score\" column. For example, one of the rows has \"+9 (75 +74 +76 +72=297)\". So the winning score is calculated by adding individual scores and subtracting from the total? Or maybe it's the sum of the three scores minus 297? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Actually, in golf, the scoring system adds up the scores of each round and then compares them to the par or the course record.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about a specific date, September 12, 1982, having a win score of -10 with a calculation inside parentheses: (69 -72 -70 -59) leading to 280? Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, the table's \"winning score\" column shows values like \"+9 (75 +74 +76 +72=297)\" or \"-3 (71 +72 +70=213)\", etc. So in each case, it's the sum of the scores minus the par or something else? Or perhaps the total is compared to a certain value.\n\nWait, but in the claim, the winning score is given as -10, with the calculation being 69-72-70-59=280. That doesn't make sense because 69-72 is -3, then subtracting 70 would be -73, and subtracting another 59 would give -132, not 280.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me look at the table again. Each row has \"winning score\" as something like \"+9 (75 +74 +76 +72 =297)\", which might be adding up individual scores and subtracting from a base number to get the winning score.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's written as \"-10 (69 -72 -70 -59 -280)\". That seems off. Maybe I should check if any row in the table matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Jul 3, 1966: +9, etc.\n2. Aug 3, 1969: +3, etc.\n3. May 5, 1974: e (playoff), etc.\n4. May 29, 1977: -9, etc.\n5. Sep 7, 1980: -4, etc.\n6. May 30, 1982: -8, etc.\n7. Sep 12, 1982: -10, with the calculation as (70 +69 +67=206). Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, no. Let's check row 7: \"sep 12 , 1982\", \"mary kay classic\", \"- 10 (70 + 69 + 67 = 206)\", \"1 stroke\", \"carole charbonnier\".\n\nSo the winning score is -10, and the calculation is 70+69+67=206. But in the claim, the calculation inside the parentheses is different: 69-72-70-59-280.\n\nWait, that's not matching at all. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to a different calculation than what's actually in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the winning score. Let me see if there's any row where the winning score is -10 with a calculation that includes those numbers: 69,72,70,59, and 280.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n1. 297 total? No.\n2. 213? No.\n3. 219? No.\n4. 201? No.\n5. 212? No.\n6. 280? Yes! Wait, in the row for May 30, 1982: \"corning classic\", \"-8 (69 +72 +70 +69=280)\". So that row has a winning score of -8, calculated as 69+72+70+69=280.\n\nBut the claim is about a win score of -10 with that specific calculation. However, none of the rows in the table have a winning score of -10. The only row close to it is September 12, 1982: \"mary kay classic\", \"-10 (70 +69 +67=206)\", so the calculation there sums to 206, not 280.\n\nSo the claim is saying that on Sep 12, 1982, the winning score was -10 with a specific calculation. But in reality, the row for Sep 12, 1982 has a win score of -10 but the calculation is different: 70+69+67=206.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions a date when the win score is -10 and the calculation inside the parentheses is (69-72-70-59-280). But looking at the table, none of the rows have that exact calculation. The closest row to Sep 12, 1982 has a different sum.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table because it incorrectly states both the date and the calculation.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect as it misrepresents both the date and the calculation of the winning score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So it's not relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 1:\n- Date: August 3, 1969\n- Tournament: Buckeye Savings Invitational\n- Margin: 3 strokes\n- Runner-up: Judy Rankin\n\nNot matching.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: May 5, 1974\n- Tournament: Lady Tara Classic\n- Margin: playoff\n- Runners-up: Donna Caponi and Kathy Whitworth\n\nNo match.\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: May 29, 1977\n- Tournament: Lady Keystone Open\n- Margin: -9 (so I think that means she won by 9 strokes)\n- Runner-up: Silvia Bertolaccini\n- So this is about Silvia, not Carole.\n\nRow 4:\n- Date: September 7, 1980\n- Tournament: Barth Classic\n- Margin: -4\n- Runners-up: Carolyn Hill and Lori Garbacz\n\nNo match.\n\nRow 5:\n- Date: May 30, 1982\n- Tournament: Corning Classic\n- Margin: playoff\n- Runner-up: Patty Sheehan\n\nNot matching.\n\nRow 6:\n- Date: September 12, 1982\n- Tournament: Mary Kay Classic\n- Margin: -10 (so she won by 10 strokes)\n- Runner-up: Carole Charbonnier\n\nWait, this row has the runner-up as Carole Charbonnier. The date is September 12, 1982. But the claim mentions May 29, 1977.\n\nSo none of the rows match both the runner-up being Carole and the date being May 29, 1977. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on May 29, 1977, Carole Charbonnier was a runner-up with a 1-stroke margin. Checking each row:\n\n- Only Row 6 mentions Carole Charbonnier as a runner-up, but it's on Sep 12, 1982, not May 29, 1977.\n\nThus, no matching row exists for the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
