    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Lessburg High School\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: player, position, school, hometown, and college. The claim mentions two specific attributes: Stanford (which would correspond to the 'college' column) and Lessburg High School (which should be under the 'school' column). It also specifies the position as linebacker.\n\nSo I need to find a row in the table where:\n1. The 'college' field is \"Stanford\".\n2. The 'school' field is \"Lessburg High School\".\n3. The 'position' is \"linebacker\".\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Player Mario Edwards, college Florida State \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 1: Player Ellis McCarthy, college UCLA \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: Noah Spence to Ohio State \u2013 no.\nRow 3: Tommy Schutt to Ohio State \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: Darius Hamilton to Rutgers \u2013 no.\nRow 5: Vince Biegel to Wisconsin. School is Lincoln High, not Lessburg.\nRow 6: Scott Starr to Southern California \u2013 no.\nRow 7: Noor Davis to Stanford. Let's check his school: Lessburg High School? Wait, looking at the table, row 7's 'school' is \"lessburg high school\". Yes, that matches. But what position is he? The claim says linebacker. Looking at the position column for this row, it's \"linebacker\". So yes, that fits.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me check each cell again. \n\nRow 7 has:\n- Player: Noor Davis\n- Position: linebacker\n- School: lessburg high school\n- Hometown: leesburg , florida\n- College: stanford\n\nSo all the conditions are met in this row. Therefore, Stanford does have a linebacker from Lessburg High School.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any other rows that match both Stanford and Lessburg High School with a linebacker position.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that Stanford has a linebacker (a position) who went to Norco High School. So, I need to look for any player in the table who plays as a linebacker and attended Norco High School, specifically at Stanford.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: player, position, school, hometown, college. Each row represents a different player.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if there's a linebacker from Norco High School attending Stanford.\n\n1. The first row: Mario Edwards Jr. is a defensive line player, went to Ryan High School, hometown Denton, Texas, and college Florida State. Not relevant since he's a defensive lineman and not from Norco or Stanford.\n\n2. Ellis McCarthy: Also a defensive line, Monrovia High School, Monrovia, California, attended UCLA. Again, not relevant.\n\n3. Noah Spence: Defensive line, Bishop McDevitt High School, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, went to Ohio State. Not relevant.\n\n4. Tommy Schutt: Defensive line, Glenbard West High School, Glen Ellyn, Illinois, also to Ohio State. Not the right position or school.\n\n5. Darius Hamilton: Defensive line from Don Bosco Preparatory, Ramsey, New Jersey, at Rutgers. Not needed here.\n\n6. Vince Biegel: Linebacker from Lincoln High School in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, attending Wisconsin. His college is Wisconsin, not Stanford. But he's a linebacker, so maybe relevant, but the wrong school.\n\n7. Scott Starr: Linebacker from Norco High School, Norco, California. His college is Southern California (USC). So, Norco High School, but he went to USC, not Stanford. So this could be close but doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\n8. Noor Davis: Linebacker from Lessburg High School, Leesburg, Florida, at Stanford. Wait, here's a linebacker from Stanford. But what school did he attend before college? His high school is Lessburg, so that's not Norco.\n\n9. Shaq Thompson: Defensive back from Grant Union HS, Sacramento, California, to Washington. Not relevant as he's a defensive back and not from Norco.\n\n10. Landon Collins: Defensive back from Dutchtown HS, Geismar, Louisiana, to Alabama. Not needed here.\n\n11. Leon McQuay III: Defensive back from Armwood HS, Seffner, Florida, to Southern California (USC). Not relevant.\n\n12. Tracy Howard: Defensive back from Miramar HS, Miramar, Florida, to Miami (FL). Also not relevant.\n\nWait a minute, looking at row 7 again: Scott Starr is a linebacker from Norco High School but attends USC. The claim is about Stanford, so that's not it. But perhaps I missed someone else?\n\nLooking through the table, none of the players who are linebackers and attended Stanford went to Norco High School. The only linebacker from Norco in the table is Scott Starr, but he went to Southern California (USC), not Stanford.\n\nSo, does Stanford have a linebacker from Norco? From the data provided, it seems they don't. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns are 'position' and 'college'. For each player who is a linebacker, check if their college is Stanford. Also, for those who went to Norco High School, check their position and college.\n\nLooking at row 6: Vince Biegel is a linebacker from Lincoln HS but attended Wisconsin, so not Stanford. Row 7: Scott Starr is a linebacker from Norco but attended USC. Rows 8-12 don't have linebackers from Norco attending Stanford.\n\nSo the relevant rows are row 6 (Vince Biegel) and row 7 (Scott Starr). For each, we need to check if their position is 'linebacker' and college is 'Stanford'. Since none of them meet both criteria, but they are relevant because they show that Norco High School players exist in the data.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is about Stanford having such a player. So in the table, no player from Norco attends Stanford as a linebacker. Therefore, the cells to look at are 'position' and 'college' for each player who went to Norco HS. Specifically, looking for any where position is 'linebacker' and college is 'Stanford'.\n\nIn this case, there's no such cell. So the relevant_cells would be all players from Norco High School, as their positions and colleges might show if any fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should only include cells that are linebackers from Norco. But to confirm, let me list the rows where school is Norco:\n\nLooking at the 'school' column: The fifth player (Darius Hamilton) went to Don Bosco Preparatory, not Norco. The sixth row: Vince Biegel's school is Lincoln HS. The seventh row: Scott Starr attended Norco HS.\n\nSo in row 7, Scott Starr is from Norco and is a linebacker but attends USC. Therefore, the relevant cell here is row 7, column 'college' because it shows a player from Norco attending a college (USC) but not Stanford.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Stanford having such a player. So in the table, none of the players meet both conditions: linebacker and from Norco to Stanford.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the columns where the player's position is 'linebacker' or 'defensive back', and their school is Norco High School. Wait, no\u2014 the claim is about college being Stanford, so we need to check the 'college' column for any player who is a linebacker from Norco.\n\nBut in the table, only Scott Starr is from Norco as a linebacker, but he went to USC, not Stanford. So there's no such cell where position is linebacker and college is Stanford with school being Norco. Therefore, the relevant cells would be row 7 for 'college' (USC) and perhaps others.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says Stanford has a linebacker from Norco. In the data, no player fits both criteria: position=linebacker and college=Stanford and school=Norco. Therefore, to confirm, look at 'position' and 'college' for each player who attended Norco HS.\n\nSo, relevant players are those with school='Norco High School', which is only Scott Starr in row 7. Check his position: linebacker and college: USC. So that cell shows a player from Norco as a linebacker but not attending Stanford.\n\nTherefore, to check if such a player exists, the relevant cells would be the 'position' and 'college' for each player who attended Norco HS. Since none have both 'linebacker' position and 'Stanford' college, we can say that no such cell exists where all three are true.\n\nBut according to instructions, I need to identify which cells (rows and columns) are relevant. So, the players from Norco High School in column 'school' whose position is 'linebacker' or 'defensive back', because those positions are relevant for the claim.\n\nSo, rows where school='Norco High School' are row 7 (Scott Starr). In that row, 'position' is 'linebacker' and 'college' is 'Southern California'.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the cells are row 7 columns 'position' and 'college' because they show a player from Norco as a linebacker but attending USC instead of Stanford.\n\nSo, to answer, the relevant cells are rows where school='Norco High School', specifically row 7, looking at their position and college.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Stanford has a linebacker from Norco High School is false. In the provided data, no player meets both criteria: being a linebacker and attending Stanford. However, Scott Starr (row 7) from Norco is a linebacker but attends USC. The relevant cells are row 7's 'position' and 'college' columns.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false. No such player exists in the dataset. Relevant cells are row 7, columns 'Position' and 'College'.",
