    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"in the master tournament, tiger wood have win the most time out of all player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It mentions \"Master Tournament,\" which I assume refers to The Masters, a major golf tournament held annually. The key point here is about Tiger Woods winning the most times among all players in that tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player along with their achievements. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"player\" and \"year (s) won,\" but more importantly, the total number of wins since it's about who has won the most times.\n\nIn the data provided, Tiger Woods is listed in the first row. His \"year(s) won\" column shows \"1997 , 2001 , 2002 , 2005.\" That means he has won four times. Now, I need to check if any other player in the table has more than four wins.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n- Phil Mickelson: Years 2004, 2006 \u2192 2 wins.\n- Vijay Singh: Year 2000 \u2192 1 win.\n- Mike Weir: Year 2003 \u2192 1 win.\n- Zach Johnson: Year 2007 \u2192 1 win.\n- Ian Woosnam: Year 1991 \u2192 1 win.\n- Sandy Lyle: Year 1988 \u2192 1 win.\n\nNone of the other players have more than one win in The Masters. Tiger Woods clearly has four wins, which is more than any others listed here. Therefore, based on the data, the claim seems to be TRUE because Tiger Woods indeed won the most times among all the players listed in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"with 2 wins, Phil Mickelson has won more times than Zach Johnson\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to information in the table. The claim mentions both Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson, so I'll focus on their respective rows in the data section.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: \"player,\" \"country,\" \"year(s) won,\" \"total,\" \"to par,\" and \"finish.\" For this claim, the relevant columns would be \"player\" to identify who is being compared and \"year(s) won\" to count their total wins. The other columns like \"total,\" \"to par,\" and \"finish\" don't seem directly related to the number of wins each player has.\n\nNow, I'll look up Phil Mickelson's row. His data shows that he has 2 wins (from the years 2004 and 2006). So, his total number of wins is 2.\n\nNext, checking Zach Johnson's row, it states he won in 2007, so he has only 1 win.\n\nThe claim says Phil Mickelson has \"more time\" than Zach Johnson. Since Phil has 2 wins and Zach has 1, this seems true.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the exact wording of the claim. It says \"with 2 wins, Phil Mickelson have won more time than...\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear. But based on the data, it's clear that Phil has more wins (2) than Zach (1), so the claim holds.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this. For each player, their row index and the \"year(s) won\" column are important because they show how many times each has won. So, for Phil Mickelson at row index 1 and Zach Johnson at row index 5, we look at the \"year (s) won\" cell to count the number of wins.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1: \"year (s) won\"\n- Row 5: \"year (s) won\"\n\nSo, in JSON format, these would be the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Phil Mickelson has more wins than Zach Johnson according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"mike weir have not win with under par for the nasters tournament,\". \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the table structure. The columns are player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. Each row corresponds to a different player.\n\nThe task is to find if Mike Weir has ever won the Masters Tournament with an under-par score. So, I need to check his record in the Masters specifically.\n\nLooking at the table, Mike Weir is listed in the fourth row (row index 3). His relevant column here would be \"year(s) won\" and \"to par\". \n\nFrom the data, Mike Weir won in 2003. Now, under \"to par\", it shows \"+2\". Since a lower score is better at the Masters, a \"to par\" of +2 means he finished over par. Wait, but wait\u2014I might be misunderstanding. If someone scores to par or below, that's better, right? So if Mike Weir had a score of +2, that's actually under par because it's equal to par, which is considered even. Hmm, no, actually, \"to par\" means the player's total is exactly the number they need to reach (par). For example, a player who scores 4 on a par 4 hole would be to par. So if Mike Weir's total is +2, that means he was two over par, which is not under par. \n\nSo his score of \"+2\" indicates he finished above par, meaning he didn't win with an under-par score. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if there are other rows where Mike Weir might have won the Masters again or if this is the only one. From the table, Mike Weir has only one Masters win in 2003, and his \"to par\" was +2. So he didn't win with under par.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Mike Weir hasn't won the Masters with an under-par score. The relevant cells are row index 3 for both \"year(s) won\" and \"to par\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the united state have have 3 player win in the master tournament.\" Hmm, first off, I notice a typo in the claim: it should probably be \"the United States have 3 players win in the Masters tournament.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"player,\" \"country,\" \"year(s) won,\" and maybe others like total or to par, but those don't seem directly related. The key here is to check how many players from the United States won the Masters.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Tiger Woods, USA, won in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005. That's four wins.\nRow 1: Phil Mickelson, USA, won in 2004 and 2006. So two wins.\nRow 2: Vijay Singh, Fiji, only one win in 2000.\nRow 3: Mike Weir, Canada, one win in 2003.\nRow 4: Zach Johnson, USA, one win in 2007.\nRow 5: Ian Woosnam, Wales, won in 1991.\nRow 6: Sandy Lyle, Scotland, won in 1988.\n\nSo counting the US players: Tiger Woods (4), Phil Mickelson (2), and Zach Johnson (1). That totals to 7 wins. Wait, but the claim is about having three players win, not the number of wins. So each player's row has their years they won.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. The claim says \"have 3 player win,\" which might mean three different players who have won at least once. Let me check how many US players have won the Masters.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nTiger Woods: Yes\nPhil Mickelson: Yes\nZach Johnson: Yes\n\nThat's three players from the USA who have won the Masters. So the claim is about having three players, not three wins. So the relevant cells would be checking each of these three players' rows to confirm they are US players and have at least one win.\n\nSo, I need to verify for each of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Zach Johnson whether they are from the USA and if they've won the Masters.\n\nLooking at their data:\n\n- Tiger Woods: country is United States, and he has multiple wins.\n- Phil Mickelson: same, US country, two wins.\n- Zach Johnson: US country, one win.\n\nTherefore, all three have indeed won the Masters as US players. So the claim is TRUE because there are three players from the USA who have won the Masters tournament.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need to list each row and column that confirms this.\n\nTiger Woods is in row 0, columns \"player\" and \"country,\" but since we're checking for his win, perhaps just player and year(s) won. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about having three players who have won, not necessarily how many times they've won. So each of these three has a 'year(s) won' cell that shows their victories.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Tiger Woods's row (row 0), \"player\" and \"country,\" but more importantly, his \"year(s) won.\"\n- Phil Mickelson's row (row1): same.\n- Zach Johnson's row (row4): same.\n\nWait, maybe for each of these three, their entire rows are relevant because we need to confirm they are US players who have won. So perhaps the columns to check are \"player\" and \"country,\" as well as \"year(s) won.\"\n\nBut actually, the claim is about having 3 players win, so perhaps just checking that each has at least one win, regardless of how many times. Alternatively, it's more straightforward: the three players are from the USA and have won, so their full rows might be considered relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only specific columns like \"player\" (to confirm it's a US player) and \"year(s) won\" to check if they've won.\n\nBut perhaps for each of these three players, we need to look at their row indices. So Tiger Woods is row 0, Phil Mickelson is row1, Zach Johnson is row4.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row0: player (Tiger Woods), country (USA), year(s) won.\n- Row1: same for Phil Mickelson.\n- Row4: same for Zach Johnson.\n\nTherefore, in the \"relevant_cells\" list, I need to include each of these three rows and columns. Wait, but the instruction says to list each cell as an object with row_index and column_name. So for Tiger Woods, it's row 0 and each relevant column, like player and country, maybe year(s) won.\n\nWait, no\u2014the columns are \"player,\" \"country,\" \"year (s) won,\" etc. But perhaps the claim is about the number of players from the USA who have won, so we need to check that for each of these three, they are US players and have at least one win.\n\nSo perhaps for each of them, their row's columns: player (to confirm name), country (USA), and year(s) won (to see if they've won).\n\nBut maybe the \"year(s) won\" is not necessary unless we're counting wins. The claim is about having three players who have won, so as long as each of them has at least one win in their \"year(s) won\" column.\n\nSo to confirm, I think the relevant cells are for each of these three players: their row index and the columns \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"year (s) won.\" But wait, maybe not all columns. Maybe just \"player\" and \"country\" because those directly indicate that they are US players who have won.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about the number of players, perhaps we only need to check their country. So if a player's country is USA and has at least one win, then they count towards the total.\n\nSo for Tiger Woods: row0, columns \"player\" (to confirm name) and \"country\" (USA), and \"year(s) won\" to see if he has won.\n\nBut perhaps the exact cells are each player's row, specifically their country column. So:\n\n- Row0: country is USA.\n- Row1: country is USA.\n- Row4: country is USA.\n\nEach of these three players has a country as USA and has at least one win in \"year(s) won.\"\n\nSo perhaps the relevant cells are the rows for these three players, specifically their country column, to confirm they're US players who have won. Alternatively, since the claim is about the number of players, maybe just their names and countries.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to include each player's row index and the columns that directly relate to confirming they are US players who have won.\n\nSo for each of Tiger Woods (row0), Phil Mickelson (row1), and Zach Johnson (row4):\n\n- Their \"country\" column is USA, so that's relevant.\n- Their \"year(s) won\" column shows they've won the Masters at least once.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor row0: columns \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"year (s) won.\"\nSimilarly for rows1 and 4.\n\nBut in the instruction, it says to include each cell as an object with row_index and column_name. So perhaps for each of these three players, we need to list all the columns that are relevant, but I think it's better to limit it to the key ones, maybe just \"country\" since that directly shows they're US players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the \"year(s) won\" is necessary because if a player has no wins, they don't count towards the three who have won.\n\nWait, the claim is about having three players who have won, so each of these three must have at least one win. So their \"year(s) won\" column is important to confirm that.\n\nTherefore, perhaps for each of these three players, we need to check their row index and the columns:\n\n- player (to confirm it's them),\n- country (USA),\n- year(s) won (has entries).\n\nBut maybe just country and year(s) won are sufficient because player confirms their name, but perhaps that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about counting players from the USA who have won, we need to check:\n\n1. Each of these three is a US player: so their country column must be USA.\n2. They each have at least one win: their year(s) won column is not empty.\n\nSo perhaps the relevant columns are \"country\" and \"year (s) won.\"\n\nTherefore, for each of these three players:\n\n- row index,\n- \"country\",\n- \"year (s) won\".\n\nHence, in the list, we'll have objects like:\n\n{ \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"country\" },\n{ \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" },\nand similarly for rows1 and4.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the columns to check are just \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"year (s) won.\" Because we need to confirm that each of these three is a US player who has won.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sufficient to just check their country and whether they have any wins. So for each of the three players:\n\n- row index,\n- country column,\n- year(s) won column.\n\nTherefore, in total, for Tiger Woods: row0, columns \"country\" and \"year (s) won.\"\nFor Phil Mickelson: row1, same.\nFor Zach Johnson: row4, same.\n\nSo in the list, we have:\n\n[\n  { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" },\n  { \"row\": 1, \"column\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row\": 1, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" },\n  { \"row\": 4, \"column\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row\": 4, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" }\n]\n\nBut that might be a bit much. Alternatively, perhaps we just need to include the columns where each of these three players have their country as USA and have at least one win.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Tiger Woods's row: check if his country is USA and he has won.\n- Phil Mickelson's row: same.\n- Zach Johnson's row: same.\n\nThus, in the \"relevant_cells\" list, we need to include each of these three players' rows for their country and year(s) won.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to just check their country and whether they have any wins. So for each, the columns are \"country\" and \"year (s) won.\"\n\nTherefore, the final relevant cells would be:\n\nFor row0: { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"country\" }, { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" }\n\nSimilarly for rows1 and4.\n\nBut perhaps in total, it's better to include all three players' country and year(s) won columns.\n\nI think that's the approach. So the final list would include six entries: for each of the three players, their country column and their year(s) won column.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are as follows:\n\n- For Tiger Woods (row 0): \"country\" and \"year (s) won\".\n- For Phil Mickelson (row 1): \"country\" and \"year (s) won\".\n- For Zach Johnson (row 4): \"country\" and \"year (s) won\".\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" },\n  { \"row\": 1, \"column\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row\": 1, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" },\n  { \"row\": 4, \"column\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row\": 4, \"column\": \"year (s) won\" }\n]\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Vijay Singh's final total win being 13 under par is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Vijay Singh have a final total win that be 13 under the score sandy lyle have when she win.\" So, it's saying Vijay Singh's total win is 13 under par, which is what Sandy Lyle had when she won. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find Vijay Singh's row and check the relevant columns. From the table, Vijay Singhs' data is in row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed, rows are 0 to 6). The columns that matter here are:\n\n1. \"player\": Vijay Singh.\n2. \"country\": Fiji.\n3. \"year (s) won\": 2000.\n4. \"total\": This should be his score, which is 289.\n5. \"to par\": His total score is +1.\n6. \"finish\": t14.\n\nWait, the claim mentions that Vijay's total win is 13 under par. But from the table, his \"to par\" is \"+1\". So he finished 1 over par, not 13 under. \n\nNow, checking Sandy Lyle's data to see her score when she won. Sandy Lyle's row is index 5 (since it's the sixth entry in the data array). Her details are:\n\n- Player: Sandy Lyle.\n- Country: Scotland.\n- Year(s) won: 1988.\n- Total: 302.\n- To par: +14.\n- Finish: 45.\n\nSo, she finished 14 over par. The claim says that Vijay's win total is 13 under, but the actual \"to par\" for Vijay is +1, which is much higher than 13 under (which would be -13). \n\nAdditionally, I should check if the table has any cells related to each player's score or finish. For both players, the relevant columns are \"total\", \"to par\", and \"finish\". So, the columns to look at for both are these.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Vijay Singh did not have a final total of 13 under par; instead, he was +1.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Tiger Woods winning one less time than Phil Mickelson in the Master Tournament is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the table has several columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. The data includes information about different golf players and their performance in the Master Tournament.\n\nThe claim says that \"in the master tournament , tiger wood win 1 less time than phil mickelson do.\" I need to check if this is true by looking at the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the data, Tiger Woods is listed first with his years as 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005. So that's four wins. Phil Mickelson is next, with years 2004 and 2006, so two wins.\n\nWait, but the claim says Tiger won one less time than Phil. If Tiger has four wins and Phil has two, then Tiger actually won more times than Phil. That would make the claim false because four isn't one less than two; it's two more.\n\nBut I should double-check to ensure I'm not misunderstanding something. Maybe there's a typo in the years or something else. Let me count again: Tiger has 4 wins, Phil has 2. The difference is 2, not 1. So the claim that Tiger won one less time than Phil isn't correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to specify which cells are relevant. Since both players are in the first two rows, their respective \"year (s) won\" columns are important here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tiger Woods has one fewer victory in the Master Tournament than Phil Mickelson. However, based on the table:\n\n- Tiger Woods has 4 wins.\n- Phil Mickelson has 2 wins.\n\nThis means Tiger has two more wins, not one less. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Phil Mickelson have 4 more wins than Zach Johnson do.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's comparing the number of wins between two golf players: Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson. The claim states that Mickelson has four more wins than Johnson.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. The relevant columns here are \"player,\" obviously, because we're dealing with specific players. Then, \"year (s) won\" might be important if we need to count how many times each won. But since the claim is about the total number of wins, I think \"total\" column is more directly related.\n\nSo, I should find the rows for Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson in the table. Let's locate them:\n\n- For Phil Mickelson: The second row (index 1). His total is 286.\n- For Zach Johnson: The fifth row (index 5, since it's zero-indexed, but wait, actually looking at the data array: first entry is index 0, so Zach Johnson is at index 5. His total is 291.\n\nWait, no. Let me count again. The rows are:\n\n0: Tiger Woods\n1: Phil Mickelson\n2: Vijay Singh\n3: Mike Weir\n4: Zach Johnson\n5: Ian Woosnam\n6: Sandy Lyle\n\nYes, so Zach Johnson is at row index 4, not 5. His total is 291.\n\nSo, Phil Mickelson's total is 286, and Zach Johnson's is 291. Wait, that seems reversed because 291 is more than 286. So according to the table, Zach Johnson has more wins than Phil Mickelson. That would mean the claim is false because it states Mickelson has four more wins than Johnson, but actually, Johnson has more.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I misread the rows. Let's look again:\n\nPhil Mickelson: row index 1, total 286.\nZach Johnson: row index 4, total 291.\n\nYes, that's correct. So Zach has 291 wins, Phil has 286. The difference is 5 more wins for Johnson than Mickelson, not the other way around.\n\nSo the claim says Phil has 4 more wins, which isn't true because he actually has fewer. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. For each player mentioned in the claim, their row index and which column is checked.\n\nFor Phil Mickelson: row index 1, columns \"player,\" \"year (s) won\" (maybe needed if there was a discrepancy), and \"total.\" But since we're checking the number of wins, \"total\" is sufficient. So relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:1, column_name:\"total\"\n- row_index:1, column_name:\"player\"\n\nWait, no. The claim is about the number of wins, so the key data point is in the \"total\" column. However, to verify that we're looking at the correct player, we should also check the \"player\" column for each row. So perhaps both columns are relevant.\n\nSimilarly, for Zach Johnson: row index 4, columns \"player\" and \"total.\" \n\nSo the relevant_cells would include:\n\n- For Phil Mickelson: {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"player\"}, and {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"total\"}\n- For Zach Johnson: {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"player\"}, and {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"total\"}\n\nWait, but does the claim refer to total wins? It just says \"wins,\" so yes. So we need to check both players' totals. Also, ensuring it's Phil and Zach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"year (s) won\" could be relevant if there was a tie or something else, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include for each player their row index and their \"player\" and \"total\" columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Phil Mickelson has fewer total wins than Zach Johnson. The relevant cells are those that confirm both players' names and their respective totals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "mike weir only win 1 master tournament under par",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Mike Weir is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Mike Weir only win 1 master tournament under par.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find the relevant information related to Mike Weir. Let me scan through each row of the data.\n\nLooking at the first column (\"player\"), the names listed are Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Mike Weir, Zach Johnson, Ian Woosnam, and Sandy Lyle. So Mike Weir is in there as one of the players. That means I should focus on his row for this claim.\n\nNow, let's check each column of Mike Weir's row to see what information we can extract. The columns are: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish.\n\nThe \"player\" column confirms it's Mike Weir. That's straightforward. \n\nNext, the \"year(s) won\" is listed as 2003. So he won in 2003. I need to check how many times he won under par because the claim mentions that he only won one master tournament under par.\n\nLooking at the \"total\" column, it shows 290 for Mike Weir. That's his total score in the tournament. Then there's the \"to par\" column which is \"+2.\" The term \"under par\" typically refers to a score lower than par, where higher numbers indicate more under par (e.g., +1 is one under par). So \"+2\" would mean he was two over par, not under.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. If the total is 290 and it's \"+2,\" that means his score relative to par is plus two, which is over par, not under. That suggests Mike Weir did not win a master tournament under par in 2003.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"under par.\" In golf terminology, \"to par\" means the player's score equals the par for that hole or round. So scores below par are considered under par, like -1, -2, etc., meaning they performed better than par. Scores above par would be over par.\n\nLooking back at Mike Weir's row: his total is 290 with a \"to par\" of \"+2.\" So he was two over par in that tournament. That means he didn't win a master tournament under par because he ended up two over.\n\nBut the claim says he only won one master tournament under par. So if he actually didn't win any under par, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me double-check the other columns to see if I missed something. The \"finish\" column shows \"t17,\" which means he finished in 17th place, so that's consistent with a higher score like +2, as lower rankings correspond to higher scores.\n\nSo putting it together: Mike Weir won the master tournament in 2003, but his score was +2, meaning over par. Therefore, he didn't win under par. So the claim is false because he didn't win any tournaments under par; he actually finished over par.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information in the table. The \"year(s) won\" for Mike Weir is only 2003, so that's the only tournament he won listed here. Since it was over par, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mike Weir only won one master tournament under par. However, according to the table, Mike Weir won in 2003 with a score of +2 (to par), meaning he finished two over par, not under par. Therefore, he did not win any tournaments under par, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament.\" First, I should check what each part of this statement means.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The subject is \"the united state\" \u2013 which I think refers to the United States.\n2. They \"have 2 players\" who won the Masters Tournament.\n3. It's about the Masters, so I'm looking at the \"year (s) won\" column for each player from the US.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The columns are player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, finish.\n- In the data, I see players and their countries. The relevant row is where the country is the United States.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\n1. Tiger Woods: Country is US. Years won: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 \u2013 that's four wins.\n2. Phil Mickelson: US. Years: 2004, 2006 \u2013 two wins so far.\n3. Vijay Singh: Fiji. Not relevant here.\n4. Mike Weir: Canada. Not US.\n5. Zach Johnson: US. Year: 2007 \u2013 one win.\n6. Ian Woosnam: Wales. Not US.\n7. Sandy Lyle: Scotland. Not US.\n\nSo, focusing on US players:\n- Tiger Woods has multiple wins.\n- Phil Mickelson has two wins.\n- Zach Johnson has one win.\n\nWait, so that's three US players who have won the Masters: Woods (4), Mickelson (2), and Johnson (1). So, does \"have 2\" mean exactly two or at least two? The claim says \"have 2,\" which could be interpreted as having two or more. But let me check again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted. Tiger Woods is from the US, so that's one player with multiple wins. Phil Mickelson has two wins, making it two players (Mickelson and perhaps someone else). Wait, but in the table, only three US players are listed: Woods, Mickelson, Johnson.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the rows:\n\n- Tiger Woods: US\n- Phil Mickelson: US\n- Zach Johnson: US\n\nSo that's three players from the US. But wait, the data has seven rows, but I'm only concerned with those where country is US.\n\nLooking again:\nRow 0: Tiger Woods, US\nRow 1: Phil Mickelson, US\nRow 5: Ian Woosnam, Wales\nRow 6: Sandy Lyle, Scotland\n\nWait, no. Wait the data array has seven subarrays:\n\nIndex 0: Tiger Woods\nIndex 1: Phil Mickelson\nIndex 2: Vijay Singh (Fiji)\nIndex3: Mike Weir (Canada)\nIndex4: Zach Johnson (US)\nIndex5: Ian Woosnam (Wales)\nIndex6: Sandy Lyle (Scotland)\n\nSo, the US players are at indexes 0,1,4. That's three players.\n\nBut the claim says \"2 player who win during the master tournament.\" So does this mean exactly two or at least two? The wording is a bit ambiguous, but in the context of claims, usually, it means at least two. But wait, in reality, Tiger Woods has won multiple times, so he's one player with multiple wins, and Phil Mickelson has two wins. So, are they counting each win by a player as separate? Or each player?\n\nThe claim is about players who have won the Masters, not the number of wins. So \"2 players\" would mean two individuals, regardless of how many times they've won.\n\nIn that case, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are two US players who have won the Masters. Zach Johnson has also won once, making it three. But the claim says \"have 2,\" so does that mean exactly two or at least two? If it's at least two, then TRUE because there are three. But if it's exactly two, then FALSE because Tiger and Phil make two, but Zach adds a third.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about having two players who have won the Masters, so as long as there are at least two US winners in the table, the claim holds.\n\nLooking back, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For each player from the US, their row index and the columns that matter: country (to check if it's US) and year(s) won (to see if they have any wins).\n\nBut more accurately, since the claim is about having two players who have won, we need to identify rows where country is US and year(s) won is not empty. Then count those.\n\nSo let's list them:\n\nRow 0: Tiger Woods, US, has years 1997,2001,2002,2005 \u2013 so he has won, count as one player.\nRow1: Phil Mickelson, US, years 2004,2006 \u2013 two wins, but as a single player, counts as another.\nRow4: Zach Johnson, US, year 2007 \u2013 another win.\n\nSo that's three players from the US who have won the Masters. Therefore, the claim says \"the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament.\"\n\nNow, if \"have 2\" means at least two, then it's TRUE because there are three. But sometimes in such contexts, \"have 2\" might mean exactly two. If that's the case, then since there are three US winners listed (Woods, Mickelson, Johnson), it would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but the table includes more years for Woods and Mickelson. So each of their rows indicates they've won multiple times, but they're still one player each.\n\nTherefore, the number of players is three: Tiger, Phil, Zach. Therefore, if the claim says \"have 2,\" it's a bit ambiguous, but in reality, they have more than two. However, the table shows that there are three US winners listed here.\n\nBut looking at the data again:\n\nWait, in the data, the players are listed as:\n\n0: Tiger Woods\n1: Phil Mickelson\n4: Zach Johnson\n\nSo three players from US have won the Masters. Therefore, if the claim is \"the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament,\" it's TRUE because they have at least two, even though they have more.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim says \"have 2 players.\" So in the table, how many US players have won? Tiger has multiple wins (so counts as one player), Phil has two (another), and Zach has one (third). Therefore, three US players have won the Masters, so they do have more than two. Therefore, if the claim is stating that they \"have 2,\" it's technically TRUE because having two is a lesser number than what actually exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't include all possible winners, but from the data given, there are three US winners listed: Tiger, Phil, Zach. So the statement is about whether in the table, the US has at least two players who have won the Masters.\n\nYes, because Tiger and Phil alone make it two, so even if there's a third, the claim still holds as TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining whether the statement \"the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament\" is true based on the provided data. \n\nAnalyzing the table:\n\n- Tiger Woods (Row 0) has multiple wins.\n- Phil Mickelson (Row 1) has two wins.\n- Zach Johnson (Row 4) has one win.\n\nThis results in at least three players from the US who have won the Masters, which is more than two. Therefore, the statement is TRUE because having two players is accurate given that there are multiple US winners listed.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is **TRUE**.",

    "claim": "vijay singh have a final score that be less than 10 under teh score of sandy lyle",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Vijay Singh's final score is true based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Vijay Singh have a final score that be less than 10 under the score of Sandy Lyle.\" Hmm, that sentence is a bit confusing. I think it means that Vijay Singh's final score is less than 10 under (or maybe below) what Sandy Lyle scored. So, essentially, is Vijay's total less than 10 points lower than Sandy Lyle's total?\n\nLooking at the table, both Vijay and Sandy are listed there. Let me locate their rows.\n\nVijay Singhh is in row index 2. His \"final\" score is given as \"+1\". Wait, no, let me check again. The columns for each player include: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. So for Vijay Singh's row, the \"total\" column has a value of 289, \"to par\" is \"+1\", and \"finish\" is \"t14\". I think the final score here refers to his total score, which is 289.\n\nSandy Lyle is in row index 5. His total is listed as 302 with \"to par\" being \"+14\" and finish \"45\". So Sandy's total is 302.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions that Vijay's final score is less than 10 under Sandy's. So does this mean that 289 is 13 less than 302 (since 302 - 289 = 13)? If so, then yes, it's more than 10 under. But I'm a bit confused because the term \"under\" could be tricky here.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. In golf, the total score can be compared by how many strokes below par someone scores. So if Sandy scored 302, and Vijay scored 289, then Vijay is 13 strokes under Sandy (since 302 - 289 = 13). So yes, that's more than 10.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"less than 10 under\". So if it's 13, which is more than 10, then the statement would be false because 13 is not less than 10. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"under\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"final score\" refers to something else. The table columns are player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. So \"total\" is likely the points scored. So if Vijay's total is 289 and Sandy's is 302, then Vijay is 13 under. That's definitely more than 10.\n\nSo the claim says that Vijay's final score is less than 10 under Sandy's. But since it's 13, which is not less than 10, the claim would be false. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need to check where these values are in the table. For Vijay, row index 2 has \"total\" as 289 and for Sandy, row index 5 has \"total\" as 302.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include both their rows for the \"total\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we compare Vijay Singh's total score (289) with Sandy Lyle's total score (302). Since 289 is 13 less than 302, it's not less than 10 under. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
