    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all team play 18 match\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. The claim says that all teams have played 18 matches. So, I'll check each row in the table to see if the number of matches (played) is 18 for every team listed.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it's a JSON with a \"columns\" array and a \"data\" array. Each entry in data corresponds to a team, with various statistics including \"played (pj)\". So, I need to look at each row's value under the \"played\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row has a played value of 18.\n2. Second row also shows 18 matches.\n3. Third row again, 18.\n4. Fourth row: 18 as well.\n5. Fifth row: 18.\n6. Sixth row: 18.\n7. Seventh row: 18.\n8. Eighth row: 18.\n9. Ninth row: 18.\n10. Tenth row: 18.\n\nSo every single team has played 18 matches according to the table. Therefore, the claim is true because all teams have indeed played 18 matches each.\n\nWait, but I should also check if the \"played\" column consistently refers to the total number of matches a team has played. In some contexts, \"played\" could mean something else, like games started or similar, but in this table, it seems clear that \"pj\" stands for \"played,\" which is the count of matches. So each row's pj value is 18.\n\nThus, all teams have played 18 matches, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"}, {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"}, ...]} \n\nBut since I need to provide only relevant cells as a list, and not the entire table, I can extract each row's played value.\n\nEach team's played column is 18, so all are relevant. However, to comply with instructions, I should include each row's index and column name.\n\nThe final answer would be:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nBut since the system expects a JSON object with answer and relevant_cells, here is the concise version:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"played (pj)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense win the least amount of game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense have won the least number of games compared to other teams in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it's a JSON with \"columns\" and \"data\". The columns are place, team, played, won, draw, lost, goals scored, goals conceded, + / -, points. So for each row, these are the stats for each team.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the number of games won by atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense. So I need to find their row in the table and see how many games they've won.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\nRow 0: SF FC - 11 wins\nRow 1: Arabi Unido - 9 wins\nRow 2: Tauro FC - 8 wins\nRow 3: Municipal Chorrillo - 8 wins\nRow 4: Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed - 6 wins\nRow 5: Alianza FC -7 wins\nRow 6: Chepo FC -6 wins\nRow7: Sporting SM -4 wins\nRow8: Plaza Amador-4 wins\nRow9: Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense -3 wins\n\nSo, in row 10 (assuming rows start at 0), which is index 9? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the data array has entries from index 0 to 9. So let me list them properly.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: SF FC, 11 won\nRow1: Arabi Unido,9\nRow2: Tauro,8\nRow3: Municipal,8\nRow4: Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed,6\nRow5: Alianza,7\nRow6: Chepo,6\nRow7: Sporting SM,4\nRow8: Plaza Amador,4\nRow9: Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense,3\n\nWait no, the data array is from index 0 to 9, but let's look at each team's 'won' value.\n\nSo Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense's row is the 10th in the list, which would be data[9], right? Because starting from 0. So yes, that's the last one: won 3 games.\n\nNow, to check if they have the least wins. I need to see what the other teams' won values are. The highest is SF FC with 11, then Arabi Unido with 9, Tauro 8, etc. The lowest among all is Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense with 3.\n\nSo the claim says \"win the least amount of game,\" which would mean they have the fewest wins. Since their won count is 3 and others have higher numbers, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other teams with lower than 3. Looking through the data: SF FC (11), Arabi Unido(9), Tauro(8), Municipal(8), Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed(6), Alianza(7), Chepo(6), Sporting SM(4), Plaza Amador(4), and then Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense(3). \n\nYes, all other teams have more than 3 wins except for maybe some. Wait, no: the lowest is 3. So they do have the least.\n\nSo the claim should be TRUE because they won the fewest games among all teams in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by checking the number of games won by each team. Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has the lowest 'won' value (3), making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"won\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"alianza fc win less game than tauro fc\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should identify which teams are being referred to. The claim mentions \"alianza fc\" and \"tauro fc.\" Looking at the table, I can see these two teams listed as rows 2 and 3 respectively, since their positions in the data array start from index 0 but the positions in the table start from 1.\n\nNext, I need to focus on the number of games each has won. The columns relevant here are \"won (pg)\" for both teams. So I'll look at the \"pg\" column for alianza fc and tauro fc.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- Alianza FC is in row 2 (index 1 if we start counting from 0). In their row, the \"pg\" value is 7.\n- Tauro FC is in row 3 (index 2). Their \"pg\" value is 8.\n\nSo, alianza fc has won 7 games, and tauro fc has won 8 games. The claim says that alianza fc wins less than tauro fc. Since 7 is indeed less than 8, this seems to be TRUE at first glance.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check if there's any other aspect to consider. Maybe the total number of games played? But the claim specifically mentions \"win less game,\" so it's about wins, not total games. However, I can confirm that both teams have played 18 games each, as per the \"played (pj)\" column.\n\nSo, yes, alianza fc has fewer wins than tauro fc, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"alianza fc win less game than tauro fc\" is true or false, we need to compare the number of games each team won according to the table. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - The teams in question are alianza fc and tauro fc.\n   - The relevant column for comparing wins is \"won (pg)\".\n\n2. **Extract Data from the Table:**\n   - For alianza fc (row 6, index 5), the number of won games is 7.\n   - For tauro fc (row 3, index 2), the number of won games is 8.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since 7 wins are less than 8 wins, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE because alianza fc has fewer wins than tauro fc.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"won (pg)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"won (pg)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"san francisco fc score the most point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase says that \"san francisco fc scored the most points.\" So, I need to find out if San Francisco FC has the highest number of points in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON format with columns labeled as:\n- place (posici\u00f3n)\n- team (equipo)\n- played (pj)\n- won (pg)\n- draw (pe)\n- lost (pp)\n- goals scored (gf)\n- goals conceded (gc)\n- + / - (dif)\n- points (pts)\n\nThe data rows have various teams and their corresponding statistics. I need to focus on the \"points (pts)\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nNext, I should look for San Francisco FC in the table. Scanning through the team names, yes, there's a row where the team is \"san francisco fc\". That should be the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, let me find their points. According to the data, each row ends with the points (pts). For San Francisco FC, that number is 37. So, I need to see if any other teams have a higher point total.\n\nLooking at all the other team entries:\n\n1. Arab Union: 32\n2. Tauru FC: 31\n3. Municipal Chorrillo: 27\n4. Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed: 26\n5. Alianza FC: 24\n6. Chepo FC: 23\n7. Sporting San Miguelito: 18\n8. Plaza Amador: 17\n9. Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense: 11\n\nComparing these, the highest points are indeed held by San Francisco FC with 37 points.\n\nNow, I need to map this out. The relevant columns for this check would be:\n\n- \"points (pts)\": This is where we find the actual point totals.\n- Possibly \"team (equipo)\": To identify which team we're talking about.\n\nBut since the claim specifically refers to San Francisco FC's points, the primary column is definitely \"points (pts)\". The other columns don't directly contribute to verifying this claim except for identifying the correct row, but in terms of checking the statement, only the points matter.\n\nSo, I should extract the relevant cells. That would be the cell in the row where team is San Francisco FC and the column for points.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells array will include both the \"points (pts)\" and perhaps the \"team (equipo)\" to identify which team it is. However, since the claim refers directly to the points, maybe only the points column is necessary, but including team could help in case there are multiple teams with that name or for clarity.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, 'FALSE'.\" And \"relevant_cells\" should list cells that are relevant to verify the claim. So, since the claim is about points, I need to check San Francisco FC's points against others. Therefore, the cells involved would be:\n\n- The cell in their row for \"points (pts)\".\n- Possibly the cell for their team name if needed to identify which team we're talking about.\n\nBut actually, in this context, since it's clear that each row represents a different team, and San Francisco FC is only present once, maybe including both columns helps indicate where the data comes from. Alternatively, perhaps just the points column is sufficient because it directly contradicts or supports the claim.\n\nI think the key here is to identify which specific cell (row and column) holds the points for San Francisco FC. So, the relevant_cells should include that particular point value as well as the team name to confirm it's the correct row.\n\nIn summary, the answer should be TRUE because San Francisco FC has the highest points in the table. The relevant cells are their \"points (pts)\" and their team name.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE since San Francisco FC has the highest points of 37 in the table. The relevant cells confirm this by checking both the team and their points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team (equipo)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"municipal chorrillo outranks plaza amador\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I know that in sports leagues, teams are often ranked based on points (pts) or goal difference (+ / -). The term \"outranks\" implies that one team has a higher position than another, so I should look at how both Municipal Chorrillo and Plaza Amador perform relative to each other.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant for ranking would be \"points (pts)\" and possibly \"goals scored\" or \"goal difference\". But since points are usually the primary determinant for standings, that's the key column here. \n\nI need to find the row for Municipal Chorrillo and Plaza Amador in the table. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Municipal Chorrillo is at row 4 with 18 played matches, 8 wins, etc., and points (pts) of 27.\n- Plaza Amador is at row 9 with similar stats but ends up with 17 points.\n\nComparing their points: 27 vs. 17. So Municipal Chorrillo has more points than Plaza Amador.\n\nNow, the claim says \"municipal chorrillo outranks plaza amador\". To outrank, they should have a higher position or rank. In most tables, lower row indices mean higher positions since they're listed from top to bottom. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each team has a unique position (posici\u00f3n) from 1 to 10. So Municipal Chorrillo is at position 4, and Plaza Amador at position 9. Since 4 is before 9, Municipal Chorrillo is ranked higher.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the column \"place (posici\u00f3n)\". Yes, each team has a number indicating their rank, so lower numbers mean better positions. Therefore, 4 is indeed outranking 9.\n\nSo based on points and position, the claim holds TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place (posici\\u00f3n)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"arabe unido be the only team which didn't play a total of 18 match.\" Hmm, wait, maybe it's a typo and should say \"didn't play a total of 18 matches\" instead of \"match.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team. I see that there are multiple teams listed with varying numbers of matches played. The claim is specifically about Arabe Unido, so I need to check their stats.\n\nFirst, I should find where Arabe Unido is in the table. Scanning through, I see that Arabe Unido is row number 2 (since it starts at index 0). In that row, under \"played (pj)\", the value is 18. So they played 18 matches.\n\nWait, but the claim says they didn't play a total of 18 matches. That seems contradictory because according to the table, Arabe Unido did play 18 matches. If that's the case, then the claim would be false because Arabe Unido actually did play 18 matches, not that they didn't.\n\nBut I should double-check other teams to make sure none of them also played 18 matches but are the only ones who didn't. Wait, no, the claim is about being the only team that didn't play 18.

So I need to compare the number of wins each team has and see if Tauro's is exactly two higher than Alianza's.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple teams listed. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"won (pg)\" because that's the number of games won by each team. \n\nI need to locate the rows for Tauro FC and Alianza FC in the data section. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Tauro FC is at row index 2 (third entry).\n- Alianza FC is at row index 5 (sixth entry).\n\nNow, let's extract their \"won\" values from the table.\n\nFor Tauro FC: The third entry has a \"won\" value of 8.\nFor Alianza FC: The sixth entry also shows a \"won\" value of 7.\n\nSo, Tauro won 8 games and Alianza won 7. The difference is indeed 1 game, not 2.

The claim says: \"the highest number of game be win by atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense at 11 with the runner up be arabe unido at 9\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The first part is about the highest number of games won by Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense being 11. The second part mentions that the runner-up (second-place team) is Arabe Unido with 9 wins.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if these two statements are accurate based on the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking how many games Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has won. In the table's \"data\" section, each row represents a team. The columns include \"team (equipo)\" and \"won (pg)\". So, I should look for the row where the team is \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\".\n\nIn the data, the fifth row (index 4) is Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense. Their won column has a value of 6. That's not 11 as stated in the claim, so this part might be incorrect.\n\nWait, that can't be right because according to the table, Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has only 6 wins. So the claim saying they have 11 is false. But I need to double-check if maybe I misread something.\n\nLooking again: the first data row is index 0, with team San Francisco FC and won=11. The second is Arabe Unido at index 1, with won=9. Then index 4 is Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense with 6 wins. So the claim's first part is definitely incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"highest number of games be win\". Maybe it's not the total number of wins but something else? No, in football (soccer), points are awarded for each win (3 points). The \"points\" column is also present. For example, San Francisco FC has 37 points, which would come from 11 wins (11*3=33) plus maybe some draws.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about the highest number of games won in terms of matches played. Let me check how many teams have more than 11 wins. Looking at each team:\n\n- San Francisco FC: 18 total matches, 11 wins.\n- Arabe Unido: 9 wins.\n- Taur\u00f3 FC: 8 wins.\n- Municipal Chorrillo: 8 wins.\n- Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed: 6 wins.\n- Alianza FC:7 wins.\n- Chepo FC:6 wins.\n- Sporting San Miguelito:4 wins.\n- Plaza Amador:4 wins.\n- Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense:3 wins.\n\nSo only San Francisco FC has 11 wins, the highest. Therefore, the claim stating that Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense is at 11 must be incorrect because they have only 6 wins.\n\nAs for the second part of the claim, it says the runner-up (second place) is Arabe Unido with 9 wins. Looking at points: San Francisco has 37 points, Arabe Unido has 32, Taur\u00f3 FC 31, etc. So the top two in points are San Francisco and Arabe Unido.\n\nBut in the claim, it says that Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense is the highest with 11 wins, which isn't true. However, about the runner-up: Arabe Unido indeed has 9 wins and is second in points. So if the claim was \"Arabe Unido has 9 wins and is runner-up\", that part would be correct. But since the first part is wrong, the entire claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is trying to say that Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense is the team with the most wins (11) and Arabe Unido is second with 9. Since neither of these is true for Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense (they have only 6), the claim is entirely false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, I examined the number of games won by each team in the table. The claim states that Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has the highest wins at 11 and Arabe Unido is second with 9. However, from the data:\n\n- San Francisco FC has 11 wins.\n- Arabe Unido has 9 wins.\n- Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has only 6 wins.\n\nSince the first part of the claim about Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense is incorrect and the second part correctly identifies Arabe Unido as runner-up, but the overall statement misrepresents Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense's performance, the entire claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"won (pg)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the highest number of point score by any team be 32 by arabe unido.\" \n\nFirst, I should check what the 'points' column in the table shows for each team. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the first data row:\n- Team is san francisco fc, points are 37.\nSecond row: arabe unido with 32 points.\nThird: tauro fc at 31.\nFourth: municipal chorrillo at 27.\nFifth: atl\u00e9tico chiriqui at 26.\nSixth: alianza fc at 24.\nSeventh: chepo fc at 23.\nEighth: sporting san miguelito at 18.\nNinth: plaza amador at 17.\nTenth: atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense at 11.\n\nSo the highest points are indeed 37 by san francisco fc, not arabe unido. The claim says that arabe unido has the highest with 32 points, which is incorrect because another team has more.\n\nNext, I need to find the relevant cells. The claim mentions both the points and the specific team. So for arabe unido, their row index in the data array is 1 (since it's zero-indexed). The column we're interested in is \"points (pts)\". Also, maybe the team name could be a factor, but since the claim directly refers to points, the main columns are 'points' and perhaps 'team', but the instructions say to include only columns relevant to verifying the claim. Here, the key fact is that arabe unido has 32 points.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n- The cell for row 1 (arabe unido) in the \"pts\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tie for lowest rank be municipal chorrillo and atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that both Municipal Chorrillo and Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense are tied for the lowest rank. So, they should have the same number of points, which would indicate a tie in their ranking.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different team with various statistics. I need to find the relevant data points that determine their ranking. The key here is probably the \"points (pts)\" column because higher points usually correspond to better rank. If two teams have the same number of points and it's the lowest among all, they would be tied at the bottom.\n\nNow, let me go through each team's points:\n\n1. San Francisco FC: 37\n2. Arab Union: 32\n3. Tauru FC: 31\n4. Municipal Chorrillo: 27\n5. Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed: 26\n6. Alianza FC: 24\n7. Chepo FC: 23\n8. Sporting San Miguelito: 18\n9. Plaza Amador: 17\n10. Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense: 11\n\nFrom this list, the lowest points are 11, held by Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense alone. Municipal Chorrillo has 27 points, which is higher than 26 and above but lower than teams like Arab Union, San Francisco, etc., but it's not tied with anyone.\n\nWait, I might be misinterpreting. The claim says \"tie for lowest rank,\" so both teams should have the same points, which would place them at the bottom together. However, looking at their points:\n\n- Municipal Chorrillo has 27.\n- Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has 11.\n\nThese are not equal; they're significantly different. So there's no tie in points, meaning they can't be tied for the lowest rank based on points alone.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something else. Could it be another metric? The table includes \"draw (pe)\" and other stats like goals scored and conceded, but points are usually the primary factor in determining rank. Since their points are different, they can't tie in rank.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the two teams don't have the same points. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
