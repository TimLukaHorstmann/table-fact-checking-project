    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Viswanathan Anand is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim has three conditions:\n1. Viswanathan Anand's rating is greater than 2753.\n2. His \"prev\" value is less than 4.\n3. The change (chng) is \"+4\".\n\nFirst, I'll locate Viswanathan Anand in the table. Looking at the data column by column:\n\n- The first column is rank, which goes from 1 to 10.\n- The second column is \"prev\", which seems to be the previous rank before this position.\n- The third column is the player's name.\n\nI'll scan through each row until I find the one with Viswanathan Anand. Let me go row by row:\n\nRow 0: Player is viswanathan anand (ind), so that's the one we need. His details are:\n- rank: 1\n- prev: 2\n- rating: 2803\n- change: +4\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says \"viswanathan anand\" have a rating greater than 2753. Let me check the rating from the table. It's 2803, which is indeed greater than 2753. So that condition holds.\n\nNext part of the claim: his \"prev\" should be less than 4. The \"prev\" column here shows 2 for Viswanathan Anand in row 0. Since 2 < 4, this also checks out.\n\nLastly, the change is \"+4\", as given in the table. So that's correct too.\n\nAll three conditions are satisfied based on the data provided in row 0 of the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each condition against Viswanathan Anand's row in the table, confirming all parts are correct.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prev\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chng\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
