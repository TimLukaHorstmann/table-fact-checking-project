    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goal in the league.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns provided in the table. The relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"league\". The other columns like \"fa cup\", \"league cup\", and \"total\" don't seem directly related to goals scored in the league.\n\nNow, I need to check each row in the data to see if any other player has 8 goals in the league. Let's go through the table:\n\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals in the league.\n- Rows 1 to 5: The highest goals in the league are 4 by Whelan, which is less than 8.\n- Rows 6 to 9: Each player (n\u00e9meth, ince, cooper, queudrue, marinelli, mustoe) has 3 or fewer league goals.\n- Rows 10 to 14: deane, johnston, etc., have 1 goal each in the league.\n- Rows 15 and 16: Murphy and Wilson have 0 league goals.\n- Row 17: Cambell has 0 league goals.\n- Row 18: \"own goals\" is a different category, so it's not a player.\n\nNone of the other players have 8 goals in the league. So bok\u0161i\u0107 is indeed the only one with 8 league goals. \n\nNext, I need to map out which cells are relevant. Since the claim mentions \"bok\u0161i\u0107\", that would be row 0 and column \"name\". Also, since it's about scoring in the league, we should include the \"league\" column for bok\u0161i\u0107 as well.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0 (bok\u0161i\u0107) in both \"name\" and \"league\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nThe table has columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. Each row represents a player with their performance in these competitions.\n\nFirst, I'll locate where \"whelan\" is in the data. Looking through each row's first element (name), I see that whelan is the second row (index 1). His fa cup score is 3, as per column index 2. So whelan has scored 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n\nNow, the claim says he's the \"only\" player to do so. I need to check if any other players have 3 or more goals in the FA Cup. Let me scan through each row's fa cup column (index 2).\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107 has 0\n- Row 1: whelan has 3\n- Row 2: n\u00e9meth has 1\n- Row 3: ince has 1\n- Row 4: cooper has 0\n- Row 5: queudrue has 0\n- Row 6: marinelli has 0\n- Row 7: mustoe has 0\n- Row 8: deane has 0\n- Row 9: johnston has 0\n- Row 10: greening has 0\n- Row 11: stockdale has 0\n- Row 12: festa has 0\n- Row 13: windass has 0\n- Row 14: southgate has 0\n- Row 15: carbone has 0\n- Row 16: ehiogu has 0\n- Row 17: murphy has 1\n- Row 18: wilson has 1\n- Row 19: cambell has 0\n- Row 20: own goals have 1\n\nWait, no player besides whelan has a fa cup score of 3 or more.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"marinelli score 1 more total goal than johnston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it's a JSON with columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The data rows have various names along with numbers under these columns.\n\nThe claim is about two specific individuals: marinelli and johnston. It says that marinelli has 1 more total goal than johnston. So, I need to find the relevant cells in the table for these two individuals, specifically looking at the \"total\" column.\n\nI should locate marinelli's row and johnston's row in the data array. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- The first row is bok\u0161\u012b with 8 total.\n- Second row: whelan with 4 total.\n- Third: n\u00e9meth, 3 total.\n- Fourth: ince, 2 total.\n- Fifth: cooper, 2.\n- Sixth: queudrue, 2.\n- Seventh: marinelli, 2. Wait, that's marinelli with 2 total goals.\n- Then, johnston is in row 10 with 1 total goal.\n\nWait a second, so according to the table, marinelli has 2 total goals and johnston has 1. That means marinelli has one more than johnston, right? So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I misread the row indices because sometimes they can get confusing. Let me count them again.\n\nThe data array starts with index 0 as bok\u0161\u012b. Then each subsequent row increments by 1. marinelli is in row 7 (index 6 if we start at 0), and johnston is in row 10 (index 9). So, marinelli's total is 2, johnston's is 1. Yes, that's a difference of one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because marinelli indeed has one more total goal than johnston. Now, I need to map which cells are relevant. The \"total\" column is key here for both individuals. So, I should include both their row indices and the column name \"total\".\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of the claim relate to the table data. The claim mentions two names: Cambell and Ehiogu. Looking at the \"name\" column in the table, I see that both Cambell and Ehiogu are present as rows. So, these rows will be relevant.\n\nNext, the claim talks about goals in the league. In the table, under each player's row, there are multiple columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The \"league\" column is where the league-specific goals would be recorded. So, I need to look at the \"league\" value for both Cambell and Ehiogu.\n\nLooking through the data rows, I'll search for the exact match of \"cambell\" in the name column. Scanning each row: \n\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n- Row 1: whelan\n- Row 2: n\u00e9meth\n- Row 3: ince\n- Row 4: cooper\n- Row 5: queudrue\n- Row 6: marinelli\n- Row 7: mustoe\n- Row 8: deane\n- Row 9: johnston\n- Row 10: greening\n- Row 11: stockdale\n- Row 12: festa\n- Row 13: windass\n- Row 14: southgate\n- Row 15: carbone\n- Row 16: ehiogu\n- Row 17: murphy\n- Row 18: wilson\n- Row 19: cambell\n- Row 20: own goals\n\nHere, Cambell is in row 19. Now, looking at the \"league\" column for this row: under \"cambell,\" the league value is 0.\n\nNow, checking Ehiogu, who is in row 16. The league value for Ehiogu is also 0.\n\nWait a minute, both have 0 in the league column. So, if Cambell has 0 and Ehiogu has 0, then Cambell doesn't score 1 less goal than Ehiogu because they're equal. Therefore, the claim seems false at first glance.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"score.\" Perhaps the claim is referring to total goals instead of league-specific ones? Let me check that. The total column for both Cambell (row 19) and Ehiogu (row 16) shows:\n\n- Cambell: Total is 1\n- Ehiogu: Total is 1\n\nAgain, they have the same total. So, if the claim is about total goals, it's still false because they're equal.\n\nHowever, looking back, the claim specifically mentions \"in the league,\" so we should focus on the \"league\" column. Since both have 0 in the league, Cambell doesn't score one less than Ehiogu; they are tied at zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cambell scores 1 less goal than Ehiogu in the league. By examining the relevant data:\n\n- **Cambell's League Goals**: 0\n- **Ehiogu's League Goals**: 0\n\nSince both have 0 goals in the league, Cambell does not score one less than Ehiogu. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"cooper , marinelli , mustoe , and queudrue all score 2 total goal.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each of these names in the table and check their 'total' column. Let's see where they are located.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n- Cooper is in row 5, with a total of 2.\n- Marinelli is in row 7, also showing a total of 2.\n- Mustoe is in row 8, which has a total of 2 as well.\n- Queudrue is in row 6, and the total for that row is indeed 2.\n\nSo each of these four players have a total of 2 goals. That seems to support the claim. But wait, I should check if there are any other columns mentioned in the claim. The claim talks about 'total goal,' which maps directly to the 'total' column in the table.\n\nI don't see any entries where these names have anything other than 2 in the total column. So all four of them have a total score of 2, meaning the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells for each name.

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The rows represent different players with their respective stats.\n\nFirst, I need to find Bok\u0161i\u0107 in the table. Scanning through the data, I see that the first row has \"bok\u0161i\u0107\" as the name. So, Bok\u0161i\u0107 is at row index 0.\n\nNow, checking the claim: it says that Bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who scored 8 goals in the league. To verify this, I need to look at the 'league' column for Bok\u0161i\u0107 and also check if there are two other players with 8 goals in the same column.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The first data row (Bok\u0161i\u0107) has a league value of 8.\nNext, looking through the rest of the data:\n- Whelan: 4\n- N\u00e9meth: 3\n- Ince: 2\n- Cooper: 2\n- Quemdrue: 2\n- Marinelli: 2\n- Mustoe: 2\n- Deane: 1\n- Johnston: 1\n- Greening: 1\n- Stockdale: 1\n- Festa: 1\n- Windass: 1\n- Southgate: 1\n- Carbone: 1\n- Ehiogu: 1\n- Murphy: 0\n- Wilson: 0\n- Cambell: 0\n- Own goals: 1\n\nWait, I'm only seeing Bok\u0161i\u0107 with 8 goals in the league. None of the other players have 8. So that means there are no two other players who scored 8 in the league. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not one of three, but just one.\n\nHowever, maybe I should double-check if any other player has 8. Let me count again.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in any competition\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. Each row represents a player with their performance in each competition. \n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"whelan\" as the player in question. So my first task is to find Whelan's data in the table. Looking at the data rows, Whelan is listed as the second entry (row index 1). His stats are: league - 4 goals, fa cup - 3 goals, league cup - 0 goals, and total - 7 goals.\n\nThe claim states that Whelan is the only player to score 3 goals in any competition. To verify this, I need to check if there's any other player who has scored exactly 3 goals in any of their competitions. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Bokashi: Scores 8 in league, 0 elsewhere.\n2. Whelan: As mentioned, 4 in league, 3 in fa cup.\n3. Nemerh: 3 in league, but I need to see if any other player also has exactly 3 in their competition.\n   \nWait, wait. The columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. So each cell corresponds to a specific competition. So for example, the second column is league goals, third is fa cup, fourth is league cup.\n\nSo looking at all players:\n\n- Whelan: 3 in fa cup (third column)\n- Nemerh: 1 in fa cup\n- Ince: 0 in fa cup\n- Cooper and others: 0\n- Murphy: 1 in league cup\n- Wilson: same\n- Cambell: 1 in fa cup\n- Own goals: 1 in fa cup\n\nWait, but the claim is about scoring exactly 3 goals in any competition. So it's not just about how many competitions they played, but whether their total in any of those competitions is 3.\n\nSo let me check each player's stats per column:\n\nLeague column:\n- Bokashi:8\n- Whelan:4\n- Nemerh:3\n- Ince:2\n- Cooper:2\n- Queudrue:2\n- Marinelli:2\n- Mustoe:2\n- Deane, Johnston, etc.:1 each\n- Festa, Windass:1\n- Southgate:1\n- Carbone:1\n- Ehiogu:1\n- Murphy:0\n- Wilson:0\n- Cambell:0\n- Own goals:1\n\nSo in the league column, Nemerh has 3 goals. That's another player who scored 3 in a competition.\n\nNow fa cup column:\n- Bokashi:0\n- Whelan:3\n- Nemerh:1\n- Ince:1\n- Cooper, etc.:0\n- Murphy:0\n- Wilson:0\n- Cambell:1\n- Own goals:1\n\nOnly Whelan has 3 in fa cup.\n\nLeague cup column:\n- Bokashi:0\n- Whelan:0\n- Nemerh:2\n- Ince:0\n- Others:0 except Murphy, Wilson, and Cambell have 1 each.\n\nTotal column isn't relevant for the claim since it's about goals in a specific competition, not total across all.\n\nSo the key point is whether any other player has scored exactly 3 goals in any competition. \n\nFrom the league column, Nemerh has 3 goals. So that means Whelan isn't the only one who scored 3 goals in a competition (league). Therefore, the claim is false because Nemerh also scored 3 goals in the league.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"score 3 goal in any competition\". So if a player scored exactly 3 goals in any of their competitions, not necessarily all. So Whelan has 3 in fa cup and 4 in league. Nemerh has 3 in league and 1 in fa cup.\n\nSo both have at least one competition where they scored exactly 3 goals. Therefore, the claim that \"whelan be the only player\" is false because Nemerh also achieved 3 goals in a competition (league).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Whelan is the sole player to score exactly 3 goals in any competition. However, upon reviewing the table, both Whelan and Nemerh have scored 3 goals in specific competitions (fa cup for Whelan and league for Nemerh). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me scan through each row:\n\n- The first entry is \"bok\u0161i\u0107\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Next is \"whelan\" \u2013 nope.\n- Then \"n\u00e9meth\" \u2013 no.\n- \"ince\", \"cooper\", \"queudrue\", \"marinelli\", \"mustoe\", \"deane\", \"johnston\", etc. So, marinelli is at row index 5 and johnston is at row index 9.\n\nNow, for each of them, I need to check the relevant columns. The claim is about goals, so I should look at the 'fa cup' and 'league cup' columns because those are likely goal-related stats, but it's not explicitly clear without context.\n\nWait, actually, in football (soccer), typically \"goals\" might refer to total goals scored or something similar. But here, the columns are named 'fa cup' and 'league cup', which probably represent their performance in those competitions. However, the term 'score' is more general, so perhaps it's about the total number of goals they've scored.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nFor marinelli (row 5):\n- \"fa cup\": 0\n- \"league cup\": 0\n- So his total goals in these competitions are 0 each.\n\nFor johnston (row 9):\n- \"fa cup\": 0\n- \"league cup\": 0\n- So his total is also 0+0=0.\n\nWait, but the claim says they \"score the same number of goals.\" So both have 0 in their fa cup and league cup stats. But perhaps we should look at 'total' column as well?\n\nWait, no, because the columns are named specifically for competitions, and 'total' is a separate category. So if the claim is about total goals scored, then looking at the 'fa cup' and 'league cup' might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe it's just the sum of those two.\n\nBut in the table, each person has their own stats in each competition. So for marinelli, his total goals would be 0 (fa cup) + 0 (league cup) = 0? Similarly for johnston, same calculation.\n\nWait, but looking at row 14: \"johnston\" has fa cup 0 and league cup 0, so total is 1. Wait no, the 'total' column in their rows might be adding up all four columns? No, each row's data seems to represent stats per competition. So for example, marinelli's row shows 2 under name, which I think is his team number or something else. But the relevant columns for goals would likely be fa cup and league cup.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row has five entries: name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. So for each person, their stats are broken down into these four competitions. For example, marinelli has 2 in the name column, which might indicate his position or something else, and then 0 in fa cup, 0 in league cup, and 8 under 'total'. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if fa cup is 0 and league cup 0, how can total be 8? That suggests that the total is perhaps a different metric, like goals scored plus assists or something else.\n\nBut wait, looking at the row for \"own goals\" (last row), they have 1 in fa cup, 1 in league cup, and 2 under total. So that makes sense: 1 own goal in each competition, totaling 2 overall. Therefore, the 'total' column might be aggregating all goals, regardless of competition.\n\nSo, for marinelli (row 5), his 'fa cup' is 0 and 'league cup' is 0, so total goals would be 0+0=0. Similarly, johnston (row 9) has fa cup 0 and league cup 0, so total goals are also 0.\n\nBut wait, in the data provided, for \"marinelli\", it's:\n[\n  \"marinelli\",\n  2,\n  0,\n  0,\n  8\n]\nWait, that can't be right because if fa cup is 0 and league cup is 0, how does 'total' become 8? Maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Alternatively, perhaps the 'fa cup' and 'league cup' are not goal statistics but something else, like appearances.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. The claim is about scoring goals, so it's likely referring to how many goals each person has scored in their competitions.\n\nBut looking at \"marinelli\", his row shows 0 under fa cup and 0 under league cup. So total goals scored would be 0+0=0? But the same for johnston: 0+0=0.\n\nWait, but looking at other rows:\n\nFor example, \"whelan\" has 4 in name (maybe number?), 3 under fa cup, 0 under league cup, and 7 under total. So that suggests that 'fa cup' is goals scored, 'league cup' is another metric, and 'total' adds them up? Or perhaps it's something else.\n\nWait, but \"own goals\" row shows 1 in fa cup, 1 in league cup, and 2 under total, which makes sense because an own goal would count as both a goal for the opponent and a self-goal. So that aligns with 'fa cup' and 'league cup' being separate goals.\n\nBut for regular players, their own goals might not be tracked separately. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the claim is about how many goals each has scored in total, regardless of competition.\n\nSo if marinelli has 0 goals in fa cup and 0 in league cup, his total goals would be 0. Similarly, johnston also has 0+0=0.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data again:\n\nFor \"marinelli\":\n[\n  \"marinelli\",\n  2,\n  0,\n  0,\n  8\n]\nSo perhaps 'fa cup' is goals scored in fa cup, 'league cup' is something else (like assists?), and total is some sum. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers under name are irrelevant, and the relevant columns are fa cup and league cup for goal counts, but then why would \"own goals\" have 1+1=2?\n\nWait, perhaps 'fa cup' and 'league cup' represent goals scored, so an own goal is counted in both. So for example, a player who scores an own goal has one goal in fa cup and one in league cup.\n\nTherefore, if marinelli has 0 in fa cup and 0 in league cup, he has scored no goals. Similarly, johnston also has 0 in both, so they've scored no goals. Therefore, their total goals are the same: 0.\n\nSo according to this, yes, both have scored zero goals, so the claim that they \"score the same number of goals\" would be true because both have scored 0.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in football, you can't score a goal without it being either for your team or an own goal. So if someone has 0 in fa cup and 0 in league cup, that would mean they didn't score any goals, which could be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'fa cup' and 'league cup' represent different competitions where they might have scored differently. But according to their data:\n\n- marinelli: fa cup 0, league cup 0\n- johnston: fa cup 0, league cup 0\n\nSo both have zero goals in these competitions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that both have the same number of goals (zero), so the claim would be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check other rows to see if this makes sense. For example, \"whelan\" has 3 under fa cup and 0 under league cup. So he's scored 3 goals in fa cup competitions and 0 in league cup. His total is 7, which perhaps includes other stats.\n\nBut for our purpose, since both marinelli and johnston have zero in their respective goal columns, their scores are equal at zero.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"They score the same number of goals\" would be true because both scored zero goals.\n\nHowever, another interpretation: maybe 'score' refers to total goals across all competitions. For that, we need to sum fa cup and league cup for each player.\n\nBut in marinelli's case: 0 + 0 = 0\nJohnston's case: 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSame result.\n\nSo yes, their scores are the same.\n</think>\n\nThey both scored zero goals across all competitions. Therefore, they indeed score the same number of goals.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"cooper , marinelli , mustoe , and queudrue be the only player to score 2 or more goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided in JSON format. The columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. Each row represents a different player with their statistics across these competitions.\n\nThe claim mentions four players: Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue. I need to check each of them to see if they scored 2 or more goals in any competition. The relevant columns for this are 'total' because the other columns (league, fa cup, league cup) might not directly indicate total goals.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. Cooper: Their row shows [2, 0, 0, 2] under name \"cooper\". Wait, but the columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. So in their row, the 'name' is \"cooper\", and then the numbers correspond to each column. So for \"cooper\", the 'league' is 0, 'fa cup' 0, 'league cup' 0, and 'total' is 2.\n\n2. Marinelli: Their data is [2, 0, 0, 2]. So 'total' is 2 here as well.\n\n3. Mustoe: Same numbers as Cooper and Marinelli, with total goals 2.\n\n4. Queudrue: Also has a total of 2 goals.\n\nSo each of these four players have a total of 2 goals in the 'total' column.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players scored 2 or more goals. Let's go through all rows:\n\n- Boksi: Total is 8.\n- Whelan: Total is 7.\n- N\u00e9meth: Total is 6.\n- Ince: Total is 3.\n- Cooper: 2\n- Marinelli: 2\n- Mustoe: 2\n- Queudrue: 2\n- Deane, Johnston, Greening, Stockdale, Festa, Windass, Southgate, Carbone, Ehiogu: Each has total of 1.\n- Murphy and Wilson: Their 'total' is 1, but looking at their columns, fa cup or league cup might be 1. For example, Murphy's row shows [0, 0, 1, 1], which could mean he scored a goal in either fa cup or league cup, adding up to total of 1.\n- Cambell: 'total' is 1, and has 1 in 'fa cup'.\n- Own Goals: Total is 2, but they are goals by own goal, not specific players.\n\nSo, the only players who scored 2 or more are Boksi (8), Whelan (7), N\u00e9meth (6), Ince (3), Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue (each with 2), and Own Goals. But since Own Goals aren't specific to these four players mentioned in the claim, we can ignore them.\n\nThe claim states that these four are the only ones who scored 2 or more goals. However, Boksi, Whelan, N\u00e9meth, Ince have higher totals than 2, so they also scored 2 or more. Therefore, the claim is false because there are other players besides Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue who have scored 2 or more goals.\n\nSo, I need to identify all relevant cells that disprove the claim. These would be the rows where 'total' is greater than or equal to 2 but not for the four named players.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells include:\n\n- All rows except those of Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue, and Own Goals.\n\nBut wait, since the claim is about players being the only ones with 2+ goals, any other player who scored 2 or more should be included as relevant cells. So, for example, Boksi has a total of 8 in their row, which would show that they also have 2+ goals, thus making the claim false.\n\nSo, I'll list all rows except Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue, and Own Goals as relevant because each of these players scored 2 or more, thereby showing the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n]}",
