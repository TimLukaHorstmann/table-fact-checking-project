    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"before week 6, attendance at San Diego Charger game total 13000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find all relevant information. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions \"before week 6,\" so I should focus on weeks 1 through 5. Each row in the data corresponds to a specific week.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent is New York Titans, result is a loss, attendance 12893\nWeek 2: Opponent is Dallas Texans, result is a loss, attendance 12500\nWeek 3: Opponent is San Diego Chargers, result is a loss, attendance 13000\nWeek 4: Opponent is Denver Broncos, result is a loss, attendance 22452\nWeek 5: Opponent is Denver Broncos again, result is a loss, attendance 7000\n\nSo, the relevant rows for week numbers before 6 are weeks 1-5. Now, I'm looking for games where the opponent is San Diego Chargers.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Week 3 is San Diego Chargers with attendance 13000.\n\nSince this is the only game before week 6 against the Chargers, and its attendance is exactly 13000, it seems to support the claim. The total attendance for all Charger games before week 6 would be just this one game at 13,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
