    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the claim and breaking it down.\n\nThe claim says: \"the building that remains the tallest in Montreal today be the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re.\" So, I'm being asked if 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is the tallest building in Montreal as of today. To verify this, I should look for information related to the height and current status of this building compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various attributes. The columns include \"name,\" \"street address,\" \"years as tallest,\" \"of years as tallest,\" \"height m / ft,\" and \"floors.\" Since the claim is about height, I should focus on the \"height m / ft\" column.\n\nFirst, let's locate 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re in the table. Scanning through the names, it's the last row (row_index 6). The height listed for this building is \"205 / 673.\" Now, I need to check if this is indeed the tallest among all the buildings listed.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n- Notre-Dame Basilica: 69m / 226ft\n- Royal Bank Building: 121m / 397ft\n- Sun Life Building: 122m / 400ft\n- Tour CIBC: 187m / 614ft\n- Place Ville Marie: 188m / 617ft\n- Tour de la Bourse: 194m / 637ft\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 205m / 673ft\n\nComparing the heights, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re's height is 205 meters, which seems to be the highest among all the listed buildings. However, I should check if there are any other buildings taller than this in Montreal not listed here. Since the table only includes these seven buildings, and within them, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re has the highest recorded height of 205m, it is indeed the tallest as per the data provided.\n\nNow, regarding the \"years as tallest\" column for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: the entry is \"21 years (current).\" This suggests that it has been the tallest for at least 21 years and remains so today. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the table's information.\n\nAs for relevant cells, I need to find which rows and columns are relevant to the claim. The key columns here are \"name\" and \"height m / ft.\" The relevant row is where 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is located (row_index 6).\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- row_index 6, column_name \"name\"\n- row_index 6, column_name \"height m / ft\"\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is TRUE, and these are the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe building in question is indeed the tallest among those listed in the table as of today. The relevant data confirms its height and current status.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "from 1829 - 1928 , the notre dame basilica be the tallest building and still hold the record for the most year be the tallest",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the Notre-Dame Basilica is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"from 1829 - 1928 , the notre dame basilica be the tallest building and still hold the record for the most year be the tallest.\" Hmm, that seems a bit unclear, but I think it's trying to say that from 1829 to 1928, Notre-Dame Basilica was the tallest building and holds the record for the number of years as the tallest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various attributes. The columns include \"name\" (the building name), \"street address,\" \"years as tallest,\" \"of years as tallest,\" \"height m / ft,\" and \"floors.\" \n\nThe first row is Notre-Dame Basilica. Its \"years as tallest\" are listed as 1829 - 1928, which matches the timeframe in the claim. The \"height m / ft\" for this building is 69 meters or about 226 feet. Another column says \"of years as tallest,\" but I think that might be a typo because it's followed by numbers like \"99 years.\" Wait, maybe \"of years as tallest\" is supposed to be something else? Or perhaps it's the number of years they were the tallest. But in this context, looking at other rows, that column seems inconsistent. For example, the second row (Royal Bank Building) has \"3 years,\" which probably refers to how many years they held the record. Similarly, Notre-Dame Basilica is listed as 99 years, but wait\u2014that doesn't make sense because their \"years as tallest\" are only from 1829-1928, which is about 100 years.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the \"of years as tallest\" column is indicating something else, like the number of floors? But no, there's a separate \"floors\" column. Let me check each row again.\n\nNotre-Dame Basilica: \"years as tallest\" is 1829-1928, which is approximately 99-100 years. The \"height m / ft\" is 69/226. The claim says they were the tallest during that period and still hold the record for the most years as the tallest.\n\nLooking at other buildings in the table, like the Royal Bank Building (second row), it was tallest from 1928-1931, so their \"years as tallest\" are only 3 years, which is much shorter than Notre-Dame's. The third row, Sun Life Building, has years from 1931-1962\u2014so about 31 years. Fourth row, Tour CIBC, was built in 1962 and still holds the record for less than a year. Fifth row, Place Ville Marie, was from 1962-1964\u20142 years. Sixth row, Tour de la Bourse, from 1964-1992\u201428 years. Seventh row, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, built in 1992 and still holds the record with 21 years (current) as of 2023 or so.\n\nSo, Notre-Dame Basilica was the tallest from 1829 to 1928, which is about 99-100 years. After that, other buildings took over as the tallest. The claim says they \"still hold the record for the most year be the tallest,\" which I think means they have the longest duration as the tallest building.\n\nLooking at the \"years as tallest\" column, Notre-Dame has the longest period: 1829-1928. None of the other buildings have a longer timeframe where they were the tallest. For example, Tour de la Bourse held for 28 years (1964-1992), but that's much shorter than 99 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Notre-Dame Basilica was the tallest from 1829 to 1928 and holds the record for the most number of years as the tallest building.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Notre-Dame Basilica was indeed the tallest from 1829 to 1928, and its duration as the tallest exceeds that of any other buildings listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the Tour de la Bourse taking the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964 by a mere 6/20 m/ft difference is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the data. The table has several columns: name, street address, years as tallest, of years as tallest, height m/ft, and floors. Each row represents a different building with its associated details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific buildings: Tour de la Bourse and Place Ville Marie. It also refers to a time frame in 1964 when Tour de la Bourse supposedly took the title from Place Ville Marie, differing by only 6/20 m/ft in height. \n\nI'll need to find the relevant rows and columns in the table that pertain to these buildings around the year 1964.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The Tour de la Bourse is listed as row index 5 with years as tallest from 1964 to 1992, height 194/637 m/ft, which I assume translates to approximately 194 meters in height since it's written as m/ft. Wait, no, actually, the format in the table is \"m / ft\", so maybe it's 194 meters and 637 feet? But that seems unusual because buildings usually have their heights in meters or feet, not both. Maybe it's a conversion, but perhaps I should just take it as is.\n\n- Place Ville Marie is row index 4 with years as tallest from 1962 to 1964, height 188/617 m/ft, and floors 47.\n\nWait, the claim says that Tour de la Bourse took the title from Place Ville Marie in 1964. So I need to check if at some point around 1964, Tour de la Bourse became taller than Place Ville Marie, or perhaps overtook it.\n\nLooking at their heights:\n\nTour de la Bourse's height is listed as \"194 / 637\" m/ft. I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this correctly. Maybe the first number is meters and the second is feet? Or is it a ratio? The format seems inconsistent with other buildings. For example, another building has \"69 / 226\", which might be meters over feet.\n\nIf that's the case, then Tour de la Bourse would have a height of approximately 194 meters (assuming 637 feet is roughly 192 meters), but that doesn't make sense because 194m is already a tall building, and 637ft is about 196m. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are in meters and feet separately, so 194 meters and 637 feet? But that's unusual for a building to have both measurements listed. Alternatively, it could be a ratio or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the height is expressed as meters and feet, but I'm not sure how that's used here. Maybe I should focus on comparing the heights numerically, considering the units appropriately.\n\nPlace Ville Marie has a height of \"188 / 617\" m/ft, which would be approximately 188m or 617ft. Again, this seems inconsistent, perhaps it's meters over feet, so 188 meters and 617 feet? That can't be right because 617 feet is about 187 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are in meters and then converted to feet, but that might complicate things. Maybe I should just consider the numerical values for comparison purposes, assuming both are in the same unit, which they aren't, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the format is meters/feet, so we can compare by converting them to the same unit. For example, Tour de la Bourse is 194m and 637ft, but that would mean it's over 200m tall, which is extremely high for a building. Place Ville Marie at 188m and 617ft also seems too tall.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the format. Maybe the first number is in meters and the second in feet, so \"69 / 226\" would be 69m and 226ft? But that's not how buildings are typically represented. More likely, it's a ratio, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent something else, like floors or height in another unit. Wait, the column name is \"height m / ft\", so perhaps it's the height in meters and feet separately. But that would mean each building has two heights, which doesn't make sense because a building can't have two different heights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are a ratio of meters to feet, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the format is just height in meters and then converted to feet for comparison purposes, so \"69 / 226\" would be approximately 69m (which is about 226ft). So maybe it's indicating that the building is 69m tall, which is roughly 226ft.\n\nBut if that's the case, Tour de la Bourse at 194/637 m/ft would be 194m (~637ft) and Place Ville Marie at 188/617 m/ft would be 188m (~617ft). That seems off because a building can't have two different heights. So perhaps it's just the height in meters, with the feet conversion being redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are in meters over feet, so for example, \"69 / 226\" could represent the ratio of meters to feet, but that doesn't make sense for building heights because they're usually expressed in a single unit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's just meters and feet as separate measurements. So, Tour de la Bourse is 194m tall and also 637ft tall? That can't be right because a building can't have two different heights. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo or an error in the table. For example, \"69 / 226\" could mean 69 meters or 226 feet. So perhaps each building has its height in one unit, and that's all. But then why have both?\n\nWait, looking at another row: Place Ville Marie is listed as 47 floors with a height of 188/617 m/ft. If floors are mentioned separately (but there's no 'floors' column except for the last column, which is just numbers without units), perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nWait, in the table, the \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\" might not be relevant here. The claim is about height differences, so I should focus on the \"height m / ft\" column.\n\nSo for Tour de la Bourse: 194/637\nPlace Ville Marie: 188/617\n\nIf we assume that these are heights in meters and feet respectively, then:\n\nTour de la Bourse: 194m (which is about 637ft)\nPlace Ville Marie: 188m (about 617ft)\n\nBut again, a building can't have both measurements. So perhaps each number represents something else, like the height in meters converted to feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a ratio, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are meant to be read as decimal points, so \"194/637\" could be 0.305m or something, which doesn't make sense either.\n\nI think I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should consider that the claim is about the height difference in meters or feet, and see if there's a significant difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for other information or sources about these buildings' actual heights because maybe the table has some errors.\n\nBut assuming I have to work with what's given:\n\nTour de la Bourse: 194/637 m/ft \u2248 194m (since 637ft is about 193.6m, so maybe it's 194m)\nPlace Ville Marie: 188/617 m/ft \u2248 188m\n\nSo Tour de la Bourse is approximately 194m and Place Ville Marie is 188m. The difference would be about 6 meters.\n\nBut wait, the claim says that Tour de la Bourse overtook Place Ville Marie in height. So if we consider this, then yes, there's a small difference.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident because the numbers seem off. Maybe I should double-check the units or see if there's another way to interpret them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are just meters and feet separately, but that still doesn't make sense for building heights.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to ignore the \"m/ft\" part and focus on the numerical values. So Tour de la Bourse is 194, Place Ville Marie is 188. The difference is 6. So in that case, yes, Tour de la Bourse is taller by about 6 units.\n\nBut without knowing what those units are, it's hard to say if that's a significant difference or not. If it's meters, then 6m is a small difference, but for skyscrapers, even a meter can be significant. However, in reality, these buildings might have similar heights.\n\nAlternatively, if the numbers are floors, then 194 vs 188 would mean Tour de la Bourse has more floors and thus is taller. But since \"floors\" isn't a column here, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the columns: There's \"years as tallest\", which might refer to when each building was the tallest in their respective cities or something like that. So maybe the height difference is referring to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are just random and should be ignored, making this problem unsolvable based on the given data.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the \"height m / ft\" column, Tour de la Bourse has a higher number (194 vs 188) than Place Ville Marie. Therefore, it's likely that Tour de la Bourse overtook Place Ville Marie in height at some point.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTour de la Bourse did indeed surpass Place Ville Marie in terms of height at some point. This conclusion is drawn from comparing their respective heights as indicated by the \"height m / ft\" column, where Tour de la Bourse has a higher numerical value (194) compared to Place Ville Marie (188).",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year , follow by place ville marie.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asserting. It seems like the claim is making two main points:\n\n1. Tour CIBC is the tallest building among those that have been the tallest for the shortest period.\n2. Place Ville Marie comes next in terms of being the second tallest for its duration.\n\nSo, I need to check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that it's structured with columns: name, street address, years as tallest, of years as tallest, height m/ft, and floors. The rows represent different buildings.\n\nStarting with Tour CIBC (last row):\n\n- Years as tallest: 1992 - present\n- Of years as tallest: 21 years (current)\n- Height m/ft: 205 / 673 \u2248 30.75 meters\n\nPlace Ville Marie is the fifth row:\n\n- Years as tallest: 1962 - 1964\n- Of years as tallest: 2 years\n- Height m/ft: 188 / 617 \u2248 3.04 meters\n\nNow, to check if Tour CIBC is the tallest building that has been the tallest for the least amount of time.\n\nLooking at other buildings:\n\n1. Notre-Dame Basilica (row 0): Years as tallest 1829-1928 = 99 years\n2. Royal Bank Building (row 1): 3 years\n3. Sun Life Building (row 2): 31 years\n4. Tour CIBC: 21 years\n5. Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n6. Tour de la Bourse (row 5): 28 years\n\nSo, the shortest duration as the tallest is Place Ville Marie at 2 years, followed by Royal Bank at 3 years, then Sun Life at 31, Tour CIBC at 21, and others longer.\n\nWait, that doesn't align. The claim says Tour CIBC is the least amount of year, but according to this, Place Ville Marie has only been tallest for 2 years, which is less than Tour CIBC's 21. So maybe the claim is incorrect because it lists Tour CIBC as having the least time.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The column \"of years as tallest\" might indicate how long they've held the title of tallest in their respective periods. For example, Place Ville Marie was tallest for 2 years from 1962-1964. Similarly, Royal Bank was only for 3 years, and so on.\n\nSo, Tour CIBC has been the tallest for 21 years (since 1992 to present), which is longer than Place Ville Marie's 2 years but shorter than others like Sun Life (31) and Tour de la Bourse (28).\n\nTherefore, Place Ville Marie actually holds the record for the shortest time as the tallest building. So the claim might be incorrect because it claims Tour CIBC is first with the least amount of year, followed by Place Ville Marie.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if \"of years as tallest\" is correctly interpreted. For example, Place Ville Marie's entry is 2 years, which seems correct for that time frame (1962-1964). Similarly, Royal Bank has 3 years (1928-1931), so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that Tour CIBC is first in being tallest for the least amount of years, followed by Place Ville Marie. But based on the data, Place Ville Marie actually comes before Tour CIBC in terms of the shortest duration as the tallest building.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Tour CIBC has been the tallest for 21 years, which is longer than Place Ville Marie's 2 years. Therefore, Place Ville Marie should be first in being the tallest for the least time, not Tour CIBC.\n\nHence, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are where the claim refers to the buildings: Tour CIBC and Place Ville Marie. Their respective columns are \"name\" and \"years as tallest.\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether Tour CIBC is indeed the tallest building for the least amount of years, followed by Place Ville Marie.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Tour CIBC (last row):** Years as tallest: 1992 - present (21 years)\n- **Place Ville Marie (fifth row):** Years as tallest: 1962 - 1964 (2 years)\n\nComparing these durations:\n- Place Ville Marie has been the tallest for only 2 years, which is less than Tour CIBC's 21 years.\n- Therefore, Place Ville Marie should be considered the building that was tallest for the least time, not Tour CIBC.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is incorrect because Place Ville Marie holds the record for the shortest duration as the tallest building, not Tour CIBC.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Sun Life Building and Notre-Dame Basilica is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for close to a third of the time of the notre dame basilica.\" So, we're comparing two buildings\u2014Sun Life Building and Notre-Dame Basilica\u2014and their respective durations as the tallest structure in Montreal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various details. The columns are \"name,\" \"street address,\" \"years as tallest,\" \"of years as tallest,\" \"height m / ft,\" and \"floors.\" \n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant to verify this claim. The key pieces of information needed are the time each building was the tallest and their heights, but since both buildings might have been the tallest at different times, I should focus on when each was the tallest.\n\nStarting with Notre-Dame Basilica: In row 0, under \"years as tallest,\" it's listed as \"1829 - 1928.\" That's a span of 99 years. The claim says that Sun Life Building remained the tallest for close to a third of this time. To find a third of 99 years, I calculate 99 / 3 = 33 years. So, we need to check if Sun Life Building was the tallest for at least 33 consecutive years during Notre-Dame's reign.\n\nLooking at Sun Life Building: It's in row 2. Its \"years as tallest\" are listed from 1931 - 1962, which is a span of 31 years. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if Notre-Dame was the tallest until 1928 and then perhaps someone else took over, but let me check all rows.\n\nWait, the rows in the table are:\n0: Notre-Dame Basilica (1829-1928)\n1: Royal Bank Building (1928-1931)\n2: Sun Life Building (1931-1962)\n3: Tour CIBC (1962)\n4: Place Ville Marie (1962-1964)\n5: Tour de la Bourse (1964-1992)\n6: 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re (1992-present)\n\nSo, Notre-Dame was tallest from 1829 to 1928. Then the Royal Bank Building took over from 1928 to 1931. Then Sun Life Building from 1931 to 1962.\n\nWait, so if Notre-Dame was the tallest until 1928, then Royal Bank took over until 1931, and then Sun Life from 1931 onwards. So, how long did Sun Life remain the tallest?\n\nIf I'm calculating a third of Notre-Dame's time as tallest: 99 years /3 = ~33 years.\n\nLooking at when Sun Life was tallest: From 1931 to 1962, that's 31 years (since 1962 -1931 +1? Wait, no, it's the period from start to end year inclusive. So, 1931-1962 is 32 years. For example, 2023-2019 would be 5 years if counting correctly.\n\nBut in any case, 31 or 32 years is less than a third of 99 years (which is ~33). So Sun Life was tallest for about 31-32 years, which is just under a third.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"close to a third of the time.\" So 31 is close to 33. That might be considered true, depending on interpretation.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the claim accurately states that Sun Life was taller for a duration approximately equal to a third of Notre-Dame's time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's implying that Sun Life was tallest during part of its reign overlapping with Notre-Dame, but actually, they were separate periods. So maybe the claim is not accurate because Sun Life became tallest after Notre-Dame had already been surpassed by others.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim says that Sun Life remained the tallest for close to a third of the time that Notre-Dame was tallest. But according to the table, Notre-Dame was the tallest until 1928, then Royal Bank took over until 1931, and then Sun Life from 1931 onwards.\n\nSo the duration when Sun Life was the tallest started after Notre-Dame had already been the tallest for nearly 100 years. Therefore, their times as tallest don't overlap. So it's not that Sun Life remained during Notre-Dame's time, but rather that after Notre-Dame, someone else took over, and then Sun Life became tallest later.\n\nThus, the claim might be incorrect because the periods are non-overlapping. Therefore, Sun Life didn't remain the tallest while Notre-Dame was still tallest; they were in different times.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Notre-Dame Basilica: row 0, column \"years as tallest.\"\nFor Sun Life Building: row 2, column \"years as tallest.\"\n\nThe claim is comparing their durations. Since Sun Life's duration (31 years) is less than a third of Notre-Dame's (99/3=33), it's not exactly a third but close. However, the more critical point is whether they overlapped at all.\n\nBut from the table, after 1928, Royal Bank was tallest until 1931, then Sun Life took over in 1931. So the periods don't overlap; Sun Life became tallest after Notre-Dame had already stopped being tallest for many years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it's implying that during a portion of Notre-Dame's time as tallest, Sun Life was also tallest, which isn't the case.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. The relevant cells are the \"years as tallest\" for both buildings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"notre dame basilica remain the tallest building in montreal today\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: name, street address, years as tallest, of years as tallest, height m / ft, and floors. Each row represents a different building with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"notre dame basilica\" specifically. So my first task is to find this entry in the data section. Scanning through the rows, I see that the first row has \"notre dame basilica\" as the name. That's relevant because if the claim is about whether it's still the tallest today, we need to look at its current status.\n\nLooking at the columns, the ones that could be important here are \"years as tallest\", which shows when the building was the tallest, and possibly \"height m / ft\" to see how tall it is compared to others. However, since the claim is about being the tallest today, maybe I should focus on whether any other buildings in Montreal have surpassed it in height.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't provide information about other buildings beyond what's listed here. So perhaps the key columns are \"years as tallest\" and the current status. Let me check each relevant row for Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nIn the first row, under \"years as tallest\", it's listed as 1829 - 1928. That suggests that during those years, it was the tallest. But then in the last row, which is \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re,\" the height m/ft is 205 / 673 and floors are 51. Wait, but I'm not sure if this building's height is higher than Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nWait, no. The first row for Notre-Dame has a height of 69 / 226 feet. Let me convert that to meters to see how tall it is. 69 divided by 226 is approximately 0.304 meters per foot, but actually, the format seems off. Wait, perhaps it's meters in the numerator and feet in the denominator? So 69 meters / 226 feet. That would be about 69m, which is quite tall.\n\nWait no, I'm confusing units. If it's written as \"69 / 226,\" maybe that's meters divided by feet, meaning 69 meters (which is approximately 226 feet). Wait, but 69/226 seems like a ratio. So if the height is 69m and another building is taller than that, then Notre-Dame wouldn't be the tallest anymore.\n\nLooking at other buildings: For example, \"tour de la bourse\" has a height of 194 / 637, which I think translates to meters over feet as well. Wait, but again, I'm not entirely sure how the numbers are presented. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the heights are given in both meters and feet, separated by a slash. So for Notre-Dame Basilica, \"69 / 226\" would be 69 meters (approx) or 226 feet? No, that doesn't make sense because 69 meters is about 226 feet, so it's just giving both measurements. Similarly, \"121 / 397\" for the royal bank building would be 121 meters and 397 feet.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then each height is given as two numbers separated by a slash, representing meters and feet respectively. So the first number is in meters, the second in feet. Therefore, to compare heights, we need to convert both to the same unit or directly compare them based on their meters.\n\nBut how? For example, Notre-Dame Basilica's height is 69m / 226ft. The last building, \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re,\" has a height of 205m / 673ft. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 205 meters is less than 69 meters? No, wait, no\u2014that's not correct. I think I'm misunderstanding the units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other way around: maybe the first number is in feet and the second in meters. So for example, \"69 / 226\" would be 69 feet (which is about 21 meters) or 226 meters? That seems more likely because 226 meters is a very tall building, taller than most skyscrapers.\n\nBut that can't be right because buildings don't reach 200+ meters unless they are extremely tall. Wait, no, the CN Tower in Toronto is over 500 meters, so perhaps some of these buildings are that tall.\n\nWait, let me think again. If \"notre dame basilica\" has a height of 69m / 226ft, which would mean 69 meters or 226 feet. Similarly, the last building has 205m / 673ft, meaning 205 meters or 673 feet.\n\nSo if we're looking at the maximum height in meters, then 205m is less than 226ft? Wait no, because 226 feet is about 68.8 meters. So 205 meters is much taller than 69 meters (since 69m is ~226ft). Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to convert both heights to meters:\n\n- Notre-Dame Basilica: \"69 / 226\" \u2013 perhaps the first number is in feet and the second in meters. So 69 feet = about 21 meters, but that's too short for a building of that era. Alternatively, maybe it's meters over feet as a ratio. So 69m / 226ft would mean that 69 meters equals 226 feet.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So 69 meters is equal to 226 feet. That way, each building's height is given in both units, allowing for comparison regardless of the unit.\n\nSimilarly, \"royal bank building\" has 121m / 397ft, meaning 121 meters equals 397 feet.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then the height is a ratio where the first number is in meters and the second in feet. Therefore, to compare heights, we can just look at the meters part or the feet part as the actual measurement.\n\nSo for Notre-Dame Basilica, it's 69 meters (or 226 feet). The last building, \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re,\" is 205 meters / 673 feet, meaning 205 meters (or 673 feet).\n\nWait, but then why would the claim be about whether Notre-Dame remains the tallest? If \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re\" is 205m, which is taller than 69m. Therefore, it's taller, so the claim that Notre-Dame is still the tallest would be false.\n\nBut wait, let me check other buildings as well. For example, \"tour de la bourse\" has a height of 194 / 637, meaning 194 meters (or 637 feet), which is taller than 69m but less than 205m.\n\nSo if that's the case, then \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re\" at 205m is taller than Notre-Dame's 69m. Therefore, it's no longer the tallest.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this interpretation is correct because the format seems off. Typically, buildings list their height in one unit, but here it's presented as meters over feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a decimal number where both are converted into feet or meters. For example, 69m / 226ft could be read as (69/226) meters, which is about 0.304 meters, which doesn't make sense for building heights.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 0.3 meters is only a few inches, which is not possible for a building's height.\n\nSo perhaps the correct interpretation is that the two numbers represent the same measurement but in different units. So, for example, \"69 / 226\" would mean 69 feet and 226 inches? But that also doesn't make sense because inches are smaller than feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meters and feet as separate measurements. So a building can have a height of 69 meters and 226 feet, which is redundant but possible in some contexts.\n\nBut if we're comparing the actual heights, regardless of units, then the key number to compare would be the meter measurement or the foot measurement.\n\nAssuming that \"69 / 226\" means 69 meters (which is about 226 feet), and \"205 / 673\" means 205 meters (about 673 feet). So in that case, 205m > 69m, making the last building taller than Notre-Dame.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Notre-Dame remains the tallest would be incorrect because another building is taller.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are in feet only, with the slash representing something else, like a ratio or a decimal.\n\nWait, if we consider \"69 / 226\" as a decimal, then it would be approximately 0.304, which again doesn't make sense for building heights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent floors instead of meters or feet. But that's another possibility.\n\nLooking back at the task, the user is asking about whether Notre-Dame remains the tallest building after another one surpasses it. From the data given, if \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re\" has a higher meter measurement than Notre-Dame, then it would be taller.\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, since \"1000 de la gaucheti\\u00e8re\" is taller, the claim that Notre-Dame is still the tallest is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the building heights provided, the \"1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\" building has a greater height (205 meters) than the Notre-Dame Basilica (69 meters). Therefore, the statement that Notre-Dame remains the tallest is no longer accurate. \n\nAnswer: No, the claim is incorrect because another building is taller.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the buildings is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"Although the place ville marie have more floor than tour de la bourse, tour de la bourse take the title of the tallest building from the place ville marie in 1964.\" \n\nBreaking this down, the claim is making two points:\n1. Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse.\n2. However, in 1964, Tour de la Bourse took the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie.\n\nI need to verify both parts using the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a JSON structure with columns: name, street address, years as tallest, of years as tallest, height m/ft, and floors. The data rows list different buildings with their details.\n\nFirst, let me find the relevant rows for Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse.\n\nIn the data array:\n- Row 4 corresponds to Place Ville Marie. Its details are: name \"place ville marie\", street address \"1 place ville - marie\", years as tallest \"1962\", of years as tallest \"<1 year\", height \"187 / 614\", and floors 47.\n- Row 5 is Tour de la Bourse, with details: name \"tour de la bourse\", address \"800 victoria square\", years as tallest \"1964 - 1992\", of years as tallest \"28 years\", height \"194 / 637\", and floors 47.\n\nWait, both Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse have the same number of floors (47). So, the first part of the claim that Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse is incorrect. They actually have the same number of floors.\n\nBut the second part says that in 1964, Tour de la Bourse took the title from Place Ville Marie. Looking at their years as tallest: Place Ville Marie's tallest year was 1962, and Tour de la Bourse's was 1964 - 1992. So, by 1964, Tour de la Bourse had already started being recognized as the tallest building.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to have two issues:\n1. The floors are equal, not that Place Ville Marie has more.\n2. The assertion about the title in 1964 is incorrect because Tour de la Bourse's tallest period began in 1964, possibly taking over from Place Ville Marie which was tallest until 1962.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"took the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\" So it's implying that in 1964, Tour de la Bourse became taller than Place Ville Marie. But according to the data, Place Ville Marie's tallest year was up to 1962, and Tour de la Bourse started being recognized from 1964 onwards.\n\nSo in 1964, when Tour de la Bourse's tallest period began, it would have been taller than Place Ville Marie, which had peaked in 1962. Therefore, the claim's second part is correct: Tour de la Bourse took the title in 1964.\n\nHowever, the first part of the claim says Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse, but they actually have the same number (47). So that part is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Both buildings have 47 floors as per the table. Therefore, the claim's first assertion is false, while the second is true.\n\nBut the overall claim says both things: although Place Ville Marie has more floors, Tour de la Bourse took the title in 1964. Since the first part is incorrect, the entire claim would be false because it's making an incorrect statement at the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first part. The claim says \"Place Ville Marie have more floor[sic] than Tour de la Bourse.\" But both have 47 floors, so that's incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim is false because the initial comparison is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the first part of the claim is incorrect. The relevant cells would be the ones for Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse to check their floors and tallest years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the given table is true or false. The claim is: \"tour cibc hold the record for the most year be the tallest in montreal.\" Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Tour CIBC has held the record for being the tallest building in Montreal for the longest number of years. So, I need to check if there's any information in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: name, street address, years as tallest, of years as tallest, height m / ft, and floors. The data rows contain information about various buildings, including Tour CIBC, which is one of them.\n\nI need to focus on the row where the building's name is \"tour cibc.\" Let me find that row in the table. Scanning through, I see it's the fourth entry:\n\n[\n  \"tour cibc\",\n  \"1155 ren\u00e9e l\u00e8vesque boulevard west\",\n  \"1962\",\n  \"<1 year\",\n  \"187 / 614\",\n  45\n]\n\nWait a second, the years as tallest for Tour CIBC is listed as \"1962.\" Hmm, that's just a single year. But the claim mentions holding the record for the most years, implying it's been the tallest for several consecutive years.\n\nNow, looking at other rows to see if any building has a longer period. For example, the first row (Notre-Dame Basilica) spans from 1829-1928, which is 99 years. The second (Royal Bank Building) is 3 years. Third, Sun Life Building: 31 years. Fourth, Tour CIBC: 1 year. Fifth, Place Ville Marie: 2 years. Sixth, Tour de la Bourse: 28 years. Seventh, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years current.\n\nSo, the Notre-Dame Basilica holds the record for the longest duration as the tallest building with 99 years from 1829 to 1928. Tour CIBC only held it in 1962, which is a single year. The claim says \"the most year,\" which might mean more than any other. Since Notre-Dame had 99, Tour CIBC doesn't hold that record.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about consecutive years rather than total duration? Let me read the claim again: \"hold the record for the most year be the tallest in montreal.\" It's a bit ambiguous. If it's about holding the title for the longest number of years, then Tour CIBC doesn't have that because Notre-Dame had 99 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about being the tallest currently or having held it at some point. But based on the table, Tour CIBC only held the record in 1962 for less than a year, which might not make it the longest ever.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because Notre-Dame Basilica has a longer period as the tallest building.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"tour cibc hold the record for the most year be the tallest in montreal\" is FALSE. The relevant cells show that Tour CIBC only held the title for less than a year, while Notre-Dame Basilica had a longer duration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"place ville marie be the tallest building for the least amount of year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that \"place ville marie\" is the tallest building for the least amount of years. So I need to find two things: whether it's the tallest (highest height) and whether it has been standing for the least number of years compared to other buildings in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various attributes. The relevant columns here are \"name\" (to identify the building), \"years as tallest\" (how many years it was the tallest before others surpassed or took its place), and \"height m / ft\" (its height). However, wait, there's also \"of years as tallest,\" which might be a typo. It seems like it should be \"years as tallest.\" So I can ignore that column for now.\n\nI need to locate \"place ville marie\" in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first entry is Notre-Dame Basilica, not relevant.\n2. Royal Bank Building: Not our building.\n3. Sun Life Building: No.\n4. Tour CIBC: Not it.\n5. Place Ville Marie: Yes, that's the fifth row.\n\nLooking at its data: In row index 5 (0-based?), wait no, looking at the table, each sublist is a separate row. Let me count:\n\n- Row 0: Notre-Dame Basilica\n- Row 1: Royal Bank Building\n- Row 2: Sun Life Building\n- Row 3: Tour CIBC\n- Row 4: Place Ville Marie\n- Row 5: Tour de la Bourse\n- Row 6: 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\n\nSo \"place ville marie\" is in row index 4.\n\nNow, for this building, the \"years as tallest\" is listed as \"2 years.\" That suggests it was the tallest building for two years. However, I also notice that there's a column labeled \"of years as tallest,\" which might be indicating how many years it remained the tallest before another building took over. But perhaps that's not relevant here; the claim says it's the tallest for the least amount of years, so we're focusing on its own time as the tallest.\n\nWait, but I also need to check if there are any other buildings in the table that have a smaller \"years as tallest\" value than 2. Because if another building was only 1 year or less, then \"place ville marie\" wouldn't be the least. Let's look at each row:\n\n- Notre-Dame Basilica: 1829-1928. It was tallest for 99 years.\n- Royal Bank Building: 3 years.\n- Sun Life Building: 31 years.\n- Tour CIBC: \"<1 year.\" That means it wasn't the tallest for a full year; maybe only part of a year or not at all.\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years.\n- Tour de la Bourse: 28 years.\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years (current).\n\nSo, Tour CIBC has \"<1 year,\" which is less than 2. That means it wasn't the tallest for even a full year. Therefore, Place Ville Marie's 2 years isn't the least; there's a building with less than that.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the least amount of year.\" So if another building was the tallest for <1 year, then Place Ville Marie is not the one with the least years. Hence, the claim would be FALSE because it's not the least\u2014it's more than some others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The column \"years as tallest\" might indicate how long it was tallest before being surpassed. For Tour CIBC, \"<1 year\" could mean that it wasn't the tallest for any full year. So Place Ville Marie, at 2 years, is more than Tour CIBC's less than 1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim is about being the tallest for the least number of years overall. So if a building was tallest for only a fraction of a year, it would have less time than others. But in this table, Place Ville Marie has 2 years, which is more than Tour CIBC's <1.\n\nTherefore, since there exists another building (Tour CIBC) with fewer years as tallest, the claim that Place Ville Marie is the tallest for the least amount of years is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because another building in the table was the tallest for less than a year, which is fewer than \"place ville marie's\" two years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the Sun Life Building and Notre Dame Basilica is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for the same amount of time as the notre dame basilica.\" So, I need to check if both buildings held the title of the tallest in Montreal for the same duration.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various attributes. The columns relevant here are \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest.\" These should tell me how many years each building was the tallest.\n\nFirst, I'll look up Notre Dame Basilica's data. It's in row 0. Under \"years as tallest,\" it's listed as \"1829 - 1928,\" which is a span of 99 years. The next column, \"of years as tallest,\" says \"99 years.\" So, they were the tallest for 99 consecutive years.\n\nNow, for the Sun Life Building, which is in row 2. Its \"years as tallest\" are listed as \"1931 - 1962,\" which is a span of 31 years. The next column has \"<1 year,\" but wait, that doesn't make sense because if it was the tallest for 31 years, why is it marked as less than a year? Maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, no, in the \"of years as tallest\" column, Sun Life Building says \"<1 year.\" That seems off because the span from 1931 to 1962 is 31 years.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest.\" For Notre Dame Basilica, both columns correctly reflect 99 years. But for Sun Life Building, maybe the first column has \"1931 - 1962,\" which is 31 years, but then the second column says \"<1 year.\" That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\" columns have different data entry conventions. For example, sometimes spans are indicated in one column, while the duration is stated in another. Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 1829 - 1928 (99 years) and 99 years.\n- Sun Life Building: 1931 - 1962 (31 years) and <1 year.\n\nThis seems contradictory. If the building was tallest from 1931 to 1962, that's a span of 31 years, so why is \"of years as tallest\" less than a year? Maybe it's a typo or data entry error. Alternatively, perhaps in some rows, the \"of years as tallest\" reflects the time since it became tallest again after another building took over.\n\nWait, maybe the \"years as tallest\" is when it first reached that height, and then \"of years as tallest\" is how long it held that title until another taller building came along. So for Notre Dame Basilica, 1829 - 1928 (99 years) and then \"99 years.\" That matches.\n\nFor Sun Life Building: If it was the tallest from 1931 to when? The data shows \"1962,\" so maybe it's still the tallest today, but let me check. Wait, no, in row 3, Tour CIBC is built in 1962 and has a height that might surpass it. Let's look at heights.\n\nHeights are given as \"69 / 226\" for Notre Dame Basilica (assuming feet/meters separated), Sun Life Building is \"122 / 400,\" which is taller than Notre Dame's 69/226? Wait, but the \"height m / ft\" column: 69/226 for Notre Dame is about 1.5 meters to 0.89 feet, and Sun Life is 122/400, which is about 1.55 meters or 5.08 feet. So perhaps that's not the tallest.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up columns. Let me check again:\n\nIn the data rows, each row has \"name,\" street address, then for Notre Dame Basilica: \"1829 - 1928\" as years, \"99 years\" in the next column. Then Sun Life Building is in row 2, so row index 2. Its years are \"1931 - 1962,\" and the next column is \"<1 year.\" So perhaps that's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe the \"of years as tallest\" for Sun Life Building isn't correct. Because if it was tallest from 1931-1962 (31 years), then why does it say \"<1 year\"? That doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps after 1962, another building became taller, so its time as tallest is less than a year before that happened.\n\nBut the claim is about how long each building remained the tallest. If Notre Dame held for 99 years and Sun Life only for <1 year, then their durations are different, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data. Maybe \"years as tallest\" is when they were first built as the tallest, but if another taller building was built later, their time as tallest would be shorter than that initial span. For example, Sun Life Building was tallest from 1931-1962 (31 years), then a newer building like Tour CIBC in 1962 might have been taller, so Sun Life's time as tallest is less than 1 year after that.\n\nWait, looking at the table, Tour CIBC is row 3, built in 1962. Its height is \"187 / 614,\" which in meters would be 187*0.00129= ~0.24 m? No, wait, no\u2014wait, actually, maybe it's meters first. So 187 m / 614 ft. That's a very tall building, about 187 meters, so much taller than Sun Life Building's 122m/400ft. Wait, no\u2014the heights are probably in meters and feet. Let me parse that correctly.\n\nWait, the \"height m / ft\" column: for Tour CIBC, it's \"187 / 614.\" So, that would be 187 meters or 614 feet? That can't be right because a building can't be both. Wait, perhaps the columns are height in meters and then in feet. So, if it's 187 meters tall, that's about 614 feet (since 1 meter \u2248 3.28 ft). So Tour CIBC is 187m/614ft.\n\nComparing to Sun Life Building: 122m/400ft. So Tour CIBC is taller than Sun Life Building. Therefore, when Tour CIBC was built in 1962, it became the tallest building in Montreal, so Sun Life's time as tallest ended at that point.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data, the years column for Sun Life Building says \"1931 - 1962.\" So perhaps its time as tallest was until 1962 when Tour CIBC was built. Therefore, how long did it hold the title before Tour CIBC?\n\nFrom 1931 to 1962 is 31 years. But if Tour CIBC was built in 1962 and immediately became taller, then Sun Life's time as tallest would be less than a year (from when Tour CIBC was built), hence \"<1 year.\" So, the \"of years\" column for Sun Life Building is \"<1 year.\"\n\nTherefore, Notre Dame held for 99 years, while Sun Life only for <1 year. Thus, their durations are different, making the claim that both held for the same duration incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. If Tour CIBC was built in 1962 and became taller than Sun Life Building which had been tallest until then, then from 1931 to 1962, Sun Life was tallest, but upon Tour CIBC's construction in 1962, it took over as tallest, so Sun Life's time as tallest ended in 1962. So the duration is 31 years, not <1.\n\nBut according to the data, Sun Life Building's \"of years\" column says \"<1 year,\" which would suggest that after a very short time (less than a year) after being built, another building took over. That doesn't make sense because Tour CIBC was built in 1962 and became taller.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the data. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Notre Dame Basilica\nYears: 1829 - 1928 (99 years)\nOf years: 99\n\nRow 1: Tour CIBC (maybe row index 3? Wait no, let's see.\n\nWait, the initial data is a bit unclear. The user provided the task, and then in the problem statement, I think the rows are:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nBuilding | Years as tallest | Duration\nNotre Dame Basilica | 1829 - 1928 (99 years) | 99\nSun Life Building | 1931 - 1962 (31 years) | <1\n\nBut why would Sun Life have only <1 year? Maybe after 1962, a taller building took over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"of years\" is when it was last tallest. So if Tour CIBC built in 1962 is taller, then Sun Life Building's time as tallest ended in 1962, so its duration would be until 1962, which is 31 years.\n\nBut according to the data, the column says \"<1 year,\" which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data entry was incorrect, and it should say \"31\" instead of \"<1.\"\n\nAssuming that, then both Notre Dame Basilica and Sun Life Building held for 99 and 31 years respectively, so their durations are different, making the claim false.\n\nBut if I'm forced to accept that in the data, Sun Life's duration is <1 year despite holding from 1931-1962, then it's a mistake. But as per the given data, perhaps we should go with the data's numbers.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: Their durations are different, so the claim that both held for the same time is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Notre Dame Basilica and Sun Life Building each held the title of tallest building in Montreal for the same duration is incorrect. \n\nNotre Dame Basilica held this title from 1829 to 1928, which is a duration of 99 years. On the other hand, Sun Life Building became the tallest upon its construction in 1931 and remained so until 1962, a period of 31 years.\n\nSince their durations as the tallest building are different (99 vs. 31 years), the original claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect; the two buildings held the title for different amounts of time.",
