    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"mollie harris play the character martha woodford in the archer.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. It mentions two actors: mollie harris and martha woodford. Wait, actually, martha woodford is a character name. So, the claim says that Mollie Harris plays Martha Woodford in The Archers.\n\nI need to check the table to see if there's an entry where \"mollie harris\" is listed as the actor for the character \"martha woodford.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: actor, character, soap opera, years, and another column which might be a show or another detail. The relevant part here is the 'actor' and 'character' columns.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match. Scanning the rows... Here's one that catches my eye:\n\n- Row 36: actor is \"mollie harris\", character is \"martha woodford\", soap opera is \"the archers.\" \n\nThat seems to fit perfectly. So, Mollie Harris does play Martha Woodford in The Archers.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other entry with the same names that might confuse things. Let me check a few more rows around it. \n\nRow 37: different actors and characters. Row 35 is about another character in a different show. So yes, row 36 is the correct one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then provide relevant cells that support this determination. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"pauline seville play the character mr perkins in the archer for 39 year.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down into parts to check each aspect.\n\n1. **Actor's Name**: The claim mentions Pauline Seville as the actor.\n2. **Character Name**: The character is Mr. Perkins.\n3. **Soap Opera Title**: It refers to \"the archer.\"\n4. **Years Played**: 39 years.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part to verify if they are supported by the table.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Pauline Seville in the Table**\n\nI need to look for rows where the actor's name is Pauline Seville. Scanning through the table, I see a row at index 31: \"Pauline Seville\" plays \"Martha Woodford\" in \"The Archers.\" Wait, that's not Mr. Perkins. Hmm, maybe I missed another entry.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each row systematically. Let me list all the rows where Pauline Seville is mentioned. From the table provided:\n\nLooking at the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 18: \"Pauline Seville\" plays \"Martha Woodford\" in \"The Archers\" for 25 years.\nWait, that doesn't match Mr. Perkins.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. Scanning through each row, I don't see any row where Pauline Seville is listed as playing Mr. Perkins. The only mention of Mr. Perkins is in the rows related to \"Ma Perkins.\"\n\nWait, let's clarify. In the table, under the column \"Character,\" there are entries like \"Ma Perkins\" and others. For example:\n\n- Row 5: \"Virginia Payne\" plays \"Ma Perkins.\"\n- Row 9: \"Felicity Finch\" plays \"Ruth Archer.\"\n- Row 11: \"Gwen Berryman\" plays \"Doris Archer.\"\n- And so on.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Mr. Perkins, not Ma Perkins. So I need to check if there's a row where Pauline Seville plays Mr. Perkins. From the table provided, in the column \"Character,\" I don't see an entry for Mr. Perkins. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n- Row 0: ...\n- ...\n- Row 18: \"Pauline Seville\" plays \"Martha Woodford.\"\n- Row 19: \"Charles Egelston\" plays \"Shuffle Shober.\"\n- ...\n- Continuing until the end, I don't see any row where Pauline Seville is assigned to Mr. Perkins.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's confusion between Mr. Perkins and Ma Perkins? The claim refers to Mr. Perkins, but in the table, only \"Ma Perkins\" exists as a character. Let me check that.\n\nIn the table:\n\n- Row 5: \"Virginia Payne\" plays \"Ma Perkins.\"\n- Row 24: \"Leslie Dunn\" plays \"Paul Johnson.\"\n- And others, but I don't see any row where Mr. Perkins is mentioned.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no such character as Mr. Perkins in the table. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the name. Maybe it's supposed to be Ma Perkins instead of Mr. Perkins?\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"pauline seville play the character mr perkins in the archer for 39 year.\" So, they are saying Pauline Seville plays Mr. Perkins in The Archers for 39 years.\n\nLooking back at the table, I need to see if there's a row where Pauline Seville is listed as playing Mr. Perkins. From what I can see, she is only mentioned in row 18, playing Martha Woodford for 25 years. So that doesn't align with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions 39 years. Looking at the table, I need to check how many years Pauline Seville has been in The Archers. From row 18: 25 years, and perhaps another entry? Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all rows again.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the only time Pauline Seville appears is in row 18, where she's been in The Archers since 1970 to 1995, which is 25 years. So the claim of 39 years doesn't match this either.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because:\n\n- Pauline Seville does not play Mr. Perkins; perhaps it's a mix-up with Ma Perkins.\n- The duration mentioned (39 years) doesn't align with her tenure in the show as per the table data.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's any row where Mr. Perkins is played by someone else. For example:\n\nLooking at row 5: \"Virginia Payne\" plays \"Ma Perkins.\"\nRow 24: \"Leslie Dunn\" plays \"Paul Johnson.\"\nRow 26: \"Mollie Harris\" plays \"Martha Woodford.\"\nWait, no mention of Mr. Perkins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different character named Mr. Perkins that's not listed in the table, which would make the claim false.\n\nAlso, regarding the years: if Pauline Seville has been in The Archers for 25 years (as per row 18), and the claim says 39, that's inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is false because:\n\n1. There is no evidence in the table that Pauline Seville plays Mr. Perkins.\n2. The duration of her involvement as stated in the claim does not match the data provided.\n3. The character name \"Mr. Perkins\" may not exist in the context of The Archers, or it might be a confusion with \"Ma Perkins.\"\n\nHence, the task is to determine if the claim is correct based on the table. Since both aspects (character and duration) don't align, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the user is incorrect based on the provided table. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Character Inconsistency**: The table does not mention \"Mr. Perkins\" as a character in the show. Instead, it lists \"Ma Perkins,\" which is played by Virginia Payne.\n\n2. **Duration Mismatch**: According to the table, Pauline Seville has been part of \"The Archers\" since 1970 until 1995, totaling 25 years (see row 18). The claim states a duration of 39 years, which does not align with this data.\n\nSince both points of fact contradict the user's claim, we conclude that the statement is false.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is incorrect. There is no evidence in the provided table to support that Pauline Seville plays Mr. Perkins in \"The Archers\" for 39 years.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"margot boyd play the character marjorie antrobus\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Margot Boyd plays the character Marjorie Antrobus in \"the archers.\" So, I need to find if there's a row in the data where both \"actor\" and \"character\" match these names.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has several columns: actor, character, soap opera (which is always \"the archers\"), years, and duration. The relevant columns for this claim are \"actor\" and \"character.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check for Margot Boyd as the actor and Marjorie Antrobus as the character.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1.

So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check all rows just in case there are multiple entries or discrepancies. But since each person might play only one character in a show, finding it here seems sufficient.\n\nHowever, let me make sure by going through the rest:\n\n- Row 1: Actor is \"carole boyd,\" which is different from Margot.\n- Row 2: Actor is \"j anthony smythe.\"\n- ...\nContinuing down, I see various actors and characters. None match the names given in the claim except for row 0.\n\nWait, but looking again at row 0: The actor is listed as \"margot boyd\" and character as \"marjorie antrobus.\" That's a direct match to the claim.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be TRUE.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"Norman paint play the character Phil archer in the archer for 59 year.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and see if there's a matching entry for Norman Paint as an actor who played Phil Archer for 59 years.\n\nLooking at the table columns: columns are \"actor,\" \"character,\" \"soap opera,\" \"years,\" and \"duration.\" So each row has data corresponding to these columns.\n\nNow, I'll scan through the rows one by one. The claim mentions \"Norman paint\" as the actor, so I should look for that name in the \"actor\" column.\n\nRow 0: Actor is \"lesley saweard,\" not Norman Paint.\nRow 1: Actor is \"norman pain,\" which matches the name \"Norman paint.\" So this is relevant. Let me check the other columns for this row.\n\nCharacter is \"phil archer.\" That's exactly what the claim mentions. Now, checking the years and duration. The \"years\" column says \"59 year\" and \"duration\" is not specified here, but typically duration might refer to years as well. So this seems to match: Norman Paint played Phil Archer for 59 years.\n\nWait, I should double-check if there are other rows with \"Norman paint.\" Let's see:\n\nRow 2: Actor is \"paul jones.\"\n...\nGoing through all the rows, only row 1 has \"norman pain\" as the actor. So that's the one.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be at row index 1, columns \"actor,\" \"character,\" and \"years.\" But according to the instructions, I need to list each relevant column for each cell. However, in the example provided, each relevant cell is a single column. Wait, no, looking back, in the example, each relevant cell is one object with either row index and column name.\n\nWait, but the instruction says: \"relevant_cells\": a list of objects, each with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string). So for each relevant data point, we need to specify which column it is in that particular row.\n\nSo for row 1, columns:\n\n- \"actor\": Norman Paint\n- \"character\": Phil Archer\n- \"years\": 59 year\n\nBut the claim mentions \"play the character phil archer,\" so the \"character\" column is relevant. Also, the \"years\" could be checked, but since duration is sometimes used interchangeably with years, maybe just the \"years\" column is needed.\n\nWait, the claim says \"for 59 year.\" In the table, for that row, \"years\" is \"59 year,\" so it's a match.\n\nBut in the instruction example, they have two cells: one from row 0 and another from row 1. So each relevant cell is a specific column in a specific row.\n\nTherefore, to verify the claim, I need to check if there exists a row where:\n\n- \"actor\" is Norman Paint\n- \"character\" is Phil Archer\n- \"years\" is 59 year\n\nBut perhaps just the actor and character columns are sufficient because the years might not be explicitly stated as duration. However, in this case, since the claim includes both the role and the duration, we should check all relevant data points.\n\nWait, but according to the instruction, it's to verify each condition in the claim against the table. The claim has two main parts: Norman Paint plays Phil Archer and did so for 59 years.\n\nSo first, confirming that Norman Paint is an actor who played Phil Archer. That would involve checking the \"actor\" and \"character\" columns.\n\nSecond, confirming that he played it for 59 years, which involves the \"years\" column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row where \"actor\" is Norman Paint (row index 1) and \"character\" is Phil Archer.\n2. Same row's \"years\" column to check duration.\n\nBut wait, in the instructions, each relevant cell is a single object with either \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" So for example, if multiple columns are relevant, we need to list each as separate objects.\n\nSo:\n\n- For row 1, \"actor\" is Norman Paint: so column \"actor,\" row 1.\n- For row 1, \"character\" is Phil Archer: column \"character,\" row 1.\n- For row 1, \"years\" is 59 year: column \"years,\" row 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the \"actor\" and \"character\" columns are needed because the \"years\" might be implied or not directly part of the claim's specific condition. But since the claim mentions both the role and the duration, I think all three are relevant.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says: if fully supported, answer \"TRUE\"; otherwise, answer \"FALSE.\" So we need to check whether each part of the claim is supported by the table.\n\nLet me parse the claim again: \"Norman paint play the character phil archer in the archer for 59 year.\"\n\nSo:\n\n1. Norman Paint plays Phil Archer.\n2. He does this in \"the archer.\"\n3. For 59 years.\n\nLooking at the table, we can confirm all three points from row 1.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- \"actor\" column at row 1: confirms Norman Paint is an actor.\n- \"character\" column at row 1: Phil Archer.\n- \"years\" column at row 1: 59 year.\n\nAdditionally, the \"soap opera\" column for that row says \"the archer,\" which matches the claim.\n\nBut since the instruction example only lists two cells, perhaps each specific condition is a separate cell. So:\n\n- To confirm he plays Phil Archer, check \"character\" in his row.\n- To confirm it's for 59 years, check \"years.\"\n- But \"in the archer\" might be implied by the show name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the actor and character columns are needed because the duration is stated as a separate condition. So perhaps:\n\n1. Check that there exists a row where \"actor\" is Norman Paint.\n2. In that same row, check that \"character\" is Phil Archer.\n3. In that same row, check that \"years\" is 59 year.\n\nSo all three columns in the same row are relevant.\n\nBut since each relevant cell is an object with row index and column name, we need to list each of these as separate cells.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be a list containing:\n\n- {row_index:1, column_name:\"actor\"}\n- {row_index:1, column_name:\"character\"}\n- {row_index:1, column_name:\"years\"}\n\nBut looking back at the example given in the problem statement:\n\nIn the example, they have two cells listed. For instance, checking the \"archer\" and \"painter\" roles across different rows.\n\nWait, perhaps each condition is a separate relevant cell. So if the claim says he plays Phil Archer for 59 years, maybe the three conditions are: role, duration, and show name. But in this case, since the show name is \"the archer,\" which matches, but it's part of the table data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we only need to check the specific claims made: that he played Phil Archer and for 59 years. So the \"character\" and \"years\" columns are relevant.\n\nBut in the example given, they have two cells because they're checking two different roles across rows.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure it:\n\nThe claim has three parts:\n\n1. Subject: Norman Paint\n2. Role: Phil Archer\n3. Duration: 59 years\n\nSo we need to check that there's a row where the actor is Norman Paint, character is Phil Archer, and years are 59.\n\nTherefore, all three columns in that specific row are relevant.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For row 1:\n   - \"actor\": Norman Pain\n   - \"character\": Phil Archer\n   - \"years\": 59 year\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to \"the archer,\" which is the show name. So in the table, the \"soap opera\" column for row 1 says \"the archer,\" matching.\n\nTherefore, does that need to be included? The instruction isn't explicit on that point. Since the problem statement says: you have a table with columns: \"actor,\" \"character,\" and \"soap_opera.\"\n\nSo the claim says: in \"the archer,\" Norman Pain plays Phil Archer for 59 years.\n\nThus, we need to check:\n\n- \"actor\" is correct\n- \"character\" is correct\n- \"soap_opera\" is correct\n- \"years\" are correct\n\nBut perhaps the \"soap_opera\" is just a match, so it's implied. Alternatively, if the claim says \"in the archer,\" we need to check that column as well.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but according to the problem statement, you have columns: actor, character, and soap_opera.\n\nSo for the claim, all four points are part of it:\n\n- Norman Pain\n- plays Phil Archer\n- in the archer\n- for 59 years\n\nThus, we need to check each of these against the table. So relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row where \"actor\" is Norman Pain: column actor at row 1.\n2. In that same row, \"character\" is Phil Archer: column character at row 1.\n3. Same row's \"soap_opera\" is \"the archer\": so column soap_opera at row 1.\n4. Same row's \"years\" is 59 year: column years at row 1.\n\nTherefore, four relevant cells.\n\nBut the instruction example only includes two cells. So maybe each specific claim point is a separate cell, regardless of rows. Or perhaps in this case, since all these are from the same row, we can include them as individual cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the \"actor\" and \"character\" columns need to be checked because the duration is implied by the role's longevity, but that might not be accurate.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think it's safer to include each relevant column in the same row. So for row 1:\n\n- actor: Norman Pain\n- character: Phil Archer\n- soap_opera: the archer\n- years: 59 year\n\nThus, four cells.\n\nBut since the problem statement didn't specify \"soap_opera\" as part of the claim beyond referring to it as \"the archer,\" maybe only three cells are needed: actor, character, and years. Because the show is identified by its name in the column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the show's name doesn't need to be checked because it's already implied that it's \"the archer.\" But if the claim says he's working in \"the archer,\" then we need to confirm that from the table.\n\nThis is a bit unclear. Given the time I've spent on this, I think I should outline all four as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Norman Pain plays Phil Archer in \"The Archer\" for 59 years, you need to check the following columns in the corresponding row:\n\n1. **Actor**: Confirm the actor's name is listed as Norman Pain.\n2. **Character**: Ensure the character's name matches Phil Archer.\n3. **Soap Opera**: Verify that the soap opera column reflects \"The Archer.\"\n4. **Years**: Check that the years worked by Norman Pain total 59.\n\nEach of these points must be validated against the table to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnswer:\nTo verify the claim, check the following columns in the corresponding row:\n\n- **{row_index:1, column_name:\"actor\"}**\n- **{row_index:1, column_name:\"character\"}**\n- **{row_index:1, column_name:\"soap_opera\"}**\n- **{row_index:1, column_name:\"years\"}**\n\nThis confirms that Norman Pain plays Phil Archer in \"The Archer\" for 59 years.",

The claim mentions two names: \"nigel pargetter\" and \"the archers.\" It also states that he acted in \"the archer for 61 years.\"\n\nStarting with the actors column, I need to find Nigel Pargetter in the table. Scanning through the rows, I notice that in row 14 (which is actually row index 14), the actor is \"nigel pargetter.\" Wait, no, looking back, maybe it's row index 15? Let me count again.\n\nWait, no, actually, row indices start at 0. So row 0 is the first one with \"nigel pargetter\"? No, let me check each entry carefully.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 14: Actor is \"nigel pargetter,\" and he acted in \"the archers\" from 1983 to 1986 and then again from 1992 to 2011. His tenure is listed as 22 years, not 61.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says 61 years. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant \"the archer\" as a single role over many years, but looking at the table, there are only two mentions of Nigel Pargetter, both in \"the archers,\" but his total time there is indeed 22 years (1983-86 and 1992-2011).\n\nSo if the claim says he acted for 61 years, that's way off. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm looking at the right columns. The relevant cells would be where \"nigel pargetter\" is listed as an actor and in which show. So in this case, it's row index 14 (since rows start at 0), column \"actors.\"\n\nWait, actually, row indices: let me recount.\n\nLooking at the table, each entry has a row index from 0 to 35. The entry with \"nigel pargetter\" is around row 15? Wait, no, I think it's in row 14 because of the numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me check again: row indices are 0-based, so the first row is 0, second is 1, etc.\n\nLooking for \"nigel pargetter\" in the actors column:\n\nRow 14 has \"nigel pargetter\" acting in \"the archers.\" Wait no, actually, it's row 15: Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's see: starting from row 0 to row 35.\n\nIn row 14 (which is the 15th entry), the actor is \"nigel pargetter,\" and the show is \"the archers.\" His tenure is listed as 22 years. So that doesn't match the claim of 61 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Nigel Pargetter didn't act in \"the archer\" for 61 years but rather 22 years.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cell would be where his name appears.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"actors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, I know that \"the archer\" is a soap opera, so the actor would be playing a character in this show. The claim mentions Denis Folwell acting in the Archers for 38 years. That seems like a long time, but let's check the table data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: actor, character, soap opera, years, duration. Each row represents an actor's details.\n\nI'll need to find Denis Folwell in the table. Scanning through the 'actor' column, I see his name in one of the rows. Let me check which row that is. \n\nRow 34 has \"denis folwell\" as the actor. So, Denis Folwell is indeed an actor listed in the Archers. Now, let's look at his details.\n\nHis 'soap opera' is \"the archers\", which matches. Next, the 'years' column: it shows \"21 years\". That means he started in 1951 and ended in 1972, giving him a duration of 21 years.\n\nThe claim says he acted for 38 years, but according to the table, it's only 21 years. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'years' column is key here because it shows how long Denis Folwell acted in the Archers. So, row index 34 and column name \"years\" are the relevant cells.\n\nI should make sure there's no other occurrence of Denis Folwell elsewhere, but from scanning all rows, he only appears once.

Scanning through each row under the 'actor' column, I find that Denis Folwell is listed in row 36 with the actor name and also in other rows where the character might be relevant.\n\nNext, I need to check if he plays Martha Woodford. Looking at row 36, the character is \"martha woodford,\" which matches the claim. Additionally, there's another row (row 18) where Denis Folwell is listed with the same character, so it seems consistent across multiple entries.\n\nWait, but in the table, I see that Denis Folwell is associated with different characters at times, so I need to ensure he specifically plays Martha Woodford. From the data, it's clear that row 36 has \"martha woodford\" under the 'character' column for Denis Folwell. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Character\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Character\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"margot boyd play aunt laura wilson\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are actor, character, soap opera, years, duration. Each row represents an actor who has been involved in \"the archers,\" which is a soap opera. For each entry, there's the actor's name, the character they played, the soap opera title, their active years, and their duration of involvement.\n\nThe claim states that Margot Boyd plays Aunt Laura Wilson. So I need to find if there's a row where the actor is Margot Boyd and the character is Aunt Laura Wilson.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 18: [\"margot boyd\", \"marjorie antrobus\", \"the archers\", \"1984 - 2004\", \"20 years\"]\n  \nHere, the actor is Margot Boyd, but her character is Marjorie Antrobus. That doesn't match Aunt Laura Wilson.\n\nWait, let me check other rows to ensure I didn't miss anything. \n\nContinuing through:\n\n- Row 19: [\"margot boyd\", \"marjorie antrobus\", ...] \u2013 same as above.\n- Other rows seem unrelated or have different actors and characters.\n\nHmm, maybe Aunt Laura Wilson is in a different section of the table. Let me search for \"aunt laura wilson\" specifically.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 17: [\"carole boyd\", \"lynda snell\", ...] \u2013 different names.\n- Row 18: as above.\n- Wait, there's another row at index 31 (assuming rows are numbered starting from 0):\n\nRow 30: [\"margot boyd\", \"marjorie antrobus\", \"the archers\", \"1984 - 2004\", \"20 years\"]\nWait, that seems to be the same as Row 18. Perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me list out all the rows again:\n\nLooking for any row where the actor is Margot Boyd and character is Aunt Laura Wilson.\n\nWait, I don't see such a row in the table provided. The closest is Row 18 and similar, but those are about Marjorie Antrobus, not Aunt Laura.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table where Margot Boyd plays Aunt Laura Wilson. So the claim must be FALSE.\n\nAs for relevant cells, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. The columns involved would be \"actor\" and \"character.\" So, I should look at each row that has the actor as Margot Boyd and the character as Aunt Laura Wilson. Since there are none, but perhaps to confirm, I can check all rows where the actor is Margot Boyd.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Rows with \"margot boyd\" as the first entry:\n  - Row 18: [\"margot boyd\", \"marjorie antrobus\", ...]\n  - Row 19: Same as above.\n  \nSo, no row matches both the actor and character in question.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows where the actor is Margot Boyd. So, for each occurrence of \"margot boyd\" in the 'actor' column, we can check their corresponding characters to see if Aunt Laura Wilson is among them, which she isn't.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the table data, as Margot Boyd is listed with a different character.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
