    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim and see how it aligns with the data.\n\nThe claim is: \"76059 attend when the result be l 20 - 17\". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think the claim is trying to say that there was an attendance of 76059 on a week where the result was a loss with the score \"l 20 - 17\". So essentially, we're looking for a row in the table where the 'attendance' column equals 76059 and the 'result' matches \"l 20 - 17\".\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row's attendance and result. The table has data from weeks 1 to 16.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nWeek 1: Attendance is 57406, Result is \"l 27 - 0\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nWeek 2: Attendance is 62063, Result is \"w 23 - 17\" \u2192 Not a loss.\nWeek 3: Attendance is 69814, Result is \"l 20 - 7\" \u2192 Score doesn't match.\nWeek 4: Attendance is 44433, Result is \"l 21 - 14\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nWeek 5: Attendance is 64578, Result is \"l 20 - 6\" \u2192 No match.\nWeek 6: Attendance is 52728, Result is \"l 31 - 14\" \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nWeek 7: Attendance is 76059, Result is \"l 20 - 17\" \u2192 Oh, this matches! So week 7 has attendance 76059 and the result is a loss by score 20-17.\n\nWait, so that means the claim is correct because there's indeed a row where attendance is 76059 and the result is \"l 20 - 17\". Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is week 7, 'attendance' column.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other rows. Continuing:\n\nWeeks 8-16 don't have an attendance of 76059 or a loss of 20-17. So only week 7 matches both criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",
