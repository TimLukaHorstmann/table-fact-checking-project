The key elements are:\n1. The home team is Melbourne.\n2. They played on July 31, 1965.\n3.

I need to check each row to see if there's a match where Melbourne is listed as the home team on that date.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n- In row 4, the home team is Melbourne, away team is Richmond, and the date is July 31, 1965. This fits because Melbourne is playing at their home venue, Moorabbin Oval.\n- No other rows show Melbourne as the home team on that date.\n\nSince there's a match where Melbourne plays as the home team on July 31, 1965, the claim that they do not play as an away team on that specific date is TRUE.

The claim says, \"a total of 6 games have a date of 31 July 1965.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns include \"date,\" and each row has an entry under that column. My task is to count how many times the date \"31 july 1965\" appears in the data.\n\nLooking through each row:\n1. First game: date is \"31 july 1965.\"\n2. Second game: same date.\n3. Third game: same date.\n4. Fourth game: same date.\n5. Fifth game: same date.\n6. Sixth game: same date.\n\nSo, that's six instances where the date matches the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says, \"richmond have an away team score 02 point higher than fitzroy do.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"away team score\" refers to the score recorded for the away team in a match. So, the claim is comparing the scores of Richmond when they were away against Fitzroy.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The rows represent different matches.\n\nI need to find the relevant data points for Richmond as an away team and Fitzroy as a home team because the claim is about Richmond's performance when they were away. Wait, actually, the term \"away team\" in the table is the team that isn't hosting, so in the context of the match, if Richmond is the away team, their score would be under the \"away team score\" column, and Fitzroy would be the home team with their score under \"home team score.\"\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says \"Richmond have an away team score,\" which implies that Richmond was the away team, so their score is in the \"away team score\" column. Fitzroy, being the home team, would have their score in the \"home team score\" column.\n\nSo I need to find the rows where either Richmond is the away team or Fitzroy is the home team because that's how the scores are recorded. Then, compare their respective scores.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: Geelong vs North Melbourne \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 1: Essendon vs Footscray \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Carlton vs South Melbourne \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 3: St Kilda vs Richmond \u2013 here, St Kilda is home, Richmond is away. So in this row, \"away team score\" is Richmond's 14.12 (96). Fitzroy isn't involved here.\nRow 4: Melbourne vs Fitzroy \u2013 here, Melbourne is home, Fitzroy is away. So their scores are under the respective columns: Melbourne's score is 12.11 (83) as home, and Fitzroy's score is 11.15 (81) as away. But wait, the claim is about Richmond versus Fitzroy. In this row, it's Melbourne vs Fitzroy, not Richmond.\nRow 5: Hawthorn vs Collingwood \u2013 irrelevant.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake in interpreting which rows are relevant. The claim mentions \"Richmond\" and \"Fitzroy.\" So the match where both are involved is important.\n\nLooking again, in row 3, St Kilda is home against Richmond (away). So that's one match. In row 4, Melbourne is home against Fitzroy (away). That's another match.\n\nBut the claim is about Richmond having a higher score than Fitzroy as an away team. Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"Richmond have an away team score 02 point higher than fitzroy do.\" So it's comparing Richmond's away score to Fitzroy's home or away score? Let me parse that again.\n\nThe phrasing is a bit confusing. The claim could mean either:\n\n1. When Richmond was the away team, their score was 2 points higher than when Fitzroy was the away team (i.e., Fitzroy as an away team). Or,\n2. When Richmond was the away team, their score was 2 points higher than Fitzroy's home team score.\n\nBut looking at the table, in row 4, Fitzroy is the away team, with a score of 11.15 (81), and Melbourne is home with 12.11 (83). So if Richmond's away score is compared to Fitzroy's away score, that would be in different rows.\n\nWait, in row 3, Richmond is the away team, scoring 14.12 (96). In row 4, Fitzroy is the away team, scoring 11.15 (81).\n\nSo if we're comparing Richmond's away score to Fitzroy's away score, then 96 vs 81. The difference is 15 points, not 2.\n\nBut that doesn't match the claim of a 02 point higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's comparing Richmond's home team score to Fitzroy's away team score? But no, the claim specifically mentions \"Richmond have an away team score,\" so it's about Richmond as away vs Fitzroy as away or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that when Richmond was the away team, their score was 2 points higher than when Fitzroy was the home team. Let me check:\n\nIn row 3: Richmond is away, score 14.12 (96). In any row where Fitzroy is home, what's their score? Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 4: Melbourne vs Fitzroy. Fitzroy is away, so that doesn't help. Are there other rows with Fitzroy as home? Let me check all rows.\n\nLooking at all the data:\n\n- The away teams are North Melbourne, Footscray, South Melbourne, Richmond, Fitzroy, Collingwood.\n- The home teams are Geelong, Essendon, Carlton, St Kilda, Melbourne, Hawthorn.\n\nWait, in row 4: Melbourne is home, Fitzroy is away. So if we're looking for when Fitzroy is the home team, I don't see that in this table. Because in all rows where Fitzroy is listed, they are the away team except perhaps elsewhere. But in this table, only row 4 has Fitzroy as away. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the table has six matches:\n\n1. Geelong (home) vs North Melbourne (away)\n2. Essendon (home) vs Footscray (away)\n3. Carlton (home) vs South Melbourne (away)\n4. St Kilda (home) vs Richmond (away)\n5. Melbourne (home) vs Fitzroy (away)\n6. Hawthorn (home) vs Collingwood (away)\n\nSo in this table, Fitzroy is only listed as the away team once, against Melbourne.\n\nTherefore, to compare Richmond's away score to Fitzroy's home score, I need to see if there's a match where Fitzroy is home and their score is recorded. But looking through all rows, there's no row where Fitzroy is the home team. They are always the away team in this table.\n\nSo perhaps the claim refers to when Richmond was away versus when Fitzroy was also away elsewhere, but that doesn't make sense because they can't both be away at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misinterpreted. Maybe it's about the difference between Richmond's home and away scores compared to Fitzroy's, but the wording says \"Richmond have an away team score 02 point higher than fitzroy do.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that when Richmond was the away team, their score was 2 points higher than when Fitzroy was the away team. So, in row 3: Richmond (away) scored 96, and in row 4: Fitzroy (away) scored 81. The difference is 15, not 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering some other metric or perhaps a miscalculation on my part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scores are considered without the first team's name, so \"Richmond have an away team score\" refers to their home score? No, that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps it's a typo and should be \"Fitzroy have...\" instead of Richmond. But assuming it's as written.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's comparing Richmond's away score (96) to Fitzroy's away score (81), but the difference is 15 points, not 2.\n\nGiven all this, I think there might be a misunderstanding in the question. Because based on the table provided, there's no match where both Richmond and Fitzroy are the home teams or the away teams against each other. So their scores can't be directly compared as per the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the scores:\n\nRichmond (away) in row 3: 14.12 (96)\n\nFitzroy (away) in row 4: 11.15 (81)\n\nDifference: 96 - 81 = 15\n\nNot 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we're comparing points rather than goal differences or something else. But the scores are given as goals and behinds, so total points would be goals + 3*behinds.\n\nFor Richmond away in row 3: 14 goals and 12 behinds. Total points = 14 + 12*3 = 14 + 36 = 50.\n\nFitzroy away in row 4: 11 goals and 15 behinds. Points = 11 + 45 = 56.\n\nWait, that's the reverse. Wait no:\n\nWait, in Australian Rules Football, each goal is worth 6 points (Goal), and each behind is worth 1 point (behind). So total points per team is Goals*6 + Behinds*1.\n\nSo for Richmond away in row 3: 14 goals and 12 behinds. Total = 14*6 + 12*1 = 84 + 12 = 96.\n\nFitzroy away in row 4: 11 goals and 15 behinds. Total = 11*6 +15=66+15=81.\n\nSo again, Richmond's score is higher than Fitzroy's by 15 points, not 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to compare Richmond's home game against another team with Fitzroy's away game? But without that information, it's unclear.\n\nGiven all this, I think there might be a mistake in the question or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, maybe the scores are being compared differently.\n\nWait, another angle: sometimes in sports, the difference is taken as the home/away factor, but that seems unlikely here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the margin of victory when Richmond was away versus when Fitzroy was away. But again, the difference is 15 points, not 2.\n\nGiven all this, I think it's impossible to validate the claim based on the table provided because there's no match where both Richmond and Fitzroy are involved with Richmond as away and Fitzroy as home or something similar that would create a 2-point difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is mistyped, and it should be comparing another team. For example, if it were \"Richmond have an away team score 15 points higher than fitzroy,\" then it would align with what's in the table.\n\nBut as per the current wording, I can't see a way to get a 2-point difference based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided match data, there is no direct comparison possible between Richmond's away score and Fitzroy's related score that results in a two-point difference. The scores indicate a significant margin favoring Richmond when they are the away team compared to Fitzroy in their respective matches.\n\n**Answer:** There is insufficient information to confirm a 2-point difference as per the provided data.",

The claim says: \"the game play at mcg be 1 of 2 game that have a crowd size larger than 30000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to see which games were played at McG. In the data provided, the fifth row is about Melbourne playing against Fitzroy at McG with a crowd of 30381. That's over 30,000. Is there another game in the table that also had a crowd over 30,000?\n\nLooking at the other rows: \n- The first game at Kardinia Park had 19658, which is under.\n- Second game at Windy Hill had 16800, also under.\n- Third game at Princes Park was 20744, still under.\n- Fourth game at Moorabbin Oval was 34076, over 30k.\nWait, that's two games: McG with 30381 and Moorabbin Oval with 34076. \n\nSo, in the table, there are two games with crowds larger than 30000: one at McG and another at Moorabbin Oval. Therefore, the claim says \"the game play at mcg be 1 of 2 game that have a crowd size larger than 30000.\" Since there's at least one other game (Moorabbin), it's not just one but two, including McG.\n\nWait, does the claim say \"be\" or is it phrased differently? The exact wording is: \"the game play at mcg be 1 of 2 game that have a crowd size larger than 30000.\" So, it's stating that the McG game is one of two. That would be true because Moorabbin had 34k, which is over 30k.\n\nWait, but in the data, both McG and Moorabbin are above 30k, making them two games.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in front of me and a claim to check. The claim is: \"Essendon play as an away team on 31 July 1965.\" My job is to figure out if this statement is TRUE or FALSE by looking at the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. There are two main aspects here:\n1. Did Essendon play as an away team?\n2. Was the game held on 31 July 1965?\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nStarting with the first part: Is Essendon listed as an away team in any row? Let's go through each row one by one.\n\n- Row 0: Home team is \"geelong,\" so not Essendon.\n- Row 1: Away team is \"footscray,\" not Essendon.\n- Row 2: Away team is \"south melbourne,\" nope.\n- Row 3: The away team is \"richmond.\" Not Essendon yet.\n- Row 4: Here, the home team is \"melbourne,\" and the away team is \"fitzroy.\" Still no Essendon as away.\n- Row 5: Away team is \"collingwood.\" None of these are Essendon.\n\nWait, that can't be right. I thought Essendon was in the table. Let me check again. Oh, wait! The claim says Essendon play as an AWAY team. Maybe they're not listed here? But I think they might be playing against someone else.\n\nLooking back at row 1: It shows Essendon's away game? Wait, no. In row 1, the home team is \"essendon\" with a score of 13.18 (96), and the away team is \"footscray.\" So in this case, Essendon is the home team, not the away.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the claim is wrong because it says Essendon played as an away team on that date, but according to the table, they were the home team against Footscray. So maybe the claim is FALSE because Essendon wasn't playing away on 31 July 1965.\n\nWait, but let me check all the rows again to make sure I'm not missing anything. All other rows have different away teams, so if Essendon is only in row 1 as home, then yes, they weren't an away team that day.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row's away team:\n\n- Row 0: North Melbourne\n- Row 1: Footscray\n- Row 2: South Melbourne\n- Row 3: Richmond\n- Row 4: Fitzroy\n- Row 5: Collingwood\n\nNone of these are Essendon as away teams. So in the table, on that date, 31 July 1965, Essendon is only listed as a home team against Footscray.\n\nSo the claim says they played as an away team, but according to the table, they were at home. Therefore, the claim is incorrect. It should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the second part: Was the game on 31 July 1965? Let's check the date column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- All rows have \"31 july 1965\" as their date.\nSo yes, all games listed were on that date.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim need to be true for it to be TRUE. Since Essendon was a home team, not an away team, on that date, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nSo, putting this together: The relevant cells would be where Essendon's away status and the date are checked. That would involve looking at column \"away team\" in row 1 (since they are playing as home there) and the \"date\" column in all rows. But actually, since the claim is about them being away, we need to check if any row has their name in the away column.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check: In row 1, Essendon is the home team, so they aren't an away team there. So there's no row where Essendon is listed as away on that date. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says they played as an away team when in reality, they were at home.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would be looking at the \"away team\" column to see if Essendon is there, which they aren't, and also checking the date, but since all dates match, that part is fine. But since the away status doesn't match, it's a mismatch.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Essendon played as an away team on 31 July 1965. By examining the table:\n\n1. **Away Team Check**: Looking through each row's \"away team\" column, none list Essendon. They are only listed as the home team in row 1 against Footscray.\n2. **Date Check**: All games were indeed played on 31 July 1965.\n\nSince Essendon was not an away team that day, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"richmond have a higher away team score than footscray do.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Richmond and Footscray are both teams in the data. The claim is about their away team scores. So I need to find their away team scores in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" and \"away team score.\" Each row represents a different match. \n\nI'll go through each row to identify which ones involve Richmond as the home team or the away team, and similarly for Footscray.\n\nIn the first row, Geelong is the home team with 10.17 (77) points, while North Melbourne is the away team with 5.4 (34). So neither of these are Richmond or Footscray.\n\nSecond row: Essendon is home with 13.18 (96), against Footscray as away with 6.11 (47).

Here, Richmond's away score is 11.17 (83).\n\nFifth row: Melbourne is home with 12.11 (83) vs Fitzroy away with 11.15 (81). Not relevant.\n\nSixth row: Hawthorn is home with 8.12 (60) against Collingwood away with 12.22 (94). Not relevant.\n\nSo, from the table, Footscray's away score is 6.11 (47) in the second row and Richmond's away score is 11.17 (83) in the fourth row.\n\nThe claim says Richmond has a higher away team score than Footscray. Comparing their scores: 11.17 vs 6.11. Since 11.17 is greater than 6.11, the statement seems true.\n\nI should check if there's any other relevant data. The columns are correct\u2014away team and score. No need to look at home or venue details because the claim is specifically about away scores.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being where Richmond and Footscray are listed as away teams.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 of the game be play on 31 july 1965\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there's only one game played on July 31, 1965. So my task is to check each row in the table and see if any other games were played on that same date.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"date\" column seems directly relevant here. Each row has a date associated with it, so I need to look specifically at that column to verify the claim.\n\nI'll go through each entry one by one:\n\n1. **First row**: The date is \"31 july 1965.\"\n2. **Second row**: Also \"31 july 1965.\"\n3. **Third row**: Same date.\n4. **Fourth row**: Again, \"31 july 1965.\"\n5. **Fifth row**: \"31 july 1965\" as well.\n6. **Sixth row**: The date here is the same as the others.\n\nSo all six games listed in the table were played on July 31, 1965. That means there are multiple games, not just one. Therefore, the claim that \"only 1 of the game be play on 31 july 1965\" is false because there are more than one games on that date.\n\nNow, to structure this properly, I need to identify which columns and rows are relevant. The key column here is \"date.\" Each row's index can be determined as well. \n\nSo the relevant cells would be all rows where the date matches. That means every single row in the table is a potential candidate because they all share the same date.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"only 1 of the game,\" so I need to check each game listed on that date. If there are more than one games, then the claim is false. Since all six entries are on July 31, it's definitely false.\n\nI should map out which cells exactly. Each row has a date at column index 5 (since columns start from home team as 0). So in terms of JSON structure, each relevant cell would have the row_index and the column_name \"date\".\n\nIn total, all six rows are relevant because each one is on that specific date. Therefore, when checking the claim, I can see that more than one game was played on that day, making the claim false.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The answer should be FALSE, and all six cells in the \"date\" column for each row are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about a game played at Glenferrie Oval having a crowd size larger than 30,000 is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking through the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the game play at glenferrie oval have a crowd size larger than 30000.\" So, I need to find out if any of the games listed in the table were played at Glenferrie Oval with a crowd exceeding 30,000.\n\nThe table is in JSON format and has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows include various teams, their scores, the venue, crowd numbers, and the date of each game.\n\nMy first step is to identify which row corresponds to the game played at Glenferrie Oval. I'll scan through each row's \"venue\" column until I find one that matches \"glenferrie oval.\"\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. First row: venue is kardinia park.\n2. Second row: windy hill.\n3. Third row: princes park.\n4. Fourth row: moorabbin oval.\n5. Fifth row: mcg.\n6. Sixth row: glenferrie oval.\n\nSo, the sixth row (index 5) is the game at Glenferrie Oval.\n\nNext, I need to check the crowd size for this particular game. The column for crowd is the fifth one in each row. So for row index 5, what's the crowd number?\n\nLooking at row 5: [ \"hawthorn\", \"8.12 (60)\", \"collingwood\", \"12.22 (94)\", \"glenferrie oval\", 18500, \"31 july 1965\" ]\n\nThe crowd is listed as 18,500.\n\nNow, the claim says the crowd was larger than 30,000. So, I need to compare 18,500 with 30,000.\n\n18,500 is less than 30,000. Therefore, the crowd size at Glenferrie Oval for that game was not larger than 30,000; it was actually smaller.\n\nSo, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other games at Glenferrie Oval in the table. Looking back, only row 5 has \"glenferrie oval\" as the venue. All others are different venues like mcg, moorabbin oval, etc. So there's only one game here.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check would be the row where venue is glenferrie oval and the crowd column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the crowd size for the game at Glenferrie Oval was 18,500, which is less than 30,000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the away team score be 8.12 (60) at the game where the home team score be 11.15 (81)\". So, the claim is saying that there was a game where the home team scored 11.15 (81), and in the same game, the away team scored 8.12 (60). I need to check if such a game exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with \"columns\" and \"data\". The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nThe data is an array of arrays. Each sub-array represents a game with values for each column.\n\nI need to look through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Home team: geelong\n- Home score: 10.17 (77)\n- Away team: north melbourne\n- Away score: 5.4 (34)\n\nNo match here because home score is 10.17, away is 5.4.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: essendon\n- Home score:13.18 (96)\n- Away team: footscray\n- Away score:6.11 (47)\n\nNot matching.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: carlton\n- Home score:9.19 (73)\n- Away team: south melbourne\n- Away score:13.12 (90)\n\nStill not matching the claimed home and away scores.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home team: st kilda\n- Home score:14.12 (96)\n- Away team: richmond\n- Away score:11.17 (83)\n\nHere, the home team is st kilda with 14.12, which doesn't match 11.15. So no.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home team: melbourne\n- Home score:12.11 (83)\n- Away team: fitzroy\n- Away score:11.15 (81)\n\nWait, the home team here is melbourne with a score of 12.11, and away is fitzroy with 11.15. The claim says that the away team scored 8.12 (60). That's not matching.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home team: hawthorn\n- Home score:8.12 (60)\n- Away team: collingwood\n- Away score:12.22 (94)\n\nHere, the home team is hawthorn with 8.12, and the away is collingwood with 12.22. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says that in the game where the home team scored 11.15 (81), the away team scored 8.12 (60). So we're looking for a row where home team score is 11.15 and away is 8.12.\n\nLooking back at row 4: Home is melbourne with 12.11, away fitzroy with 11.15. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if any game has the home team score of 11.15 (81) and in the same row, the away team score is 8.12 (60). But from the table, looking through each row:\n\n- The only home scores are 10.17,13.18,9.19,14.12,12.11,8.12.\n\nLooking for a home team score of 11.15\u2014none of the rows have that. So there's no game where home scored 11.15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check each row's home and away scores again.\n\nRow 4: Home melbourne 12.11 vs fitzroy 11.15. So if the claim was about this row, the home is 12.11, not 11.15.\n\nSo perhaps there's no such game in the table where both conditions are met: home score 11.15 and away score 8.12.\n\nWait, but looking at row 5: Home team hawthorn scored 8.12, which matches the away score part of the claim if it were reversed. But the claim says away team scored 8.12 when home scored 11.15.\n\nSince none of the rows have a home score of 11.15, the claim must be FALSE because such a game doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there is a game where the away team scored 8.12 (60) when the home team scored 11.15 (81). By examining each row, none have the home score of 11.15 or the away score of 8.12 together.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}",
