    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the match hold on january 26 , 2006 , the result be 2 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It's a JSON with columns like goal, date, venue, score, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two specific things: the date of the match (January 26, 2006) and the result (2 - 1). So, I need to check if there's a match that happened on January 26, 2006, and whether its result was 2-1.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row in the table. Let me go through them one by one:\n\n1. First row: June 7, 2000. Not matching.\n2. Second row: November 17, 2004. No match.\n3. Third row: Same date as second but different score? Wait, no, same date, different scores? Hmm, not relevant yet.\n4. Fourth row: Again, November 17, 2004 with a different score but same competition. Not our date.\n5. Fifth row: June 8, 2005. Not January 2006.\n6. Sixth row: September 7, 2005. No match.\n7. Seventh row: October 26, 2005. Still not January 2006.\n8. Eighth row: January 26, 2006. Okay, this is the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, let's look at this specific row (row index 8). The columns are:\n\n- goal: 2\n- date: January 26, 2006\n- venue: Monster Park, San Francisco, United States\n- score: 2 - 1\n- result: 2 - 1\n- competition: friendly\n\nSo the score is \"2 - 1\" and the result is also \"2 - 1\". That matches the claim exactly. The claim states that on January 26, 2006, the match had a result of 2-1.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure there's no other row with the same date and similar score. Scanning again: only row 8 has the date as January 26, 2006. So that's the only relevant one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. The answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
