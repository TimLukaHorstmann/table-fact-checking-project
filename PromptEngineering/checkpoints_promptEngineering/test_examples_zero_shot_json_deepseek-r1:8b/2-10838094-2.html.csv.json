    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the new Trabzon stadium's capacity is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the new trabzon stadium have a capacity of 41513 people.\" So, I'm being asked if the capacity listed for the New Trabzon Stadium in the table matches 41,513.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like stadium name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. The relevant part here is the \"capacity\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nNext, I'll search through the data rows to find any entry where the stadium name is \"new trabzon stadium.\" Scanning each row:\n\n1. First row: stadium is \"timsah arena,\" so not this one.\n2. Second row: \"vodafone arena\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: \"new konya stadium\" \u2013 close, but not Trabzon.\n4. Fourth row: \"new trabzon stadium.\" Yes, here we go.\n\nNow, I need to check the capacity for this specific stadium. In the fourth data row, under the \"capacity\" column, the number is 41513. That's exactly what the claim states \u2013 41,513 people.\n\nSo, the claim matches the data accurately. Therefore, it should be TRUE. But let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed anything. Maybe there are multiple entries for New Trabzon Stadium? Let me see:\n\nLooking further down the list:\n- Row 10: \"new sakarya stadium\" \u2013 not Trabzon.\n- Other rows like \"new sivas stadium,\" \"afyonkarahisar stadi,\" etc., none mention Trabzon.\n\nSo, only one entry matches \"new trabzon stadium\" with a capacity of 41,513. The claim is fully supported by this data point.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that the New Trabzon Stadium has a capacity of 41,513 people. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by reading the claim carefully: \"the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, the claim mentions \"the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015.\" So I need to find all stadiums in the table that opened after 2015 and then determine which one has the highest capacity among them.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a stadium with details like stadium name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. The \"opening\" column should be checked for each row to see if it's after 2015. Also, I need to compare their capacities to find the largest one.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: TimSah Arena, opened in 2014 \u2192 before 2015.\n2. Row 1: Vodafone Arena, 2015 \u2192 exactly 2015, so not after.\n3. Row 2: New Konya Stadium, 2014 \u2192 before.\n4. Row 3: New Trabzon Stadium, 2016 \u2192 after 2015.\n5. Row 4: New Eski\u015fehir Stadium, 2015 \u2192 same year as the claim's cutoff, so not after.\n6. Row 5: Stadyum Samsun, 2016 \u2192 after.\n7. Row 6: New Gaziantep Stadium, 2016 \u2192 after.\n8. Row 7: New Antalya Stadium, 2016 \u2192 after.\n9. Row 8: New Sakarya Stadium, 2016 \u2192 after.\n10. Row 9: Malatya Arena, 2015 \u2192 same year, not after.\n11. Row 10: New Sivas Stadium, 2015 \u2192 same, not after.\n12. Row 11: AfyonKarahisar Stadi, 2014 \u2192 before.\n13. Row 12: BaFakfehir Stadi, 2014 \u2192 before.\n14. Row 13: Ay - Y\u0131ld\u0131z Stadium, 2014 \u2192 before.\n15. Row 14: New Sakarya Stadium, 2015 \u2192 same year, not after.\n16. Row 15: New Turgutlu Stadium, 2014 \u2192 before.\n\nSo the stadiums that opened after 2015 are rows 3 (New Trabzon), 5,6,7,8,9 (wait no, row9 is 2015). Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, actually, from the data provided, rows with opening year >2015 are:\n\n- Row 3: New Trabzon Stadium, 2016\n- Row5: Stadyum Samsun, 2016\n- Row6: New Gaziantep Stadium, 2016\n- Row7: New Antalya Stadium, 2016\n- Row8: New Sakarya Stadium, 2016\n\nWait, row9 is Malatya Arena, opened in 2015 \u2192 same as the claim's cutoff. So after 2015 would be strictly greater than 2015.\n\nSo rows 3,5,6,7,8 are the ones opened after 2015.\n\nNow, their capacities:\n\n- Row3: 41513\n- Row5: 34658\n- Row6: 33200\n- Row7: 33000\n- Row8: 28710\n\nSo among these, New Trabzon Stadium has the highest capacity of 41513. Therefore, the claim is saying that this stadium is the one with the largest capacity opening after 2015, which seems to be true based on the data.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any other stadiums opened after 2015 that might have a higher capacity. Looking through the rows again:\n\nRow3: New Trabzon \u2192 41513\nRow5: Samsun \u2192 34658\nRow6: Gaziantep \u2192 33200\nRow7: Antalya \u219233000\nRow8:Sakarya\u219228710\n\nYes, New Trabzon is indeed the highest. So the claim's statement about it being the largest capacity opening after 2015 seems accurate.\n\nHowever, I should check for any possible errors in my analysis. For example, are there any stadiums opened after 2015 with higher capacities not mentioned? From the data provided, no. The next highest is Samsun at 34658, which is less than New Trabzon's 41513.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we identified all stadiums that opened after 2015 and compared their capacities. Among these, \"New Trabzon Stadium\" has the highest capacity of 41,513, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opening\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"In Trabzon, the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000.\" Hmm, first, I should understand what this means. It seems to be talking about matches (games or events) held in Trabzon with the lowest capacity, specifically stating that this capacity is 11,000.\n\nLooking at the table structure: there are columns for stadium name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. The data has multiple rows, each representing a different stadium with their respective details.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all entries related to Trabzon. So I'll go through each row's \"city\" column and see which ones have \"trabzon.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 3: city is Trabzon, capacity is 41513\n- Row 7: stadium name is \"new sakarya stadium\", but city is Sakarya, so not relevant here.\nWait, no, row 6 is \"stadyum samsun,\" which is Samsun. Let me check each row properly.\n\nRow indices start at 0:\n- Row 3: Trabzon, club: Trabzonspor, capacity 41513\n- Any others? Let me see:\n\nRow 0: Bursa\nRow 1: Istanbul\nRow 2: Konya\nRow 3: Trabzon\nRow 4: Eski\u015fehir\nRow 5: Samsun\nRow 6: Gaziantep\nRow 7: Antalya\nRow 8: Sakarya\nRow 9: Malatya\nRow 10: Sivas\nRow 11: Afyonkarahisar\nRow 12: Istanbul (again)\nRow 13: Karab\u00fck\nRow 14: Trabzon again? Wait, row 14 is:\n[\n    \"new sakarya stadium\",\n    25000,\n    \"sakarya\",\n    \"sakaryaspor\",\n    2015\n]\nNo, that's Sakarya. Then row 15: Turgutlu.\n\nSo only Row 3 and maybe another one? Wait, looking again:\n\nRow 3 is Trabzon with capacity 41513.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me check each city:\n\n- Bursa (row 0)\n- Istanbul (rows 1, 12)\n- Konya (row2)\n- Trabzon (row3)\n- Eski\u015fehir (row4)\n- Samsun (row5)\n- Gaziantep (row6)\n- Antalya (row7)\n- Sakarya (row8)\n- Malatya (row9)\n- Sivas (row10)\n- Afyonkarahisar (row11)\n- Istanbul again (row12)\n- Karab\u00fck (row13)\n- Sakarya again (row14)\n- Turgutlu (row15)\n\nSo only Row3 is Trabzon. So the relevant row for this claim is Row3.\n\nNow, the claim says the lowest capacity match in Trabzon has 11,000 capacity. Wait, but in the table, the capacity for Trabzon is 41513. That doesn't make sense because 41k is higher than 11k. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to a specific type of match or event with lower capacity. Or maybe it's referring to multiple stadia in Trabzon? But according to the table, there's only one stadium in Trabzon: \"new trabzon stadium\" with capacity 41513.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confusing Trabzon with another city, but I need to stick to what's given.\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"In Trabzon, the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000.\" So in Trabzon, there exists a match (event) with the lowest capacity of 11,000. But according to the table, the only stadium in Trabzon has a capacity of 41,513. There's no entry for 11,000 in Trabzon.\n\nWait, is there another stadium in Trabzon? Let me check each row again:\n\nRow3: \"new trabzon stadium\", capacity 41513\n\nIs there any other entry with city Trabzon? No, the next Trabzon-related entry is Row14, but that's Sakarya.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim seems to be incorrect because in the table, Trabzon only has a stadium with 41k capacity. Therefore, there's no match in Trabzon with a capacity of 11k as stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"lowest capacity match.\" Maybe it refers to the lowest average capacity across all matches in that stadium? But the claim is about the capacity of the match, which would refer to the venue's capacity. Since the stadium's capacity is 41k, any match held there would have a capacity of at least that, unless maybe there are different events with lower capacities, but I think in sports, the stadium's capacity is the max.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to multiple stadia in Trabzon, each with varying capacities. But according to the table, only one stadium exists in Trabzon, which has a higher capacity than 11k.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there is no stadium in Trabzon listed with a capacity of 11,000.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
