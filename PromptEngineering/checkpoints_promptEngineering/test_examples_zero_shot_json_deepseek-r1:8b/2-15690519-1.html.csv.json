    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the song this time be rank 8th with 40 point.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table. The table has columns: draw, song, performer, points, and rank. So, I'm going to check each part of the claim against these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific attributes: \"rank 8th\" and \"40 point.\" So I need to find in the table a row where the rank is 8th and the points are 40. \n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Draw: 1\n- Song: gotta know right now\n- Performer: rob burke band\n- Points: 76\n- Rank: 3rd\n\nNo match here because rank isn't 8th and points aren't 40.\n\nRow 1:\n- Draw: 2\n- Song: missing you\n- Performer: dav mcnamara\n- Points: 84\n- Rank: 2nd\n\nAgain, no match. Not 8th rank and not 40 points.\n\nRow 2:\n- Draw: 3\n- Song: once again\n- Performer: william byrne & lorraine nolan\n- Points: 61\n- Rank: 5th\n\nStill no luck. Not the right rank or points.\n\nRow 3:\n- Draw: 4\n- Song: the voice\n- Performer: eimear quinn\n- Points: 105\n- Rank: 1st\n\nNope, not this one either.\n\nRow 4:\n- Draw: 5\n- Song: this time\n- Performer: marion fossett\n- Points: 40\n- Rank: 8th\n\nWait a minute, here we go. The song is \"this time,\" the performer is marion fossett, points are 40, and rank is 8th. That seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss any other row, let me check the remaining ones quickly.\n\nRow 5:\n- Draw: 6\n- Song: find my way\n- Performer: yvonne holmes\n- Points: 73\n- Rank: 4th\n\nNo match.\n\nRow 6:\n- Draw:7\n- Song: amhr\u00e1n an ronnach\n- Performer: se\u00e1n monaghan\n- Points:61\n- Rank:5th\n\nNope.\n\nRow 7:\n- Draw:8\n- Song: worlds apart\n- Performer: maurra donaghy\n- Points:50\n- Rank:7th\n\nNot matching either. So the only row that matches both \"rank 8th\" and \"40 points\" is Row 4, where the song is \"this time.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are in Row 4 at column \"rank\" and \"points.\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each row for the specified rank (8th) and points (40). Only one row matches both conditions, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"rob burke band have 76 point\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"rob burke band,\" which seems like a specific performer. Then it says they \"have 76 points.\" So I need to check if this information matches any entry in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: draw, song, performer, points, and rank. The data rows include each of these columns with corresponding values. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's a matching performer. The first row has the performer \"rob burke band\" in row 0. Let me check what their points are. In that same row, under the points column, it says 76. So that matches perfectly.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other entry with \"rob burke band.\" Looking at all the rows, only row 0 has this performer listed. Therefore, the points for \"rob burke band\" are indeed 76.\n\nSo the claim is true because the data supports it fully.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the table for any entry where the performer is \"rob burke band.\" Only one such entry exists in row 0 with 76 points. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"song this time have a rank lower than 8th\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the song \"this time\" has a rank lower than 8th. So I need to find the row where the song is \"this time\" and check its rank.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different song. The columns are draw, song, performer, points, and rank. So my focus should be on the \"song\" column and the \"rank\" column for each row.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Song is \"gotta know right now\" \u2013 not the one we're looking for.\n2. Row 1: Song is \"missing you\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: Song is \"once again\" \u2013 no.\n4. Row 3: Song is \"the voice\" \u2013 nope.\n5. Row 4: Song is \"this time\" \u2013 yes, this is the song we're checking.\n6. Row 5: Song is \"find my way\" \u2013 not relevant.\n7. Rows 6 and 7 don't have \"this time\", so they can be ignored.\n\nNow, in row 4, what's the rank? The rank column shows \"1st\". So the rank is 1st, which is definitely lower than 8th.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if there are any other instances of \"this time\" that might affect the claim. From the table, it seems like \"this time\" only appears once, in row 4. So no other rows have conflicting information.\n\nTherefore, since the rank for \"this time\" is 1st, which is lower than 8th, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe song \"this time\" has a rank of \"1st\", which is indeed lower than \"8th\". No other relevant entries exist in the table. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"performer of rob burke band have less than 75 point.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. Let's look at the columns provided: draw, song, performer, points, rank.\n\nThe performer in question is the Rob Burke Band. So I need to find the row where the 'performer' column matches \"rob burke band\". Looking at the data, that's the first row (row index 0).\n\nNow, I check the 'points' column for this row. The points are 76. The claim states less than 75, but 76 is more than 75. So the statement isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and only the relevant cell from the performer column in row 0 needs to be included.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"performer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
