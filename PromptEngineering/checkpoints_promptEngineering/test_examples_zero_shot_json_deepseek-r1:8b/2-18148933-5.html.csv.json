I need to determine whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should locate where David Frost appears in the table. Looking at the data, the second row has the player name \"david frost\". So, that's row index 1 (since rows start counting from 0).\n\nNext, I need to check the country column for this specific row to see which country is listed. Scanning through, in row 1, under the country column, it says \"south africa\".\n\nNow, the claim states that David Frost is from the United States. However, according to the table, his country is South Africa. This discrepancy means the claim isn't accurate based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because David Frost's country in the table doesn't match what the claim states.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"david frost be from united state,\" I'll check the relevant row and column in the provided table.\n\n1. **Locate David Frost in the Table**: Searching through the data, David Frost is found in the second entry (row index 1).\n2. **Check His Country**: Under the country column for this row, it's listed as \"south africa.\"\n\nSince his country isn't the United States but South Africa, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
