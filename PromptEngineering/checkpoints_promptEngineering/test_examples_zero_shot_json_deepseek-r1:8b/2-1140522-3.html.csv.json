    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the gf28a prr class be 1 of the 4 locomotive class with freight service.\" So, the claim is making two points. One, that the gf28a PRR class is one of four locomotive classes that provide freight service, and second, that it has a specific position or count among these four.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents different locomotives with various attributes. The columns include \"prr class,\" \"builders model,\" \"build date,\" \"total produced,\" \"wheel arrangement,\" \"service,\" and \"power output.\" \n\nSince the claim mentions \"gf28a prr class\" specifically, I should focus on that row in the table. Let's find where gf28a is located. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- First row: gs4\n- Second row: gf25\n- Third row: gf25a\n- Fourth row: gf28a\n- Fifth row: gf30a\n\nSo, the fourth row (row index 3) is for gf28a. Now, let's check the columns relevant to the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions \"prr class.\" In the table, this column is the first one. Looking at row 3, the value under \"prr class\" is \"gf28a,\" which matches the name in the claim. So, that's one relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"}.\n\nNext, the service. The claim states it has freight service. In the table, the service column is listed as \"service.\" Checking row 3, the service is \"freight,\" which matches. So that's another relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"service\"}.\n\nThe claim also implies there are four such locomotive classes providing freight service. To verify this, I need to check all rows where the service is \"freight.\" Let's see:\n\n- Row 0: service is \"switcher\" \u2013 doesn't count.\n- Row 1: service is \"freight\" \u2013 counts as one.\n- Row 2: service is \"freight\" \u2013 that's two.\n- Row 3: service is \"freight\" \u2013 three.\n- Row 4: service is \"freight\" \u2013 four.\n\nSo, there are indeed four locomotives with the service \"freight.\" Therefore, the claim holds true for gf28a being one of them. \n\nWait, but does the table list exactly four? Let me count again:\n\n1. gf25 (row 1)\n2. gf25a (row 2)\n3. gf28a (row 3)\n4. gf30a (row 4)\n\nYes, that's four. So all four have \"freight\" as their service.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in cells related to row 3 and column \"service.\" \n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones I identified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the gf28a PRR class has a freight service and there are four such locomotives. The relevant cells confirm this information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"service\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the gf25 prr class locomotive classification have the highest locomotive produce\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"gf25 prr class locomotive classification\" refers to a specific type of locomotive in the PRR (Pennsylvania Railroad) class. The second part, \"have the highest locomotive produce,\" seems a bit unclear. It could mean that these locomotives have the highest production numbers compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns like \"prr class,\" \"builders model,\" \"build date,\" \"total produced,\" etc. The data rows include entries for different locomotives and their specifications.\n\nI need to focus on the relevant parts of the claim. The key terms here are \"gf25\" and \"highest produce.\" From the table, I can see that there's a row where prr class is \"gf25\" with a total produced value of 59. Another row with \"gf25a\" has a total produced of 20, which is lower. So, \"gf25\" seems to have the highest production in its own row compared to other models like gf25a and gf28a.\n\nHowever, the claim mentions \"gf25 prr class locomotive classification,\" which might imply that this model's production should be higher than all others in the table. Let me check all the rows:\n\n1. gf4: 46\n2. gf25: 59\n3. gf25a:20\n4. gf28a:15\n5. gf30a:5\n\nSo, gf25 has the highest total produced among these. Therefore, the claim that \"gf25 prr class locomotive classification have the highest locomotive produce\" seems to be TRUE because in the table, it's the most produced model.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure that all other models are considered. The highest is indeed 59 by gf25. So yes, it has the highest.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"gf25 prr class locomotive classification have the highest locomotive produce.\" By examining the table, we see that under \"total produced,\" the gf25 row has the highest value of 59 compared to other models like gf4 (46), gf25a (20), gf28a (15), and gf30a (5). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the gf25a prr class record 15 more product than that of the gf30a prr class.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are \"prr class,\" \"builders model,\" \"build date,\" \"total produced,\" \"wheel arrangement,\" \"service,\" and \"power output.\" The data has several rows, each with values corresponding to these columns.\n\nThe relevant part of the claim is about two specific models: gf25a and gf30a. So I need to find their entries in the table. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 0: prr class is gs4, model is 44 ton.\n- Row 1: prr class is gf25, model is u25b.\n- Row 2: prr class is gf25a, model is u25c. So this is the gf25a record.\n- Row 3: prr class is gf28a, model is u28c.\n- Row 4: prr class is gf30a, model is u30c.\n\nSo I'm interested in rows 2 and 4 because they are the two prr classes mentioned in the claim: gf25a and gf30a.\n\nNow, looking at the \"total produced\" column. For gf25a (row 2), it's 20. For gf30a (row 4), it's 5. \n\nThe claim says that gf25a records 15 more products than gf30a. So let's subtract: 20 - 5 = 15. That seems correct numerically.\n\nWait, but I should also check if there are any other factors or possible errors. For example, are these the only relevant rows? Yes, because the claim specifically mentions gf25a and gf30a. Other prr classes like gs4, gf25, gf28a aren't part of this comparison.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other columns: build date is 1965 for both, so that's consistent. The \"service\" column also shows 'freight' for both, which doesn't affect the product count. So no discrepancies there.\n\nIs there any missing data? For example, NaNs in power output or wheel arrangement. But since those columns aren't part of the comparison, it doesn't matter here. \n\nSo based on this, gf25a produced 20 units and gf30a produced 5 units, which is a difference of 15. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as gf25a produced 15 more units than gf30a.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the gs4 prr class record a lower number of total product compare to that of the gf25 prr class.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The claim mentions two classes: gs4 PRR and gf25 PRR. Looking at the table's columns, \"prr class\" is one of them, so that's definitely relevant for both.\n\nNext, it compares the total produced by these two classes. So I need to look at the \"total produced\" column for each row where prr class is gs4 and gf25.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- The first row has prr class as \"gs4\" with a total produced of 46.\n- The second row has prr class as \"gf25\" with a total produced of 59.\n- Then, the third row is gf25a, which is a different prr class, so it doesn't apply to gf25.\n- The fourth and fifth rows are also gf25 derivatives but not gf25 itself.\n\nSo only two relevant cells: one from row 0 (gs4) in the \"prr class\" column, and another from row 1 (gf25) in the same column. \n\nNow, comparing their total produced: gs4 has 46, gf25 has 59. So 46 is less than 59, which supports the claim that gs4 has a lower number.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are both prr class in rows 0 and 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the latest PRR class locomotive be built in 1967\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions the latest PRR (Pennsylvania Railroad) class locomotive being built in 1967. So, I need to find out if there was a locomotive classified under PRR that was constructed during 1967.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"prr class\" and \"build date\". The other columns like \"total produced\", \"wheel arrangement\", etc., might not be necessary unless they affect the classification or build date.\n\nNow, I'll check each row in the table to see if it matches both conditions: being a PRR class locomotive and built in 1967.\n\n1. **First row**: prr class is gs4, build date is 1948-1950. Doesn't match.\n2. **Second row**: prr class is gf25, build date is 1965. No, not 1967.\n3. **Third row**: prr class is gf25a, build date 1965. Still not 1967.\n4. **Fourth row**: prr class is gf28a, built in 1966. Close, but not 1967.\n5. **Fifth row**: prr class is gf30a, built in 1967. This matches both conditions.\n\nSo, the fifth row's data shows that there was a PRR class locomotive (gf30a) built in 1967. However, I should verify if this is indeed the latest one. The table doesn't provide information beyond 1967, so we can assume based on the data given that 1967 is the build year for that specific locomotive.\n\nWait a minute\u2014does \"latest\" imply that there are multiple and it's the last one? The fifth row seems to be the last one built in 1967, but there might have been others after that not listed. Since the table stops at 1967, we can consider within the data provided that the latest PRR class locomotive built was in 1967.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"build date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the second highest locomotive produced be the locomotive classification gf25 prr class.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is saying that when you look at the total produced column, the second highest number corresponds to a locomotive classified as gf25 in the PRR class.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: \"prr class,\" \"builders model,\" \"build date,\" \"total produced,\" \"wheel arrangement,\" \"service,\" and \"power output.\" The data rows have entries for each of these. \n\nI think I need to focus on two main things: \n1. Which row has the second highest total produced.\n2. Whether that row's PRR class is gf25.\n\nSo first, let me list out the \"total produced\" numbers from each row:\n- First row: 46\n- Second row: 59\n- Third row: 20\n- Fourth row: 15\n- Fifth row: 5\n\nWait, no. Looking at the table again:\n\nRow 0: total produced is 46\nRow 1: 59\nRow 2: 20\nRow 3: 15\nRow 4: 5\n\nSo arranged in order from highest to lowest:\nRow 1 (59), Row 0 (46), Row 2 (20), Row 3 (15), Row 4 (5).\n\nTherefore, the second highest total produced is 46, which is in row 0. Now, I need to check what the PRR class is for row 0.\n\nLooking at \"prr class\" column:\nRow 0: \"gs4\"\nSo the PRR class is gs4, not gf25.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The claim says it should be gf25. So if the second highest total produced (46) is in row 0 with PRR class gs4, then the claim is false because it's saying it should be gf25.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe \"gf25 prr class\" refers to a different classification. Let me check all rows again.\n\nRow 1: builders model is u25b, and PRR class is gf25? No, looking at row 1's columns:\n\n- \"prr class\": it's not specified in row 1. Wait, the table shows that row 1 has \"gf25\" under \"builders model,\" but \"prr class\" for row 1 might be empty or perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait no, looking again: Each data row has seven elements corresponding to each column. So for row 1:\n- prr class: the fourth element in the array is 59 (total produced), but let me check:\n\nNo, wait the columns are in order: prr class, builders model, build date, total produced, wheel arrangement, service, power output.\n\nSo for row 1: \n- prr class: the first element is \"gf25\"\nWait no, wait each data row is an array. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: [\"gs4\", \"44 ton\", \"1948 - 1950\", 46, \"b - b\", \"switcher\", NaN]\nSo columns: prr class is \"gs4\"\n\nRow 1: [\"gf25\", \"u25b\", \"1965\", 59, \"b - b\", \"freight\", NaN] \u2192 prr class is gf25?\n\nWait no, the first element of row 1's data is \"gf25,\" which is under \"prr class.\" So PRR class for row 1 is gf25.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: [\"gf25a\", \"u25c\", \"1965\", 20, ...], so prr class is gf25a.\n\nWait no, wait the columns are:\n\nLooking back at the table's data structure, the first column is \"prr class,\" so for each row, the first element is the PRR class. So:\n\nRow 0: prr class is \"gs4\"\n\nRow 1: prr class is \"gf25\"\n\nRow 2: prr class is \"gf25a\"\n\nRow 3: prr class is \"gf28a\"\n\nRow 4: prr class is \"gf30a\"\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So each row's first element is the PRR class.\n\nSo the total produced numbers are:\n\n46 (row0), 59 (row1), 20 (row2), 15 (row3), 5 (row4).\n\nSo highest is 59 in row1, second highest is 46 in row0.\n\nNow, for row1: PRR class is gf25, and total produced is 59 (highest). The claim says \"second highest locomotive produced be the locomotive classification gf25 prr class.\"\n\nWait, so perhaps I misinterpreted. Maybe the claim is that the second highest total is classified under gf25. But in row0, the PRR class is gs4, not gf25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the builders model being gf25 and PRR class being something else. Hmm, no, the claim specifically mentions \"locomotive classification gf25 prr class.\"\n\nSo perhaps I need to see if any other rows have gf25 as their PRR class beyond row1.\n\nLooking at the table, only row1 has PRR class gf25. So the second highest total produced (46 in row0) has a different PRR class (gs4). Therefore, the claim that the second highest is classified as gf25 is false because it's actually gs4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: maybe I'm misunderstanding \"second highest locomotive produced.\" Maybe it refers to the second entry in the table. No, usually highest and second highest refer to the numerical values in the total produced column.\n\nSo yes, row1 has 59 (highest), row0 has 46 (second). The PRR class for row0 is gs4, not gf25. Therefore, the claim is false because it's saying that the second highest is gf25, which isn't the case.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the second highest total produced corresponds to a locomotive classified as gf25 in the PRR class.\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the \"total produced\" values.**\n  - Row 0: 46\n  - Row 1: 59 (highest)\n  - Row 2: 20\n  - Row 3: 15\n  - Row 4: 5\n\n- **Step 2: Determine the second highest total produced.**\n  - The second highest is 46 in row 0.\n\n- **Step 3: Check the PRR class for row 0.**\n  - PRR class for row 0 is \"gs4.\"\n\nSince the second highest total produced (46) corresponds to a PRR class of \"gs4,\" not \"gf25,\" the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions \"gf28a PRR\" as a specific locomotive class and asserts that it's the only one with freight service. So, my task is to check if there are any other entries in the table under the \"service\" column where the service type is \"freight,\" specifically looking for other classes besides \"gf28a.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are [\"prr class\", \"builders model\", \"build date\", \"total produced\", \"wheel arrangement\", \"service\", \"power output\"]. The data rows have information about different locomotive classes.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the data to find out which ones provide freight service. \n\n1. **First row**: \"gs4\" has a service type of \"switcher.\"\n2. **Second row**: \"gf25\" is for freight.\n3. **Third row**: \"gf25a\" is also for freight.\n4. **Fourth row**: \"gf28a\" is freight.\n5. **Fifth row**: \"gf30a\" is freight.\n\nWait, so the gf28a is one of several locomotive classes that offer freight service. The second and third rows (gf25 and gf25a) are both marked as freight.

The columns are:\n\n1. prr class\n2. builders model\n3. build date\n4. total produced\n5. wheel arrangement\n6. service\n7. power output\n\nThe claim mentions \"gf25a prr class\" and \"gf30a prr class.\" So, I need to find the rows where prr class is gf25a and gf30a.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- First row: prr class gs4\n- Second row: gf25\n- Third row: gf25a\n- Fourth row: gf28a\n- Fifth row: gf30a\n\nSo, the relevant rows are index 2 (gf25a) and index 4 (gf30a). The columns we need to check are \"total produced\" for these two rows.\n\nNext, I'll extract the total produced values for each of these prr classes:\n\nFor gf25a: total produced is 20.\nFor gf30a: total produced is 5.\n\nThe claim says that less than 15 products separate them. So, we subtract the smaller total from the larger one. Let's see:\n\ngf30a (5) vs gf25a (20). The difference is 20 - 5 = 15. However, the claim states \"less than 15,\" but here it's exactly 15.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the absolute difference is less than 15. But in this case, it's 15, not less than. So does that mean the condition isn't met?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to say that the total produced for gf30a is less than gf25a by 15, but since it's exactly 15, it might still be considered as \"separated\" or not? I'm a bit confused.\n\nBut the claim says \"less than 15 product separate,\" so strictly less than. Since the difference is 15, which is not less than 15, the condition isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating. Let me double-check:\n\ngf25a: total produced is 20.\ngf30a: total produced is 5.\n\nThe difference is 20 - 5 = 15. So it's exactly 15, not less than 15. Therefore, the claim that less than 15 separates them is FALSE because the actual separation is equal to 15, not less than.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE and only the relevant cells are for \"total produced\" in rows 2 and 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the gs4 prr class record the highest number of total produced out of all PRR locomotive classification.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are: prr class, builders model, build date, total produced, wheel arrangement, service, and power output. The data has rows for different locomotives.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"gs4 prr class\" having the highest total produced among all PRR locomotive classifications. So I need to check if 'gs4' is a PRR classification and compare its total produced against others in the same category.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row has \"gs4\" under prr class with 46 total produced. Then there are other rows like gf25, gf25a, etc., but their prr classes might be different. Wait, the prr class is listed as \"gf25\", \"gf25a\", etc. So 'gs4' is a PRR class, and it's in row 0.\n\nNow, I need to see if any other rows have the same prr class as gs4. From the table, all other entries under \"prr class\" are gf25, gf25a, gf28a, gf30a. So no other 'gs4' entries. Therefore, the highest total produced would be 46 for gs4 if there are no others.\n\nWait, but looking at the data, the second row is \"gf25\" with 59 total produced. But that's under prr class as gf25. Is 'gf25' considered a PRR locomotive classification? I think PRR stands for Pennsylvania Railroad, and models like u25b are their locomotives. So perhaps in this table, the prr class refers to different classifications within PRR.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. The first column is \"prr class,\" which could be a specific classification under PRR. So 'gs4' is one such class. Then, in the data, for row 0, it's gs4 with 46. Row1: gf25 with 59. So if 'gf25' is another prr class, then the total produced might be higher than gs4.\n\nSo, to confirm the claim, I need to check if gs4 has the highest total produced among all prr classes in the table. But in row0, it's 46, and row1 is 59, which is higher. Therefore, the claim would be false because gf25 (prr class gf25) has a higher total produced.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"gs4 PRR class records the highest number...\" So if there's another prr class with higher total produced, then it's false. So in this case, since row1 has 59, which is more than 46, the claim is false.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where the prr class is and the total produced. Therefore, I need to include both columns for the relevant rows.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column is 'prr class', so row0 has 'gs4' as prr class with 46 total. Row1 has 'gf25' as prr class with 59.\n\nSo the cells that matter are row0's prr class and total produced, and row1's prr class and total produced.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate whether \"the gs4 PRR class records the highest number of total produced out of all PRR locomotive classification\" is true, we compare the 'total produced' values across all entries in the table under the 'prr class'. \n\n- The 'gs4' PRR class has 46 units.\n- The 'gf25' PRR class has 59 units.\n\nSince 'gf25' exceeds 'gs4', the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total produced\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the latest PRR class locomotive be built the year before 1967\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the table. The columns are: prr class, builders model, build date, total produced, wheel arrangement, service, and power output. The data rows include different locomotives with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about the \"latest\" PRR class locomotive built before 1967. I need to figure out which row in the table corresponds to the latest PRR class locomotive built before 1967.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\n- The first row has prr class as 'gs4' with a build date of 1948-1950.\n- The second row is 'gf25' with a build year of 1965.\n- Third row: 'gf25a' built in 1965.\n- Fourth: 'gf28a' built in 1966.\n- Fifth: 'gf30a' built in 1967.\n\nWait, the fifth row's build date is 1967. The claim says \"the latest PRR class locomotive be built the year before 1967.\" So the latest one would be the most recent before 1967. That would mean it was built in 1966 or earlier.\n\nLooking at the rows, the 'gf30a' is built in 1967, which is not before 1967. The previous ones are up to 1966 ('gf28a'). So the latest one built before 1967 would be 'gf28a', built in 1966.\n\nNow, I need to check if this particular locomotive's build year aligns with the claim.\n\nThe columns relevant here are \"prr class\" and \"build date\". For 'gf28a', prr class is 'gf28a' (but wait, no\u2014looking back, the first column is \"prr class,\" so for row index 3, the prr class is 'gf28a'.) Wait, but the claim refers to PRR class. So maybe I need to see if any of the locomotives in the table have a prr class and were built before 1967.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. In railroad terminology, PRR stands for Pennsylvania Railroad. But in this context, it might refer to the \"prr class\" as per the column name. So the first column is \"prr class,\" which seems to list different classes like 'gs4', 'gf25', etc.\n\nSo, looking at each row's prr class:\n\n- Row 0: gs4\n- Row 1: gf25\n- Row 2: gf25a\n- Row 3: gf28a\n- Row 4: gf30a\n\nThe claim is about the latest PRR class (so the last one) built before 1967. The last row with a build date before 1967 would be 'gf28a' in 1966.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. For 'gf28a', check its prr class and build date.\n2. Also, confirm that it's indeed the latest one built before 1967.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row index 3 for \"prr class\" (gf28a) and \"build date\" (1966).\n\nWait, but in the table, each row is a different locomotive. So 'gf30a' is built in 1967, which doesn't count because it's not before 1967. The latest before that is 'gf28a' in 1966.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, we need to check two columns: \"prr class\" and \"build date\" for the locomotive built in 1966.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\n- Row index 3: prr class gf28a, build date 1966.\nSo that's the one.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index 3, column_name \"prr class\"\n- row_index 3, column_name \"build date\"\n\nWait, but the user's example had each relevant cell as a separate object in the list. So each relevant cell is an object with row_index and column_name.\n\nSo in this case, both columns for the same row need to be checked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the latest PRR class locomotive built before 1967. From the table, the most recent locomotive meeting this criterion is 'gf28a' built in 1966. Therefore, checking its \"prr class\" and \"build date\" verifies the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prr class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"build date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
