    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the date of vacancy when the position in the table be 10th and the manner of departure be resign be 28 february 2011.\"\n\nSo, the claim has two conditions:\n1. The position in the table is 10th.\n2. The manner of departure is 'resigned'.\n3. The date of vacancy is February 28, 2011.\n\nI need to check each condition against the table and see if there's any row that satisfies all three aspects.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: team, outgoing head coach, manner of departure, date of vacancy, position in table, incoming head coach, date of appointment.\n\nMy task is to identify rows where:\n- The position in the table is 10th.\n- The manner of departure is 'resigned'.\n- The date of vacancy matches February 28, 2011.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- Position: off - season (not 10th)\n- Manner of departure: sacked\n- Date of vacancy: 7 July 2010 (Not Feb 28, 2011)\n\nRow 1:\n- Position: 15th\n- Manner: sacked\n- Date: 14 Sept 2010\n\nRow 2:\n- Position: 14th\n- Manner: sacked\n- Date: 6 Oct 2010\n\nRow 3:\n- Position: 9th\n- Manner: resigned\n- Date: 21 Dec 2010 (Not Feb 28)\n\nRow 4:\n- Position: 16th\n- Manner: sacked\n- Date: 30 Dec 2010\n\nRow 5:\n- Position: 16th\n- Manner: sacked\n- Date: 29 Dec 2010\n\nRow 6:\n- Position: 13th\n- Manner: resigned\n- Date: 20 Feb 2011 (Close, but not 28 Feb)\n\nRow 7:\n- Position: 3rd\n- Manner: resigned\n- Date: 26 Feb 2011\n\nRow 8:\n- Position: 10th\n- Manner: resigned\n- Date: 28 Feb 2011\n\nWait, that seems to match all three conditions. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at row 8:\n\n- Team: beira - mar\n- Outgoing coach: leonardo jardim\n- Manner of departure: resigned\n- Date of vacancy: 28 Feb 2011\n- Position in table: 10th\n\nSo yes, all three conditions are met here.\n\nNow, the claim says that when the position is 10th and manner is resign, the date of vacancy is 28 Feb 2011. This seems to be true because row 8 satisfies all these aspects.\n\nI should also check if there's any other row that might satisfy this condition. Let me scan through again quickly.\n\nLooking at rows 0-8:\n\nOnly row 8 has position as 10th, manner of departure as resign, and date of vacancy as 28 Feb 2011. No other rows meet all three criteria.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position in table\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the date of vacancy be 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach be carlos azenha.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. It mentions two specific cells: one for the date of vacancy and another for the incoming head coach. My task is to find these in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns provided, they are team, outgoing head coach, manner of departure, date of vacancy, position in table, incoming head coach, and date of appointment. So I need to focus on the \"date of vacancy\" and \"incoming head coach\" columns.\n\nNow, going through each row of data:\n\nRow 0: The date of vacancy is July 7, 2010. The incoming coach is Pedro Caixinha. Doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 1: Date of vacancy September 14, 2010. Incoming coach Pedro Martins. Not matching.\n\nRow 2: December 27, 2010. Coach Rog\u00e9rio Gon\u00e7alves. No.\n\nRow 3: Academy's date is December 21, 2010. Coach Jos\u00e9 Guilherme. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 4: December 19, 2010. Coach Carlos Mozer. Not the right coach or date.\n\nRow 5: December 28, 2011. Incoming head coach Carlos Azenha. Wait, this matches both parts of the claim.\n\nRow 6: February 20, 2011. Coach Ulisses Morais. No match.\n\nRow 7: February 26, 2011. Coach Jos\u00e9 Couceiro. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8: March 28, 2011. Coach Rui Bento. Not relevant.\n\nRow 9: March 1, 2011. Coach Bruno Ribeiro. Doesn't match.\n\nSo only row 5 has the date of vacancy as December 28, 2011 and the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha. That fully supports the claim. Therefore, it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's a row where both \"date of vacancy\" is December 28, 2011 and \"incoming head coach\" is Carlos Azenha.\n\n- **Row Index**: 5\n- **Columns Checked**:\n  - \"date of vacancy\"\n  - \"incoming head coach\"\n\nThe relevant cells are found in Row 5, Columns \"date of vacancy\" and \"incoming head coach\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incoming head coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"when the team be uni\u00e3o de leiria , the date of appointment be 10 july 2010.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to be saying that for the specific team \"uni\u00e3o de leiria,\" the incoming head coach was appointed on July 10, 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: team, outgoing head coach, manner of departure, date of vacancy, position in table, incoming head coach, and date of appointment. The data rows provide specific information for each column.\n\nI need to find the row where the team is \"uni\u00e3o de leiria.\" Scanning through the 'team' column:\n\n- Row 0: uni\u00e3o de leiria\n- Row 1: mar\u00edtimo\n- Row 2: naval 1 de maio\n- Row 3: acad\u00e9mica\n- Row 4: naval 1 de maio again\n- Row 5: portimonense\n- Row 6: acad\u00e9mica again\n- Row 7: sporting\n- Row 8: beira - mar\n- Row 9: vit\u00f3ria de set\u00fabal\n\nSo, only row 0 has the team \"uni\u00e3o de leiria.\" Now, I need to check if in this row, the date of appointment is July 10, 2010.\n\nLooking at row 0's 'date of appointment' column: it's \"10 july 2010.\"\n\nThat matches exactly. So the claim seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the date of vacancy be after 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach, carlos azenha.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to data in the table. The key elements are:\n- Date of vacancy being after December 28, 2011.\n- Incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find where these conditions match.\n\nLooking at the first column (\"team\"), I see that there's a team named \"portimonense\" in one of the rows. Let me check which row that is. It's the fifth row with index 5, and the columns are:\n- Team: portimonense\n- Outgoing head coach: litos\n- Manner of departure: sacked\n- Date of vacancy: 28 december 2011\n- Position in table: 16th\n- Incoming head coach: carlos azenha\n- Date of appointment: 29 december 2010\n\nWait, the date of vacancy here is December 28, 2011, which is exactly on that day, not after it. The claim says \"after\" 28 December 2011, so this row doesn't satisfy the condition because it's not after but on that date.\n\nContinuing, I check other rows. The seventh row (index 6) has:\n- Team: sporting\n- Outgoing coach: paulo srgio\n- Manner: resigned\n- Date: 26 february 2011\n- Position: 3rd\n- Incoming: jos\u00e9 couceiro\nNot relevant.\n\nEighth row (index 7):\n- Team: beira - mar\n- Coach: leonardo jardim\n- Manner: resigned\n- Date: 28 february 2011\n- Position: 10th\n- Incoming: rui bento\nNo match.\n\nNinth row (index 8):\n- Team: vit\u00f3ria de set\u00fabal\n- Coach: manuel fernandes\n- Manner: sacked\n- Date: 1 march 2011\n- Position: 14th\n- Incoming: bruno ribeiro\nNot relevant.\n\nI've checked all rows and only the fifth row (index 5) has Carlos Azenha as the incoming coach, but its date of vacancy is exactly December 28, not after. Therefore, there's no row where both conditions are met: a date of vacancy after December 28, 2011, AND an incoming coach named Carlos Azenha.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the necessary data isn't present in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for a team, the date of vacancy is after December 28, 2011, and the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha.

No rows meet both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incoming head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
