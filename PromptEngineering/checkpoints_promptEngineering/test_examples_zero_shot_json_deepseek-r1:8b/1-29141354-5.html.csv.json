    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Jessica Ennis being a guest on Andrew and Jack's show, aired on May 4, 2012, is true based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim: \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are:\n- episode\n- first broadcast\n- andrew and jacks guest\n- jamies guests peter crouch replaced jamie redknapp as team captain for one week in series 5 , episode 2\n- scores\n\nThe data rows have information corresponding to these columns. \n\nI need to find the relevant cells that could verify this claim.\n\nStarting with the \"first broadcast\" column, since the claim mentions a specific date, May 4, 2012. Looking at the table, I'll check each row's first broadcast date.\n\nRow 0: 20 April 2012\nRow 1: 27 April 2012\nRow 2: 4 May 2012 \u2013 This matches the claim's date.\nRow 3: 11 May 2012\nRow 4: 18 May 2012\nRow 5: 25 May 2012\nRow 6: 8 June 2012\n\nSo, row 2 has the first broadcast on 4 May 2012. Therefore, the episode is \"05x03.\"\n\nNext, looking at the \"andrew and jacks guest\" column for this row. The entry is \"jessica ennis.\" That matches the claim's assertion that Jessica Ennis was the guest.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions the episode being part of Andrew and Jack's show. So, another relevant cell would be the row index (2) and the column name (\"andrew and jacks guest\").\n\nSo, the two relevant cells are:\n1. Row 2, \"first broadcast\"\n2. Row 2, \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n\nI should check if there's any other information needed. The claim doesn't mention anything about scores or other guests, so those columns aren't necessary here.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is fully supported by row 2, which has both the correct broadcast date and the correct guest.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"first broadcast\" and \"andrew and jacks guest\" columns for the corresponding episode, confirming Jessica Ennis as the guest on May 4, 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the first broadcast with jessica ennis as andrew and jack guest be before may 2012.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two things: a first broadcast where Jessica Ennis was a guest on \"Andrew and Jack\" (or Andrew and Jack's show) and that this broadcast happened before May 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are episode, first broadcast, and several others. The relevant columns here seem to be \"first broadcast\" because it directly relates to when each episode aired, and the fourth column which lists the guests, including whether Jessica Ennis was a guest on that particular episode.\n\nSo, I need to find in the table any rows where Jessica Ennis is listed as a guest for the \"Andrew and Jack\" show. Then, check if the corresponding first broadcast date was before May 2012.\n\nFrom the table's data:\n- The fifth row (index 4) has guests: \"clare balding , david walliams\" \u2013 no Jessica.\n- The sixth row (index 5) has guests: \"jimmy carr , christine bleakley\" \u2013 no Jessica.\n- The seventh row (index 6) is missing some data, but it's episode 05x08 with first broadcast on June 8, 2012. Guests are \"joe hart , john bishop\" \u2013 no Jessica.\nWait, actually, looking back, I might have missed something. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table again:\nRow 0: Georgie Thompson, guests Steven Gerrard and John Bishop \u2013 no Jessica.\nRow 1: Louise Hazel, guests Jimmy Carr, Peter Crouch, John Bishop \u2013 no Jessica.\nRow 2: Jessica Ennis is a guest in column four. So that's the third row (index 2). The first broadcast date for this episode is May 4, 2012. That's in May, which is after April but before June. But the claim says \"before May 2012.\" Wait, if it's May 4, that's technically still May, so depending on how we interpret \"before May,\" it might be a point of confusion.\n\nWait, let me clarify: If an event happened in May, does that count as being \"before May\"? No, because May has already started. So if the first broadcast was on May 4, 2012, that's within May, not before May. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states the first broadcast should be before May, but it actually happened in May.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake in assigning row indices. Let me count again:\n\nRows are:\n0: 05x01\n1: 05x02\n2: 05x03\n3: 05x04\n4: 05x05\n5: 05x06\n6: 05x08\n\nSo, the third row (index 2) is 05x03 with first broadcast on May 4, 2012. So Jessica Ennis was a guest in that episode.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 2, column \"first broadcast\" because that's when the episode aired.\n- Also, column \"andrew and jacks guest\" to confirm it's Jessica Ennis.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the first broadcast... be before May 2012.\" So if the first broadcast was on May 4, 2012, that's in May. Therefore, it's not before May. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait another thing: The fifth row (index 5) is 05x06 with guests Jimmy Carr and Christine Bleakley \u2013 no Jessica. Then, the seventh row (index 6) is 05x08 on June 8, 2012. So the only occurrence of Jessica Ennis as a guest is in index 2.\n\nSo, to check the claim, I need to verify that this episode's first broadcast was before May 2012. But it was on May 4, which is within May. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not before May.\n\nAlternatively, if \"before May\" includes May itself or not. If May is considered as part of the prior period, but usually \"before May\" would mean before the month starts, so up to April. Since this broadcast was in May, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's an episode where Jessica Ennis was a guest and whether its first broadcast occurred before May 2012.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Jessica Ennis as Guest:**\n   - Only row index 2 has Jessica Ennis listed under \"andrew and jacks guest.\"\n\n2. **Check First Broadcast Date for That Episode:**\n   - The first broadcast for 05x03 was on May 4, 2012.\n\n3. **Determine if It's Before May 2012:**\n   - Since it aired in May, it is not before May 2012.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
