    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"9 adr have a bore of mm (in) just like every other bore in the table.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"bore\" refers to a specific column in the table. Looking at the columns, there's \"name,\" \"cyl,\" \"bore,\" \"capacity,\" \"power,\" and \"weight.\" So the relevant column here is \"bore.\"\n\nThe claim states that for \"9 adr,\" the bore is in mm (in), which is consistent with every other entry in the table. I need to check if this is true.\n\nNext, I'll look at the data provided. Each row represents different engines or components with varying specs. For example:\n\n- The first row has \"9 ad\" with a bore of \"mm (in).\"\n- The second row also mentions \"mm (in)\" for the bore.\n- Similarly, other rows like \"9 adb,\" \"9 ac,\" etc., all have \"mm (in)\" specified in their bore column.\n\nSo, every entry in the \"bore\" column uses mm (in) as the unit. Therefore, \"9 adr\" also uses this measurement, matching every other bore in the table.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"bore\" column is at index 2 in each row's data. So for \"9 adr,\" it's in row 3 of the data array (since rows start from 0). Therefore, I'll note the row_index as 3 and the column_name as \"bore.\"\n\nSince all other entries also have \"mm (in)\" in their bore columns, this makes the claim TRUE.\n\nSo the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are at row 3, column \"bore.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bore\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
