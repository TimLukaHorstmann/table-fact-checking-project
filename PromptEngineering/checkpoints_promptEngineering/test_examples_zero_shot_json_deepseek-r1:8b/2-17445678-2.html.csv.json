    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the 2 round match hold in south dakota , united state , the opponent 's name be brian dunn.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into parts:\n1. There's a match that took place in South Dakota, United States.\n2. The match was in round 2 (since it says \"2 round\").\n3. The opponent's name is Brian Dunn.\n\nNow, I need to look through the table to find if there's such a record. Let me check each row for these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location.\n\nI'll go through each row and see:\n\n- Row 0: Location is South Dakota, United States. Round is 1. Opponent is Hank Weis.\n- Row 1: Mexico. Round 2. Opponent Don Ortega.\n- Row 2: Oregon. Round 2. Opponent Heath Sims.\n- Row 3: Colorado. Round 1. Opponent Carlos Condit.\n- Row 4: Colorado. Round 1. Opponent Doug Evans (NC).\n- Row 5: Illinois. Round 2. Opponent Antoine Skinner.\n- Row 6: Mexico. Round 2. Opponent Michael Buell.\n- Row 7: Colorado. Round 3. Opponent Eric Davila.\n- Row 8: Alberta, Canada. Round 3. Opponent Brad Blackburn.\n- Row 9: California. Round 3. Opponent Joe Stevenson.\n- Row 10: Colorado. Round 3. Opponent Joe Stevenson (win).\n- Row 11: South Dakota. Round 2. Opponent Brian Dunn.\n- Row 12: Louisiana. Round 2. Opponent Shonie Carter.\n- Row 13: Colorado. Round 1. Opponent Dario Valdez.\n- Row 14: United States. Round 1. Opponent Jason Mckeever.\n\nSo, looking for a match in South Dakota, round 2, opponent Brian Dunn.\n\nRow 11 has location South Dakota, round 2, and the opponent is Brian Dunn. The res is \"win\". So this matches all parts of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE, with relevant cells being row 11, columns 'opponent' and 'round'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a match in South Dakota, United States, round 2, where the opponent was Brian Dunn. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"Brian Dunn be the opponent of the match in South Dakota, United States, which have 3 rounds.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. The key points are:\n1. Brian Dunn is the opponent.\n2. The location is South Dakota, United States.\n3. The match has 3 rounds.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with various details. The columns relevant here seem to be \"opponent\", \"location\", and \"round\". \n\nI'll need to search through each row to find any matches where:\n- The opponent is Brian Dunn,\n- The location is South Dakota, United States, and\n- The round number is 3.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Hank Weis. Not Brian Dunn. Location is South Dakota. Round is 1. Doesn't match all criteria.\nRow 1: Opponent is Don Ortega. Not Brian Dunn. Location is Mexico. No match.\nRow 2: Opponent is Heath Sims. Not Brian Dunn. Location is Oregon. No match.\nRow 3: Opponent is Carlos Condit. Not Brian Dunn. Location is Colorado. Round 1. Partial, but opponent isn't correct.\nRow 4: Opponent is Doug Evans. Not Brian Dunn. NC result. Doesn't matter.\nRow 5: Opponent is Antoine Skinner. Not Brian Dunn. Win result. No match.\nRow 6: Opponent is Michael Buell. Not Brian Dunn. Mexico location. Round 2. Partial but opponent wrong.\nRow 7: Opponent is Eric Davila. Not Brian Dunn. Colorado, round 3. Partial again.\nRow 8: Opponent is Brad Blackburn. Not Brian Dunn. Alberta, Canada. No.\nRow 9: Opponent is Joe Stevenson. Not Brian Dunn. California. No.\nRow 10: Opponent is Joe Stevenson again. Still not Brian. Same location? Wait, no, South Dakota here. Let me check the details.\n\nWait, looking back at row 0: Opponent Hank Weis, location South Dakota, round 1. That's in row 0. But opponent is wrong.\n\nLooking further down, I think I missed something. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nRow 5: Win by Skinner. Round 2. No.\nRow 6: Michael Buell vs. Joe Stevenson? Maybe not relevant.\nWait, maybe row 14? Let me count again. \n\nWait, the table has rows from 0 to 19 (since there are 20 entries). Wait no, looking at the data array in the table, it's a list of 20 subarrays, each representing a fight.\n\nLooking for \"Brian Dunn\" as opponent: \n\nI think row 4 is Doug Evans vs someone. No.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the data array, the fourth entry (row 3) has opponent Carlos Condit in Colorado. Not Brian.\n\nWait, maybe row 10? Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: Opponent Hank Weis, location South Dakota, round 1.\nRow 1: Don Ortega, Mexico, round 2.\nRow 2: Heath Sims, Oregon, round 2.\nRow 3: Carlos Condit, Colorado, round 1.\nRow 4: Doug Evans, Colorado, NC.\nRow 5: Antoine Skinner, Illinois, round 2.\nRow 6: Michael Buell, Mexico, round 2.\nRow 7: Eric Davila, Colorado, round 3.\nRow 8: Brad Blackburn, Alberta, Canada, round 3.\nRow 9: Joe Stevenson, California, round 3.\nRow 10: Joe Stevenson again, but in South Dakota? Wait no, looking at row 10:\n\nWait, the 10th entry (row 10) is \"win\", opponent is Joe Stevenson, location is South Dakota. Round is 3.\n\nWait, so row 10 has:\n- Opponent: Joe Stevenson\n- Location: South Dakota\n- Round: 3\n\nBut the claim says Brian Dunn is the opponent. So this doesn't match. \n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 11: Not sure, but looking at all rows, I don't see Brian Dunn as an opponent in South Dakota with round 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row where Brian Dunn is the opponent. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each entry:\n\n- In row 4 (Doug Evans), opponent is someone else.\n- In row 10, opponent is Joe Stevenson.\n- No other entries have Brian Dunn as opponent in South Dakota with round 3.\n\nSo the claim says Brian Dunn is the opponent in a match located in South Dakota with 3 rounds. But looking through all rows, there's no such entry where Brian Dunn is the opponent, location is South Dakota, and round is 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
