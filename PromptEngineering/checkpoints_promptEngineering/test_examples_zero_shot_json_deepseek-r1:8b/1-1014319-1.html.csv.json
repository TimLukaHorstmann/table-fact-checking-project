    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim given is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me read through the claim again and see what each part means.\n\nThe claim says: \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be , rank a 7 from horwood , have a total score of 31 , and have a safe result.\" Hmm, I need to break this down into parts.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key points in the claim:\n1. Goodman gives an 8 to all songs (that be? Maybe \"be\" is a typo, perhaps meaning \"all\"? So, Goodman scores 8 for every dance/song).\n2. Horwood ranks a 7 for something\u2014maybe he gives a 7 mark.\n3. The total score is 31.\n4. The result is safe.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check each of these points against the data provided.\n\nStarting with Goodman's scores: In the \"goodman\" column, I'll look through each row. For week 1, it's 8; week 2, 8; week 3, 7; week 4,9; week5,8; week6,9; week7,9; week8,10; week10,9; week11, n/a (not applicable); week12,9. So Goodman sometimes gives 8s, but not all. For example, week2 is 8, but week3 is 7. Wait, the claim says \"all song that be\" \u2014 maybe it's saying Goodman always gives 8? But in week3, Goodman scored a 7. So that contradicts the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, Horwood ranking a 7: Looking at the \"horwood\" column. Week1 is 7; week2,7; week3,8; week4,9; etc. So sometimes he gives 7s but not all. For example, in week1 and week2 it's 7, but other weeks have higher numbers.\n\nTotal score of 31: Looking at each row, the \"total\" column has values like 31, 31, 31 for some weeks, then increases later. For example, week1 total is 31; week2 is 31; week3 is 31; week4 is 35; etc. So not all weeks have a total of 31.\n\nLastly, the result is safe: In the \"result\" column, I see entries like \"safe\", \"safe\" across multiple rows except for week11 and week12 where it's \"2nd / 4 points\" and \"second place\". So sometimes the results are not just \"safe\".\n\nSo, checking each part:\n- Goodman doesn't always give 8 (e.g., week3 is 7).\n- Horwood doesn't always rank 7 (e.g., week3 is 8).\n- Total isn't always 31 (after week4 it goes up).\n- Results aren't always safe.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because Goodman doesn't consistently give 8s, Horwood doesn't consistently rank 7, the total score isn't always 31, and results can vary beyond \"safe\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"horwood\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me read through the claim first: \"the dance tango with song hung up receive a 10 from goodman and be also rat by tonioli.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week and various columns like dance/song type, scores from different judges, total points, and results. The key here is to find if there's a row where \"tango\" with \"hung up\" gets a 10 from Goodman and a rating by Tonioli.\n\nFirst, I'll search the table for entries that mention \"tango / hung up\". Scanning through each week:\n\n- Week 11 has three different dances. The first entry is tango/hung up, which gives me hope.\n- Let's check Week 11: The third row in data under week 11 is tango/hung up. In the 'horwood' column, it says \"9\", Goodman is \"10\" and Dixon is \"10\". Tonioli is missing here; it's \"n/a\".\n- So that doesn't fully match because Tonioli isn't rated as 'safe' or anything else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"be also rat by tonioli.\" Does \"rat\" mean a negative rating? Looking at other rows where results are given, like week 2: result is safe; week 4: safe; others say second place or safe. There's no 'rat' in results column, so maybe that part isn't applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim means Tonioli gave a bad rating, but since there's no data indicating that for this dance, it doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, another angle: The claim mentions two things: Goodman gives 10 and Tonioli gives a rating. In week 11, Goodman did give 10, but Tonioli is n/a. So only one part is true. But the claim says both happen, so maybe that's why it's false.\n\nWait no, looking again at week 12 entries, for Week 12 there are three dances:\n\n- One is samba with a result of second place.\n- Another is showdance with second place.\n- The third is paso doble. No tango here.\n\nSo the only tango with hung up is in week 11, where Goodman gave 10 but Tonioli is n/a.\n\nThus, the claim says both happen, which isn't fully supported because Tonioli doesn't have a rating there. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"horwood\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"goodman\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"dixon give the score 10 to the song samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has columns like week, dance/song, horwood, goodman, dixon, tonioli, total, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions Dixon giving a score of 10 to a specific song, \"samba / young heart run free,\" and that this entry is in second place.\n\nLooking at the table data, I need to find rows where the dance/song is \"samba / young hearts run free\" because that's the song in question. Also, looking for when Dixon gives 10 points, as per the claim.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Week 1: No mention of samba.\n- Weeks 2-8: No entry with samba except week 12 and others. Wait, let me check week 12:\n    - In week 12, there are three entries for dance/song. The first is \"samba / young hearts run free.\" Let's look at that row.\n\nRow 12 has:\n\ndance/song: samba / young hearts run free\n\nhorwood:9\n\ngoodman:9\n\ndixon:10\n\ntonioli:10\n\ntotal:38\n\nresult: second place.\n\nSo, in week 12, Dixon gave a score of 10 to that song. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, does this entry (week 12) have the result as \"second place\"? Yes, it says \"second place.\"\n\nWait, but looking at the table data for week 12, there are actually three entries with dance/song:\n\n1. samba / young hearts run free\n2. showdance / i like the way (you move)\n3. paso doble / don't let me be misunderstood\n\nEach has their own horwood, goodman, dixon, etc. The first entry's result is \"second place,\" but the other two entries in week 12 also have results. Wait, no, actually, looking at row 12:\n\nIt shows three separate dances for week 12, each with their own results.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again. The table has multiple rows for week 11 and week 12.\n\nLooking at the data, after week 8 comes week 10, then week 11, which has two entries (both labeled as week 11), and then week 12 with three entries.\n\nIn week 12:\n\nFirst entry: samba / young hearts run free\nSecond entry: showdance / i like the way...\nThird entry: paso doble...\n\nEach of these is a separate dance in week 12, each with their own scores and result.\n\nSo for the first entry in week 12, Dixon scored 10, which is part of that row. The result column says \"second place,\" which would mean that out of all entries in week 12, this one is second.\n\nWait, but are there other dances in week 12? Yes, two more. So if the result for that samba entry is \"second place,\" then yes, it's correct.\n\nSo, Dixon gave 10 to that song, and it's in second place. Therefore, the claim seems true.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The claim says \"dixon give the score 10 to the song samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" So Dixon giving 10 is correct for that week 12 entry, and the result is indeed second place for that dance. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"dixon\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"goodman give the score 9 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main points: Goodman giving a score of 9 and that this leads to the dance being in second place.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where \"goodman\" is involved and where \"samba / young heart run free\" is mentioned. The columns are week, dance/song, horwood, goodman, dixon, tonioli, total, result. So, the relevant columns for this claim are 'goodman' and 'result'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries where \"samba / young heart run free\" appears under the 'dance/song' column. Scanning the data:\n\n- Row 8: dance is \"samba / young hearts run free\", so that's one occurrence.\n- Row 12 also has \"samba / young hearts run free\".\n\nSo, rows 8 and 12 are relevant.\n\nNow, checking row 8 for 'goodman': the value is 9. So Goodman gave a score of 9 to this dance in week 8.\n\nNext, looking at the result column for week 8: it's marked as \"safe\". That means the performance was considered safe but doesn't specify the placement. Wait, actually, looking again, maybe I need to check if the result is \"second place\" or not.\n\nWait, row 12 also has \"samba / young hearts run free\", so let's check that too. In week 12, the 'goodman' column shows 9 again. But what about the result? For week 12, it says \"second place\". So in week 8, the score is 9, but the result is \"safe\", not second place.\n\nThe claim states that Goodman gave a score of 9 leading to second place. However, from the table, in week 8, the samba dance got a 9 from Goodman and was marked as safe, not second place. In week 12, the same dance also received a 9 but was placed second. So there are two instances where Goodman gave 9 points.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to one specific instance. Let me check the 'result' column again for both weeks:\n\n- Week 8: result is \"safe\"\n- Week 12: result is \"second place\"\n\nSo in week 12, samba / young hearts run free received a score of 9 from Goodman and was second place. That matches part of the claim.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"which be in second place.\" So does the statement imply that because Goodman gave it a 9, it's in second place? In week 8, the 9 didn't lead to second place; it was safe. However, in week 12, the 9 did result in second place.\n\nBut the table shows that in week 12, \"goodman\" scored 9 and the result was second place. So maybe the claim is partially correct but not entirely because it's only true for week 12. The problem is whether Goodman gave a score of 9 to this dance which resulted in second place.\n\nWait, but the table has two entries for week 8 and week 12 with \"samba / young hearts run free\". So perhaps the claim is referring to one specific week, either 8 or 12.\n\nIf the claim is about week 12, then it's correct: Goodman gave 9 points and it was second place. If it's about week 8, then it's incorrect because the result was safe.\n\nBut the way the claim is phrased, it's stating that Goodman gave 9 to this dance, which (that) is in second place. It doesn't specify which week. So I need to check if there's a week where both conditions are met: Goodman gives 9 and the result is second place.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Week 8: samba / young hearts run free received 9 from Goodman, result was safe.\n- Week 12: same dance received 9 from Goodman, result was second place.\n\nSo in week 12, both conditions are met. Therefore, the claim is correct for that week. But does the table show any other weeks where this happens? It seems only week 12.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another dance with \"samba / young hearts run free\" that might have a different result. In week 8 and 12, it's the same dance. So in week 12, both Goodman gave 9 and the result was second place.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because in week 12, Goodman did give a 9 to this dance, which resulted in second place.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about any instance where Goodman gives 9 leading to second place, then it's true for week 12. However, if it's claiming that every time Goodman gives 9, it leads to second place, that might not be the case because in week 8, it was safe.\n\nBut the claim says \"goodman give the score 9 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be stating that when Goodman gives 9, then it's in second place (implying always), or that he gave 9 and it ended up in second place (for that specific instance).\n\nIf the claim is asserting that for this dance, giving a 9 leads to second place (in general), but as per the table, sometimes it's safe. So maybe the claim is incorrect because not all instances of Goodman giving 9 result in second place.\n\nBut if it's stating that in a particular week, Goodman gave 9 and the result was second place, then it's correct for week 12.\n\nI think I need to check whether the claim is making a general statement or a specific one. The way it's phrased seems like a general statement: \"you are tasked... the task is about checking if this statement is true.\"\n\nSo perhaps the statement is claiming that whenever Goodman gives 9, the dance is in second place, which isn't entirely true because in week 8, it was safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is stating that for this specific dance, giving a 9 leads to second place, but that's not accurate since in week 8, it wasn't.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct assessment is that the statement is incorrect because not all instances where Goodman gave 9 resulted in second place. However, if the claim is referring specifically to week 12, then it is true.\n\nThis ambiguity makes it tricky. To be thorough, I should check for both possibilities.\n\nBut given that the result column in week 8 was \"safe\" and week 12 was \"second place,\" the statement isn't universally true but is partially true for week 12.\n\nWait, maybe the task is to determine if the statement is factually correct based on the table. So perhaps it's not entirely correct because while Goodman did give a 9 in week 12 leading to second place, in another instance (week 8), he gave a 9 but the result was different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is asserting that for this specific dance, when Goodman gives a 9, it results in second place. But since there are multiple entries, and not all lead to second place, the statement is incorrect.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try again.\n\nThe key points:\n\n1. Does Goodman ever give a 9 to \"samba / young hearts run free\"?\n\nYes, in week 8 and 12.\n\n2. For those weeks, was the result \"second place\"?\n\n- Week 8: Safe\n\n- Week 12: Second place\n\nSo only week 12 meets both conditions. Therefore, while Goodman did give a 9 leading to second place (in week 12), he also gave a 9 without it being second place (week 8). Thus, the statement that \"goodman gives a score of 9... which be in second place\" isn't universally true; it's only true for week 12.\n\nBut perhaps the task is to determine if such a situation exists at all, not necessarily that it always happens. In that case, since week 12 has both conditions met, the statement is TRUE because there exists an instance where Goodman gave 9 and it was second place.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim implies that whenever Goodman gives 9, it's in second place, then it's FALSE because of week 8. But I think the more accurate interpretation is that the claim is stating that in at least one instance, Goodman gave a 9 leading to second place, which is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is TRUE because there exists an instance where Goodman scored 9 for \"samba / young hearts run free,\" and it resulted in second place (Week 12).\n\n**Answer:** The statement is \\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}.",

The claim is: \"1 song receive a 10 from goodman and be rated 7 by tonioli.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The user is saying that in week 1, there's a song where Goodman gave a score of 10, and Tonioli gave a score of 7.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like \"week\", \"dance / song\", \"horwood\", \"goodman\", \"dixon\", \"tonioli\", \"total\", and \"result\". The data is arranged in rows corresponding to each week. Each row represents one performance or dance style for that week.\n\nSo, I need to check the relevant columns: specifically, \"goodman\" and \"tonioli\". For week 1, looking at the first data row:\n\nweek 1:\n- dance/song: \"cha - cha - cha / ain't no mountain high enough\"\n- horwood: 7\n- goodman: 8\n- dixon: 8\n- tonioli: 8\n- total:31\n- result: n/a\n\nHmm, so in week 1, Goodman scored 8 and Tonioli also scored 8. But the claim says Goodman gave a 10 and Tonioli gave 7. Neither of these scores match. Wait, did I read that correctly? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me look again at week 1:\n\nIn week 1, the goodman column is 8, and tonioli is also 8. So neither gave a 10 nor 7 as per the claim. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another row for week 1? Looking through the data, I see that week 1 is only one row, so no other entries for that week.\n\nWait, but in the data provided, the first row after week 1 is week 2. So yes, only one entry for week 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because in week 1, neither Goodman nor Tonioli gave a 10 or 7 respectively. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the numbers.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"goodman give 8 to all song with second place result , which receive a 7 from horwood and have a total score of 31.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of this claim.\n\n1. Goodman gives 8 to songs that have a second place result.\n2. These songs receive a 7 from Horwood.\n3. The total score for these songs is 31.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"goodman\", \"horwood\", and \"total\". We need to look at rows where the \"result\" is \"second place\".\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where \"result\" is \"second place\". From the table:\n\n- Row 12: samba / young hearts run free - result is second place\n- Row 12: showdance / i like the way (you move) - result is second place\n- Row 12: paso doble / don't let me be misunderstood - result is second place\n\nWait, there are three entries for week 12. Each of these has a \"result\" of \"second place\". Now, I need to check what Goodman and Horwood scored for each of these.\n\nFor the first entry in week 12:\n- Goodman: 10\n- Horwood: 9\n- Total: 38\n\nSecond entry in week 12:\n- Goodman: 7\n- Horwood: 9\n- Total: 34\n\nThird entry in week 12:\n- Goodman: 8\n- Horwood: 8\n- Total: 35\n\nWait, the claim says \"goodman give 8 to all song with second place result\". Looking at these entries:\n\n- In the first entry of week 12, Goodman scored 10.\n- In the second entry, Goodman scored 7.\n- In the third entry, Goodman scored 8.\n\nSo not all songs with a second place result received an 8 from Goodman. Some got higher or lower scores. Therefore, the claim's statement that Goodman gives 8 to all such songs is false because there are exceptions where he didn't give 8.\n\nAdditionally, let me check if these entries indeed received a 7 from Horwood and have a total of 31.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- For week 12, the second entry shows Horwood scored 9. The first entry also has Horwood as 9, but the third entry is 8. So none of them have a 7 from Horwood. This directly contradicts part of the claim which says they receive a 7 from Horwood.\n\nMoreover, looking at the total scores:\n\n- Week 12 entries have totals of 38, 34, and 35, not 31. The claim mentions a total score of 31, but in reality, it's higher for these second place entries.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is false because Goodman doesn't give 8 to all second place songs (as seen with week 12, entries have different Goodman scores), and the Horwood scores and totals don't match either.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because not all second-place results received an 8 from Goodman, nor did they have a total of 31 or receive a 7 from Horwood.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"horwood\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}",
