    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"bosone's cardinalatial order and title be cardinal - priest of s anastasia and be elevate circa 1116.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. Let me understand its structure. The table has columns: elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, elevator. The data rows contain information about different people.\n\nI need to find the row where \"bosone\" is listed because the claim is specifically about him. Looking through the data:\n\n- The first row is kuno von urach.\n- Second row: lamberto scannabecchi .\n- Third: john of crema.\n- Fourth: guido galli.\n- Fifth: bosone.\n\nYes, bosone is in the fifth row. Now, I'll check each column for that row.\n\n1. **Elector**: bosone. The claim refers to his title, so this is relevant because it's part of his identity.\n2. **Nationality**: Italy. Not directly related to the claim, so maybe not necessary unless needed for identification, but perhaps not crucial here.\n3. **Cardinalatial order and title**: \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\". The claim mentions this exactly, so this cell is definitely relevant.\n4. **Elevated**: \"circa 1116\". The claim includes a date range (circa 1116), which matches the data here.\n5. **Elevator**: paschal ii. This column seems to list who elevated them. Since the claim doesn't mention Paschal II, maybe this isn't relevant unless it's about who did the elevating.\n\nWait, the claim says \"be elevate circa 1116.\" So the important parts are his title and the year he was elevated. \n\nLooking at the row for bosone: his cardinalatial order is correct as per the claim. The date \"circa 1116\" matches the claim's timeframe. \n\nSo, all the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 5 (since it's zero-indexed? Wait, no, in the data list, bosone is the fifth element, so row index would be 4 if starting from 0. Let me check: yes, the data array starts at 0, so bosone is index 4.\n\nWait, looking back, the rows are numbered as per their position in the data array:\n\nRow 0: kuno von urach\n\n...\n\nRow 4: bosone.\n\nSo row_index is 4.\n\nThe columns to check are \"cardinalatial order and title\" and \"elevated\".\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions two things: his cardinal title and that he was elevated around 1116. So both of these cells need to be checked.\n\nIn the table, bosone's \"cardinalatial order and title\" is \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\", which matches the claim.\n\nThe \"elevated\" column has \"circa 1116\". The claim says \"be elevate circa 1116.\" So that also matches.\n\nTherefore, all the conditions in the claim are met by the data. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the pisa elector be elevate in 1117\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The table has five columns: \"elector,\" \"nationality,\" \"cardinalatial order and title,\" \"elevated,\" and \"elevator.\" Each row in the data represents a different person with their respective information filled into these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the Pisa elector and the year 1117. I need to find if there's an entry in the table where the \"elector\" is from Pisa and the \"elevated\" column indicates that they were elevated around 1117.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the 'elector' column:** This column lists the names of the electors. I need to find any row where the \"elector\" is associated with Pisa.\n\n2. **Check the 'elevated' column for that specific year:** Once I find an elector from Pisa, I'll look at their corresponding \"elevated\" date. If it's around 1117, then the claim might be TRUE.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The first row is about Kuno von Urach, nationality Germany.\n- Second row: Lamberto Scannabecchi, nationality Fagnano.\n- Third row: John of Crema, nationality Crema.\n- Fourth row: Guido Galli, nationality Italy.\n- Fifth row: Bosone, nationality Italy.\n- Sixth row: Corrado de Sururra, nationality Rome.\n- Seventh row: Gregorio Papareschi, nationality Rome.\n- Eighth row: Pietro Pierleoni, nationality Rome.\n- Ninth row: Crisogono Malcondini, nationality Pisa.\n\nHere, in the ninth row, the \"elector\" is Crisogono Malcondini from Pisa. Now, let's check his \"elevated\" date. According to the table, it's listed as 1117.\n\nSo, this matches the claim: The Pisa elector (Crisogono Malcondini) was elevated in 1117.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: \"the cardinalatial order and title of bosone be cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" The goal is to check each part of this claim against the provided JSON table.\n\nThe table has five columns: elector, nationality, \"cardinalatial order and title,\" elevated, and elevator. I need to focus on the third column, which is \"cardinalatial order and title,\" because that's directly related to the claim.\n\nLooking at the data rows, each row corresponds to a different person. My task is to find the row where the elector is \"bosone.\" So, I'll go through each row one by one until I find the correct individual.\n\nLet me start checking each entry:\n\n1. The first entry has the name \"kuno von urach,\" nationality Germany. Not relevant.\n2. Second entry: \"lamberto scannabecchi , canreg\" from Fagnano. Also not bosone.\n3. Third row: \"john of crema.\" Still not matching.\n4. Fourth row: \"guido galli , osb\" from Italy. Nope.\n5. Fifth row: \"bosone,\" nationality Italy. Here's the name we're looking for.\n\nNow, focusing on bosone's data. The third column for this row is \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" That exactly matches the claim I need to verify.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in row 5 (since it's zero-indexed, actually row index 4) and the column is \"cardinalatial order and title.\"\n\nI think that's all.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"the elector from pisa be elevated in 1117 by urban ii (or paschal ii).\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"elector\" refers to someone who is eligible to vote in an election, but in this context, it's more likely referring to a person who held a position that allowed them to elevate someone else, like a cardinal in the Catholic Church. \n\nThe claim mentions two possible elevators: Urban II or Paschal II. Looking at the table, I see entries where people were elevated by either Urban II or Paschal II. For example, one row has \"Gregorio papareschi\" elevated around 1088 or 1116 by Urban II or Paschal II.\n\nNext, the claim specifies that this is an elector from Pisa who was elevated in 1117. So I need to look for someone from Pisa who was elevated around that time. Scanning through the table, I notice that Crisogono Malcondini is listed as coming from Pisa and being elevated in 1117. The nationality column shows \"pisa\" for his row. \n\nSo checking each relevant cell: the elector in question would be Crisogono Malcondini at row index 7. The columns we need to check are \"elector,\" \"nationality,\" \"elevated,\" and \"elevator.\" His nationality is Pisa, so that's correct. He was elevated in 1117, which matches the claim. The elevator could be either Urban II or Paschal II; according to his row, it mentions Paschal II. \n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"elector\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"elevator\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a specific individual in a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. The claim says: \"the elector bosone be from rome and receive the cardinalatial order and title of the cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" So, there are two main points here: Bosone's nationality and his cardinal title.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has five columns: elector, nationality, \"cardinalatial order and title,\" elevated, and elevator. The data rows provide information about various individuals.\n\nI'll start by locating Bosone in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. First row: Kuno von Urach\n2. Second row: Lamberto Scannabecchi\n3. Third row: John of Crema\n4. Fourth row: Guido Galli\n5. Fifth row: Bosone\n\nSo, Bosone is in the fifth row (row_index 4). Now, I need to check his nationality and cardinal title.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Nationality: Italy\n- Cardinalatial Order and Title: Cardinal - priest of S Anastasia\n\nNow, let's verify each part of the claim against these values.\n\n1. **Nationality**: The claim states that Bosone is from Rome. However, according to the table, Bosone's nationality is Italy, not Rome. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the claim.\n\n2. **Cardinal Title**: The claim mentions he received the title \"cardinal - priest of S Anastasia.\" Checking the table, this is exactly what's listed for Bosone. So this part of the claim aligns correctly.\n\nSince the nationality in the table doesn't match the claim (Italy vs. Rome), there's a contradiction here. However, the cardinal title matches perfectly.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I need to check which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones containing Bosone's nationality and his cardinal title.\n\n- For nationality: column \"nationality,\" row 4.\n- For cardinal title: column \"cardinalatial order and title,\" row 4.\n\nThus, these two cells are the ones that either support or contradict the claim. Since one part of the claim is correct (title) but another is incorrect (nationality), I need to evaluate whether the claim is fully supported or not.\n\nThe claim makes two assertions: Bosone's nationality and his cardinal title. If even one assertion is false, the overall claim should be considered FALSE. Therefore, since Bosone's nationality in the table doesn't match the claim, the entire statement isn't TRUE.\n\nHowever, I must ensure that I'm only considering the specific cells related to the claim. Since the claim mentions both nationality and title, both are relevant, but only one is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, despite one correct part, the overall claim's accuracy depends on both parts being true. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Bosone is from Rome and holds a specific cardinal title. Upon reviewing the table, while his cardinal title matches, his nationality is listed as Italy, not Rome. Thus, the claim is partially correct but fails in one aspect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"paschal ii be the elevator for the elector from cream circa 1106\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions three main things: \"paschal ii,\" \"the elevator,\" and \"the elector from cream circa 1106.\" So, I should look for these elements in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, and elevator. The data rows contain various entries. My goal is to find cells that directly relate to each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with \"paschal ii.\" I'll scan through the 'elevated' column because that's where \"paschal ii\" appears multiple times. Specifically, looking at row 0, the 'elevated' value is \"paschal ii.\" So, this is one relevant cell: row 0, column \"elevated.\"\n\nNext, the term \"the elevator.\" In the table, there's a column named 'elevator.' I'll check if any rows have \"paschal ii\" in both 'elevated' and 'elevator.' However, upon reviewing the data, it seems that each row has a unique value for 'elevator,' and only row 0 lists \"paschal ii.\" So, this might be a bit confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the term here.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"elevator\" refers to the person being elevated by Paschal II. So, looking at the 'elector' column, I need to find an elector from cream around 1106. Let's see row indices for where the nationality is \"cream.\"\n\nLooking through the data, row index 2 has the elector as \"john of crema\" with a nationality of \"crema.\" The year mentioned here is \"circa 1117,\" which is close but not exactly 1106. So, there's no exact match for an elector from cream (crema) around 1106 in the 'elector' column.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any other columns might have the term \"cream.\" The nationality of row index 2 is \"crema,\" which corresponds to cream. But the year is 1117, not 1106. So, there's no match here either.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the 'cardinalatial order and title' column, none of these entries mention \"paschal ii\" as an elector. Instead, they all list Paschal II as the one who elevated others.\n\nSo, putting it together: The claim is saying that Paschal II was the elevator for a specific elector from cream around 1106. From the table, Paschal II is indeed listed as the 'elevated' individual in row 0, and there's an elector named \"john of crema\" but from 1117, not 1106.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't have a matching row where the elector is from cream (crema) and the year is around 1106. Paschal II was elevated in 1107, as seen in row 0, so that's around 1107-1109 perhaps. The closest elector from cream is John of Crema around 1117.\n\nHence, there's no exact match for an elector from cream (crema) being elevated by Paschal II around 1106. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not fully supported as there's no matching row with the required conditions. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
