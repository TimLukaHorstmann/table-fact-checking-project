    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some data about awards, and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"the youngest winner be 8 year older than the youngest nominee.\" Hmm, I need to check if this is true based on the table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. Let's break down the claim into two main parts: the youngest winner and the youngest nominee. Each of these corresponds to specific cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like superlative, director, record set, year, and notes. The relevant column for both parts is probably \"youngest winner\" and \"youngest nominee.\" So I need to find their respective rows.\n\nIn the data section, row 4 is about the youngest winner: \"youngest winner,\" with the director being Norman Taurog, age 32 in 1930/31. Row 5 talks about the youngest nominee: John Singleton at 24 years old in 1991.\n\nWait, but the claim says the youngest winner is 8 years older than the youngest nominee. So I need to compare their ages. The youngest winner was 32 years old, and the youngest nominee was 24. Let me do the math: 32 minus 24 equals 8. That fits! So yes, the youngest winner is exactly 8 years older.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm looking at the right rows. Row 4 has \"youngest winner\" with age 32, and row 5 has \"youngest nominee\" at 24. So subtracting 24 from 32 gives 8. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by these two rows. The relevant cells are row 4 (youngest winner) and row 5 (youngest nominee). Their age values match the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe youngest winner, at 32 years old, is indeed 8 years older than the youngest nominee, who was 24 when he was nominated. Both these pieces of information are found in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"youngest winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"youngest nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"William Wyler receive more than 2 times the amount of nomination as John Ford\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's comparing the number of nominations for William Wyler and John Ford. The claim states that William received more than twice the number of nominations compared to John. So, I need to find how many nominations each had from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: superlative, director, record set, year, notes. Each row represents a different superlative category, like \"most awards,\" \"most nominations,\" etc.\n\nI'll search for both William Wyler and John Ford in the directors' column to find their respective data points.\n\nStarting with William Wyler:\n- I see one entry where the director is \"william wyler\" (lowercase). The row has \"superlative\": \"most nominations\", \"record set\": 12, year: 1965. So, he had 12 nominations in that category.\n\nNext, John Ford:\n- There's another entry with director \"john ford\". The superlative here is \"most awards,\" record set is 4, from 1952, and notes about 5 nominations leading to 4 awards.\n\nWait, the claim is about nominations, so I need to check if the number of nominations for William is more than twice that of John. \n\nJohn Ford's row mentions 5 nominations resulting in 4 awards. So, his total nominations are 5. William Wyler has 12. Is 12 more than twice 5? Twice 5 is 10, and 12 is indeed more than 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE, supported by their respective rows.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I located William Wyler's and John Ford's entries in the table. William received 12 nominations, while John had 5. Since 12 > 2\u00d75 (which is 10), the claim holds true.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record set\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim is: \"the oldest winner and the oldest nominee be both in their seventy.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: superlative, director, record set, year, notes. Each row represents a different category, like most awards, most nominations, etc.\n\nI'm focusing on two parts of the claim: \"oldest winner\" and \"oldest nominee.\" So I need to find these in the table.\n\nStarting with \"oldest winner,\" I'll scan through each row's 'superlative' column. \n\nRow 0: \"most awards\" \u2013 not related.\nRow 1: \"most nominations\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"oldest winner\" \u2013 yes, this is relevant. So the superlative here matches one part of the claim.\n\nThen, looking for \"oldest nominee.\" I go through the rows again.\n\nRow 0: Not about a nominee.\nRow 1: Still not a nominee.\nRow 3: \"oldest nominee\" \u2013 found it. This row's 'superlative' is \"oldest nominee.\"\n\nNow, checking their ages. For the oldest winner (row 2), age is 74 years old. For the oldest nominee (row 3), age is 79 years old.\n\nThe claim says both are in their seventies. Well, 74 and 79 are both indeed in the seventy range, technically. Seventy can be considered as 70-79 years old. So they both fit.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"seventy\" might imply specifically 70s without including 80s? But 79 is still part of the seventies decade if we consider it as 70-79. So yes, both are in their seventies.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both the oldest winner and nominee are indeed in their seventies.\n\nNext, I need to map which cells correspond to these. For row 2, column \"superlative\" is \"oldest winner,\" so that's one relevant cell. Row 3, column \"superlative\" is \"oldest nominee,\" making the second relevant cell.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE with those two cells mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"superlative\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"superlative\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"3 of the director have the first name john.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are superlative, director, record set, year, and notes. Each row seems to represent a different category related to awards, perhaps from something like the Oscars.\n\nI need to focus on the directors column because the claim is about directors. So I'll extract all the names listed under the \"director\" column:\n\n1. john ford\n2. william wyler\n3. clint eastwood\n4. john huston\n5. norman taurog\n6. john singleton\n\nNow, I need to check how many of these directors have the first name \"john.\" Looking at each one:\n\n- John Ford: First name is John.\n- William Wyler: Not John.\n- Clint Eastwood: Not John.\n- John Huston: First name is John.\n- Norman Taurog: Not John.\n- John Singleton: First name is John.\n\nSo, there are three directors with the first name John: John Ford, John Huston, and John Singleton. That matches the claim of 3 directors having the first name John.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm only counting first names correctly. For example, in row 4, it's \"john huston\"\u2014so the first name is indeed John. Similarly, row 6 is \"john singleton,\" so that's another John.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim. It has two main parts: \"oldest winner\" and \"most recent year list.\" I need to check if these are supported by the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are superlative, director, record set, year, and notes. The rows represent different achievements with their details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the oldest winner,\" so I should find the row where this is specified. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. First row: Most awards, John Ford, 4 awards, 1952, notes about 5 nominations.\n2. Second row: Most nominations, William Wyler, 12 nominations, 1965, notes on 3 awards.\n3. Third row: Oldest winner, Clint Eastwood, 74 years old, 2004, movie \"Million Dollar Baby.\"\n4. Fourth row: Oldest nominee, John Huston, 79 years old, 1985, about Prizzi's Honor.\n5. Fifth row: Youngest winner, Norman Taurog, 32, 1930/31, \"Skippy.\"\n6. Sixth row: Youngest nominee, John Singleton, 24, 1991, \"Boyz n the Hood.\"\n\nSo, the third row is about the oldest winner. That's relevant because it mentions the age of the winner.\n\nNext part: \"set the record in the most recent year list.\" So I need to check if that year was the most recent or if there's another row with a more recent year.\n\nLooking at the years:\n- 1952, 1965, 2004, 1985, 1930/31, 1991.\n\nThe most recent year in the table is 2004 because it's later than 1991 and others. So Clint Eastwood won in 2004, which is the latest year listed.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the oldest winner set the record in the most recent year list.\" Does that mean the oldest winner holds a record for being the oldest in the most recent year? From the table, yes, because 2004 is the most recent year and Clint Eastwood was the oldest winner in that year.\n\nAre there any other rows that might affect this? Let me check each row:\n\n- The third row's superlative is \"oldest winner,\" which directly relates to setting a record. It sets the oldest at 74 years in 2004, which is the most recent listed year.\n- Other rows don't mention anything about the most recent year.\n\nSo the claim seems to be supported by the data in row 2 (superlative: oldest winner, director: Clint Eastwood, age:74, year:2004). Therefore, it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait, does \"most recent year list\" refer to the latest year overall or within a specific category? Since the table only lists years for these achievements, and 2004 is indeed the latest, that's correct. So yes, the oldest winner (Clint Eastwood) set the record in the most recent year listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the third row of the table, which states that Clint Eastwood was the oldest winner in the year 2004, the most recent year listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"superlative\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row and column in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are superlative, director, record set, year, and notes. The data rows have information about different categories like \"youngest winner\" and \"youngest nominee.\"\n\nThe claim is comparing two specific entries: the youngest winner and the youngest nominee. So I need to find their ages from the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The row with index 5 has \"youngest nominee\" under the superlative column, and the director is john singleton. The age is 24 years old in 1991.\n2. The row with index 4 has \"youngest winner\" under the superlative column, directed by norman taurog. His age was 32 years old in 1930/31.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference in their ages. The youngest winner was 32 years old, and the youngest nominee was 24 years old. So, 32 minus 24 equals 8 years. \n\nThe claim says the youngest winner is more than 8 years older. Well, \"more than\" implies strictly greater than 8, but here it's exactly 8. So technically, it's not more than 8; it's equal to 8.\n\nWait, does \"more than\" include being exactly 8? No, because \"more than\" usually means a higher number than the one specified. So if someone is exactly 8 years older, that doesn't satisfy \"more than 8.\"\n\nBut I should double-check. The youngest winner was 32, and the youngest nominee was 24. 32 - 24 = 8. So they are 8 years apart. Since it's not more than 8, the claim would be false.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me confirm the rows again.\n\nRow index 4: youngest winner, age 32 in 1930/31.\nRow index 5: youngest nominee, age 24 in 1991.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the difference is exactly 8 years.

The claim is: \"william wyler receive less than 2 times the amount of nomination as john ford.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's comparing the number of nominations for William Wyler to that of John Ford. Specifically, it's saying whether William's nominations are less than twice John's.\n\nLooking at the table, columns include superlative, director, record set, year, and notes. The data has multiple rows, each representing different achievements or records with corresponding details.\n\nI need to find the relevant rows where both William Wyler and John Ford are mentioned. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: John Ford is mentioned as having \"most awards\" with 4 awards in 1952.\n- Row 1: William Wyler is mentioned as having \"most nominations\" with 12 nominations in 1965.\n\nSo, William Wyler's nomination count is 12, and John Ford's is 4. The claim states if 12 < 2*4 (which would be 8). Since 12 > 8, the statement isn't true.\n\nNow, checking which columns are relevant. For each director, the relevant column is \"record set,\" which shows how many nominations they had. So for William Wyler's row, it's row index 1 and the \"record set\" column.

The claim mentions two specific individuals: the oldest winner and the oldest nominee. Looking at the table's columns, these would correspond to the \"superlative\" column because each row starts with a superlative term like \"most awards,\" \"oldest winner,\" etc.\n\nSo, in the data section of the table, I need to look for rows where the first element is either \"oldest winner\" or \"oldest nominee.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"most awards\" as the superlative, so it's not relevant.\n2. The second row starts with \"most nominations,\" also not relevant.\n3. The third row starts with \"oldest winner.\" This is one of the individuals mentioned in the claim. So, I'll note this row (row index 2) and the column \"superlative.\"\n4.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the oldest winner set the age record in the third most recent year list.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. I'll need to parse this into parts to check against the table.\n\nLet's start with the key components:\n\n1. **Oldest Winner**: Looking for someone who is the oldest to win something.\n2. **Set an Age Record**: This implies that their age was notable or set a record at that time.\n3. **Third Most Recent Year List**: So, it's referring to the third year in some ordered list of years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different record. The columns are superlative, director, record set, year, and notes.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which one fits the claim.\n\n- **Row 0**: \"most awards\" \u2013 Not relevant since it's about awards, not age.\n- **Row 1**: \"most nominations\" \u2013 Again, about nominations, not age.\n- **Row 2**: \"oldest winner\" \u2013 This is directly related. The director here is Clint Eastwood, aged 74 in 2004. That seems like a strong candidate for the oldest winner setting an age record.\n- **Row 3**: \"oldest nominee\" \u2013 Not about winners but nominees, so probably not relevant to the claim.\n- **Rows 4 and 5**: These are about youngest winners and nominees, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.\n\nSo, focusing on Row 2: It mentions Clint Eastwood as the oldest winner at 74 years old in 2004. The notes say \"million dollar baby.\" This seems like a significant achievement.\n\nNow, let's check the claim again. It says \"the oldest winner set the age record in the third most recent year list.\" Wait, where is the third most recent year? Let me see the years listed:\n\nLooking at the table, the years are 1952, 1965, 2004, 1985, 1930/31, and 1991. If we order these from oldest to newest: 1930/31, 1952, 1985, 1965, 1991, 2004.\n\nThe \"most recent\" would be the latest year, which is 2004, but it's the third most recent? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me count from the oldest to newest:\n\n1930/31 (oldest), 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\n\nSo in terms of \"most recent,\" 2004 is the most recent, then 1991, 1985, etc. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2004 is later than 1991. So maybe the list is ordered differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the third most recent year would be counting backwards from the latest. Let me try:\n\nFrom oldest to newest: 1930/31 (oldest), 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\n\nSo if we're considering the \"most recent\" as the latest, then:\n\n- 3rd most recent would be 1991? Wait, no. Let me count backward starting from the latest.\n\nStarting with 2004 (most recent), then 1991, then 1985, then 1965, then 1952, then 1930/31.\n\nSo third most recent would be 1985. But in Row 2, the year is 2004, which is the most recent. Hmm, that doesn't fit because the claim says \"third most recent,\" but the age record was set in 2004, which is the most recent, not the third.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"third most recent.\" Maybe it's referring to a list where 2004 is the third most recent. Let me think about how years are often listed. If we have a list of years from earliest to latest, the third from the end would be the year before the second and first.\n\nSo if I order all the years:\n\n1930/31, 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\n\nIf I'm making a \"most recent\" list, perhaps in terms of when they occurred. So 2004 is most recent, then 1991, then 1985, etc.\n\nSo the third most recent would be 1952? No, because 1930/31 would be older than all. Wait, let's count:\n\nFrom oldest to newest: 1930/31 (1), 1952 (2), 1965 (3), 1985 (4), 1991 (5), 2004 (6).\n\nIf we're looking for the third most recent, that would be position 4 (1985). But in Row 2, the year is 2004, which is the most recent.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The claim says the oldest winner set the record in the third most recent year, but according to the table, it was set in 2004, the most recent year, not the third.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"third most recent.\" Maybe it refers to a list where they are ordered as third from the top. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that it's the third entry when sorted in descending order of recency.\n\nLet me try another approach: Let's consider all the years given and see if 2004 is indeed the third most recent. The years listed are:\n\n1952, 1965, 2004, 1985, 1930/31, 1991.\n\nIf we arrange them in chronological order:\n\n1930/31, 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\n\nNow, the most recent is 2004 (6th), then 1991 (5th), then 1985 (4th), then 1965 (3rd), 1952 (2nd), and 1930/31 (1st).\n\nIf \"third most recent\" refers to being third from the end, that would be 1965. But in Row 2, the year is 2004, which is the most recent.\n\nSo this doesn't align with the claim. Therefore, either my understanding is off or perhaps the table is structured differently.\n\nWait, maybe the \"year\" refers to when the record was set relative to other records. For example, if there are multiple age records, and 2004 was the third most recent year in which a record was set.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has its own year:\n\nRow 0: 1952\nRow 1: 1965\nRow 2: 2004\nRow 3: 1985\nRow 4: 1930/31\nRow 5: 1991\n\nSo arranging these years from oldest to newest:\n\n1930/31, 1952, 1985, 1965, 1991, 2004.\n\nNow, if we consider the \"most recent\" as the latest year (2004), then the third most recent would be 1991? Wait, no. Because after 2004 comes 1991, but that's not correct chronologically. 1991 is before 2004.\n\nWait, perhaps I should arrange them in order of when they occurred, with 2004 being first (most recent), then 1991, then 1985, then 1965, then 1952, then 1930/31.\n\nSo the third most recent would be 1985. But Row 2 is in 2004, which is the most recent. So again, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe \"third most recent\" is a term used differently here. Alternatively, maybe the table has only six entries, so third from the end would be 1965 (since counting from 2004 as first: 2004, 1991, 1985, 1965, 1952, 1930/31). So 1965 is fourth, not third.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different angle. The claim says the age record was set in the third most recent year. The table shows that Row 2 (oldest person) had their record in 2004, which is the most recent year. So it can't be the third most recent.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n1. The understanding of \"third most recent\" is incorrect, or\n2. The claim is wrong because the age record was set in the most recent year, not the third.\n\nBut given that the user's task is to confirm if the statement is correct based on the data provided, perhaps I need to see if 2004 is indeed the third most recent when considering all the years in the table.\n\nWait, another way: If we list all the years and number them from most to least recent:\n\n1. 2004\n2. 1991\n3. 1985\n4. 1965\n5. 1952\n6. 1930/31\n\nSo third most recent is 1985, but the age record was set in 2004, which is first. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"third most recent\" refers to counting from the end of the list when sorted differently. For example, if we order them as:\n\n2004, 1991, 1985, 1965, 1952, 1930/31\n\nThen third from the start would be 1985, but again, the age record was set in 2004.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps it's not about chronological order but about being third when ordered by some other criteria, like how many people set records in each year. But with only one row per year, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that 2004 is the third most recent because there are three people whose age records were set after 1930/31 or something. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps I should conclude that either:\n\n- The claim is incorrect because the age record was set in the most recent year (2004), not the third most recent.\n- Or maybe \"third most recent\" refers to a different ordering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error in their statement, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe \"third most recent\" is relative to when the data was collected. For example, if this task was done in 2023, then 2004 would be 19 years ago, 1991 32 years ago, 1985 38 years ago, etc. So third most recent would be 1991 (32 years ago), but again, that doesn't align with the data.\n\nI think I've exhausted my approaches here. Based on the table, Row 2 has the age record set in 2004, which is the most recent year among all the entries. Therefore, if the claim says it's the third most recent, it's incorrect because it's actually the first (most recent). Unless there's a misunderstanding in how \"third most recent\" is defined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscounted the ordering of years. Let me try again:\n\nYears: 1930/31, 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\n\nIf we list them from oldest to newest, their positions are 1 to 6 respectively. The third most recent would be position 4 (1985), as it's the fourth entry when counting from 1930/31 as the first.\n\nBut again, Row 2 is in 2004, which is position 6. So it doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is incorrect because the age record was set in the most recent year (2004), not the third most recent.\n</think>\n\nThe statement provided is not accurate based on the given data. The age record mentioned in the table was set in the year 2004, which is the most recent among all the listed years (1930/31, 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, and 2004). Therefore, the claim that it was set in the \"third most recent\" year is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The age record was set in the most recent year, not the third most recent.",
