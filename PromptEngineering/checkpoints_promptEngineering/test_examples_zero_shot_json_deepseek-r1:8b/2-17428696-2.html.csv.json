    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim made by the user is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Brian Peterson lose in 3 round, with a time of 1:51.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see where Brian Peterson is mentioned. Let me go through each fight one by one.\n\nLooking at row 0: It mentions Daniel Garlets winning, not Brian Peterson, so that's not relevant.\n\nRow 1: This is about Brian Peterson. The result here says he won against Daniel Garlets with a KO in the third round at 1:51. Wait, but the claim says he lost. That\u2019s conflicting.\n\nHmm, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. In row 35, which is the last one, it's Brian Peterson vs. Daniel Garlets. The result is \"KO\" and the time is 1:51. So according to this, Brian won, not lost. But the claim says he lost, so that would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing rows. Let me count them again. The table has entries from row 0 to row 35. Row 35 is Brian Peterson's win against Daniel Garlets. So yes, he won in round 3 at 1:51. Therefore, the claim that he lost is incorrect.\n\nAlso, looking back, I don't see any other entry where Brian loses. The claim points to a loss, but all evidence shows he wins. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Brian Peterson lost in round 3 at 1:51, but according to the table, he won in that fight.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"Time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check whether the claim is true based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"1:51 be the time of the event that goes 3 rounds and have a record of 2 - 0.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n- Time: 1:51\n- Event duration: 3 rounds\n- Record: 2 - 0\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight event with several columns like fighter name, opponent, record, time, rounds, and event details.\n\nI need to find an entry where:\n1. The time of the event is exactly 1:51.\n2. The event went on for 3 rounds.\n3. The fighter's record before this fight was 2 - 0.\n\nLet me go through each row to check these conditions.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Time is not specified, so probably not. Also, record isn't 2-0 yet.\nRow 1: Time missing; can't be 1:51. Record not 2-0.\nRow 2: Time and rounds not given. Record isn't 2-0.\nRow 3: Time 1:00, so no.\nRow 4: Time 1:51? Let me check. Yes, time is 1:51 here. Now, looking at the record column. The fighter's previous record was 10 - 2 before this fight. So not 2-0. Also, how many rounds did it go? It says \"3 round\" (probably a typo for rounds). But wait, in row 4, the time is 1:51, which matches, but the record isn't 2-0. So maybe this isn't the one.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 5: Time is 5 - 2; not 1:51.\nRow 6: Time is n/a? No.\nRow 7: Time is 1:38; nope.\nRow 8: Time 0:22; nope.\nRow 9: Time 2:39; nope.\nRow10: Time 5:00; nope.\nRow11: Time 0:43; nope.\nRow12: Time 5:00; nope.\nRow13: Time 1:51? Yes, here as well. Check the record: before this fight, it was 2 - 1. So not 2-0.\nRow14: Time n/a; no.\nRow15: Time 1:51 again? Let me check. Wait, row 4 and row13 both have time 1:51. Row15 is a different fighter with time n/a.\nWait, actually row13's time is 1:51 as well. So checking that row:\n\nTime: 1:51\nRounds: 3 (as per the claim)\nRecord before fight: 2 - 1\nSo, not 2-0.\n\nRow16: Time 5:00; nope.\nRow17: Time n/a; no.\nRow18: Time 1:38; nope.\nRow19: Time 0:22; nope.\nRow20: Time 2:36; nope.\nRow21: Time 5:00; nope.\nRow22: Time n/a; nope.\nRow23: Time 3:51? Wait, in the data provided, I think it's actually row4 where time is 1:51. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row4 (index 4): Time is 1:00\n- Row13 (index13): Time is 1:51\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Wait, let me re-examine the data structure.\n\nThe user provided a list of events, each with various details. Let me count from top:\n\nRow0: Daniel Garlets vs Daniel Woychik - time n/a\nRow1: Brian Peterson vs Steve Hecht - no time?\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look at the data as provided.\n\nLooking back, in the table, each row has columns like Fighter1, Opponent, Record, Time, Rounds, Event.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIn Row4 (if starting from 0), which would be index3: Steve Hecht vs Dave Huckaba - time 1:51? Or perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe the relevant rows are those where Time is 1:51, Record is 2-0, and Rounds=3.\n\nLooking for such a row:\n\nI see that in the table, there's a fighter named Brian Peterson with a win at 1:51 (Row15, index15). His record before was 2 - 1. So not 2-0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking for Time=1:51, Rounds=3, Record=2-0.\n\nI think the only time I see 1:51 is in rows where the fighter's record isn't 2-0. For example, in Row4 (index4), the fighter was Steve Hecht with a record of 10 - 2 before fighting Brian Peterson, and the time was 1:00. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a row where:\n\nFighter: Brian Peterson\n\nOpponent: ?\n\nRecord: 2-0\n\nTime: 1:51\n\nRounds:3\n\nEvent: UFC 13 or something?\n\nWait, looking through the table, in Row4 (index4), fighter is Steve Hecht vs Dave Huckaba.\n\nSteve Hecht's record before was 10 - 2. So not 2-0.\n\nRow13 (index13): Brian Peterson vs ??? Time=1:51? Let me check:\n\nYes, row13: Brian Peterson vs unknown opponent. His record before was 11 - 4. So no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no such event in the table where a fighter with a 2-0 record fought for 3 rounds ending at 1:51.\n\nSo based on that, the claim is false because none of the events match all three criteria: time=1:51, 3 rounds, and record=2-0 before the fight.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided data. There is no event in the table where a fighter with a 2-0 record fought for 3 rounds ending at exactly 1:51.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Criteria**: The claim requires an event where:\n   - Time is exactly 1:51.\n   - The fight lasted 3 rounds.\n   - The fighter's record before the match was 2-0.\n\n2. **Search for Matching Entries**:\n   - Scanning each row for a time of 1:51, only one entry meets this criterion (Brian Peterson vs. Dave Huckaba at 1:51).\n   - However, Brian Peterson's record before the fight was 11 - 4, not 2-0.\n   - Additionally, the claim specifies 3 rounds, but the event in question may not have lasted that long.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: None of the events meet all three criteria simultaneously, thus the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Each row where Time is 1:51 (e.g., Row4 and Row13) as these are potential candidates.\n- The \"Record\" column in these rows to check for a 2-0 standing before the fight.",
