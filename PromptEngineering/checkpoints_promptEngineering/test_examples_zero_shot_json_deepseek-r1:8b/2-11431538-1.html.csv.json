    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tail code ed have call sign paula 01\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that there exists a row in the table where the \"tail code\" is 'ed' and the corresponding \"call sign\" is 'paula 01'. So I need to check if such an entry exists in the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: date, pilot, weapon systems officer, aircraft, tail code, call sign, kill. The data rows have these seven fields for each entry. \n\nI should go through each row one by one and see if any of them match both 'tail code ed' and 'call sign paula 01'.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- date: may 10\n- pilot: capt richard s ritchie\n- weapon systems officer: capt charles b debellevue\n- aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 7463\n- tail code: oy\n- call sign: oyster 03\n- kill: mig - 21\n\nSo, tail code is 'oy', not 'ed'. So this row doesn't match.\n\nSecond row:\n- date: july 8\n- pilot: capt rs ritchie\n- weapon systems officer: capt cb debellevue\n- aircraft: f - 4e 67 - 0362\n- tail code: ed\n- call sign: paula 01\n- kill: mig - 21\n\nWait, here I see the tail code is 'ed' and the call sign is 'paula 01'. That seems to match exactly what the claim is saying. So this row would support the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows just in case there's another one or to confirm it's unique.\n\nThird row:\n- date: august 28\n- pilot: capt rs ritchie\n- weapon systems officer: capt cb debellevue\n- aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 7463\n- tail code: oy\n- call sign: buick 01\n- kill: mig - 21\n\nTail code is 'oy', not 'ed'. Call sign is 'buick 01', which isn't the same as 'paula 01'. So no match here.\n\nFourth row:\n- date: september 9\n- pilot: capt john a madden , jr\n- weapon systems officer: capt cb debellevue\n- aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 0267\n- tail code: oy\n- call sign: olds 01\n- kill: mig - 19\n\nTail code is 'oy', and the call sign is 'olds 01'. Not matching.\n\nFifth row:\n- date: september 9\n- pilot: capt ja madden , jr\n- weapon systems officer: capt cb debellevue\n- aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 0267\n- tail code: oy\n- call sign: olds 01\n- kill: mig - 19\n\nSame as the fourth row. Tail code is 'oy', so no match.\n\nSo, out of all five rows, only the second one has both tail code 'ed' and call sign 'paula 01'. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's at least one entry that satisfies these conditions.\n\nNow, to determine which cells are relevant. The claim checks the \"tail code\" column and the \"call sign\" column for a specific value in each row. So, I need to find the cell where tail code is 'ed' and call sign is 'paula 01'. \n\nLooking at the table again, that's row index 1 (since arrays are zero-indexed). Specifically:\n- In row 1, the \"tail code\" is in column 4.\n- The \"call sign\" is in column 6.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row_index 1 for both columns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant_cells pointing to row 1, columns \"tail code\" and \"call sign\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tail code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim says: \"captain charles b debellevue be the weapon system officer assign to aircraft f - 4d 66 - 7463\". So, the claim has two main parts. One is the name of the individual, and the other is the specific aircraft they're assigned to as a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO).\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: date, pilot, weapon systems officer, aircraft, tail code, call sign, kill. Each row represents a different incident or event.\n\nI need to check each relevant cell in the table to verify if the claim holds true. The first thing is to identify which rows and columns are related to the claim.\n\nStarting with the name: \"captain charles b debellevue\". I'll look for this name in the 'weapon systems officer' column across all rows.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Weapon Systems Officer is \"capt charles b debellevue\" \u2013 that's a match.\n- Row 1: Weapon Systems Officer is \"capt cb debellevue\". Hmm, same last name but first name isn't explicitly stated. The claim refers to \"charles b\", so this might not be a direct match unless it's assumed that CB stands for Charles B. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's a given.\n- Row 2: Same as row 1, so probably the same individual.\n- Rows 3 and 4: Weapon Systems Officer is \"capt cb debellevue\" again.\n\nWait, in row 0, it's \"capt charles b debellevue\", which includes the first name. In rows 1,2,3,4, it's just \"capt cb debellevue\". So maybe the full name isn't always present. The claim specifies \"charles b debellevue\", so only row 0 has that exact name.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim is about the aircraft: \"f - 4d 66 - 7463\". I need to check if this specific aircraft is assigned to him as WSO in any row.\n\nLooking at the 'aircraft' column:\n\n- Row 0: f - 4d 66 - 7463 \u2013 yes, that's a match.\n- Other rows have different aircraft numbers or are for other pilots.\n\nSo, in row 0, he is assigned to that specific aircraft as WSO. That supports the claim.\n\nHowever, in rows 1,2,3,4: He's still the WSO but assigned to different aircraft. So, does the claim say that he \"is\" the WSO for that specific aircraft on any particular date? The table shows multiple instances where he is WSO for various aircraft, so if the claim is about whether he has ever been assigned there, then yes, row 0 supports it.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify a date. It just states his assignment. So as long as there's at least one instance in the table where he is assigned to that aircraft as WSO, the claim holds.\n\nSo, checking the 'weapon systems officer' column and the 'aircraft' column:\n\n- In row 0, both match: \"capt charles b debellevue\" and \"f - 4d 66 - 7463\".\n- Other rows either have different aircraft or same WSO with different aircraft.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by at least one row in the table. Therefore, it should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Captain Charles B. DeBellevue was assigned as the Weapon Systems Officer to the specific aircraft F - 4D 66 - 7463 on May 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"belong to weapon system officer capt charles b debellevue , oyster 03 be the call sign that have a tail code of oy\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts and check each part against the table.\n\n1. **Weapon System Officer Capt Charles B DeBellevue**: Looking at the table, under \"weapon systems officer\" column, I see names like \"capt charles b debellevue\", \"capt cb debellevue\", etc. So, yes, he is a weapon system officer in the table.\n\n2. **Oyster 03 as call sign with tail code oy**: The table has a \"call sign\" column and \"tail code\" column. In row index 0, the call sign is \"oyster 03\" and the tail code is \"oy\". So that part matches too.\n\nNow, looking for cells relevant to the claim: \n\n- For \"weapon systems officer\", check each row where \"capt charles b debellevue\" appears.\n  - In rows 0 and 2, it's listed as \"capt charles b debellevue\".\n  - So row indices 0 and 2 are relevant for this part.\n\n- For the call sign \"oyster 03\" and tail code \"oy\":\n  - This occurs in row 0 only.\n  \nSo the relevant cells are where \"weapon systems officer\" is Capt Charles B DeBellevue (rows 0,2) and the specific call sign and tail code in row 0.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"oyster 03 be the call sign that have a tail code of ed that belong to weapon system officer capt charles b debellevue on july 8.\"\n\nBreaking this down, the key elements are:\n- Call sign: oyster 03\n- Tail code: ed\n- Weapon systems officer: capt charles b debellevue\n- Date: july 8\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific date and has several columns: date, pilot, weapon systems officer, aircraft, tail code, call sign, kill.\n\nSo I need to check if there's any row that matches all these criteria on July 8th. Let me look through each row in the data.\n\nFirst, let's list out the rows with their dates:\n- Row 0: may 10\n- Row 1: july 8\n- Row 2: august 28\n- Row 3: september 9\n- Row 4: september 9\n\nThe claim is about July 8, so I'm focusing on row 1.\n\nRow 1:\n- date: july 8\n- pilot: capt rs ritchie\n- weapon systems officer: capt cb debellevue\n- aircraft: f - 4e 67 - 0362\n- tail code: ed\n- call sign: paula 01\n- kill: mig - 21\n\nWait, the claim says the call sign is oyster 03.

From the table, only row 1 has July 8 as the date. So the tail code is ed in that row, and the call sign is paula 01.\n\nTherefore, oyster 03 isn't the call sign on July 8th for capt charles b debellevue because his call sign is paula 01 on that date. So the claim seems to be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided. The claim states: \"oy be the tail code that belong to weapon system officer capt charles b debellevue with call sign paula 01.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: date, pilot, weapon systems officer, aircraft, tail code, call sign, and kill. The data rows contain specific entries for these columns. \n\nThe claim mentions \"oy\" as the tail code. So, I need to look into the table's 'tail code' column to see if any row has \"oy.\" Scanning through each row:\n- Row 0: tail code is \"oy\"\n- Row 1: tail code is \"ed\"\n- Row 2: tail code is \"oy\"\n- Rows 3 and 4 also have \"oy\" as their tail code.\n\nNow, the claim says that this tail code (\"oy\") belongs to a specific person: weapon systems officer Capt Charles B Debellevue. So I should check the 'weapon systems officer' column for each row where tail code is \"oy.\"\n\nLooking at rows 0 and 2:\n- Row 0's weapon systems officer is \"capt charles b debellevue\"\n- Row 2's weapon systems officer is also \"capt cb debellevue\" (I assume this is the same person as Capt Charles B Debellevue, possibly a nickname or abbreviation).\n\nSo in both these rows, the tail code is \"oy,\" and it's associated with Capt Charles B Debellevue.\n\nNext part of the claim: the call sign. The claim mentions \"paula 01.\" I need to check the 'call sign' column for any occurrence of \"paula 01.\"\n\nLooking at row 0, the call sign is \"oyster 03,\" which doesn't match. Row 1's call sign is \"paula 01\" \u2014 that matches. However, in rows where tail code is \"oy,\" specifically rows 0 and 2, the call signs are different: \"oyster 03\" and \"buick 01.\" So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, row 1 has tail code \"ed\" but call sign \"paula 01.\" The claim says that the call sign is \"paula 01,\" which exists in row 1. But the tail code in row 1 isn't \"oy,\" it's \"ed.\" So there might be confusion here.\n\nHowever, rows 3 and 4 have tail code \"oy\" and their call signs are both \"olds 01,\" not \"paula 01.\"\n\nSo to summarize:\n- In rows where tail code is \"oy,\" the call sign isn't \"paula 01.\" Only in row 1 does the call sign match, but the tail code doesn't. \n- The claim says that \"oy\" (tail code) belongs to Capt Charles B Debellevue with call sign \"paula 01.\" But from the table:\n    - Tail code \"oy\" is associated with Capt Charles B Debellevue in rows 0 and 2, but their call signs are different.\n    - The call sign \"paula 01\" exists in row 1, but that row's tail code isn't \"oy.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be mixing up two separate data points. It incorrectly links \"oy\" (tail code) with Capt Charles B Debellevue while also associating it with a call sign (\"paula 01\") that doesn't belong to those rows where \"oy\" is present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion arises from multiple entries for Capt CB Debellevue. Let me check:\n- In row 0: pilot is \"capt richard s ritchie,\" WSO is \"capt charles b debellevue\"\n- In row 2: same WSO\n- In rows 3 and 4, the WSO is \"capt cb debellevue,\" which I assume refers to Capt Charles B Debellevue as well.\n\nSo all these rows where tail code is \"oy\" are associated with Capt Charles B Debellevue. However, their call signs vary: row 0 has \"oyster 03,\" row 2 has \"buick 01.\" Only in row 1 does the call sign match \"paula 01,\" but that's a different tail code.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it links \"oy\" (tail code) with Capt Charles B Debellevue and incorrectly associates this with the call sign \"paula 01,\" which isn't present in any of the rows where tail code is \"oy.\"\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I need to verify each element of the claim against the table.\n\n1. **Tail Code**: The claim states that \"oy\" is the tail code. In the table, rows 0 and 2 have a tail code of \"oy,\" both associated with Capt Charles B Debellevue.\n   \n2. **Weapon Systems Officer (WSO)**: The claim specifies that this WSO is Capt Charles B Debellevue. Checking the relevant rows:\n   - Row 0: WSO is \"capt charles b debellevue.\"\n   - Row 2: WSO is \"capt cb debellevue,\" likely an abbreviation of Capt Charles B Debellevue.\n\n3. **Call Sign**: The claim mentions \"paula 01\" as the call sign. In the table:\n   - Only row 1 has a call sign of \"paula 01.\"\n   - However, in rows 0 and 2 where tail code is \"oy,\" the call signs are \"oyster 03\" and \"buick 01,\" not \"paula 01.\"\n\nSince the call sign in the claim does not match any row with the tail code \"oy,\" the claim incorrectly associates these elements.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE because the claim inaccurately links \"oy\" as the tail code of Capt Charles B Debellevue with the call sign \"paula 01,\" which isn't present in those rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tail code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tail code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The pilot's name matches, but the aircraft is different from what's in the claim (\"f - 4e 67 - 0362\"), and the call sign doesn't match either. So no match here.\n\nSecond row:\n- Pilot: \"capt rs ritchie\"\n- Aircraft: \"f - 4e 67 - 0362\"\n- Call sign: \"paula 01\"\n\nHere, the pilot's name is abbreviated as \"rs ritchie,\" which isn't exactly \"richard s ritchie.\" The full name in the claim has a \"capt\" title and the last name spelled out. So this might be a shortened version, but I think it's not an exact match because the full name isn't given here.\n\nThe aircraft does match: \"f - 4e 67 - 0362,\" which is exactly what the claim mentions. The call sign also matches as \"paula 01.\" So both parts of the claim are met in this row, but let's check other rows to see if there's another occurrence.\n\nThird row:\n- Pilot: \"capt rs ritchie\"\n- Aircraft: same as first row\n- Call sign: \"buick 01\"\n\nNo match here because the call sign is different.\n\nFourth row:\n- Pilot: \"capt john a madden , jr\" (so a different pilot)\n- So no match for the pilot name.\n- The aircraft is another F-4, but different model and tail code\n- Call sign: \"olds 01\"\n\nNo match here either.\n\nFifth row:\n- Pilot: same as fourth row's pilot? Wait, looking closely: it's \"capt ja madden , jr.\" So this seems like a shortening again. The name is not \"richard s ritchie,\" so no match on the pilot. Aircraft and call sign are also different.\n\nSo from all the rows, only the second row matches both the pilot (if considering abbreviations) and the specific aircraft and call sign mentioned in the claim. But wait, the pilot's name in the table is \"capt rs ritchie,\" whereas the claim specifies \"capt richard s ritchie.\" The first name is \"richard\" versus just \"rs.\" Is \"rs\" a common abbreviation? I'm not sure, but \"capt richard s ritchie\" seems like the full name, so an abbreviated version might not be considered an exact match.\n\nAdditionally, in the second row, the pilot's name doesn't include the \"captain\" title. The first row starts with \"capt,\" which matches, but the aircraft and call sign don't align.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. In the first data row, the pilot is \"capt richard s ritchie.\" Oh no, wait: looking back, the first row's pilot is \"capt richard s ritchie,\" and the second row's pilot is \"capt rs ritchie.\" So the claim says \"capt richard s ritchie,\" which exactly matches the first row, but in that row, the aircraft is different. The second row has the correct aircraft but a different pilot name.\n\nWait, no: looking again, the data rows are:\n\nRow 0:\npilot: capt richard s ritchie\naircraft: f -4d 66-7463\ncall sign: oyster03\n\nRow1:\npilot: capt rs ritchie\naircraft: f-4e67-0362\ncall sign: paula01\n\nRow2:\npilot: capt rs ritchie\naircraft: same as row0\ncall sign: buick01\n\nRow3:\npilot: capt ja madden, jr\naircraft: different\ncall sign: olds01\n\nRow4:\npilot: capt ja madden, jr\naircraft: same as row3\ncall sign: same as row3\n\nSo in row1, the pilot is \"capt rs ritchie,\" which might be an abbreviation for \"captain Richard S Ritchie.\" The claim specifies \"capt richard s ritchie\" without any abbreviation. So perhaps the name doesn't fully match.\n\nWait, but in the first data row, it's exactly as the claim says: pilot is \"capt richard s ritchie,\" and in that same row, the aircraft is f-4d 66-7463, which doesn't match the claim's f-4e67-0362. So the first row matches the pilot name but not the other details.\n\nThe second row has the correct aircraft and call sign but a different pilot name (abbreviated). The third row has same pilot as second row but wrong call sign. The fourth and fifth rows have a different pilot entirely.\n\nSo, is there any row where both the pilot's full name matches \"capt richard s ritchie,\" the aircraft matches f-4e67-0362, and the call sign is paula01? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at row1: pilot is \"capt rs ritchie\" (without 'Richard'), which doesn't match the claim exactly. The claim uses the full name with \"richard.\"\n\nSo in the table, there's no exact matching row where all three conditions are met: pilot as \"capt richard s ritchie,\" aircraft as f-4e67-0362, and call sign paula01.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by any single data row. Each of the two relevant aspects (aircraft and call sign) appears in a different row from the pilot's name. Since all three conditions must be met for the claim to be TRUE, and there's no such row, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says that \"capt richard s ritchie\" flew a specific plane and had a specific call sign. If in any row these three attributes are present together, then it's true. From the data provided, such a combination doesn't exist. So yes, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining if there exists a single row in the provided data where all three conditions of the claim are met: the pilot is \"capt richard s ritchie,\" the aircraft is \"f-4e67-0362,\" and the call sign is \"paula01.\" Upon examining each data row, none satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is not fully supported by the data, so the answer is \\boxed{False}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and data. The claim says: \"weapon system officer capt r ritchie belongs to f - 4d 66 - 7463.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The \"weapon system officer\" is a role, similar to a copilot or another officer on the aircraft. The name given is \"capt r ritchie,\" which might be short for Richard Ritchie. The specific aircraft mentioned is \"f - 4d 66 - 7463.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: date, pilot, weapon systems officer, aircraft, tail code, call sign, and kill. Each row represents an occurrence or event with these details.\n\nI need to check if any row in the data matches a weapon system officer named \"capt r ritchie\" operating the specific aircraft \"f - 4d 66 - 7463.\"\n\nLet's go through each row of the data:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Date: May 10\n   - Pilot: Capt Richard S Ritchie\n   - Weapon systems officer: Capt Charles B Debellevue\n   - Aircraft: F - 4D 66 - 7463\n   - Tail code: OY\n   - Call sign: Oyster 03\n   - Kill: MIG -21\n\n   Here, the pilot is Richard S Ritchie. The weapon systems officer is Charles B Debellevue, not \"capt r ritchie.\" Also, the aircraft matches, but the WSO doesn't.\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Date: July 8\n   - Pilot: Capt RS Ritchie (which could be Richard S Ritchie)\n   - Weapon systems officer: Capt CB Debellevue (same as above)\n   - Aircraft: F -4E 67 - 0362 (different model and serial number)\n   - Tail code: ED\n   - Call sign: Paula 01\n   - Kill: MIG-21\n\n   The pilot here is RS Ritchie, which might be Richard S Ritchie. Again, the WSO is Debellevue, not \"capt r ritchie.\" Aircraft doesn't match either.\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Date: August 28\n   - Pilot: Capt RS Ritchie (same as above)\n   - Weapon systems officer: Capt CB Debellevue (same)\n   - Aircraft: F -4D 66 - 7463 (matches the claim's aircraft)\n   - Tail code: OY\n   - Call sign: Buick 01\n   - Kill: MIG-21\n\n   Here, the pilot is RS Ritchie again. The WSO is Debellevue, not \"capt r ritchie.\" So even though the aircraft matches, the WSO doesn't.\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Date: September 9\n   - Pilot: Capt John A Madden , Jr\n   - Weapon systems officer: Capt CB Debellevue (same)\n   - Aircraft: F -4D 66 - 0267 (different serial number)\n   - Tail code: OY\n   - Call sign: OLDS 01\n   - Kill: MIG-19\n\n   Pilot is John Madden, WSO is Debellevue, aircraft doesn't match.\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Date: September 9\n   - Pilot: Capt JA Madden , Jr (same as above)\n   - Weapon systems officer: Capt CB Debellevue (same)\n   - Aircraft: F -4D 66 - 0267 (same as row3, different serial)\n   - Tail code: OY\n   - Call sign: OLDS 01\n   - Kill: MIG-19\n\n   Same as above. So in none of the rows does the weapon systems officer match \"capt r ritchie\" and have the aircraft \"f -4d 66 -7463.\"\n\nI'm looking for a row where both the WSO is \"capt r ritchie\" and the aircraft matches exactly.\n\nIn Row0, the pilot is Richard S Ritchie, but WSO is Debellevue. In Rows1-2, pilot is RS Ritchie, which might be Richard S Ritchie, but again WSO is Debellevue. So even if the name varies in spelling (RS vs R), it's possible they refer to the same person.\n\nWait, in Row0, pilot is Capt Richard S Ritchie, and WSO is Charles B Debellevue. In Rows1-2, pilot is RS Ritchie, which could be short for Richard S Ritchie, but that would mean he's the pilot. So in none of these rows is \"capt r ritchie\" listed as the WSO.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where the weapon systems officer is Capt R Ritchie with that specific aircraft.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if any other rows have \"capt r ritchie\" as WSO. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row0: WSO is Charles B Debellevue\n- Row1: same\n- Row2: same\n- Rows3-4: same\n\nSo no row matches the WSO being \"capt r ritchie.\"\n\nThus, the claim is false because there's no evidence in the table that a WSO named Capt R Ritchie was assigned to F -4D 66 -7463.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the weapon system officer \"capt r ritchie\" belongs to the aircraft \"f -4d 66 -7463.\" After reviewing each row, none of the weapon systems officers match this description with the specified aircraft. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
