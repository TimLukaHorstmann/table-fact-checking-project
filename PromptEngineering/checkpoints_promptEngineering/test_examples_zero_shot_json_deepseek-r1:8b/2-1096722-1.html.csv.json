    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 10.6 million viewers for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. It has five columns: episode, broadcast date, run time, viewers (in millions), and archive. There are four rows, each corresponding to different parts of an episode.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things about \"episode part four\": the number of viewers (10.6 million) and the run time (24:57). So I should check both these pieces of information in the table for part four.\n\nLooking at the data row by row:\n\n- Row 0: Part one, 15 Dec 1973, runtime 24:15, 8.7 viewers, archive.\n- Row 1: Part two, 22 Dec 1973, runtime 24:10, 7.0 viewers, same archive.\n- Row 2: Part three, 29 Dec 1973, runtime 23:30, 6.6 viewers, same archive.\n- Row 3: Part four, 5 Jan 1974, runtime 24:57, 10.6 viewers.\n\nSo part four is row index 3. The claim checks out for both the viewers and the run time. \n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. The claim refers to two columns: \"viewers (in millions)\" and \"run time.\" For part four, those are columns 3 and 2 respectively.\n\nWait, let me count the columns:\n\n1. episode\n2. broadcast date\n3. run time\n4. viewers (in millions)\n5. archive\n\nSo run time is column index 2, viewers is column index 3. Part four is row 3.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row 3, columns \"run time\" and \"viewers (in millions).\"\n\nI think that's it. So the answer should be TRUE because both conditions in the claim are satisfied by part four.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified with the given data. The relevant cells for episode part four are found correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
