So, it's stating that both individuals had the title of Viscount. \n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are state, type, name, title, and royal house. Each row corresponds to a different person or ruler.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for any mention of \"xiong yan the elder\" and \"xiong yong\".\n\nStarting from row 0: It has names like 'cai', 'cao', etc., which don't match the claim.\n\nRow 3: The name is \"xiong yan the elder\". Let's check the title column for this row. The third row's title is \"viscount\", so that matches one part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to find if there's a row with \"xiong yong\" as the name and whether their title is also \"viscount\".\n\nLooking through the rows, row 4 has the name \"xiong yong\". Let me check the title for this row. The third element in row 4 is \"viscount\", so that matches.\n\nSo both xiong yan the elder and xiong yong have the title of viscount.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to find the relevant cells. For each name, I'll get their row index and check the 'title' column.\n\nFor xiong yan the elder (row 3), the title is \"viscount\" at column index 3. So, the cell is row 3, column \"title\".\n\nFor xiong yong (row 4), similarly, the title is \"viscount\" in the same column. So, row 4, column \"title\".\n\nWait, but looking at the data, the table's columns are given as [\"state\", \"type\", \"name\", \"title\", \"royal house\"]. So for each relevant entry, I need to map the name to its row and check the 'title' column.\n\nYes, so the relevant_cells should include both occurrences where the title is viscount for those names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both xiong yan the elder and xiong yong have the title of viscount. The relevant cells are their respective rows in the 'title' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the royal house be unavailable for the state cao , chen , song , wey , and yan.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a confusing statement. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the \"royal house\" is unavailable for certain states: Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, and Yan. So, I need to check if in the table, each of these states has a \"-\" under the \"royal house\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure: columns are state, type, name, title, royal house. The data rows have various entries, sometimes \"-\", which might indicate absence or unavailability.\n\nSo my task is to go through each of the mentioned states (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, Yan) and check their corresponding \"royal house\" cell in the table.\n\nLet me start by listing the rows for each state:\n\n1. Cao: Looking at row 1, state Cao has \"sovereign\" as type, name is Yi, title is count, and royal house is \"-\". So yes, \"-\" here.\n\n2. Chen: Row 2, state Chen has type sovereign, name You, title Duke, royal house \"-\". So again, \"-\".\n\n3. Song: Row 12, state Song has type sovereign, name Li, title Duke, and royal house \"-\". Yes, that's \"-\".\n\n4. Wey: Row 13, state Wey has type sovereign, name Li, title Marquis, and royal house \"-\". So yes.\n\n5. Yan: Wait, is there a row for Yan? Let me check. The last rows are:\n\n- Row 14: state Yan, type sovereign, name Hui, title Marquis, royal house \"-\"\n- Then rows after that are for other states like Jin, Lu, Qi, Qin, etc.\n\nSo row 14, which is the 14th index (since it's zero-based?), wait no, in JSON data arrays start at 0. So let me list all the rows:\n\nRows 0-14 (15 rows). So row indices are from 0 to 10 for the first few, then up to 14? Wait, looking back, the data array has 15 entries, so rows go from 0 to 14.\n\nWait, in the JSON, \"data\" is an array with 15 elements. Each element is a row. So row indices are 0 through 14.\n\nLooking for Yan: I think there's a state named Yan at row 14 (state: \"yan\", type: \"sovereign\", name: \"hui\", title: \"marquis\", royal house: \"-\"). So yes, \"-\" in the royal house column.\n\nSo each of these states (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, Yan) has a \"-\" in the \"royal house\" column. That would mean that for each of these states, the royal house is unavailable, as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because all specified states have \"-\" under \"royal house\".\n\nWait, but let me double-check each one:\n\n- Cao: row 1 (index 0?), no, wait. The data array starts with [ ... ], so row 0 is first entry, which is state Cai. Wait, the first row in data is [ \"cai\", ..., ...], that's row index 0.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the JSON:\n\n\"data\": [\n    [\n      \"cai\",\n      ...\n    ],\n    [\n      \"cao\",\n      ...\n    ],\n    ...\n]\n\nSo for state Cao, it's in the second position of data array, which is index 1. So rows are indexed from 0 to 14.\n\nSo for each state:\n\nCao: row 1 (index 1) has \"-\" in royal house.\n\nChen: row 2 (index 2) has \"-\".\n\nSong: row 12 (index 12).\n\nWey: row 13 (index 13).\n\nYan: row 14 (index 14), since the last entry is [ \"yan\", ... ] which would be index 14, but wait, the data array has 15 rows, so indices go up to 14.\n\nYes, so each of these states (Cao at 1, Chen at 2, Song at 12, Wey at13, Yan at14) have \"-\" in \"royal house\".\n\nTherefore, all specified states have the royal house unavailable. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list which cells are relevant. Each of these rows and their \"royal house\" column.\n\nSo for each state:\n\nCao: row 1, \"royal house\"\n\nChen: row 2, \"royal house\"\n\nSong: row12, \"royal house\"\n\nWey: row13, \"royal house\"\n\nYan: row14, \"royal house\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are these five instances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. It's making two assertions:\n1. There is a person named \"li\" who holds the title \"duke of song.\"\n2. There is also a person named \"li\" who holds the title \"marquis of wey.\"\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. The data rows provide information for different individuals or titles.\n\nStarting with the first assertion about the duke of song:\n- In the table, I'll search for any row where the 'title' is \"duke\" and 'state' is \"song.\" Alternatively, since sometimes titles are in the 'title' column, but looking at the data, each row has a title. Wait, no, actually, in the table, the columns include 'name,' 'title,' etc.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 10: state=qi, type=sovereign, name=qin zhong, title=ruler, royal house=ying.\n- Row 11: state=song, type=sovereign, name=li, title=duke, royal house=-.\nWait, row index 12? Wait, let me recount the rows starting from 0.\n\nLooking at each data entry:\n\nRow 0:\nstate: cai\ntype: sovereign\nname: wu\ntitle: marquis\nroyal house: ji\n\nRow1:\ncao, sovereign, yi, count, -\n\nRow2:\nchen, sovereign, you, duke, -\n\nRow3:\nchu, sovereign, xiong yan the elder, viscount, mi\n\nRow4:\nchu, sovereign, xiong yong, viscount, mi\n\nRow5:\njin, sovereign, jing, marquis, ji\n\nRow6:\njin, sovereign, xi, marquis, ji\n\nRow7:\nlu, sovereign, shen, duke, ji\n\nRow8:\nqi, sovereign, wu, duke, jiang\n\nRow9:\nqin, sovereign, marquis, marquis,ying\n\nRow10:\nqin, sovereign, gongbo, ruler,ying\n\nRow11:\nqin, sovereign, qin zhong, ruler,ying\n\nRow12:\nsong, sovereign, li, duke, -\n\nRow13:\nwey, sovereign, li, marquis, -\n\nRow14:\nyan, sovereign, hui, marquis, -\n\nSo row 12: state=song, name=li, title=duke. So \"li\" is the name for the duke of song. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNow the second assertion: \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\"\n\nWait, so does the same \"li\" hold two titles? Let's check if there are two different entries with 'li' as the name and different titles.\n\nLooking at row13: state=wey, name=li, title=marquis. So yes, another entry for \"li\" as marquis of wey.\n\nSo both assertions are true because in the table, there are two separate rows where 'li' is the name for duke of song (row12) and marquis of wey (row13).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other 'li's. The only li's are in row12 and row13.\n\nSo both assertions hold true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and what each column represents.\n\nThe table has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. Each row seems to represent a different entity with these attributes. My task is to find any cells related to \"wu\" in the context of being a duke for Chen or Lu.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to see where \"wu\" appears and what its associated titles are. Starting from row 0: state is cai, type is sovereign, name is wu, title is marquis, royal house is ji. So here, wu is a marquis, not a duke.\n\nRow 1: state cao, type sovereign, name yi, title count, \"-\" for royal house. No mention of wu here.\n\nRow 2: state chen, type sovereign, name you, title duke, royal house \"-\". Here, the name is you, but I'm looking for \"wu.\" So not relevant.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is about whether wu is a duke in either Chen or Lu. So I need to check if any of the states are chen or lu and their titles include duke with name wu.\n\nLooking at row 3: state chu, type sovereign, name xiong yan the elder, title viscount, royal house mi. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: same state chu but different name, still not wu.\n\nRows 5-7 are jin, which is a different state, so I can skip those for now.\n\nRow 8: state lu, type sovereign, name shen, title duke, royal house ji. Here, the name is shen, not wu. So no, wu isn't here.\n\nWait, but in row 0, it's wu as marquis, and in row 4, another entry for chu, but I'm looking for chen or lu.\n\nLooking back, does any state named chen have a title of duke? Let's check:\n\nRow 2: state is chen, type sovereign, name you, title duke. Name is you, not wu.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 is lu with name shen, title duke. So no wu there either.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. The claim says \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu.\" So if any of these states (chen or lu) have a Duke title with name wu, then the claim would be false. If in all cases wu isn't a Duke for those states, it's true.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For state chen: row 2 has title duke, but name is you.\n- For state lu: row 8 has title duke, but name is shen.\n\nSo in neither case is the name wu. Therefore, wu isn't a Duke for either Chen or Lu. So the claim should be true.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if any other rows have chen or lu with titles and names that could relate to wu? Let me double-check:\n\nIn row 0: state is cai, not chen or lu.\nRow 1: cao, not relevant.\nRow 2: chen, title duke, name you.\nRow 3-4: chu, no.\nRows 5-7: jin, no.\nRow 8: lu, title duke, name shen.\nRow 9-11: qin, no.\nRows 12-13: song and wey, not relevant.\nRow 14: yan, no.\n\nSo yes, none of the chen or lu states have a Duke with name wu. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in the table, neither Chen nor Lu have a \"Duke\" title with the name \"wu\". \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The claim concerns whether \"wu\" holds the title of Duke for either Chen or Lu.\n2. **Search the Table:** Check each row to see if there's a state named Chen or Lu with a Duke title and name \"wu\".\n3. **Find No Matching Entries:** Neither Chen nor Lu has a Duke title with the name wu in the table.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since no evidence supports the claim, it is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the royal house be ji for the state jin , which have both jing and xi.\" \n\nSo, the claim has two main parts:\n1. The royal house is Ji for the state Jin.\n2. The state Jin has both Jeng (jing) and Xi as part of it.\n\nI need to check if there are any entries in the table that support these points.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Columns: state, type, name, title, royal house\n- Data rows have various values for each column.\n\nThe relevant columns here seem to be \"state\", \"royal house\", and possibly \"name\" or \"title\" if needed. The claim is about two specific states (Jin) and their corresponding royal houses (Ji). Also, it mentions that Jin has both Jeng and Xi associated with it.\n\nSo, first step: Identify rows where the state is \"Jin\". Scanning through the data:\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n- Row 5: state \"jin\", type \"sovereign\", name \"jing\", title \"marquis\", royal house \"ji\"\n- Row 6: state \"jin\", type \"sovereign\", name \"xi\", title \"marquis\", royal house \"ji\"\n\nSo, for the state Jin, there are two entries. Both have the same royal house Ji.\n\nNow, checking if the claim is about the royal house being Ji for Jin. Yes, both rows 5 and 6 have state Jin and royal house Ji, so that's correct.\n\nNext part of the claim: Jin has both Jeng (jing) and Xi as part of it. Looking at the name column in those rows:\n\n- Row 5: name is \"jing\"\n- Row 6: name is \"xi\"\n\nSo, within the same state Jin, there are both Jeng (from row 5) and Xi (from row 6). Therefore, this part is also correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is TRUE because for the state Jin, the royal house is Ji, and within Jin, there are both Jeng and Xi listed as names. Now, I need to map this back to the relevant cells in the table.\n\nRelevant cells would be the rows where state is \"jin\" (rows 5 and 6) and the columns involved: \"state\", \"royal house\". So, for each of these rows, I should include their row index and column names that are relevant.\n\nIn JSON format, each relevant cell will have a row_index and column_name. So, for row 5:\n- row_index:5\n- columns: state (Jin), royal house (Ji)\n\nFor row 6:\n- row_index:6\n- columns: state (Jin), royal house (Ji)\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are these two rows' \"state\" and \"royal house\" entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

State: cao\n   - Looking at the table, there's a row where state is \"cao\".\n   - The columns for this row are:\n     - state: cao\n     - type: sovereign\n     - name: yi\n     - title: count\n     - royal house: \"-\"\n   - So the royal house for cao is \"-\", which means no royal house.

State: wey\n   - Row with state \"wey\":\n     - columns include royal house: \"-\"\n   - So no royal house.\n\n5. State: yan\n   - Looking for state \"yan\":\n     - There's a row with state \"yan\".\n     - Columns:\n       - type: sovereign\n       - name: hui\n       - title: marquis\n       - royal house: \"-\"\n   - Royal house is \"-\", indicating none.\n\nSo all the listed states (cao, chen, song, wey, yan) have a \"-\" in the \"royal house\" column, meaning they don't have a royal house available.

I need to scan through each row and specifically look for instances where the title is \"viscount.\"\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- Name: WU\n- Title: marquis\n\nRow 1:\n- Name: YI\n- Title: count\n\nRow 2:\n- Name: YOU\n- Title: duke\n\nRow 3:\n- Name: Xiong Yan the Elder\n- Title: viscount\n\nRow 4:\n- Name: Xiong Yong\n- Title: viscount\n\nRow 5:\n- Name: Jing\n- Title: marquis\n\nRow 6:\n- Name: Xi\n- Title: marquis\n\nRow 7:\n- Name: Shen\n- Title: duke\n\nRow 8:\n- Name: WU\n- Title: duke\n\nRow 9:\n- Name: Marquis\n- Title: marquis (duplicate entry)\n\nRow 10:\n- Name: Gongbo\n- Title: ruler\n\nRow 11:\n- Name: Qin Zhong\n- Title: ruler\n\nRow 12:\n- Name: Li\n- Title: duke\n\nRow 13:\n- Name: Li\n- Title: marquis\n\nRow 14:\n- Name: Hui\n- Title: marquis\n\nSo, from this, I can see that Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong both have \"viscount\" as their title. Now, I need to check if any other individuals also hold this title.\n\nLooking through all the titles listed in the table, only these two have \"viscount.\" The rest include marquis, count, duke, ruler, etc., but no other \"viscount\" titles.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because only Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong are titled as viscounts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that \"Li\" is not a name used exclusively for the titles \"Duke of Song\" and \"Marquis of Wey\". So, I need to check if \"Li\" appears as the name column in any other rows besides those two titles.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different entry with data across the columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. The relevant columns for this claim are probably \"name\" and \"title\". Specifically, I need to check if there's an entry where the \"name\" is \"Li\" and the \"title\" is either \"Duke of Song\" or \"Marquis of Wey\".\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Row 0: name is \"wu\", title is not related.\n2. Row 1: name is \"yi\", not Li, title is \"count\".\n3. Row 2: name is \"you\", not Li.\n4. Row 3: name is \"xiong yan the elder\", not Li.\n5. Row 4: same as above.\n6. Row 5: name is \"jing\", not Li.\n7. Row 6: name is \"xi\", nope.\n8. Row 7: name is \"shen\", not Li.\n9. Row 8: name is \"wu\", nope.\n10. Row 9: name is \"marquis\", nope.\n11. Row 10: name is \"gongbo\", nope.\n12. Row 11: name is \"qin zhong\", nope.\n13. Row 12: name is \"li\" and title is \"duke of song\".\n14. Row 13: name is \"li\" and title is \"marquis of wey\".\n\nSo, rows 12 and 13 have the name \"Li\" with titles \"Duke of Song\" and \"Marquis of Wey\", respectively. \n\nNow, does this support or contradict the claim? The claim says that Li is not the name for only those two titles. From the table, there are exactly two entries where name is Li: Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. So, it's used exclusively for these two titles.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because the data in the table shows that \"Li\" is indeed the name for only those two positions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"li\" appears as the name for exactly the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim: \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu.\" I need to determine if it's true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"wu\" being a duke in two different states: Chen and Lu. So I should look for entries where the state is Chen and another where the state is Lu, specifically looking at who holds the title of Duke.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. Each row represents a different entry with these attributes. My task is to find rows that match both conditions: state being Chen or Lu and the title being Duke.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- State: cai, Type: sovereign, Name: wu, Title: marquis, Royal House: ji.\nNot relevant because state is not Chen or Lu, and title isn't duke.\n\nSecond row:\n- State: cao, Type: sovereign, Name: yi, Title: count, Royal House: -.\nNot relevant. State isn't Chen or Lu.\n\nThird row:\n- State: chen, Type: sovereign, Name: you, Title: duke, Royal House: -.\nThis one is relevant because state is Chen and title is Duke. So this cell is important for the claim about Chen.\n\nFourth row:\n- State: chu, Type: sovereign, Name: xiong yan the elder, Title: viscount, Royal House: mi.\nNot relevant. Title isn't duke, so even though it's a chen (maybe typo?), but since state might be \"chu\" not \"chen\", but regardless, title is viscount.\n\nWait, wait, I think there might be a confusion here. In the table, the first entry under data has [ \"cai\", ...], second [ \"cao\"... ], third [ \"chen\"... ]. So Chen is row 2 (index starts at 0?), or maybe it's row 3? Wait, in programming indices, rows start at 0, but sometimes people count from 1. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back: the table has 14 rows. The first row is index 0: cai. Then index 1: cao, etc., up to index 13: yan.\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nThe data array is:\n[\n    [ \"cai\", ... ],\n    [ \"cao\", ... ],\n    [ \"chen\", ... ], --> this would be row 2 (index 2)\n    [ \"chu\", ... ],\n    [ \"jin\", ... ],\n    etc.\n]\n\nSo the third row, index 2, has state: chen. Title is duke.\n\nSimilarly, I need to find if there's a row with state: lu and title: duke.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 6 (index 5): state is jin, not relevant.\n\nWait, let me list all states that are Chen or Lu:\n\nChen: index 2.\n\nLu: looking for \"lu\" in the state column. Let's scan each row:\n\nIndex 0: cai\n1: cao\n2: chen\n3: chu\n4: jin\n5: jin\n6: lu --> yes, row 6 (index 6) is state: lu.\n\nIn that row, the title is duke.\n\nSo for Chen, row 2, title is duke.\nFor Lu, row 6, title is duke.\n\nWait no, let me check:\n\nRow index 6:\n[\n  \"lu\",\n  \"sovereign\",\n  \"shen\",\n  \"duke\",\n  \"ji\"\n]\nYes, title is duke.\n\nSimilarly, for Chen, row 2 (index 2):\n[\n  \"chen\",\n  \"sovereign\",\n  \"you\",\n  \"duke\",\n  \"-\"\n]\nTitle is duke.\n\nSo both states, Chen and Lu, have wu as the name? Wait no. In row 2, the name is you. In row 6, name is shen. So the claim says \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu.\" But in the table, for Chen, the name is you, not wu. For Lu, name is shen.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misunderstood. The claim is about wu being the duke. So perhaps we need to check if wu is associated with both Chen and Lu.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nWhich rows have title: duke?\n\nRow 2 (index 2): state chen, title duke, name you.\nRow 6 (index 6): state lu, title duke, name shen.\nRow 9 (index 8? Wait data array is up to index 13. Let me recount:\n\nWait the data has 14 rows, indices 0-13.\n\nLooking for any row where title is duke and name is wu.\n\nIn row 2: name is you. Not wu.\n\nAny other rows with title=duke?\n\nYes, let's check each row where title=duke:\n\nRow 2 (index 2): state chen, title duke, name you.\nRow 6 (index 6): state lu, title duke, name shen.\nRow 9 (index 8): state qi, title duke, name wu.\nWait no, in data array, row 8 is:\n\n[\n  \"qi\",\n  \"sovereign\",\n  \"wu\",\n  \"duke\",\n  \"jiang\"\n]\n\nSo here, state: qi, name: wu, title: duke.\n\nSo for the claim, it's about wu being the duke of both Chen or Lu. So let's see:\n\nIs there a row where state is Chen, name is wu, and title is duke? No. In Chen's case (row 2), name is you.\n\nIs there a row where state is Lu, name is wu, and title is duke? No. Lu's row (index6) has name shen.\n\nHowever, in qi's row (index8), name is wu, but state is qi, not Chen or Lu. So the claim says \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu.\" But in reality, wu is a duke only for qi, not for Chen or Lu.\n\nWait, so does the claim say that wu is the duke for Chen and Lu? Or either one?\n\nThe exact wording: \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu.\" So it's saying that wu is a duke in both Chen and Lu. But from the table, wu is only associated with qi as a name.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me see:\n\nLooking for any row where state=chen, name=wu: none.\nstate=lu, name=wu: none.\nBut there's a row where name=wu and state=qi, title=duke.\n\nSo the claim is false because wu is not a duke in Chen or Lu. Instead, wu is the duke of qi.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is incorrect.\n\nWait but wait, perhaps I misread the data array. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 2: state=chen, name=you.\nRow 6: state=lu, name=shen.\nRow8: state=qi, name=wu, title=duke.\n\nSo no, wu is not a duke in chen or lu. So the claim is wrong.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"both chen or lu\" as OR, meaning either one. But the way it's phrased, \"of both chen or lu,\" which could imply both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to say that wu is a duke in both Chen and Lu, but the data shows otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because wu is only the duke of qi.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu,\" but based on the provided table, wu is not associated with either Chen or Lu as a duke. Instead, in the Qi row, it's wu who holds the title of duke.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because wu is only the Duke of Qi, not Chen or Lu.",

    "claim": "the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Let's parse the claim sentence by sentence. The main parts are:\n\n1. \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin\"\n2. \", which do not have either jing and xi\"\n\nI think the first part is saying that for the state \"jin\", the royal house shouldn't be \"ji\". So, I need to check in the table if any row with the state \"jin\" has a \"royal house\" value of \"ji\".\n\nLooking at the table's columns: [\"state\", \"type\", \"name\", \"title\", \"royal house\"]. So, each row corresponds to a state and provides details about its type, name, title, and royal house.\n\nI'll scan through each row where the state is \"jin\". Let me go through the data:\n\n- First row after \"qin\": [\"jin\", \"sovereign\", \"jing\", \"marquis\", \"ji\"]\n  - State: jin\n  - Royal House: ji\n\nNext, another row for \"jin\":\n- Next row: [\"jin\", \"sovereign\", \"xi\", \"marquis\", \"ji\"]\n  - Royal House: ji again.\n\nSo, both instances where the state is \"jin\" have \"ji\" as their royal house. But the claim says \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin\". So according to this, it should not be \"ji\". However, in reality, it is \"ji\", so that part of the claim seems incorrect.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \", which do not have either jing and xi.\" Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. It says that for the state \"jin\", they don't have either \"jing\" or \"xi\". So, in other words, the name should not be \"jing\" or \"xi\".\n\nLooking back at the rows for \"jin\":\n\n- First row: name is \"jing\"\n- Second row: name is \"xi\"\n\nSo, both these names are present. Therefore, according to the claim, they shouldn't have either, but they do. That means that part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the second part. Let me re-examine the original claim: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi.\" So it's saying two things:\n\n1. Royal house is not ji for state jin.\n2. The state jin does not have jing and xi as names.\n\nBut in reality, both points are false because the royal house is ji, and they do have jing and xi as names. Therefore, the entire claim seems to be false.\n\nHowever, I need to be precise. Let's look at each relevant cell to verify.\n\nFirst, for the state \"jin\", check the \"royal house\" column:\n\n- For row where name is \"jing\": royal house is ji.\n- For row where name is \"xi\": royal house is also ji.\n\nSo both have royal house as \"ji\". Therefore, the first part of the claim is false because it claims the royal house isn't ji, but in reality, it is.\n\nSecond, check if the state \"jin\" has either jing or xi as names:\n\n- Yes, the name column has \"jing\" and \"xi\".\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are incorrect. So the overall claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim refers to two main aspects: the royal house for state jin and whether jing and xi exist as names in that state.\n\nFor the first part, looking at \"state\" being \"jin\" and checking \"royal house\". So rows where state is \"jin\" have columns \"royal house\", which are relevant.\n\nLooking through the table, the relevant rows are index 6 and 7 (assuming indexing starts at 0). Wait, let's count:\n\nThe data array has rows starting from 0. Let me list out all the states to find where state is \"jin\".\n\nWait, I'll go row by row:\n\n- Row 0: cai\n- Row1: cao\n- Row2: chen\n- Row3: chu\n- Row4: chu\n- Row5: jin\n- Row6: jin\n- Row7: lu\n- Row8: qi\n- Row9: qin\n- Row10: qin\n- Row11: qin\n- Row12: song\n- Row13: wey\n- Row14: yan\n\nSo, rows 5 and 6 are for state \"jin\".\n\nIn both of these rows, the column \"royal house\" is present. So row indices 5 and 6, column \"royal house\".\n\nNow, for the second part: do they have either jing or xi as names?\n\nLooking at row5: name is \"jing\".\nRow6: name is \"xi\".\n\nSo both of these are in the \"name\" column for state \"jin\". So rows 5 and 6, column \"name\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- (row5, \"royal house\")\n- (row5, \"name\")\n- (row6, \"royal house\")\n- (row6, \"name\")\n\nWait, but in row5, state is \"jin\", name is \"jing\". In row6, same state, name is \"xi\".\n\nSo for both rows, we need to check the relevant columns.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include all these four cells: two from row5 and two from row6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just note each relevant cell individually. But according to the instructions, it's a list of objects with row_index and column_name.\n\nSo in total, for rows 5 and 6:\n\nFor row5 (index5):\n- \"royal house\" at index5\n- \"name\" at index5\n\nFor row6 (index6):\n- \"royal house\" at index6\n- \"name\" at index6\n\nThus, the relevant_cells list would include these four entries.\n\nPutting it all together, since both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking if the royal house for state \"jin\" is not \"ji\" and that names \"jing\" or \"xi\" do not exist. However, the table shows that the royal house is \"ji\" and both names are present, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"false\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
