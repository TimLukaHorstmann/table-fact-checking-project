    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and instructions. The claim states: \"David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Diego Gonzalez.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells are relevant by checking each row where David Bielkheden fought in Stockholm, Sweden against Diego Gonzalez.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: The fighter is David Bielkheden vs. Diego Gonzalez in Stockholm, Sweden.\n- This seems to match the claim's event.\n\nNext, I need to check if this win was his highest or not. Since the claim refers to \"highest record,\" I should look for any other matches where Bielkheden might have a higher number of wins elsewhere.\n\nHowever, in the table provided, there are multiple entries for David Bielkheden, but only row 0 mentions Stockholm, Sweden against Gonzalez. The rest either don't specify the location or involve different opponents.\n\nSince only row 0 is relevant and there's no indication of a higher win count elsewhere, I can assume this might be his highest in that context.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE, supported by row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by unanimous decision\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by carefully going through each step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that David Bielkheden has won the majority of his matches via a unanimous decision. So, to verify this, I need to check if most of his fights ended with him winning by a unanimous decision.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list all of David's fight results. Each row in the table represents a different match. The columns relevant here are probably the \"Result\" column, as it will show whether each fight was won or lost, and how they were won\u2014unanimous, split, etc.\n\nI'll need to go through each row to check the outcome of his fights. Let's start from the top:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Result is \"Loss\". Since he didn't win this one, it doesn't count towards his wins.\n2. **Row 1:** Loss again. So, not a win.\n3. **Row 2:** Win by KO (Knockout). That's a win, but I need to check if it was unanimous.\n4. **Row 3:** Win by submission (RNC). Again, a win, but was it unanimous?\n5. **Row 4:** Loss\u2014so not relevant for wins.\n6. **Row 5:** Win by KO. Another win, but again, I need to confirm the type of decision.\n7. **Row 6:** Win by KO. Win, but need to check if it's unanimous.\n8. **Row 7:** Win by submission (armbar). A win, but what kind of decision?\n9. **Row 8:** Loss\u2014so not relevant.\n10. **Row 9:** Win by KO. Another win.\n11. **Row 10:** Win by KO. So that's another win.\n12. **Row 11:** Win by KO. Yet another win.\n13. **Row 12:** Loss\u2014irrelevant.\n14. **Row 13:** Win by KO. Another win.\n15. **Row 14:** Win by submission (RNC). A win.\n16. **Row 15:** Win by KO. Another one.\n17. **Row 16:** Win by KO. Yet another.\n18. **Row 17:** Loss\u2014not relevant.\n19. **Row 18:** Win by KO. So, a win.\n20. **Row 19:** Win by KO again.\n21. **Row 20:** Loss\u2014irrelevant.\n22. **Row 21:** Win by KO. Another win.\n23. **Row 22:** Loss\u2014not relevant.\n24. **Row 23:** Win by KO. So, a win.\n25. **Row 24:** Win by KO. Another one.\n26. **Row 25:** Loss\u2014irrelevant.\n27. **Row 26:** Win by KO. A win.\n28. **Row 27:** Win by submission (armbar). A win.\n29. **Row 28:** Loss\u2014not relevant.\n30. **Row 29:** Win by KO. So, a win.\n31. **Row 30:** Win by KO again.\n32. **Row 31:** Loss\u2014irrelevant.\n33. **Row 32:** Win by KO. A win.\n34. **Row 33:** Win by KO. Another one.\n35. **Row 34:** Loss\u2014not relevant.\n36. **Row 35:** Win by KO. So, a win.\n37. **Row 36:** Win by KO again.\n38. **Row 37:** Loss\u2014irrelevant.\n39. **Row 38:** Win by KO. Another win.\n40. **Row 39:** Win by KO again.\n41. **Row 40:** Loss\u2014not relevant.\n42. **Row 41:** Win by KO. So, a win.\n43. **Row 42:** Win by KO again.\n44. **Row 43:** Loss\u2014irrelevant.\n45. **Row 44:** Win by KO. Another win.\n46. **Row 45:** Win by KO again.\n47. **Row 46:** Loss\u2014not relevant.\n48. **Row 47:** Win by KO. So, a win.\n\nNow, let's count how many wins he has. From rows 2 to 47 (excluding losses), I can see that each row where the result is \"Win\" indicates a victory. The type of decision (unanimous, majority, split) isn't explicitly stated in the table provided, which is a bit confusing because the original user mentioned that David Bielkheden wins by unanimous decision. However, the table only shows whether he won or lost each match, not the specific type of decision.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. The columns might have more details. Let me check again. Oh, in the initial table description, the user included columns like \"Opponent,\" \"Result,\" and \"Method.\" So the \"Method\" would indicate whether it was by KO, submission, etc., but not necessarily whether it's a unanimous decision.\n\nWait, no\u2014the original table might not include whether each win was by unanimous decision. That\u2019s an issue because without knowing that, I can't confirm if he won a majority of his matches by a unanimous decision or just any type of decision.\n\nBut the claim is specifically about a \"unanimous\" victory in the majority of his matches. So, unless the table specifies whether each win was by a unanimous decision, we can't verify it.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again: the user listed the columns as Opponent, Result, and Method. The result is either Win or Loss, but not specifying the type of win (unanimous, etc.) So without that information, I can\u2019t determine if each win was by a unanimous decision.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be fully verified because the data doesn't specify whether his wins were via a unanimous decision. It only shows that he won or lost each match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some cultures or organizations, a KO is considered a unanimous decision, but I don't think that's standard. Typically, a knockout is a dominant victory, but not necessarily a unanimous decision as per the standards of judging.\n\nSo, without knowing if his wins were by a unanimous decision, we can't confirm that he won the majority of his matches by that specific method.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be based on an assumption that isn't supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by a unanimous decision cannot be fully verified with the given information. The table provides details about each match's outcome (Win or Loss) and method (KO, submission), but it does not specify whether these wins were via a unanimous decision. Without this specific data on the type of victory, we cannot confirm that the majority of his wins were by a unanimous decision.\n\n**Conclusion:** Insufficient information is provided to confirm the claim based on the given table.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim is true based on some data in a table. The claim is: \"David Bielkheden fought a total of 4 games in Turku, Finland, 75% of which be win.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many fights David Bielkheden had in Turku, Finland. Looking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a fight, and each column has details like the opponent, method of victory, etc. \n\nI'll go through each row and check if the location is Turku, Finland. Scanning each row's 'Location' column:\n\n- Row 0: Hakata, Fukuoka, Japan\n- Row 1: Stockholm, Sweden\n- Row 2: London, England\n- Row 3: Coventry, England\n- Row 4: Coventry, England\n- Row 5: Hakata, Fukuoka, Japan\n- Row 6: Tokyo, Japan\n- Row 7: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 8: Turku, Finland\n- Row 9: Belfast, Northern Ireland\n- Row 10: Turku, Finland\n- Row 11: London, England\n- Row 12: Coventry, England\n- Row 13: Hakata, Fukuoka, Japan\n- Row 14: Tokyo, Japan\n- Row 15: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 16: Turku, Finland\n- Row 17: Turku, Finland\n- Row 18: Turku, Finland\n- Row 19: Turku, Finland\n- Row 20: Turku, Finland\n- Row 21: Turku, Finland\n- Row 22: Turku, Finland\n- Row 23: Turku, Finland\n- Row 24: Turku, Finland\n- Row 25: Turku, Finland\n\nSo, from this, I can see that David Bielkheden fought multiple times in Turku, Finland. Let's count the rows where 'Location' is Turku, Finland. That's rows 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25\u2014so that's a total of 12 fights in Turku.\n\nWait, but the claim says he fought a total of 4 games. That doesn't match at all. I must be misunderstanding something. Maybe the table is mislabeled or I'm looking for the wrong columns.\n\nLooking back, perhaps each row represents one fight, so let me check how many times 'Turku, Finland' appears in the 'Location' column. As per my previous count, it's 12 times, which contradicts the claim of 4 games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table isn't about David Bielkheden but another fighter. Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify whose fights are listed\u2014David Bielkheden or someone else. That could be a mistake because the claim is specifically about him.\n\nIf it's not his fights, then the data is irrelevant. But assuming the table is about him, the claim is wrong because he fought more than 4 times in Turku.\n\nAlso, the second part of the claim mentions that 75% of these games are wins. So even if there were 4 games, I'd need to check if 75% are wins. Since he actually has 12 fights in Turku with varying results (some wins, some losses), but again, the total number is more than 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems false because the total number of fights in Turku doesn't match, and even if it did, the percentage might not hold.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Maybe the table isn't comprehensive or perhaps 'David Bielkheden' is fighting only a subset of these listed games. But without more context, it's hard to say. Still, based on the given data, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that David Bielkheden fought 4 games in Turku, Finland, with 75% being wins. Upon examining the table, there are multiple fights in Turku, Finland (12), which contradicts the claim of only 4 games. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"Location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim that David Bielkheden has won every match that ends with a Tko or Ko across his career is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each row in the table and look for matches where the outcome is either Tko (Technical Knockout) or Ko (Knockout). The claim suggests he wins all these matches.\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Alexey Ignashov, Outcome is KO. So that's a win.\nRow 1: Opponent is Mihail Gurtu, Outcome is Tko. That's another win.\nRow 2: Opponent is Daniel Weimer, Outcome is Ko. Win again.\nRow 3: Opponent is Bjorn Betsa, Outcome is Tko. Win.\nRow 4: Opponent is David Minasian, Outcome is KO. Win.\n\nWait, but let me check all the rows. I should make sure I'm not missing any. Let's go row by row:\n\n- Row 0: KO \u2192 Win\n- Row 1: Tko \u2192 Win\n- Row 2: Ko \u2192 Win\n- Row 3: Tko \u2192 Win\n- Row 4: KO \u2192 Win\n- Then, rows 5 to 14 have outcomes like decision, submission, etc., which are not Tko or Ko.\n- Rows 15 onwards start showing x wins, but since the claim is about Bielkheden's own wins, those are probably others. Wait, no\u2014looking at the table, some cells have \"x win\" where x is another fighter, so those are different fighters' wins, not Bielkheden.\n\nWait, actually, I think the table might be structured such that each row represents a match, with columns like Opponent and Outcome. So for example, row 0: David Bielkheden vs Alexey Ignashov, outcome KO. Row1: David vs Mihail Gurtu, Tko.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow5: Decision \u2192 Not Tko/Ko\nRow6: Submission \u2192 No\nRow7: KO? Wait, in the table, it's written as \"KO\" but is it for whom? Wait, maybe I need to check each row properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Let me look again. The table seems to have multiple columns, possibly Opponent, and the outcome. So for example:\n\nRow 0: David Bielkheden vs Alexey Ignashov; Outcome KO \u2192 Win.\nRow1: David vs Mihail Gurtu; Tko \u2192 Win.\nRow2: David vs Daniel Weimer; Ko \u2192 Win.\nRow3: David vs Bjorn Betsa; Tko \u2192 Win.\nRow4: David vs David Minasian; Ko \u2192 Win.\n\nThen, after that, the rows seem to be against other fighters, with the outcome being x win, which might not be relevant because it's about others. But wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see:\n\nLooking at row 5: Opponent is Steve Dade, outcome KO? No, looking closer, in the table provided, each row seems to have a single cell with the outcome, perhaps. Wait, no\u2014looking again, it's structured as a list where each item has multiple properties like Opponent, Rounds, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, the way the data is presented might be that each line is a match, and within each match, there are details like Opponent, Rounds, etc. But for the purpose of this claim, we're focusing on the outcome being Tko or Ko.\n\nSo in the initial rows:\n\n- Row 0: KO \u2192 Win\n- Row1: Tko \u2192 Win\n- Row2: Ko \u2192 Win\n- Row3: Tko \u2192 Win\n- Row4: KO \u2192 Win\n\nThese are all wins for David Bielkheden when the match ended with a Tko or Ko. \n\nNow, let's check if there are any matches where he lost despite the outcome being Tko or Ko. From the table provided, I don't see any such cases in the early rows.\n\nWait, but looking further down, starting from row 5 onwards, it shows \"x win\" where x is another fighter. These are wins by other fighters against someone else, not David Bielkheden. So these are irrelevant for this claim because they're about different fighters' wins.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, all matches that ended with Tko or Ko were won by David Bielkheden. So the claim seems to hold true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Tommy DePret be one of the 12 fighters that David Bielkheden have lost to in his career.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if there's an entry where David Bielkheden has fought Tommy DePret and lost. \n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- The first few rows are about David Bielkheden's wins against fighters like Steve Dawson, Josenildo Ramarho, etc. I don't see any mention of Tommy DePret here.\n- Scanning further, in row 15, there's a fighter named Tommy Haddock who David Bielkheden defeated by KO. Not the same as Tommy DePret.\n- Then in row 16, it says \"Tommy de Pret\" which catches my eye. The fighter is Patrick Vallee who defeated Tommy DePret via submission. Wait, so the fighter is Tommy DePret, but the result is a loss for David Bielkheden because he was submitted by Vallee.\n- So in this case, David Bielkheden lost to Tommy DePret. That's one loss.\n\nI need to check if there are 12 such losses. The table has many rows, and I don't have the exact count of all of David's Bielkheden's fights. But since at least one of them is a loss against Tommy DePret, the claim that he lost to him is true. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be the row where David Bielkheden fought Tommy DePret and lost.

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Nikola Matic.\"\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. David Bielkheden is a fighter, as are the names mentioned like Nikola Matic. The claim suggests that David's best win (highest record) occurred specifically against Nikola Matic in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where these two fighters faced each other in Stockholm. So, I'll go through each row and look for \"Stockholm, Sweden\" as the location. \n\nStarting from row 0: The location is not mentioned here, so move on. Row 1: Location is London, England. Not it. Row 2: Coventry, England. No. Row3: London again. Row4: Coventry again. Row5: Hakata, Japan. Not Stockholm. Row6: Stockholm, Sweden! Now, who did David Bielkheden fight here? The opponent's name is Valdas Pocevi\u010di\u016bs. Hmm, that's not Nikola Matic.\n\nContinuing, row7: Belfast, Northern Ireland. No. Row8: London again. Row9: Tokyo, Japan. Not Stockholm. Row10: Helsinki, Finland. No. Row11: London, England. Row12: Coventry again. Row13: Hakata again. Row14: Stockholm, Sweden! Opponent is Patrick Vallee. Still not Matic.\n\nRow15: Belfast again. Rows16-27: Most are in different locations, but I'm looking specifically for Stockholm. Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nLooking for \"Stockholm, Sweden\" as the location. It occurs at rows 6 and 14. \n\nAt row6 (index 6), opponent is Patrick Vallee. At row14 (index14), opponent is Tom Haddock. Neither of these are Nikola Matic.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a match where David Bielkheden fought against Nikola Matic in Stockholm. Scanning the entire table, I don't see any such entry where both the location is Stockholm and the opponent is Nikola Matic.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow0: Not relevant.\n...\nRow6: David vs Valdas Pocevi\u010di\u016bs in Stockholm. No.\nRow14: David vs Tom Haddock in Stockholm.

    "claim": "david bielkheden win a majority of his match by ko",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if David Bielkheden won a majority of his matches by KO based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The claim is that David Bielkheden won \"a majority of his match by ko.\" That implies two things: he has a significant number of wins (more than half) and that each of those wins was by Knock Out (KO).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight or match. Each column seems to have specific attributes like the result (Win/Loss), method of victory (KO, Submission, etc.), the opponent's name, and other details.\n\nSo my first task is to determine which rows are wins for David Bielkheden. I should go through each row where \"Winner\" is David Bielkheden. For each such case, I need to check if his victory was by KO.\n\nLet me look at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Winner is David Bielkheden. He defeated Alexey Ignashov. The result is a KO.\n- Row 1: Opponent is Denis Saittagirov, but it's an 'L', so not relevant for wins.\n- Row 2: David has a loss to Bob Chec. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: He lost to Ericson Barbarena. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Lost to Matti Latvala. No.\n- Row 5: Lost to Arben Lafti. No.\n- Rows beyond that also show losses, so only row 0 is a win.\n\nNow, in row 0, the result was a KO. So he has one win by KO. Now, does \"a majority\" mean more than half? Let's see: there are multiple fights listed, and I need to count how many times David won by any method.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Win by KO\n- Rows beyond that show losses until row 17, where he loses again. So only one win in total, which is by KO.\n\nSo does having one win out of several fights constitute a majority? Well, majority would imply more than half. If there are, say, 18 fights in total, a majority would be over 9 wins. But from the table, it's unclear how many fights David has in total. The data only shows some of his matches.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Maybe \"a majority of his match\" refers to all his wins being by KO. That is, whenever he won, it was by KO. Or does it mean that the number of wins by KO is more than the other methods? The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut the exact claim is: \"David Bielkheden win a majority of his match by ko.\" So I think it's saying that he won most of his matches via KO. But in reality, he has only one recorded win by KO. Without knowing how many total wins he has, we can't say if this is a majority.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that all his victories are by KO, meaning every time he won, it was by KO. Let me check each of his wins:\n\nLooking at the table, the only row where David Bielkheden is the winner is row 0. The method there is KO. So in this case, since he has only one win and that was by KO, we can't say he won a majority unless \"a majority\" refers to all of his wins.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's parse the claim again: \"david bielkheden win a majority of his match by ko.\" It could mean two things: either that he has more wins overall and each of those was by KO, or that his total wins are more than half, and all were by KO.\n\nGiven the context, it's likely the former: that he won most of his matches by KO. So, if the majority refers to the method of victory, not the number of wins, then every time he won, it was via KO.\n\nLooking back at the table, in row 0, he won by KO. Are there any other rows where he is the winner and used KO? No, because all other wins are by others. So in his own wins (only one), he used KO. Therefore, that single win is a majority of his victories by KO.\n\nBut if \"a majority\" refers to more than half of all matches, then without knowing how many total matches David fought, it's impossible to confirm. For example, if he fought 10 matches and won 6 by any means, the majority would be 6 wins, but we don't know how many were KO.\n\nHowever, looking at the claim again: \"win a majority of his match by ko.\" The phrasing suggests that the method is KO for the majority of his victories. So if all his victories (which are few) were by KO, then yes, he has a majority (all) of his wins by KO.\n\nBut considering that the table only shows a small portion of his fights, it's possible that there are more wins elsewhere where the method isn't KO. Without that information, we can't definitively say whether he won a majority by KO.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. The user is asking to verify based on the given table, which only shows specific matches. So in the provided data, David has one win (by KO), and all other outcomes are losses or other methods. Therefore, if we consider \"a majority\" as a plurality rather than strict majority, then having one win by KO would suffice.\n\nBut strictly speaking, a majority requires more than half of the total number of victories. Since only one victory is shown, unless there are other wins elsewhere that aren't documented here, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"a majority\" refers to all his victories being by KO. So in this case, since he has only one victory and it was by KO, then yes, he won a majority of his matches (all) by KO.\n\nSo, considering the table provided, David Bielkheden has at least one win by KO, which could be considered a majority if there are no other wins. Therefore, the claim is true based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n- **David Bielkheden** has one recorded victory (against Alexey Ignashov) via Knock Out (KO).\n- There are no other documented victories where his method of victory was KO.\n- The term \"a majority\" could imply that all of his victories were by KO, which is true in this case since he only has one win.\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, David Bielkheden won a majority of his matches (specifically, all) by Knock Out based on the given data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim made by the user. The claim is: \"David Bielkheden fought a total of 5 games in Turku, Finland, 75% of which were wins.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row and column in the provided table to see if this holds true.\n\nLet me start by understanding what's needed here. The user wants to know two things: \n1. Did David Bielkheden fight exactly 5 games in Turku, Finland?\n2. Of those 5 fights, did he win 75% of them?\n\nSo I'll need to find all the rows where \"Town/City\" is Turku and \"Country\" is Finland. Then, count how many wins are there out of these.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details like \"Opponent\", \"Event\", \"Date\", etc., but I'm particularly interested in whether the location is Turku, Finland. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is unknown, Event is not clear, but location isn't mentioned. So probably not relevant.\n2. Row 1: No location info.\n3. Row 2: No location info.\n4. Rows 3-5: No location info.\n5. Row 6: Location is Turku, Finland. Opponent is Patrick Vallee, event is \"shooto sweden - second impact\", result is a win. So that's one win in Turku.\n\nContinuing:\n- Row 7: Belfast\n- Rows 8-10: Various locations\n- Row 11: Tokyo\n- Row 12: Helsinki\n- Row 13: Helsinki\n- Row 14: Turku, Finland. Opponent is Joni Kyllonen, result is a win. That's two wins in Turku.\n- Row 15: Turku, opponent Kai Rintakorpi, submission loss. So that doesn't count as a win.\n- Row 16: Turku, opponent unknown (Arben Lafti), decision loss. Not a win.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nLooking at the table, I'll list out the rows where City is Turku and Country is Finland.\n\nRow indices mentioned by user are from 0 to 35.\n\nLooking for \"City\" column: It seems that the table doesn't explicitly state \"City\" as a column. Instead, it mentions \"Town/City\" or just location in some columns like \"Event\". \n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the \"Location\" or \"Event Location\" column? Or maybe it's embedded within the \"Opponent\" or \"Event\" descriptions.\n\nThis might be tricky because the table structure isn't entirely clear. Let me assume that the \"Town/City\" is a specific column. If I don't see \"Town/City\", perhaps I need to infer from the event names or other columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has a \"Location\" column which I haven't considered yet. But in the provided data, it's not clear. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's initial message, each row seems to have details like Opponent, Event, Date, etc., but I don't see a specific \"City\" or \"Town/City\" column. Maybe that information is embedded within the \"Event\" description or somewhere else.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps I need to look at each row's data again.\n\nLet me try another approach: look for any rows where the event mentions Turku, Finland.\n\nFor example:\n- Row 5: Event is \"shooto finland - capital punishment\", location might be Helsinki? Not sure.\n- Row 12: Opponent from Helsinki.\n- Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the user's claim refers to specific rows where David fought in Turku, Finland.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user provided a table that includes all fights by David Bielkheden, and each row is a fight with details including location.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents one fight, so I need to check for any fight where the location is Turku, Finland, and then count how many wins he had there.\n\nSo let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: No location info.\n- Row 1: Opponent unknown, but \"shooto sweden - second impact\" in Stockholm. So not Turku.\n- Row 6: Location is Stockholm, Sweden. Not Finland.\n- Row 7: Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n- Row 8: Tokyo, Japan.\n- Row 12: Helsinki, Finland.\n- Row 13: Helsinki, Finland.\n- Row 14: Stockholm, Sweden.\n- Row 15: Turku, Finland? Because event is \"shooto sweden - initial collision\" in Stockholm. Wait, no, that's Stockholm.\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check for any rows where the location is Turku and country is Finland.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 16: Opponent Arben Lafti, event \"shooto sweden - second impact\", so that's in Stockholm. Not Turku.\n\nHmm, I might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps some rows have locations explicitly mentioned in the \"Opponent\" or \"Event\".\n\nWait, perhaps row 15 is in Turku because it mentions \"Turku\". Let me check:\n\nRow 15: Opponent unknown, event is \"shooto sweden - initial collision\", which might be in Stockholm. So not Turku.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the user's claim refers to any fight in Finland, but specifically in Turku.\n\nIn that case, from the rows provided, how many times did David Bielkheden fight in Turku, Finland?\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 6: Stockholm, Sweden.\n- Row 12: Helsinki, Finland.\n- Row 13: Helsinki, Finland.\n- Row 14: Stockholm, Sweden.\n- Row 15: ?\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the correct rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to all fights in Finland, regardless of city. But the claim specifies Turku.\n\nI think without explicit location info in each row, it's hard to verify. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that he fought 5 games in total in Turku, with 75% wins.\n\nAssuming that, let me count how many times he fought and won in Turku.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nLooking for rows where Opponent is listed as someone specific in Turku, Finland.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a fight, so I'll list out all fights in Turku:\n\n- Row 6: Not Turku.\n- Row 12: Helsinki, not Turku.\n- Row 13: Helsinki, not Turku.\n- Row 14: Stockholm, not Turku.\n- Row 15: Maybe Turku? Opponent unknown, event is \"shooto sweden - second impact\". Wait, that's in Stockholm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Alternatively, maybe the user's table isn't properly structured, making it difficult to extract location info.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the user has a specific set of rows where David fought in Turku, Finland, and of those, 75% were wins.\n\nLooking through the table again, I notice that in row 14 (index 14), the opponent is Joni Kyllonen, event is \"shooto sweden - capital punishment\", and result is a win. That's one win in Turku.\n\nIn row 15 (index 15), opponent is Kai Rintakorpi, result is a loss.\n\nRow 16: Opponent Arben Lafti, result is loss.\n\nSo only one win in Turku.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to five fights. So perhaps the user's claim isn't accurate based on this data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing some rows where he fought in Turku.\n\nWait, let me check each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent unknown, event not clear.\n- Row 1: Sweden, Stockholm.\n- Row 2: Sweden, Stockholm.\n- Row 3: Sweden, Stockholm.\n- Row 4: Japan, Tokyo.\n- Row 5: Finland, Helsinki? Or Sweden?\nWait, the event is \"shooto sweden - capital punishment\", so likely in Stockholm.\n\nRow 6: Sweden, Stockholm.\n\nRow 7: Belfast.\n\nRows 8-11: Various locations.\n\nRow 12: Helsinki, Finland.\n\nRow 13: Helsinki, Finland.\n\nRow 14: Sweden, Stockholm.\n\nRow 15: ?\nWait, perhaps row 15 is Turku. Let me check:\n\nRow 15: Opponent Kai Rintakorpi, event \"shooto sweden - initial collision\", so that's in Stockholm.\n\nSo I'm struggling to find five fights in Turku, Finland. From the table, it seems like he fought in Helsinki a couple of times and in Stockholm several times, but only one fight in Turku with a win.\n\nThis suggests that the claim might not be accurate based on the provided data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 14: Opponent Joni Kyllonen, Event \"shooto sweden - capital punishment\", which is in Turku? Or Stockholm?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing event locations. \"Shooto sweden\" events are likely in Sweden, so Turku wouldn't be mentioned.\n\nThus, perhaps David Bielkheden didn't fight five times in Turku, Finland, let alone with 75% wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't seem to hold based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that David Bielkhoven fought five matches in Turku, Finland, with a 75% win rate is not supported by the provided data. The analysis reveals only one documented victory in Turku against Joni Kyllonen, suggesting the claim may be inaccurate.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is not accurate based on the given information.",

    "claim": "david bielkheden have lose every match that end with a tko or ko across his career",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"David Bielkheden has lost every match that ended with a Tko or KO across his career\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of this claim means.\n\nFirst, David Bielkheden's record is given in a table where each row represents a fight. The columns include variables like 'Opponent', 'Result', and others. I'm specifically interested in the 'Result' column because it indicates whether the match ended with a KO or Tko (Technical Knockout).\n\nThe claim states that Bielkheden has lost every match that ended with KO or Tko. So, whenever his fight resulted in a KO or Tko, he should have lost.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row where the result is either KO or Tko and verify if the 'Result' shows a loss for Bielkheden.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Opponent is unknown, Result is 'KO', Outcome is 'Loss'. So this is relevant because it's a KO and he lost.\n2. Second row: Opponent is Arbin Mahmodov, Result is 'KO', Outcome is 'Loss'. Again, KO and loss, so relevant.\n3. Third row: Opponent is Steve Dawson, Result is 'KO', Outcome is 'Win'. Here, the result is KO but outcome is Win, which contradicts the claim.\n4. Fourth row: Opponent is Josenildo Ramarho, Result is 'Submission', Outcome is 'Loss'. This isn't a KO/TKO, so not relevant for this check.\n5. Fifth row: Opponent is Shiko Yamashita, Result is 'Decision (Majority)', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, so irrelevant.\n6. Sixth row: Opponent is Patrick Vallee, Result is 'Submission', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n7. Seventh row: Opponent is Tom Haddock, Result is 'KO', Outcome is 'Win'. Again, KO but he won, which contradicts the claim.\n8. Eighth row: Opponent is Valdas Pocevi\u016bdius, Result is 'Decision', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n9. Ninth row: Opponent is Ryuta Sakurai, Result is 'Decision (Unanimous)', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n10. Tenth row: Opponent is Sigitas Antanavi\u010dius, Result is 'KO', Outcome is 'Win'. Here, he won despite the KO, so again a counterexample.\n11. Eleventh row: Opponent is Charles McCarthy, Result is 'Submission (Strikes)', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n12. Twelfth row: Opponent is Kimmo Nurkse, Result is 'Submission', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n13. Thirteenth row: Opponent is Joni Kyllonen, Result is 'Decision (Unanimous)', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n14. Fourteenth row: Opponent is Kai Rintakorpi, Result is 'Submission (Punches)', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n15. Fifteenth row: Opponent is Arben Lafti, Result is 'Decision', Outcome is 'Loss'. Not KO/TKO, irrelevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, I can see that in several matches where the result was KO or Tko (rows 1,2,7,10), David Bielkheden did not lose. In fact, he won some of those matches (rows 3,7,10). This directly contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI also need to note which cells are relevant for this check. These would be any row where the 'Result' is either KO or Tko and the 'Outcome' is 'Loss'. Let me list them:\n\n- Row 0: KO, Loss\n- Row 1: KO, Loss\n- Row 3: KO, Win (This contradicts, so relevant as well)\n- Row 7: KO, Win\n- Row 10: KO, Win\n\nWait, the claim is that he lost every match ending in KO/TKO. So rows where Result is KO and Outcome is Loss are relevant to support the claim, while those with KO but Win contradict it. Therefore, all these rows should be included as relevant cells because they either support or counter the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would include:\n\n- All rows where 'Result' is KO/TKO (rows 0,1,3,7,10)\n- Additionally, rows where Result is KO but Outcome is Win (to show he didn't lose) which are also relevant for this check.\n\nTherefore, I'll list all these rows as the relevant cells because they are the ones that either support or contradict the claim.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim \"David Bielkheden has lost every match that ended with a KO or Tko\" is **false**. Here's why:\n\n- In multiple matches where the result was KO (rows 0,1,3,7,10), David Bielkheden did not lose but instead either won or the outcome is listed as 'Loss' in some cases. This contradicts the claim.\n\nThe relevant cells are all rows where the 'Result' column indicates a KO or Tko:\n\n- **Row 0:** Opponent unknown, Result: KO, Outcome: Loss\n- **Row 1:** Arbin Mahmodov, Result: KO, Outcome: Loss\n- **Row 3:** Steve Dawson, Result: KO, Outcome: Win\n- **Row 7:** Tom Haddock, Result: KO, Outcome: Win\n- **Row 10:** Sigitas Antanavi\u010dius, Result: KO, Outcome: Win\n\nThese rows are included because they either support or contradict the claim, providing evidence for the analysis.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Tommy De Pret be one of the 14 fighters that David Bielkheden have lost to in his career.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The claim mentions two fighters: Tommy De Pret and David Bielkheden. It's saying that out of 14 losses David has, Tommy is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows where the fighter's name is \"Tommy De Pret\" or any variation, but it seems like his name is spelled consistently as \"tommy depret.\" So I'll search for that exact spelling in the Fighter column.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check if \"tommy depret\" appears. \n\nStarting from row 0: The fighter's name isn't matching. Row 1: No match either. This pattern continues until I find a row where the fighter is \"tommy depret.\" Let me check each row:\n\nRow 14: Fighter is \"Tommy De Pret\"? Wait, actually looking back, in the table provided, the rows are numbered from 0 to 35. I need to scan through each row's Fighter column.\n\nLooking at row 14: Fighter is \"Tommy De Pret.\" So yes, that's a match. Now, I need to see if David Bielkheden lost to him. So in the same row, I should check if the Opponent is David Bielkheden.\n\nRow 14 has Opponent as \"David Bielkheden\" and Result as KO in round 1. So that means Tommy De Pret defeated David Bielkheden.\n\nNow, I need to see how many losses David Bielkheden has in total. The claim says it's 14 fighters he lost to. But the table doesn't provide a direct count of his losses; it just lists each fight where he was either a fighter or opponent.\n\nWait, the table seems to list fights where David Bielkheden is either the Fighter or Opponent. So for each row, if David is the Fighter, it's his win. If he's the Opponent, it's someone else's win over him, which counts as a loss for him.\n\nSo I need to count all rows where David Bielkheden is listed as the Opponent. That would be his losses.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 14: Opponent is David Bielkheden \u2192 that's one loss.\nAny other rows? Let me check each row quickly.\n\nRows where Opponent is \"David Bielkheden\":\n\n- Row 14: Fighter is Tommy De Pret, Opponent is David Bielkheden.\nIs there another row with Opponent as David Bielkheden?\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 16: Opponent is David Bielkheden. Fighter is Steve Dawson. So that's another loss for David.\n\nWait, let me list all such rows where David is the Opponent.\n\nRow 14: Tommy De Pret vs David \u2192 loss\nRow 16: Steve Dawson vs David \u2192 loss\nAny others?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nAt row 17: Opponent is not David.\nRow 18: No.\nContinue until row 35. I think only rows 14 and 16 have David as Opponent.\n\nSo that's two losses, but the claim says 14 fighters. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a fight where either David is fighting or someone else is fighting against him. So every time David is listed as the Opponent, it counts as one loss for him.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Fighter = Tommy De Pret vs Opponent = ??? Maybe not David.\nRow 1: Fighter = Josenildo Ramarho vs Opponent = Steve Dawson \u2192 no\n...\nRow 14: Fighter = Tommy De Pret vs Opponent = David Bielkheden \u2192 loss\nRow 16: Fighter = Steve Dawson vs Opponent = David \u2192 loss\nAny others?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me go through each row:\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of fights where the fighter is on one side and opponent on the other. So whenever David Bielkheden is listed as the Opponent, that's one of his losses.\n\nSo let's scan each row's Opponent column for \"David Bielkheden.\"\n\nStarting from row 0:\n\nRow 14: Opponent = David \u2192 count 1\nRow 16: Opponent = David \u2192 count 2\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLooking at the rows beyond that, I don't see another entry where Opponent is David. So he has two losses.\n\nBut the claim says he lost to 14 fighters. That doesn't match. Unless I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps the table includes more fights where David was the opponent, but maybe I missed some rows. Let me check again.\n\nRows beyond row 16:\n\nRow 17: Opponent = ?\nRow 18: Not relevant.\n...\nRow 34: Fighter is Tommy De Pret vs Opponent = Jorgen Remstrup \u2192 no\nRow 35: Fighter is David Bielkheden vs Opponent = ? \u2192 that's a win for David.\n\nWait, row 35 has Fighter as David, so that's a win for him. So only rows where he's the opponent count as losses.\n\nSo in total, only two losses are listed in the table.\n\nBut the claim says 14 fighters he lost to. That suggests there might be more than what's shown here or perhaps the table is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the data is presented. Perhaps each row is a fight where David was either the fighter or opponent, and for each loss, it's listed as Opponent.\n\nBut in this case, only two losses are present.\n\nTherefore, the claim that David lost to 14 fighters isn't supported by the table. Unless there are more rows elsewhere that I didn't consider, but based on what's given, it seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table structure. Maybe each fight is represented as a row, and if David is the Opponent, it counts as a loss. So let me count all such instances.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRows where Opponent is \"David Bielkheden\":\n\n- Row 14: Tommy De Pret vs David \u2192 loss\n- Row 16: Steve Dawson vs David \u2192 loss\n\nThat's two losses. So unless there are more rows not shown, the claim isn't accurate based on this data.\n\nTherefore, the claim that David lost to 14 fighters is false; he only lost twice as per the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again each row for Opponent = David Bielkheden.\n\nLooking at all 36 rows:\n\nRows where Opponent is \"David Bielkheden\":\n\n- Row 14: Tommy De Pret vs David \u2192 loss\n- Row 16: Steve Dawson vs David \u2192 loss\n\nNo others. So only two losses.\n\nThus, the claim that David lost to 14 fighters is incorrect based on this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that David Bielkheden lost to 14 fighters is not supported by the provided data. Based on the table, David has only two confirmed losses, as shown in rows 14 and 16.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; according to the table, David Bielkheden only lost twice, not 14 times.",
