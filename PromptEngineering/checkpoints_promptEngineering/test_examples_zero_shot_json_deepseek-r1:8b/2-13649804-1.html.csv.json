    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim states: \"the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The key points are that there's a tie for the lowest score, involving John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman, both scoring 205.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table to find these two champions and their respective scores. \n\nLooking at the \"champion\" column:\n\n- John Jackson appears in row index 19 (2000). His score is 282.\n- Webb Heintzelman is in row index 17 (1988). His score is 205.\n\nWait, but in row 34, which is 1987, Darrell Kestner scored 210 po. That's a different person. \n\nNow, I need to check if John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman have the same lowest score. \n\nLooking through all the scores:\n\n- John Jackson: 282 in 2000.\n- Webb Heintzelman: 205 in 1988.\n\nBut is there another instance of someone scoring 205? Let's scan each row for a score of 205.\n\nRow 34 (1977): Mike Zacks scored 209. No, that's not it.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I missed someone else with 205.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 2000, Alan Schulte had 282.\n- In 1999, Randall McCracken scored 210 po.\n- In 1988, Webb Heintzelman scored 205.\n- In 1984, Fred Funk scored 206.\n- In 1980, John Jackson scored 205. Oh! Wait a minute, in row index 19, which is 1979, Loren Roberts scored 212. But wait, I might have confused the rows.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The table has entries from 1977 to 1988, and then jumps up to 2000. Let me list all scores:\n\n- 1977: Mike Zacks -209\n- 1978: Larry Griffin -209\n- 1979: Loren Roberts -212\n- 1980: John Jackson -205\n- 1981: Ted O'Rourke -210\n- 1982: Darrell Kestner -213 po\n- 1983: Victor Tortorici -214\n- 1984: Fred Funk -206\n- 1985: John Fiedler -211\n- 1986: Robert Thompson -209\n- 1987: Darrell Kestner -210 po\n- 1988: Webb Heintzelman -205\n- 1989 isn't in the table, but I think we don't have that.\n\nWait, no. The table starts from 1977 up to 1987, then jumps to 2000.\n\nSo, in row index 34 (1977), Mike Zacks scored 209.\nRow 35: Larry Griffin -209\nRow 36: Loren Roberts -212\nRow 37: John Jackson -205 (this is row 19)\nWait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nLet me correct this: The table has rows starting from 0 upwards. So:\n\nLooking for John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman with score 205.\n\nJohn Jackson: Looking through the table, in row index 19 (1980), his score is 205.\n\nWebb Heintzelman: In row index 17 (1988), he scored 205.\n\nSo both have scores of 205. Now, are they tied for the lowest? Let's check if any other person has a lower score than 205.\n\nLooking through all the table entries:\n\nThe lowest score in the table is 205, achieved by John Jackson (in 1980) and Webb Heintzelman (in 1988). So yes, they are tied at 205 for the lowest championship score. There's no one else with a lower score than that.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the highest championship score be 284 by steve brady in 1993.\" So I need to check if there's a record in the table where Steve Brady scored 284 at the championship event in 1993.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, champion, venue, location, and score. Each row represents a different year with corresponding details.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match the claim. Starting from 1993, I remember that the user already provided some rows above and below. Let me check the 1993 entry first.\n\nIn the data section, the 1993 row is:\n[\n  1993,\n  \"steve brady\",\n  \"pga west , jack nicklaus private course\",\n  \"la quinta , california\",\n  \"284\"\n]\n\nThat looks promising because Steve Brady is listed as the champion with a score of 284 in 1993. So this directly matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no higher score. The claim says \"the highest championship score,\" so I need to check if any other entries have a higher score than 284. Let me scan through the rest of the data.\n\nLooking at the scores:\n\n- Some years like 1997 had scores around 280.\n- Earlier years in the 2000s, mostly mid-200s.\n- Moving to the 1980s, I see scores like 210, 211, and up to 214.\n- In the 1970s, the highest was 212.\n\nSo comparing all these, 284 is indeed higher than any other score in the table. Therefore, Steve Brady's 284 in 1993 is the highest championship score as per the table data.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify which rows and columns correspond to this information. The relevant row is 1993 (row_index: 18 if we count from 0). Columns are year (to check the year), champion (for Steve Brady), venue, location, and score (284).\n\nSo the relevant cells would be for each of these pieces of information in that specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided. Steve Brady did indeed have a championship score of 284 in 1993, and this is the highest score found in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Bruce Zabriski's score is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"Bruce Zabriski scored 282 at PGA National Golf Club, Haig & Champion course.\" So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where the champion is Bruce Zabriski and the score is 282, and the venue includes both PGA National Golf Club and Haig & Champion courses.\n\nFirst, let me look at the columns: year, champion, venue, location, score. So, I need to scan through each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll go through each row one by one. Starting from 1995 onwards because that's when Bruce Zabriski appears. Let me check:\n\nIn 1995, the champion is \"bruce zabriski\", venue is \"pga national golf club , haig & champion courses\", location is palm beach gardens, florida, and score is 282. That seems to match exactly what the claim says.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there aren't any other entries for Bruce Zabriski with the same score or conflicting information. Let me check earlier years as well, just in case. From 2000 onwards, it seems Bruce isn't listed again. Before that, he's not mentioned either. So, 1995 is his only entry.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. The relevant cells are where row_index is 14 (since the list starts at 0, so index 14 corresponds to 1995), column_name is \"score\", and of course the other columns as well. But according to the instructions, I need to provide each relevant cell's row index and column name.\n\nSo, in the table, Bruce Zabriski is at row_index 14 (since it starts from 0). The score is at column 4, which is \"score\". Also, his venue includes both the club and courses mentioned. So, all three columns: champion, score, and venue are relevant.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, they only listed the columns that matched. So, perhaps I should list all relevant cells that support the claim. That would be:\n\n- row_index 14, column_name \"score\" for the 282\n- row_index 14, column_name \"champion\" for Bruce Zabriski\n- row_index 14, column_name \"venue\" since it mentions both clubs\n\nBut actually, according to the instructions, I need to list all cells that are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim mentions three specific things: name, score, and venue. So each of these corresponds to a column in the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. row_index 14, \"champion\"\n2. row_index 14, \"score\"\n3. row_index 14, \"venue\"\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that the venue is exactly as stated. Let me look at the 1995 entry again: \"pga national golf club , haig & champion course\". Yes, it has both the club and the courses mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, yes, all three columns are relevant. Therefore, I need to include each of these cells in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a single entry in the table where Bruce Zabriski scored 282 at the specified venue. The relevant cells are his champion status, the score, and the venue details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 4 championship score at la quinta , california , in 1991 - 1994.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions four specific years (1991-1994) and a location (La Quinta, California). It refers to \"championship score,\" which likely corresponds to the \"score\" column in the table.\n\nNext, I'll look through the table to find any rows that match these criteria. The table has columns: year, champion, venue, location, score. \n\nI'll start by checking each row from 1991 onwards. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n- **1994**: The location is \"la quinta , california.\" Looking at the data, the 1994 entry has a location of La Quinta, California. The venue is \"pga west , jack nicklaus private course,\" but since we're focusing on the location column, that's relevant. There's also a score of 283. So this row is relevant.\n\n- **1993**: Location is also La Quinta, California. Score is 284. Relevant.\n\n- **1992**: Same location and year range. Score is 283. Relevant.\n\n- **1991**: Again, La Quinta, California. The score here is 278. So that's four entries: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, all with the location of La Quinta, California in their respective years within 1991-1994. Each has a \"score\" value.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"there be 4 championship score.\" So it's looking for four entries where in those specific years (1991-1994), there was a championship held at La Quinta, California, each with their own scores.\n\nLooking back at the table, I see that from 1985 onwards, the location is Brockton, Massachusetts except for some later years which are either La Quinta or others. The entries in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994 have La Quinta as their location, so they fit.\n\nEach of these four rows has a score associated with them. Therefore, the claim is supported by four relevant cells: each row from 1991 to 1994 at La Quinta, California in the \"location\" column, and each has a corresponding score in the \"score\" column.\n\nSo all four years (1991-1994) have entries where the location is La Quinta, California, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the highest championship score be a tie between robert thompson and mike west at 211.\"\n\nTo verify this, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. **Highest Championship Score**: This implies that we're looking for the maximum value in the 'score' column.\n2. **Tie Between Robert Thompson and Mike West**: Both these individuals should have the same highest score.\n3. **Score of 211**: The highest score is specifically stated as 211.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several columns: year, champion, venue, location, and score. My focus will be on the 'score' column to find the maximum value and check if Robert Thompson and Mike West are tied at that score.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n- Starting from 2013 down to 1999, I notice scores ranging from 271 up to 282. The highest scores during these years don't include 211.\n  \n- Then, looking at the rows starting from 1980 onwards, specifically around the 1970s and earlier, there are several entries with scores in the 200s.\n\n- Focusing on 1980: John Jackson scored 205.\n- 1981: Ted O'Rourke scored 210.\n- 1982: Darrell Kestner scored 213 po. (I assume \"po\" is a typo or shorthand, but for the purposes of this check, I'll consider it as 213.)\n- 1983: Victor Tortorici scored 214.\n- 1984: Fred Funk scored 206.\n- 1985: John Fiedler scored 211.\n- 1986: Robert Thompson scored 209.\n- 1987: Darrell Kestner scored 210 po (assuming 210).\n- 1988: Webb Heintzelman scored 205.\n- 1989 wasn't provided, but we can infer that in later years, scores go up again.\n\nWait a minute, I see John Fiedler scored 211 in 1985. Is this the highest score? Let me check other rows to confirm.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nIn the earlier part of the table (from 2013 down), the highest score is 282, which is much higher than 211.\n\nWhen moving down to around 1985-1990, John Fiedler scored 211 in 1985. Are there any other scores above this?\n\nLooking at 1986: Robert Thompson scored 209.\n1987: Darrell Kestner scored 210.\n1988: Webb Heintzelman scored 205.\n\nNo, none of these are higher than 211. So John Fiedler has the highest score of 211 in 1985.\n\nNow, checking for a tie between Robert Thompson and Mike West at 211:\n\nLooking through the table for both Robert Thompson and Mike West:\n\n- **Robert Thompson** is mentioned in 1986 with a score of 209.\n- I don't see any other entries for Robert Thompson. So he only scored 209.\n\n- **Mike West**: There are two entries:\n  - In 1990, Mike West scored 210.\n  - In 1979, Loren Roberts scored 212, which is higher than both.\n\nWait, in the table, under 1985: John Fiedler scored 211. Then in 1986: Robert Thompson scored 209. Later, in 1987: Darrell Kestner scored 210. In 1990 (row index not specified), Mike West scored 210.\n\nSo neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West have a score of 211. The highest score by an individual is John Fiedler with 211, and he's the only one at that score.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the highest championship score be a tie between robert thompson and mike west at 211\" is FALSE because:\n\n1. There's no tie; only John Fiedler has 211.\n2. Neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West achieved a score of 211.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other high scores that might make the claim incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- In 1983: Victor Tortorici scored 214.\n- In 1984: Fred Funk scored 206.\n- In 1979: Loren Roberts scored 212.\n- In 1980: John Jackson scored 205.\n\nThe highest score in the table is 214 by Victor Tortorici in 1983. So, the claim about a tie at 211 is incorrect because the actual highest score is higher and achieved by someone else.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\", with no relevant cells since none of Robert Thompson or Mike West have a score of 211.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"all scores from 1996 - 2013 be at courses in port st lucie , florida.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that for each year between 1996 and 2013, all the scores were achieved by golfers playing at the \"PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course\" located in Port St Lucie, Florida.\n\nSo, my task is to go through each relevant row from 1996 to 2013 and check two things: \n1. Whether the score for that year was indeed played at a location that's part of the PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course in Port St Lucie.\n2. Ensure that all such scores are only for events held there.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on rows where the year is between 1996 and 2013. For each of these rows, I need to check the \"venue\" and \"location\" columns.\n\nStarting with 1996: The row has \"pga golf club , wanamaker course\" as venue and location \"port st lucie , florida\". So that's good for 1996.\n\n1997: venue is \"pga golf club , ryder course\", but the location is still Port St Lucie. Hmm, so it's a different course within the same PGA Golf Club. I'm not sure if playing at a different course within the same location would count as being in Port St Lucie or not. But the claim says \"at courses in port st lucie,\" which might imply specific venues.\n\nWait, maybe the key is whether the entire event for that year was held at Port St Lucie. So, even if the venue is different but still in Port St Lucie, it's okay as long as all scores are from events there. But I'm not sure. Maybe the claim is stricter, requiring all scores to be from a specific course within Port St Lucie.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"at courses in port st lucie,\" which could mean any golf course in that city, but looking at the table, it seems that most of the Port St Lucie entries are either at the Wanamaker Course or sometimes the Ryder Course. But from 1996 to 2013, let's check each year:\n\n1996: PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course \u2013 yes\n1997: PGA Golf Club, Ryder Course \u2013 yes (still in Port St Lucie)\n1998: Not sure, but looking at the table, it might be another course. Wait, actually, from 1980 onwards, many entries are for Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, MA, which is a different location. So that's outside of Port St Lucie.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check rows starting from 1996:\n\nLooking at the table, rows around that time:\n\nIn the years 1996-2013, many entries have locations other than Port St Lucie. For example:\n\n- 1980 onwards: Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton, MA\n- Some years in between also have different locations.\n\nWait, no, looking at the data provided, from row 1980 to 1977, but wait, the rows go down from 1977 to 2013. So I need to focus on rows where year is between 1996 and 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, for each of those years:\n\n- For example, in 2000: \"thorny lea golf club\", Brockton, MA \u2013 that's not Port St Lucie.\n\nSo, if any of these scores are from a different location, then the claim is false because it's saying all scores in 1996-2013 were at courses in Port St Lucie, but some are from other places like Brockton.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there are scores for years within that range that took place outside of Port St Lucie.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to be precise. The claim says \"all scores from 1996-2013 be at courses in port st lucie\". So it's about the location of each score, meaning that every event from '96-'13 was held in Port St Lucie.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nLooking for years between 1996 and 2013:\n\n1980: No\n1981: No\n...\n1984: No\n1985: No\n1986: No\n1987: No\n1988: No\n1989: No\n1990: No\n1991: No\n1992: No\n1993: No\n1994: No\n1995: No\n1996: Yes (Port St Lucie)\n1997: Yes (Port St Lucie, but different course within same club)\nWait, is Ryder Course in Port St Lucie? The location is Port St Lucie, FL. So 1997 is okay.\nBut then 1998: Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nI think some years between 1996-2013 have locations other than Port St Lucie. For example, 2000 has Thorny Lea in Brockton, MA. So that would be outside of Port St Lucie.\n\nTherefore, since not all scores from '96-'13 are in Port St Lucie, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all scores between 1996 and 2013 were achieved at courses in Port St Lucie, Florida. However, upon reviewing the table, it's clear that some years within this range had events held elsewhere, such as Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, MA.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For each year between 1996 and 2013 where the event was not at Port St Lucie:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2000, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since the exact rows aren't specified, but it's evident that some years fall outside Port St Lucie, here is a general structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2000, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The specific row indices may vary based on the exact data, but it's clear that not all scores are from Port St Lucie during 1996-2013.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bruce zabriski score 284 at thorny lea golf club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions three things: the name \"bruce zabriski,\" the score \"284,\" and the location \"thorny lea golf club.\" So, to verify the claim, I need to check if there's a row in the table where the champion is bruce zabriski, the score is 284, and the venue includes thorny lea golf club.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, champion, venue, location, score. The data starts from 1977 up to 2013, but I notice that in some rows, the venue might include multiple courses separated by commas, like \"pga national golf club , haig & champion courses\" or \"thorny lea golf club.\"\n\nI should go through each row and check if any of them match all three criteria.\n\nStarting from the top, I see that the first few rows are from 2013 down to 2000, with champions like frank bensel, jake scott, etc. None of these seem to be bruce zabriski, so I can skip those.\n\nThen I spot a row for 1995 where the champion is \"bruce zabriski.\" Let me check that row:\n\n- Year: 1995\n- Champion: Bruce Zabriski\n- Venue: \"pga national golf club , haig & champion courses\"\n- Location: \"PGA National Golf Club, Haig & Champion Courses\"\n- Score: Not explicitly mentioned here; the score cell is empty.\n\nWait, in that row, the score column doesn't have a value. So that can't be the one. Then I look further down to find where \"thorny lea golf club\" is mentioned. Scrolling through, I see rows from 1980 onwards where the venue and location are \"thorny lea golf club.\" For example:\n\n- 1984: Fred Funk\n- 1985: John Fiedler\n- Etc.\n\nNone of these champions are bruce zabriski. So, in all the rows where the venue is thorny lea golf club, the champion isn't bruce zabriski with a score of 284.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row more carefully. Looking through the data:\n\n- In 1995, Bruce Zabriski's row doesn't have a score listed.\n- Going back to the claim, the score is 284. So, perhaps in another row where he played at thorny lea golf club.\n\nWait, let me check the rows after 1995 again. Hmm, I don't see any other entries for Bruce Zabriski beyond 1995 in the table provided. The rest of the data seems to be about different champions and venues.\n\nSo, considering all this, there is no row where the champion is bruce zabriski, the score is 284, and the venue is thorny lea golf club. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not have a matching entry in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It mentions three specific things: the lowest score, 206, achieved by Fred Funk in 1984. So, to verify this, I need to check if there's a record of Fred Funk winning in 1984 with a score of 206.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, champion, venue, location, and score. The data is in rows, each representing a different year from 1977 up to 2013.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row where the year is 1984. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- 1999: Randall McCracken\n- 1998: Rick Gehr\n- 1997: Jim Schuman\n- 1996: Jim Schuman\n- 1995: Bruce Zabriski\n- 1994: Wes Short, Jr.\n- 1993: Steve Brady\n- 1992: Bill Loeffler\n- 1991: Kim Thompson\n- 1990: Steve Gotsche\n- 1989: Mike West\n- 1988: Webb Heintzelman\n- 1987: Darrell Kestner\n- 1986: Robert Thompson\n- 1985: John Fiedler\n- 1984: Fred Funk\n\nOkay, so the row for 1984 is indeed there. The champion that year is Fred Funk. Now I need to check the score column for that row.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column under Fred Funk in 1984, it says 206. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no lower score than 206 in other years by Fred Funk or others. However, the claim specifically mentions Fred Funk and 1984, so I don't need to check all scores globally unless the claim is implying that across all years, the lowest score was 206. But reading the claim again: \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984.\" It sounds like it's asserting that in 1984, Fred Funk had a score of 206 which was the lowest.\n\nTo confirm this, I should check if there are any scores lower than 206 in other years. For example, in 1977, Mike Zack scored 209; in 1985, John Fiedler scored 211; and so on. But Fred Funk's score in 1984 is 206. I also need to check if any other champion had a lower score in their winning year.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The lowest score mentioned is 205 by John Jackson in 1980.\n- There are several scores around 205, but nothing below that except Fred Funk's 206 and others like Darrell Kestner with 213 po or similar. However, I think \"po\" might indicate a playoff score, which could be different from the championship score.\n\nWait, in some rows, the score has \"po\" at the end, like 210 po or 213 po. That might mean that those scores are from a playoff, not the actual championship. So Fred Funk's score of 206 is in 1984 without a \"po,\" indicating it's his championship score.\n\nTherefore, comparing across all championship scores (without considering play-offs as they're separate), Fred Funk scored 206 in 1984, which is the lowest in that year and perhaps even lower than some other years.\n\nI should also confirm if any other years have a lower score. For example, in 1979, Loren Roberts scored 212; 1983 had Victor Tortorici with 214. The scores before 1984 don't go below 205 except for Fred Funk's 206 in 1984.\n\nSo, since Fred Funk indeed had a championship score of 206 in 1984 and that seems to be the lowest among all entries, especially considering other years don't have lower than 205 without play-offs, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 3 championship score at bockton , massachusetts in 1991 - 1994.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's talking about championship scores specifically in Bockton, Massachusetts, from 1991 to 1994. Wait, but looking at the table, I don't see any entries for \"Bockton\". Instead, there are locations like \"brockton , massachusetts\" and others. Maybe it's a typo? Let me check.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"bockton\", but in the table, all locations have \"brockton , massachusetts.\" So that might be a mistake in the claim. But regardless, I need to check if there are three championship scores at Brockton (if it exists) during 1991-1994.\n\nLooking through the data, the table has entries where location is \"brockton , massachusetts\". For example:\n\n- 1990: score 205\n- 1989: score 210\n- 1988: score 205\n- 1987: score 210 po (probably 210 points or something)\n- 1986: score 209\n- 1985: score 211\n- 1984: score 206\n- 1983: score 214\n- 1982: score 213 po\n- 1981: score 210\n- 1980: score 205\n\nSo, these are all under \"brockton , massachusetts\". Now, the claim refers to years 1991-1994. Looking at the table, I don't see any entries for 1991, 1992, 1993, or 1994 in Brockton. The closest is 1989, 1990, etc., but nothing in the early '90s.\n\nWait, let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking from the top, rows 0 to... up to row 29 (since there are 30 entries). Let's see if any of the rows have location \"brockton , massachusetts\" and year between 1991-1994.\n\nRow indices: I think rows start at 0. So let me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 25: 1985\nRow 26: 1986\nRow 27: 1987\nRow 28: 1988\nRow 29: 1989\nWait, no. Wait, the table has entries starting from 1977 up to 1990? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the row indices and years:\n\nRow 0: 1977\n...\nRow 20: 1984\nRow 21: 1985\nRow 22: 1986\nRow 23: 1987\nRow 24: 1988\nRow 25: 1989\nRow 26: 1990\n\nSo, the latest is 1990. Therefore, in the given table, there are no entries for 1991, 1992, 1993, or 1994 under \"brockton , massachusetts\". \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"Bockton\", which might be a typo for \"Brockton\". So maybe it's referring to \"Brockton\" but misspelled as \"Bockton\"? If that's the case, then in the table, there are no entries for 1991-1994. Therefore, the claim would be false because there aren't three championship scores in those years at Brockton.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Bockton\" is correct and it's a different place, but from the table, I don't see any such location. So regardless of the typo, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, because there are no championship scores in Bockton (or Brockton) during 1991-1994 in the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
