    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It's specifically about the player ranked 11 and their goals per match being less than 1.237. So my main focus will be on finding the row where the rank is 11 and then checking the \"goals per match\" value for that player.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by examining each row to see if any have a rank of 11. The table has several rows, so I should go through them one by one.\n\n1. The first few rows have ranks like 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, etc., but none seem to be at rank 11 yet.\n2. Scanning down, I notice that row 12 is for Hugo S\u00e1nchez with a rank of 15. That's higher than 11, so not the one we need.\n3. Continuing further, I see row 16 which has Hugo S\u00e1nchez again but still not rank 11.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me list out all the ranks:\n\n- Row 0: Rank 1\n- Row 1: Rank 2 (Messi)\n- Row 2: Rank 2 (Ronaldo)\n- Row 3: Rank 4\n- Row 4: Rank 5 (Ronaldo)\n- Row 5: Rank 5 (Messi)\n- Row 6: Rank 7\n- Row 7: Rank 7 (Ronaldo, but different season)\n- Row 8: Rank 7 (Messi)\n- Row 9: Rank 10\n- Row 10: Rank 11 (\"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\")\n- Row 11: Rank 12\n- Row 12: Rank 12 (different players)\n- Row 13: Rank 15\n- Row 14: Rank 16\n\nAh, there we go. In row 10, the rank is 11 for \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano.\" That's the player in question.\n\nNow, I need to check the \"goals per match\" column for this player. Looking at row 10:\n\nThe data for row 10 is:\n[\n  11,\n  \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\",\n  \"1956 / 57\",\n  \"real madrid\",\n  43,\n  43,\n  1.0\n]\n\nSo the goals per match here is 1.0.\n\nThe claim states that this player has less than 1.237 goals per match. Since 1.0 is definitely less than 1.237, the claim seems to hold true.\n\nWait a minute\u2014hold on. I think I made a mistake. The row index for rank 11 is row 10 (since rows are zero-indexed). So in that row, the \"goals per match\" is indeed 1.0, which is less than 1.237. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't overlook anything else. The table has multiple players with different ranks and different stats. But the key point is that for rank 11, the goals per match is 1.0, so it's definitely less than 1.237.\n\nI don't see any other relevant rows because the claim specifically mentions rank 11. So I'm confident that the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we identified the player ranked 11 and checked their goals per match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Lionel Messi is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific things: his rank and his goals that season. So, I need to check both in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns, they are rank, name, season, club, goals, apps, and goals per match. The relevant columns for this claim are \"rank\" and \"goals.\"\n\nNow, I'll search through each row for Lionel Messi during the 2011/12 season. Scanning the data:\n\n- Row 0: name is Lionel Messi, season is 2011/12, rank is 1, goals 73.\nWait, so in row 0, his rank is 1, not 2 as stated in the claim. That's a problem because the claim says he was rank 2.\n\nNext, I check if there's another row for 2011/12 where Messi's rank is 2. But looking through all rows, only row 0 has 2011/12 season with Messi, and his rank there is 1.\n\nSo, since his rank isn't 2 in that season according to the table, the claim's first part is false. Also, the goals in row 0 are 73, which matches the claim. But since the rank doesn't match, the overall claim is false.\n\nI don't see any other rows for 2011/12 with Messi, so there's no way his rank could be 2 that season.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Lionel Messi as rank 1 in the 2011/12 season with 73 goals. The claim states he was rank 2, which is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that the rank 11.0 has a higher goals per match (GPM) than 1.237. So, I need to check if in the table, there's a row where the GPM is above 1.237 and the rank is exactly 11.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with their details for a specific season. The columns relevant here are \"rank,\" \"goals per match.\" So I'll focus on these two.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row to find where GPM is greater than 1.237 and check if the rank is 11.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Messi (2011/12) has GPM ~1.217, which is below 1.237.\n- Row 1: Messi (2012/13) has GPM ~1.224, still below.\n- Rows 2 and 3 involve Ronaldo in 2011/12 and 2012/13, both have lower GPMs.\n- Row 4 is Ronaldo in 2010/11 with GPM ~0.981.\n- Rows 5 are Messi again in 2010/11, also below 1.237.\n- Row 6: Puskas (1959/60) has GPM ~1.237. So this is exactly at the threshold, but the claim says \"more than,\" so it doesn't count.\n- Row 7: Ronaldo from 1996/97, GPM ~0.964.\n- Row 8: Messi in 2009/10 with GPM ~0.887.\n- Row 9: Zarra's GPM is ~1.278, which is above 1.237. His rank is 10. So not the one we're looking for.\n- Rows 10: Di St\u00e9fano (rank 11) has GPM exactly 1.0, so below.\n- Row 11: Mariano Mart\u00edn with GPM ~1.355, which is above 1.237. His rank is 12.\n- Row 12: Puskas again in 1960/61, GPM ~1.077, but rank 12.\n- Row 13: S\u00e1nchez (1989/90) has GPM ~0.933.\n- Row 14: S\u00e1nchez in 1986/87 with GPM ~0.759.\n- Row 15: Puskas again with GPM exactly 1.0 and rank 16.\n\nWait, I think I missed some rows. Let me recount from the data array:\n\nLooking back at the table, there are 16 rows (indices 0 to 15). Wait, actually, looking at the data array, it has 16 elements, so row indices go up to 15.\n\nNow, let's go through each relevant row carefully:\n\n- Row 6: GPM is exactly 1.237. Rank is 7.\n- Any other rows with GPM above 1.237? Let me check row 9 (Zarra) which has ~1.278 and rank 10. So Zarra's GPM is higher, but his rank isn't 11.\n\nLooking for a player with rank 11 and GPM >1.237:\n\nCheck if any row has rank 11 and GPM above 1.237.\n\nLooking through the ranks:\n\n- Rank 11 occurs in rows where:\n\nRow 10: Di St\u00e9fano, GPM 1.0 (not above)\nRow 15: Hugo S\u00e1nchez in 1986/87, GPM 0.759\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me list all players with rank 11.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 10: Rank 11, Di St\u00e9fano, GPM 1.0\n- Any other rank 11? No, only row 10 is rank 11.\n\nSo in row 10, GPM is 1.0 which is below 1.237.\n\nTherefore, there's no player with rank exactly 11 who has a GPM higher than 1.237.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there isn't such a player.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that rank 11 has the highest goals per match above 1.237. Upon examining the table, none of the players ranked 11 have a GPM exceeding this value. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
