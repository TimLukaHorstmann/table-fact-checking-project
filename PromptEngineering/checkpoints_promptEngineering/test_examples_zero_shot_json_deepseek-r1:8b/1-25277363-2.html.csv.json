    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"bob sand write episode 149\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: \"bob sand\" and \"write episode 149.\" So, it's stating that Bob Sand wrote episode 149.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"no in series,\" \"no in season,\" \"title,\" \"directed by,\" \"written by,\" and \"original air date.\" The rows represent different episodes with their respective details.\n\nI need to find which cells are relevant to verify this claim. Since the claim is about someone writing an episode, I should focus on the \"written by\" column. So, the \"row_index\" for episode 149 would be the row where \"no in series\" is 149.\n\nLooking through the table, each row starts with a number corresponding to \"no in series.\" Scanning down, I see that the 7th row (index 6) has 149 as the first element. Let's verify:\n\nRow index: 6\nColumns: [\"no in series\", ..., \"written by\"]\n\nSo, for episode 149, the relevant column is \"written by.\"\n\nNow, I'll check who wrote episode 149. In that row, the \"written by\" cell says \"bob sand.\" So, Bob Sand did write episode 149.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by this information, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are the one at row_index 6 and column_name \"written by.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tough love be the title of episode 148\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that \"tough love\" is the title of episode 148. So I need to find out what the title is for episode number 148 and see if it matches.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, etc. The relevant column here is \"title.\"\n\nNow, I'll go through the data rows to find where \"no in series\" is 148 because that refers to episode number 148. Let me scan each row:\n\nRow 0: no=145 \u2192 no\nRow 1: no=146 \u2192 no\n...\nLooking at the first few rows:\nRow 2: no=147\nRow 3: no=148\n\nYes, row index 3 has \"no in series\" as 148. So that's the correct episode.\n\nNow, check the title column for this row. The third entry is \"tough love.\" So the title matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. I need to find which cells are relevant. For row 3 (index 3), the columns checked are \"no in series\" and \"title.\" But wait, according to instructions, we only include the column names that verify the claim. Since the claim refers to both the episode number and the title, both \"no in series\" and \"title\" columns are relevant.\n\nWait, actually, the instruction says: check each condition against the table. The claim has two conditions: episode 148's title is \"tough love.\" So we need to find the row where no in series is 148 (to get the correct episode) and then check its title. Therefore, both columns are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the row where no=148 (row index 3) for both \"no in series\" and \"title.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"fast friend originally aired on october 12, 1993.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns are relevant here. The claim mentions \"originally aired\" and a specific date, so that points to the \"original air date\" column. Also, it refers to the title of the episode or show, which would be the \"title\" column.\n\nNext, I'll look for the row where the title is \"fast friend.\" Scanning through the data, I see that in row 149 (since the list starts at 145), the title is \"fast friends,\" not exactly \"fast friend.\" Hmm, maybe it's a typo or difference in pluralization. But regardless of the exact phrasing, the important part is that this row does have the title related to fast friends.\n\nNow, checking the original air date for this row, which should be the same as what the claim states. The data shows that \"fast friends\" aired on October 12, 1993. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because both the title and the air date align with the information in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we first identify which columns are relevant. The claim refers to \"fast friend\" airing on a specific date, so the \"title\" and \"original air date\" columns are important.\n\n- **Title**: The row with the title \"fast friends\" has an original air date of October 12, 1993.\n- **Original Air Date**: This matches the date in the claim.\n\nSince both pieces of information align correctly, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 149, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 149, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"the episode number in the series the test be before 148.0.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. It seems like they're talking about an episode called \"the test\" and its position in the series relative to another episode numbered 148.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are multiple rows and columns. The columns include things like \"no in series,\" \"title,\" etc. So each row represents an episode with these attributes.\n\nI need to find where the title is \"the test.\" Let me scan through the data:\n\nRow 159: title is \"the test\". Its \"no in series\" is 159, which is higher than 148 (from row 148). The claim says that \"the test\" should be before 148.0, but since 159 is after 148, this doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but the claim might be about the episode number being less than 148. Since 159 > 148, then in the series order, it comes later. So the claim is incorrect because \"the test\" is after 148.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to find which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be \"no in series\" and \"title.\" For the row where title is \"the test,\" which is row 159, both these columns are important.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because \"the test\" episode (number 159) appears after episode number 148.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 159, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 159, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"fast friend originally aired on october11 , 1992.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It's a JSON with columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, and original air date. The data rows contain information for each episode.\n\nI'm looking for the specific episode mentioned in the claim. The title is \"fast friend.\" So I need to find the row where the title is \"fast friends.\" Wait, actually, the user wrote it as \"fast friend,\" but checking the table, the correct title seems to be \"fast friends\" (with an 's' at the end). Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at row 149: [149,5,\"fast friends\",...]. So yes, the correct title is \"fast friends.\" The claim has a slight typo (\"fast friend\") but I think that's just a mistake and I should look for the episode regardless.\n\nNow, the claim mentions the original air date as October 11, 1992. But let's check the table. In row 149, the original air date is \"october 12 , 1993.\" Wait, that's in 1993, not 1992. Hmm, so there might be an issue here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The claim says October11, 1992. But in the table, looking at row 149, it's \"october 12 , 1993.\" So that doesn't match the date in the claim. That suggests the claim is incorrect because the episode aired on October 12, 1993, not in 1992.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nRow 149: no in series 5, no in season 6? Wait, the columns are \"no in series\" and \"no in season.\" So for row 149, it's [145,1,\"it was a dark and stormy night\",...], then row 146 is next. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 0: 145,1,title...\nRow 1: 146,2,...\nRow 2:147,3,\nRow3:148,4,\nRow4:149,5,\"fast friends\",...\n\nSo row 149 is the one with \"fast friends.\" The original air date for that row is \"october 12 , 1993.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim says it aired on October11, 1992, which doesn't match. So the date in the claim is wrong because according to the table, it's October12, 1993.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe there are multiple episodes with \"fast friends\" or a similar title? Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking through the titles:\n\n- Row 149: fast friends\n- Others have different titles like \"it was a dark and stormy night,\" \"the apartment,\" etc.\n\nSo only row 149 has \"fast friends.\" Therefore, the original air date for that episode is October12, 1993. The claim says October11, 1992, which is incorrect both in the month (October vs September) and the year (1992 vs 1993).\n\nWait, but wait another thing: perhaps I misread the row indices. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n0: [145,1,...]\n1: [146,2,...]\n...\n4: [149,5,\"fast friends\",...]\n\nYes, so row index 4 is \"fast friends\" with air date October12,1993.\n\nTherefore, the claim's date is off by a year and a month. So it's definitely wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has a typo, but I don't have control over that. I have to go by what's given.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is FALSE because the original air date for \"fast friends\" was October12,1993, not October11,1992.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"fast friend\" originally aired on October 11, 1992. However, upon reviewing the table, it's clear that \"fast friends\" aired on October 12, 1993. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}",
