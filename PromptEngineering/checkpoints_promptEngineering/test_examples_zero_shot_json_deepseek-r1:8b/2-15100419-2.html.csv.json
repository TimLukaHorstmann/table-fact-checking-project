    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\"\n\nBreaking it down, there are two parts:\n1. No defensive end pick.\n2. Overall position smaller than 2.\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the columns, I see \"position\" and \"overall.\" The claim refers to \"defensive end,\" so I'll focus on that column. Also, \"overall\" might be a numerical value, but the term is a bit ambiguous. In the context of player picks, \"overall\" likely refers to their overall pick number in the draft.\n\nLet me go through each row to check for defensive ends.\n\nRow 0: Position is \"linebacker.\" Not a defensive end.\nRow 1: Position is \"defensive end.\" So there's at least one defensive end pick. This already contradicts the first part of the claim which says \"no defensive end pick.\" Therefore, if there's even one defensive end pick, the claim is false on that point.\n\nAdditionally, looking for an overall smaller than 2. The \"overall\" column has values like 1, 2, 33, etc. So for a player to have an overall less than 2, their pick number would need to be 1 or lower, but since the lowest pick is 1 (Row 0), it's possible. However, the first part already fails because there's at least one defensive end.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. Now I need to find the relevant cells that show this. \n\nRelevant cells for \"defensive end\" are Row 1, Column: \"position.\" Also, for \"overall,\" look for rows where overall is less than 2, which is only Row 0 with overall=1.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include both these instances.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there is at least one defensive end pick (Tony Brackens in row 1), and some players have an overall pick number less than 2. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
