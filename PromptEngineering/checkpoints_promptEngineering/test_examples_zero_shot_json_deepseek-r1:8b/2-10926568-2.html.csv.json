    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in JSON format and has several columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. The data within the table lists episodes with their respective details.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"the title of the episode that aired on March 31, 2008, be 'new york : secret societies'\". I need to verify if this claim holds true based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what exactly needs to be checked. The key point here is to find the episode that aired on March 31, 2008, and then check its episode title. If the title matches \"new york : secret societies\", then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nSo, step one is to locate the relevant row in the table where the original airdate is March 31, 2008. The 'original airdate' column has dates in the format \"month day , year\". Let me look through each row's original airdate:\n\n1. January 28, 2008\n2. February 4, 2008\n3. February 11, 2008\n4. February 25, 2008\n5. March 3, 2008\n6. March 10, 2008\n7. March 17, 2008\n8. March 24, 2008\n9. March 31, 2008 \u2192 This is the date we're looking for.\n10. April 14, 2008\n11. April 21, 2008\n12. April 28, 2008\n13. May 5, 2008\n\nI found that row number 9 (since arrays are zero-indexed, but here rows start from index 0) is the one with March 31, 2008.\n\nNow, I need to check the 'episode title' for this specific row. Looking at the data:\n\nRow 9:\nproduction no: 23\nepisode no: 209\noriginal airdate: \"march 31 , 2008\"\nepisode title: \"new york : secret societies\"\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim provided. The episode title is indeed \"new york : secret societies\".\n\nSo, all conditions of the claim are met in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNext, I have to identify which cells in the table are relevant to support this conclusion. That means I need to specify the row index and the column name for each piece of data that verifies the claim.\n\nThe relevant information needed to confirm the claim are:\n\n1. The production number (23) isn't directly part of the claim, so maybe not necessary unless specified.\n2. The episode number (209) is also not mentioned in the claim, so it's not required.\n3. The original airdate (\"march 31 , 2008\") is crucial because it ties the episode to the date mentioned in the claim.\n4. The episode title (\"new york : secret societies\") is directly stated in the claim and needs to be checked.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the original airdate: row_index=9, column_name=\"original airdate\"\n- For the episode title: row_index=9, column_name=\"episode title\"\n\nSo, these two cells are what verify that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4 , 2008\" is true based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions an episode number, which is 202. So I should look for any row in the table where the \"episode no\" column has this value. The second part talks about the air date being February 4, 2008. That means I also need to check if that specific date corresponds to the episode with number 202.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\nEach row represents an episode with details like production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. The \"episode no\" column seems to list numbers sequentially from 15 onwards up to 27 in this dataset.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Episode number is 201, airdate January 28, 2008.\n2. Row 1: Episode number is 202, airdate February 4, 2008.\n3. Row 2: Episode number is 203, airdate February 11, 2008.\n4. ... and so on.\n\nSo, in row 1 (index 0 because rows start at 0), the episode no is 202 with an airdate of February 4, 2008. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this specific cell in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode no\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the title of the episode that aired on January 28, 2008, was 'Vietnam' and was hosted by Don Wildman.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, host. The data is a list of rows corresponding to different episodes.\n\nI need to locate the row where the original airdate matches January 28, 2008. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: January 28, 2008 \u2013 this must be the relevant row.\n  \nNow, let's check the other parts of the claim within this row:\n- Episode title: The title listed is \"underground apocalypse\". The claim says it was \"Vietnam.\" That doesn't match.\n- Host: The host is Don Wildman, which does match.\n\nSo, the episode title in that specific row doesn't align with what's claimed. Therefore, even though the host matches, the title doesn't. \n\nHence, the claim isn't fully supported; it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked the table for the episode aired on January 28, 2008.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008. So I need to check if in the provided table, there's an entry where the \"episode no\" is 213 and the \"original airdate\" is January 28, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, host. The data rows are listed from index 0 to 6, with each row containing the relevant information.\n\nNow, I should look through each row's \"episode no\" and compare it to 213, as well as check the \"original airdate.\"\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 0: production no=15, episode no=201, original airdate=January 28, 2008, episode title=\"underground apocalypse\", host=don wildman.\n\nHere, the episode number is 201, which isn't 213. So not relevant for this claim.\n\nRow 1: production no=16, episode no=202, original airdate=February 4, 2008. Episode number 202 \u2260 213.\n\nRow 2: production no=17, episode no=203, original airdate=February 11, 2008. Not matching.\n\nRow3: production no=18, episode no=204, date February 25. No match.\n\nRow4: production no=19, episode no=205, March 3. Not relevant.\n\nRow5: production no=20, episode no=206, March 10. Nope.\n\nRow6: production no=21, episode no=207, March 17. Still not matching.\n\nRow7: production no=22, episode no=208, March 24. No match.\n\nRow8: production no=23, episode no=209, March 31. Not relevant.\n\nRow9: production no=24, episode no=210, April 14. Nope.\n\nRow10: production no=25, episode no=211, April 21. Not matching.\n\nRow11: production no=26, episode no=212, April 28. Still not 213.\n\nRow12: production no=27, episode no=213, original airdate=May 5, 2008. Hmm, here the episode number is 213, but the date is May 5, which doesn't match January 28.\n\nWait a minute, so in row 12, \"episode no\" is 213, but the \"original airdate\" is May 5, not January 28. So that's not the entry we're looking for.\n\nNow, checking all rows, none of them have an \"episode no\" of 213 and an \"original airdate\" of January 28, 2008 together. The only time 213 appears is on May 5, which doesn't align with the claim.\n\nSo the claim that episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008 is not supported by the table data. Therefore, it should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":12, \"column_name\":\"episode no\"}, {\"row_index\":12, \"column_name\":\"original airdate\"}]}",
