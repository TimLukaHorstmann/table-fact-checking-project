    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"didi benami sing the song choice angel before lean on me\" is true based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two songs: \"angel\" and \"lean on me.\" The claim states that Didi Benami sang \"angel\" as her song choice before singing \"lean on me.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week with details like theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. I need to find any rows where either \"angel\" or \"lean on me\" appear in the 'song choice' column.\n\nStarting with \"angel,\" I'll scan through the 'song choice' column:\n\n1. Row 0: \"hey jude\"\n2. Row 1: \"first solo\"\n3. Row 2: \"no one\"\n4. Row 3: \"second solo\"\n5. Row 4: \"the way i am\"\n6. Row 5: \"lean on me\"\n7. Row 6: \"rhiannon\"\n8. Row 7: \"play with fire\"\n9. Row 8: \"you 're no good\"\n\nI don't see \"angel\" in the 'song choice' column, but I do see \"lean on me\" in row 5. However, row 5's 'song choice' is \"lean on me,\" which means someone else sang that song during that week.\n\nNow, looking at Didi Benami's entries. Wait, looking through the rows, I notice that the original artists are names like The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, etc., but I don't see Didi Benami listed anywhere in the 'original artist' column. That might be a red flag because if she didn't sing these songs, her name isn't present.\n\nAlso, considering the order and result columns: for row 5, the song choice is \"lean on me\" by Bill Wither's, and the order is 5 with a result of safe. But Didi Benami isn't listed as the original artist here either. So, she didn't sing \"lean on me.\"\n\nSince there's no record of Didi Benami singing \"angel,\" and she also didn't sing \"lean on me,\" the claim doesn't hold up. The relevant cells are where \"song choice\" is \"lean on me\" in row 5 and any cell where her name appears, but since she isn't listed, those might not be necessary. However, since the claim mentions her singing both songs, only the \"lean on me\" entry is partially correct but doesn't involve Didi Benami.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's no support in the table for Didi Benami singing either song as claimed. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"song choice\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"no one be not the last song choice for didi benami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions \"no one\" as the song choice and that it's supposed to be the last song choice for Didi Benami. So, my task is to check if in the table there's an entry where \"no one\" is listed under \"song choice\" and is indeed the last song choice specifically for Didi Benami.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result. The data rows have various entries. I need to find any row where the original artist is Didi Benami and check if \"no one\" is listed as the song choice.\n\nI'll scan each row's original artist column:\n\n1. Row 0: original artist is \"the beatles\"\n2. Row 1: \"katharine mcphee\"\n3. Row 2: \"alicia keys\"\n4. Row 3: \"sarah mclachlan\"\n5. Row 4: \"ingrid michaelson\"\n6. Row 5: \"bill withers\"\n7. Row 6: \"fleetwood mac\"\n8. Row 7: \"the rolling stones\"\n9. Row 8: \"betty everett\"\n\nWait, none of these original artists are Didi Benami. So if there's no row where the original artist is Didi Benami, then does that mean the claim is automatically false? Because it says \"for Didi Benami,\" but she isn't listed in any row.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check to ensure I didn't miss any rows or misread the data. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 0: \"the beatles\"\n- Row 1: \"katharine mcphee\"\n- Row 2: \"alicia keys\"\n- Row 3: \"sarah mclachlan\"\n- Row 4: \"ingrid michaelson\"\n- Row 5: \"bill withers\"\n- Row 6: \"fleetwood mac\"\n- Row 7: \"the rolling stones\"\n- Row 8: \"betty everett\"\n\nNo Didi Benami here. So that means the claim refers to a situation not present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about whether \"no one\" was chosen as the last song for someone else, but the user specifically mentioned Didi Benami. Since she's not in any row, I think the claim is false because there's no data supporting it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and since there are no relevant cells (since the original artist isn't present), the relevant_cells list would be empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"didi benami be number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that Didi Benami is ranked as number 5 in the \"order\" column for two specific weeks: Top 20 (10 women) and Top 16 (8 women). So, I should look into the table provided to see if there are any entries where \"dididemi benami\" or a variation of her name appears in the relevant columns during those weeks.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. The data rows provide specific information about different auditions or performances. \n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check for any mention of Didi Benami in the relevant columns. Starting from the top:\n\n1. First row: week is \"audition\", which doesn't match Top 20 or Top 16 weeks.\n2. Second row: week is \"hollywood\" again, not matching.\n3. Third and fourth rows are also \"hollywood\".\n4. The fifth row mentions \"top 24 (12 women)\" and \"safe\" result.\n5. Sixth row: \"top 20 (10 women)\", this is one of the weeks in question. Let's check the columns here:\n   - theme: \"billboard hot 100 hits\"\n   - song choice: \"lean on me\"\n   - original artist: \"bill withers\"\n   - order: 5\n   - result: safe\n   There's no mention of Didi Benami here, so this row doesn't apply.\n\n6. Seventh row: \"top 16 (8 women)\", another relevant week. Checking the columns:\n   - theme: \"billboard hot 100 hits\"\n   - song choice: \"rhiannon\"\n   - original artist: \"fleetwood mac\"\n   - order: 5\n   - result: safe\n   Again, no Didi Benami here.\n\nLooking at the remaining rows:\n\n8. Eighth row: \"top 12\", not relevant.\n9. Ninth row: \"top 11\", also not relevant.\n\nSo, in none of the relevant weeks (Top 20 and Top 16) does the name Didi Benami appear in the order column with a number 5 ranking. The only rankings I see are for other artists like Alicia Keys, Sarah Mclachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, etc., but not Didi Benami.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there's no evidence that Didi Benami is ranked number 5 in either of those weeks. The claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this table and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"the way i am be one of 3 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the relevant columns in the table. The columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. The claim mentions \"theme\" which is \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" so that's definitely relevant. It also talks about \"song choice,\" so that's another column to check.\n\nNext, I need to find any row where the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits.\" Let me scan through the data. Looking at each row:\n\n1. Week: audition, theme: \"auditioner 's choice\" \u2013 nope.\n2. Week: hollywood, theme: first solo \u2013 nope.\n3. Week: hollywood, theme: group performance \u2013 nope.\n4. Week: hollywood, theme: second solo \u2013 nope.\n5. Week: top 24 (12 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits \u2013 yes! This is row index 5.\n\nNow, in this row, the song choice is \"the way i am\" and the original artist is Ingrid Michaelson. The claim says it's one of 3 song choices with that theme. So I need to check if there are two other songs for this theme.\n\nLooking further, next rows:\n\n6. Week: top 20 (10 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits \u2013 song choice is \"lean on me\" by Bill Wither.\n7. Week: top 16 (8 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits \u2013 song choice is \"rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac.\n\nSo in total, for the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" there are three songs: \"the way i am,\" \"lean on me,\" and \"rhiannon.\" That means the claim is correct\u2014there are indeed three song choices with that theme.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 5 (song choice and theme) and also rows 6 and 7 for their respective song choices to show all three. Wait, but the claim only mentions \"the way i am\" as one of three, so I might only need to point out that specific cell plus any others needed to support the count.\n\nWait, no\u2014the relevant cells should include all rows where the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\" because that's necessary to verify that there are at least three song choices. So rows 5, 6, and 7 have that theme. Each of these has a different song choice, making three in total.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because all conditions are met. The relevant cells include row 5 for \"the way i am,\" and rows 6 and 7 to show there are two more songs with the same theme.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as TRUE because there are indeed three song choices (\"the way i am,\" \"lean on me,\" and \"rhiannon\") under the \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a hollywood theme\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that \"terrified\" was one of the songs performed in a week with a Hollywood theme. So, I should look for weeks where the theme is \"Hollywood\" and see if \"terrified\" appears as a song choice or performance.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different week with various details like theme, song choice, original artist, etc. The columns relevant here are \"week\", \"theme\", \"song choice\". \n\nI'll go through each row to check for weeks where the theme is \"Hollywood\" and see if any of those have \"terrified\" as the song choice.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Theme is \"audition\", so not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Theme is \"hollywood\". The song choice is \"first solo\". Not \"terrified\".\n3. **Row 2**: Theme is \"hollywood\". Song choice is \"group performance\". Still not \"terrified\".\n4. **Row 3**: Theme is \"hollywood\". Song choice is \"second solo\". Again, no match.\n5. **Row 4-8**: These don't have the theme \"Hollywood\", so I can ignore them.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, row 1 has theme \"hollywood\" and song choice \"first solo\". Row 2: group performance; row3: second solo. None of these are \"terrified\". So does that mean \"terrified\" isn't listed as a song choice in any Hollywood-themed week?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to the original artist. Let me check for the column \"original artist\". If the original artist is \"katharine mcphee\" and she performed \"terrified\", but the claim says \"she sing\", which might be a typo, so perhaps it's referring to her performing it.\n\nLooking at row 1: The original artist is \"katharine mcphee\", song choice is \"first solo\". So she did perform \"terrified\"? Wait, no, in row1, the song choice is \"first solo\", but the column \"song choice\" might not be the same as the song title.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: The columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result. So for each row, the \"song choice\" is what she chose to perform that week, and the column after that is the original artist, meaning who originally sang it.\n\nSo in row1: song choice is \"first solo\", which might be a performance type, but the original artist is \"katharine mcphee\". So the song she performed that week was \"first solo\" by her. Wait, but the claim says \"terrified\" was one of the songs she sang.\n\nLooking again at row1: The \"song choice\" is \"first solo\", and the original artist is \"katharine mcphee\". If the song is \"first solo\", then perhaps that's what she performed. But the claim mentions \"terrified,\" so I need to see if any week with Hollywood theme has \"terrified\" as song choice.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me look at row1 again: \"song choice\" is \"first solo\", which might be a type of performance rather than a specific song title. So perhaps \"terrified\" was not chosen by her in any Hollywood week.\n\nLooking through all rows where theme is Hollywood (rows 1,2,3), the song choices are first solo, group performance, second solo. None of these are \"terrified\". Therefore, there's no evidence that she performed \"terrified\" in a Hollywood-themed week.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is referring to her being in the category where she sang \"terrified\", but not necessarily as the song choice. For example, maybe she was an original artist for \"terrified\" in another row. Let me check other rows where theme might be relevant.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- Row0: audition week, song is \"hey jude\" by beatles.\n- Row1: Hollywood, song choice first solo, artist Katharine McPhee.\n- Row2: Hollywood, group performance, artist Alicia Keys.\n- Row3: Hollywood, second solo, artist Sarah Mclachlan.\n- Row4: top24, song is \"the way I am\" by Ingrid Michaelson.\n- Row5: top20, song is \"lean on me\" by Bill WITHERS.\n- Row6: top16, song is \"rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac.\n- Row7: top12, song is \"play with fire\" by Rolling Stones.\n- Row8: top11, song is \"you're no good\" by Betty Everett.\n\nNone of these have \"terrified\" as a song choice or performance in the Hollywood week. Therefore, the claim that she sang \"terrified\" in a Hollywood-themed week seems to be FALSE because there's no row where theme is Hollywood and song choice is \"terrified\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any other columns might relate. The result column shows \"advanced\" for some rows, but that doesn't directly indicate the song.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is not supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n]}",

Maybe the claim is saying that Didi Benami had a song choice of \"no one\" before someone else did \"hey jude.\" So maybe looking for rows where Didi Benami performed \"no one.\"\n\nBut looking at the table, the original artists are different: The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, etc. I don't see a row with Didi Benami as the original artist.\n\nWait, is Didi Benami in the table?

None of these are Didi Benami.\n\nSince there's no entry where \"no one\" is the last song choice for Didi Benami, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the way i am be one of 5 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the way i am be one of 5 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main things: the song title and the theme. The song title is \"the way i am,\" and the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits.\" The claim also states that this song is one of five song choices for a particular theme.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode or a group, with columns like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. I need to check if there's a row where the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" the song choice includes \"the way i am,\" and it's among five choices.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Theme is \"auditioner 's choice,\" not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Theme is \"first solo,\" nope.\n3. Row 2: Group performance, not the theme in question.\n4. Row 3: Second solo, different theme.\n5. Row 4: Theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits.\" Here, song choice is \"the way i am.\"\n6. Row 5: Same theme but a different song.\n7. Rows 6-8: Other themes, not matching.\n\nIn row 4, the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\" and the song choice is \"the way i am.\" The order is 9, which might mean it's one of five since there are likely more entries per week. So this matches the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\" and found that in Row 4, the song choice is indeed \"the way i am.\" This supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is: \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme.\" So, I'm looking for any instances where \"terrified\" is performed in a Bollywood-themed week. \n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to see if there's a week with a Bollywood theme and whether \"terrified\" was sung during that week.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Week is \"audition\", theme is \"auditioner 's choice\". The song is \"hey jude\" by the Beatles. Doesn't mention Bollywood.\n2. Second row: Week is \"hollywood\", theme is \"first solo\". Song is \"terrified\" by Katharine McPhee. Theme here is \"first solo\", not Bollywood.\n3. Third row: Week is \"hollywood\", theme is \"group performance\". Song is \"no one\" by Alicia Keys. Again, theme isn't Bollywood.\n4. Fourth row: Week is \"hollywood\", theme is \"second solo\". Song is \"angel\" by Sarah Mclachlan. No Bollywood theme.\n5. Fifth row: Week is \"top 24 (12 women)\", theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\". Song is \"the way i am\" by Ingrid Michaelson. Not Bollywood.\n6. Sixth row: Week is \"top 20 (10 women)\", theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\". Song is \"lean on me\" by Bill Wither. Not relevant.\n7. Seventh row: Week is \"top 16 (8 women)\", theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\". Song is \"rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac. No Bollywood.\n8. Eighth row: Week is \"top 12\", theme is \"the rolling stones\". Song is \"play with fire\" by the Rolling Stones. Not Bollywood.\n9. Ninth row: Week is \"top 11\", theme is \"billboard 1 hits\". Song is \"you 're no good\" by Betty Everett. No match.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check each row's theme to see if any mention Bollywood. Looking back at the table:\n\nThe only mentions of themes are like \"auditioner's choice\", \"first solo\", \"group performance\", etc., but none explicitly say \"Bollywood\". So perhaps there's no week with a Bollywood theme in this table.\n\nTherefore, since there's no week where the theme is Bollywood and \"terrified\" was performed, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that \"terrified\" was sung during a Bollywood-themed week. Examining each row, none have a theme related to Bollywood, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
