    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table and instructions. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10.\" So, the claim is making three assertions:\n\n1. The score was 5-4 (OT).\n2. The location/attendance was at Montreal Forum.\n3. The date was after May 10.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: date, opponent, score, location / attendance, series.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any match all three criteria.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- Date: April 26\n- Score: 4-2\n- Location: Montreal Forum\nBut the date is before May, so it doesn't meet the third condition. So this can't be the one.\n\nRow 1:\n- April 28, same opponent, score 5-2. Also not after May 10.\n\nRow 2:\n- May 1: Opponent Bruins, score 1-2, location Boston Garden. Not Montreal Forum. So no match.\n\nRow 3:\n- May 3: Bruins again, but score is 3-4, location is Boston Garden. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4:\n- May 5: Score is 5-1, location is Montreal Forum. But the date is May 5, which is before May 10? Wait, no, May 5 comes before May 10, so actually it's not after May 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 5:\n- May 8: Bruins, score 2-5, location Boston Garden. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 6:\n- May 10: Score is 5-4 (OT). Location is Montreal Forum. Date is May 10. Wait, the claim says \"after May 10.\" So May 10 is not after May 10; it's on May 10. The date needs to be after May 10, so this isn't a match either.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake here. The claim says \"the date after may 10,\" which implies the date is later than May 10. So let me check each row's date:\n\n- April dates: before May\n- May 1,3,5,8: all before or on May 10 except May 10 itself.\n\nSo none of the dates in the table are after May 10. That means there's no entry that matches all three criteria: score 5-4 OT, location Montreal Forum, and date after May 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no corresponding row in the table where all these conditions are met.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if any row in the table meets all three criteria specified in the claim. \n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n1. **Claim Breakdown:**\n   - **Score:** 5 - 4 (OT)\n   - **Location/Attendance:** Montreal Forum\n   - **Date:** After May 10\n\n2. **Check Each Row Against the Claim:**\n   - **Row 6** is the only row with:\n     - **Score:** 5-4 (OT)\n     - **Location:** Montreal Forum\n     - **Date:** May 10\n   - The date in this row is May 10, which is not after May 10. Thus, it doesn't meet the third condition.\n\nSince no row satisfies all three conditions, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
