    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is: \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game.\" Hmm, I need to figure out if this statement is true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The Wildcats are keeping their opponents scoreless in four games. That would mean that in those four games, the Wildcats won and scored some points while the opponents didn't score any points.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents points, and record. The data has 10 rows, each representing a game. So I need to check for four games where the Wildcats won, their opponents scored zero points, and the Wildcats scored some points.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Game 1 on Sept 20 vs Ole Miss. Result is loss, so not relevant.\nRow 1: Game 2 on Sept 27 vs Cincinnati. They won with 20 points, opponents scored 0. That's one game where Wildcats won and opponents were scoreless.\n\nRow 2: Game 3 on Oct 4 vs Xavier. Another win, 20-7. Opponents scored 7, so not zero.\n\nRow 3: Game 4 on Oct 11 vs Georgia (9). Win with 26-0. Opponents scored zero here too. That's the second game where Wildcats won and opponents were scoreless.\n\nRow 4: Game 5 on Oct 18 vs Vanderbilt (10). Win, 14-0. Opponents scored zero again, that's three games.\n\nWait, but the claim says four games. Let me check the remaining rows.\n\nRow 5: Game 6 on Oct 25 vs Michigan State. They won 7-6. Opponents scored 6, so not zero.\n\nRow 6: Game 7 on Nov 1 vs Alabama (18). Loss, not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Game 8 on Nov 8 vs West Virginia. Win, 15-6. Opponents scored 6, so no.\n\nRow 9: Game 9 on Nov 15 vs Evansville. They won 36-0. Opponents scored zero here, making it four games where Wildcats won and opponents were scoreless.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nGame 2: Opponents 0.\nGame 4: Opponents 0.\nGame 5: Opponents 0.\nGame 9: Opponents 0.\n\nThat's four games. So the claim is about these four games where Wildcats won and kept opponents scoreless. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. For each of those four games, I'll note the row index and column name 'opponents' because it shows whether they scored or not.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include:\n\n- Row 1 (game 2), column 'opponents'\n- Row 3 (game4), same\n- Row4 (game5)\n- Row9 (game9)\n\nEach with their respective row indices and the column name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 in any game they lose\" is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The Wildcats are a team, and the claim suggests that whenever they lost a game, their points scored were no more than 7. So, for every loss recorded in the table, I should check the \"wildcats points\" column to see if it ever exceeds 7.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can see the data is structured with multiple rows, each representing a different game. Each row has several columns: game number, date, opponent, result (win/loss), Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and record. \n\nSince the claim specifically refers to losses, I'll focus on the rows where the \"result\" column indicates a loss. From the table:\n\n1. Game 1: Opponent is Ole Miss, result is loss, Wildcats scored 7 points.\n2. Game 7: Opponent is Alabama, result is loss, Wildcats scored 0 points.\n3. Game 10: Opponent is Tennessee, result is loss, Wildcats scored 6 points.\n\nNow, I'll check each of these losses to see if the Wildcats scored more than 7 points:\n\n- In game 1, they scored exactly 7 points. The claim says \"never score more than 7,\" which includes equaling 7. So this is relevant.\n- Game 7 shows 0 points, which is well below 7.\n- Game 10 has 6 points, again below 7.\n\nNone of the losses in the table have Wildcats scoring more than 7 points. The highest they scored in a loss is 7, which is exactly the threshold mentioned in the claim. Since the claim says \"never score more than 7,\" and they never exceeded it, even reaching 7 once, the claim holds true.\n\nHowever, I should ensure that there are no other losses beyond what's shown in the table. If there were more games where the Wildcats lost with points higher than 7, this would make the claim false. But based on the provided data, all losses have Wildcats scoring 7 or fewer points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the given data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table, the first two rows (index 0 and 1) are in September. So that seems to check out.\n\nNext, October: The claim says they played 4 games in October. Scanning through the table, I see four entries for October: rows 3,4,5,6. That's four games, so that part is correct too.\n\nLastly, November: The claim states 4 games in November.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 point in any game they win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table structure and the columns it contains. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", \"wildcats points\", and possibly \"record\". However, since the claim focuses on wildcat's scoring in games they won, I'll focus on the \"wildcats points\" and \"result\" columns.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row of the table to check where the Wildcats had wins. The \"result\" column will tell me if it was a win or loss. For each game that resulted in a win, I need to note down the \"wildcats points\".\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Game 1: sept 20 vs ole miss - loss, so not relevant.\n- Game 2: sept 27 vs cincinnati - win, wildcat points 20. This is a win with 20 points, which exceeds 7, but wait\u2014that's higher than 7.\nWait, that seems contradictory because the claim says they never scored more than 7 in any game they won.\n\nBut hold on, game 2 has 20 points for Wildcats in a win. That already contradicts the claim. However, I should check all games to ensure there isn't another instance where this might be true.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Game 3: oct 4 vs xavier - win, wildcats scored 20 again.\n- Game 4: oct 11 vs 9 georgia - win, 26 points.\n- Game 5: oct 18 vs 10 vanderbilt - win, 14 points.\n- Game 6: oct 25 vs michigan state - win, 7 points. Okay, here's one where they scored exactly 7 in a win.\n- Game 7: nov 1 vs 18 alabama - loss, not relevant.\n- Game 8: nov 8 vs west virginia - win, 15 points.\n- Game 9: nov 15 vs evansville - win, 36 points.\n- Game 10: nov 22 vs tennessee - loss.\n\nSo, in games 2,3,4,5,6,8,9 the Wildcats won. Among these, their points were:\n\n20, 20, 26, 14,7,15,36.\n\nMost of these are above 7 except for game 6 where they scored exactly 7. The claim says \"never score more than 7 points in any game they win\". So if they scored exactly 7 once and higher in others, the claim is not entirely true because they did exceed 7 in multiple games.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. I'll need to identify all the relevant cells where the result was a win and check their points.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in several of their winning games, the Wildcats scored more than 7 points (e.g., 20, 26, 14, 15, 36).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 36 points\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 36 points.\" This seems to refer to a situation where the Wildcats scored 36 more points than their opponent in a game. So I need to look for any row in the table where the Wildcats' points (column \"wildcats points\") minus the opponents' points is exactly 36.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different game with details like date, opponent, result, etc. The relevant columns here are probably \"game\" as an identifier, \"opponent\", \"result\", \"wildcats points\", and maybe \"opponents\". Wait, actually, looking back, the columns are: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record.\n\nWait, so for each row, we have the Wildcats' points (column 5) and presumably the opponents' points in another column. But wait, in the table provided, the data rows have a seventh column \"record\" which is like \"0 - 1\", \"1 - 1\", etc., probably indicating the Wildcats' win/loss record after that game.\n\nBut I need to find where the Wildcats outscore their opponent by 36 points. So I should check if in any row, the Wildcats' points minus opponents' points equals 36.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Wildcats scored 7, opponents 14. So difference is -7. Not 36.\nRow 1: Wildcats scored 20, opponents 0. Difference +20. No.\nRow 2: 20 vs 7, difference +13. No.\nRow 3: 26 vs 0, +26. No.\nRow 4: 14 vs 0, +14. No.\nRow 5: 7 vs 6, +1. No.\nRow 6: Wildcats scored 0, opponents 13. -13. No.\nRow 7: 15 vs 6, +9. No.\nRow 8: 36 vs 0, +36. Oh! Here we go.\n\nWait, row index 8 (which is the ninth game) has wildcats points as 36 and opponents' points as 0. So 36-0=36. That fits the claim exactly. So this game meets the condition of Wildcats outscoring their opponent by 36 points.\n\nBut I should make sure that in any other row, there isn't a higher difference or another instance where they scored more by 36. Let me check all rows again quickly:\n\nRows after 8: wildcats points are 6, but it's against Alabama and the opponents have 13, so -7. Then 15 vs 6 (difference +9), then 36 in row 8 is the only instance where they scored 36 more.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in row 3, Wildcats scored 26, opponent 0, but that's a difference of 26, not 36. So no, only row 8 has a 36 point difference.\n\nSo the claim says \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 36 points.\" Wait, does it say \"the most\" implying the highest such score? Or is it just stating that they did it, and maybe multiple times? But in the table, only once do they have a 36-point win.\n\nBut actually, looking at the claim again: \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 36 points.\" The word \"most\" could mean the highest such instance. So if Wildcats have scored more than 36 points against an opponent, that would be the case here. But in this table, row 8 is the only time they scored 36 points, and it's a 36-point win.\n\nWait, but sometimes outscoring can also refer to a margin, so a 36-point lead. So yes, if Wildcats have a game where their score minus opponent's score is 36, that meets the condition.\n\nTherefore, since row 8 has such a case, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the one in column \"wildcats points\" and perhaps \"opponents\" to check the difference.\n\nWait, but looking at the table structure: each row has \"wildcats points\", which is their score, and another column \"opponents\", which might be the opponent's name or their score? Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe columns are:\n\n- game (number)\n- date\n- opponent\n- result\n- wildcats points\n- opponents (this seems to be a label, perhaps it's a mistake, maybe it should be \"opponent's points\"? Because in the data, after \"wildcats points\" comes \"14\", which likely is the opponent's points in row 4. But looking at the example:\n\nIn row 0: wildcats points are 7, then opponents is listed as 14.\n\nSo yes, \"opponents\" column refers to the opponent's points in that game. So for each row, \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\" (opponent's points) can be used to compute the difference.\n\nTherefore, to check the claim, we need to look at all rows where wildcats points - opponents = 36.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: 7 vs 14 \u2192 difference is -7.\nRow1:20 vs 0 \u2192 +20.\nRow2:20 vs7\u2192+13.\nRow3:26 vs0\u2192+26.\nRow4:14 vs0\u2192+14.\nRow5:7 vs6\u2192+1.\nRow6:0 vs13\u2192-13.\nRow7:15 vs6\u2192+9.\nRow8:36 vs0\u2192+36. \u2192 This is the one.\nRow9: 36 points against Evansville? Wait, no, row 8 has wildcats points as 36, and opponent's points are 0.\n\nWait, in row 8, \"wildcats points\" is 36, opponents' points are 0. So yes, 36-0=36.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there is at least one game where Wildcats outscore their opponent by 36 points. The relevant cells would be the columns for that specific row: \"game\", but more importantly, the \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\" to calculate the difference.\n\nWait, actually, the instruction says:\n\n\"relevant cells\": likely refers to which columns are used, so perhaps both \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\" in row 8.\n\nBut the instruction isn't entirely clear. Maybe it's just the specific data point where this occurs. So I think the relevant cells would be row 8, specifically the columns \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\".\n\nBut to stick strictly with instructions: probably highlight that in at least one game, they scored 36 more points than their opponent. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe Wildcats indeed have a game where they outscored their opponent by 36 points. Specifically, in Game 9 (row 8 of the table), they scored 36 points while their opponents scored 0. This meets the condition stated in the claim.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{TRUE}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that in 10 games, the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless. That means I need to look for situations where the Wildcats' opponent's points are zero in those specific games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and record.\n\nThe relevant parts here are the \"game\" column (which is just numbering the games) and the \"opponents\" column, which shows the score of the opposing team. Wait, actually, there's a separate column called \"result,\" but maybe it's better to focus on the \"opponents\" field because that directly shows the points.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table again: the columns are \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", \"wildcats points\", \"opponents\", and \"record\". So the \"opponents\" column is actually the score of the opponent. For example, in row 1, it's \"14,\" meaning Ole Miss scored 14 points.\n\nSo the claim is about Wildcats keeping opponents scoreless in 10 games. That would mean in those 10 games, the opponent's points are zero.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which games are considered as the 10 games. The table has entries from game 1 to game 10, so it seems like all 10 games are listed. Therefore, for each of these 10 games, I have to check if the opponents' score is zero.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nGame 1: Opponent is Ole Miss, opponents score is 14 \u2192 Not zero.\nGame 2: Opponent is Cincinnati, opponents score is 0 \u2192 Zero. So this counts as one game where opponents are kept scoreless.\nWait, no, wait. The Wildcats' result is a win with 20 points against Cincinnati, and the opponent's score is listed as 0 in their data. Wait, looking at row 2: \"opponents\" is 0, yes.\n\nSo for each game, check if opponents' score is zero:\n\nGame 1: 14 \u2192 Not zero.\nGame 2: 0 \u2192 Zero (counted).\nGame 3: 7 \u2192 Not zero.\nGame 4: 0 \u2192 Zero (counted).\nGame 5: 0 \u2192 Zero (counted).\nGame 6: 6 \u2192 Not zero.\nGame 7: 13 \u2192 Not zero.\nGame 8: 6 \u2192 Not zero.\nGame 9: 0 \u2192 Zero (counted).\nGame 10: 13 \u2192 Not zero.\n\nSo games where opponents are scoreless: Game 2, 4, 5, and 9. That's four games, not ten.\n\nBut the claim says \"in 10 game.\" Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me read the claim again: \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game.\" So does that mean they did this in all ten games? Or at least ten times across any games?\n\nLooking back, the table has 10 games. The Wildcats kept opponents scoreless in four of them (games 2,4,5,9). But the claim says \"in 10 game,\" which could be interpreted as ten games where they did this, but there are only four instances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again: the columns are \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", \"wildcats points\", \"opponents\", and \"record\". So \"opponents\" is their score.\n\nSo in the 10 games listed, only four times did Wildcats make the opponent scoreless. Therefore, the claim that they kept opponents scoreless in 10 games is false because it's not true across all ten games, nor even across ten instances within these ten games.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim means that in their ten games, the opponents were kept scoreless at least once each, i.e., each game was scoreless. But that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nGame 1: Opponent scored 14.\nGame 2: Opponent scored 0 \u2192 Wildcats won 20-0.\nGame 3: Opponent scored 7.\nGame 4: Opponent scored 0 \u2192 Wildcats won 26-0.\nGame 5: Opponent scored 0 \u2192 Wildcats won 14-0.\nGame 6: Opponent scored 6.\nGame 7: Opponent scored 13.\nGame 8: Opponent scored 6.\nGame 9: Opponent scored 0 \u2192 Wildcats won 36-0.\nGame 10: Opponent scored 13.\n\nSo in four games, opponents were scoreless. So the claim that they kept opponents scoreless in ten games is false because it's not true for all ten games. It's only true for four of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misinterpreted. Maybe it's saying that in ten games, the Wildcats made the opponents scoreless at least once each, meaning each opponent had a game where they were kept scoreless. But that would require more context than what's given.\n\nBut based strictly on the table, the Wildcats kept opponents scoreless only in four of their ten games. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the relevant cells in the provided table. The claim suggests that in 10 specific games, the Wildcats caused their opponents to have a score of zero.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns and Data:** Focus on the \"opponents\" column, which shows the opposing team's points for each game.\n2. **Check Each Game (Row):**\n   - **Game 1:** Opponents scored 14 \u2192 Not zero.\n   - **Game 2:** Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Zero.\n   - **Game 3:** Opponents scored 7 \u2192 Not zero.\n   - **Game 4:** Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Zero.\n   - **Game 5:** Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Zero.\n   - **Game 6:** Opponents scored 6 \u2192 Not zero.\n   - **Game 7:** Opponents scored 13 \u2192 Not zero.\n   - **Game 8:** Opponents scored 6 \u2192 Not zero.\n   - **Game 9:** Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Zero.\n   - **Game 10:** Opponents scored 13 \u2192 Not zero.\n\n3. **Count Instances Where Opponents Were Scoreless:** Only games 2, 4, 5, and 9 meet the criteria, totaling four instances, not ten.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because the Wildcats did not keep their opponents scoreless in all ten listed games.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific months where the Wildcats lost games: November with one loss and September with two losses. I need to check each month mentioned in the claim against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has a \"date\" column which lists the dates of each game. Each row represents a different game with details like opponent, result, points, etc. The key columns here are \"game\" (which seems to be the game number), date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents points, and record.\n\nI'll go through each row to see when the Wildcats lost games in September and November.\n\nStarting with September: In the table, the first two rows are September 20 and September 27. The results for these games are \"loss\" and \"win,\" respectively. So there's only one loss in September, which is game 1 on September 20.\n\nNow, checking November: Looking at the dates in November, row 7 is November 1 (game 7) with a result of \"loss.\" The next November game is row 8 on November 8, but that was a win. So only one loss in November, specifically on November 1.\n\nThe claim states there was one loss in November and two losses in September. But from the table, there's only one loss in September (game 1) and one loss in November (game 7). The claim says two losses in September but only one actually happened. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it doesn't match the actual data.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into specific parts. It mentions games played in September, October, and November. Specifically, it's talking about how many games were played each month: 4 in September, 2 in October, and 2 in November.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related to this are \"game,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" etc., but the key ones here are probably \"game\" (which seems to be numbering) and \"month\" from the date. Wait, actually, the dates are listed as strings like \"sept 20,\" so I need to parse those months.\n\nLet me list out each game's month based on the 'date' column:\n\n1. September 20 - Game 1\n2. September 27 - Game 2\n3. October 4 - Game 3\n4. October 11 - Game 4\n5. October 18 - Game 5\n6. October 25 - Game 6\n7. November 1 - Game 7\n8. November 8 - Game 8\n9. November 15 - Game 9\n10. November 22 - Game 10\n\nSo, looking at this, in September, there are two games: game 1 and game 2. The claim says the Wildcats played 4 games in September, which doesn't match because only two games are listed for September.\n\nNext, October has four games (games 3-6). The claim mentions 2 games in October, which is incorrect here as there are actually more than that.\n\nNovember has three games (games 7-10). The claim says 2 games in November, but it's actually three. So all the numbers don't add up to what the claim is stating.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the number of games per month doesn't match the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the number of games played each month. September has two games, October has four, and November has three, not matching the claimed 4, 2, and 2 respectively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcats outscore an opponent by 26 points\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"the most,\" which suggests looking for a game where the Wildcats scored the highest point differential against their opponents. The key term here is \"outscore an opponent by 26 points.\" So I need to find a row in the table where the \"wildcats points\" minus the \"opponents points\" equals or exceeds 26.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with the following columns: game number, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents points, and record. The relevant columns for this claim are \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents.\" \n\nI'll go through each row to check the point differential.\n\nRow 0: Wildcats scored 7, opponents scored 14. Differential is -7 (Wildcats lost). Not a high score.\nRow 1: Wildcats scored 20, opponents 0. Differential is +20. That's a significant lead, but not 26.\nRow 2: Wildcats scored 20, opponents 7. Differential is +13. Still less than 26.\nRow 3: Wildcats scored 26, opponents 0. Differential is +26. This matches the claim exactly.\nRow 4: Wildcats scored 14, opponents 0. Differential is +14. Not enough.\nRow 5: Wildcats scored 7, opponents 6. Differential is +1. Minimal.\nRow 6: Wildcats scored 0, opponents 13. Differential is -13 (loss).\nRow 7: Wildcats scored 15, opponents 6. Differential is +9.\nRow 8: Wildcats scored 36, opponents 0. Differential is +36. That's even higher than the previous one but still relevant as it shows a large lead.\nRow 9: Wildcats scored 6, opponents 13. Differential is -7 (loss).\nRow 10: Wildcats scored 6, opponents 13. Differential is -7 (loss).\n\nSo, in row 3, the differential is +26, which meets the claim. Additionally, row 8 has a higher differential of +36, but since the claim specifies \"the most,\" it's looking for any instance where they outscore by at least 26 points.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are where the differential is >=26, specifically rows 3 and 8.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there is at least one game (Row 3) where the Wildcats outscore their opponent by 26 points. Additionally, another game (Row 8) shows an even larger lead, further supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
