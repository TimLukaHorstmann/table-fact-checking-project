    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the location that be found in 1891 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's talking about a place (location) where something happened in 1891 and then left in 1975. The specific location mentioned is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different institution with various attributes like location, founded year, type, etc. So I need to find which rows match the criteria of being founded in 1891 and leaving in 1975, and then check if their locations are Hickory, NC.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Catawba College - Founded 1851, left 1975. Location is Salisbury, SC. Doesn't match the location or the founding year.\n\nRow 1: Appalachian State University - Founded 1899, left in 1967. Boone, NC. Not matching the 1891 founding year.\n\nRow 2: Catawba College again? Wait, no, row 0 is Catawba, and row 3 is Coker College. So row 3:\n\nCoker College - Founded 1908, left in 2013. Location is Hartsville, SC. No match.\n\nRow 4: East Carolina University - Founded 1907, left 1962. Greenville, NC. Not matching.\n\nRow 5: Elon University - Founded 1889, left 1975. Location Elon, NC. Close year, but not 1891 and location doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: Guilford College - Founded 1837, left 1988. Greensboro, NC. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 7: High Point University - Founded 1924, left 1997. High Point, NC. Not matching.\n\nRow 8: Lenoir-Rhyne University - Founded 1891, left 1975. Location Hickory, NC. Wait, that's exactly the location and the years mentioned in the claim. So this seems to match.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Let me confirm each detail:\n\nLooking at row 8: \"lenoirrhyne university\" is listed as founded in 1891, left in 1975, and location is \"hickory , north carolina\". That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nSo the claim is about a place that was founded in 1891 and left in 1975, which is Hickory, NC. The only row that fits all these criteria is Lenoir-Rhyne University.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"left\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the former private member that be found in 1839 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim step by step. It seems like it's talking about an institution that was founded in 1839, became private, and left Hickory, North Carolina in the year 1975. Or maybe it's referring to a change of location or something else.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different institution with various attributes. The columns include \"founded,\" \"type\" (public or private), \"location,\" \"nickname,\" and others like \"joined\" and \"left.\" \n\nThe claim mentions a private member founded in 1839 that left Hickory in 1975. So I need to find an institution that matches these criteria: founded year is 1839, type is private, location is Hickory, North Carolina, and the \"left\" year is 1975.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Anderson University \u2013 founded 1911, not 1839.\n2. Row 1: Appalachian State \u2013 founded 1899, public.\n3. Row 2: Catawba College \u2013 1851, private. Location is Salisbury, NC. So no.\n4. Row 3: Coker College \u2013 1908, private. Hartsville, SC. Not Hickory.\n5. Row 4: East Carolina \u2013 1907, public. Greenville, NC.\n6. Row 5: Elon University \u2013 1889, private. Elon, NC.\n7. Row 6: Guilford College \u2013 1837, private. Greensboro, NC.\n8. Row 7: High Point U \u2013 1924, private. High Point, NC.\n9. Row 8: Lenoir-Rhyne \u2013 1891, private. Hickory, NC. Founded in 1891, not 1839.\n10. Row 9: Longwood U \u2013 1839, public. Farmville, VA.\n11. Row 10: Mars Hill College \u2013 1856, private. Mars Hill, NC.\n12. Row 11: Newberry College \u2013 1856, private. Newberry, SC.\n13. Row 12: UNC Pembroke \u2013 1887, public. Pembroke, NC.\n14. Row 13: Presbyterian College \u2013 1880, private. Clinton, SC.\n15. Row 14: Queens U of Charlotte \u2013 1857, private. Charlotte, NC.\n16. Row 15: St Andrews U \u2013 1958, private. Laurinburg, NC.\n17. Row 16: Western Carolina U \u2013 1889, public. Cullowhee, NC.\n18. Row 17: Wingate U \u2013 1896, private. Wingate, NC.\n\nNow, looking for an institution founded in 1839, which is private, located in Hickory, NC, and left in 1975.\n\nNone of the rows seem to match all these criteria exactly. Let me double-check each aspect:\n\n- Founded: 1839 \u2013 only Longwood U matches that year, but it's public.\n- Private: Several institutions are private, like Catawba, Lenoir-Rhyne, etc., but their locations don't match Hickory except Lenoir-Rhyne, which was founded in 1891.\n- Location is Hickory, NC: Only Lenoir-Rhyne is there, and it's private, but not founded in 1839.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the former private member that be found in 1839.\" Maybe it's referring to an institution that changed its location. But looking at the data, I don't see any institution changing from one city to another with those exact years mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about a nickname or something else, but the main points are founding year, type, and leaving year along with location.\n\nSince none of the rows match all these criteria, the claim doesn't hold. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not find a matching institution in the table based on the provided criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
