    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"active from 1947 - 1964 , titus ozon score 157 goal.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two main things: the active years and the goals scored by Titus Ozon.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: rank, name, years, matches, and goals. The data is a list of rows, each representing a person along with their details.\n\nI need to locate Titus Ozon in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first row after headers (row index 0) is Dudu Georgescu.\n2. Next, Ionel Danciulescu (index 1).\n3. Then Rodion Camataru (index 2).\n4. Marin Radu (index 3).\n5. Ion Oblemenco (index 4).\n6. Florea Dumitrache shares the same rank as Ion Oblemenco? Wait, no, looking closer, row index 5 is Florea Dumitrache with rank 5.\n7. Next is Mircea Sandu (index 6), Victor Piturca (index 7), Mihai Adam (index 8), and finally Titus Ozon at index 9.\n\nSo Titus Ozon is in row index 10? Wait, let me count again. The data array starts with Dudu Georgescu as the first entry, so row indices are from 0 to 9. So the last entry is index 9: Titus Ozon, active years 1947-1964, matches 270, goals 157.\n\nNow, check each part of the claim:\n\n1. Active from 1947 - 1964: Looking at Titus Ozon's row (index 10? Wait no, let me recount. The data array has entries from index 0 to 9. So the last entry is index 9, which is Titus Ozon with years 1947-1964. That matches the claim.\n\n2. Score 157 goals: In the same row for Titus Ozon, under the 'goals' column, it's 157. So that also matches.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table, as Titus Ozon was active from 1947-1964 and scored 157 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"During the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score was less than 160.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows in the table fall within that time frame\u20141950 to 1965. Let's look at each row's years:\n\n1. dudu georgescu: 1970-1986 \u2192 after 1965.\n2. ionel danciulescu: 1993-present \u2192 way after.\n3. rodion camataru: 1974-1989 \u2192 too late.\n4. marin radu: same as above, 1974-1989.\n5. ion oblemenco: 1964-1976 \u2192 ends in 76, but starts in 64. So part of it is before 1965? Wait, 1964-1976 includes years up to 1976, so 1965 is within that period.\n6. florea dumitrache: 1966-1983 \u2192 includes 1965?\nWait, no, 1966-1983 starts in '66, so 1965 isn't included here. So this row's years are from 66 onwards, which doesn't overlap with 1950-65.\n7. mircea sandu: 1970-1987 \u2192 after 1965.\n8. victor piturca: 1975-1989 \u2192 same as above.\n9. mihai adam: 1962-1976 \u2192 includes years up to 76, so 1965 is within this range.\n10. titus ozon: 1947-1964 \u2192 ends in '64, which is before 1965.\n\nSo rows that might be relevant are ion oblemenco (row index 4) and mihai adam (row index 8). Wait, no, row indices start at 0? Let me check the data:\n\nLooking at the table, the first entry is row 0, which is dudu georgescu, then row 1, etc. So ion oblemenco is row 4, and mihai adam is row 8. Wait no, looking back: the rows are numbered from 0 to 9 because there are 10 entries.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\nRow 0: dudu georgescu\nRow 1: ionel danciulescu\nRow 2: rodion camataru\nRow 3: marin radu\nRow 4: ion oblemenco\nRow 5: florea dumitrache\nRow 6: mircea sandu\nRow 7: victor piturca\nRow 8: mihai adam\nRow 9: titus ozon\n\nSo, the relevant rows are those where years include any part of 1950-1965.\n\nLooking at each:\n\nRow 4: ion oblemenco's years are 1964-1976. So 1964 is within 1950-1965 (since it's up to 1965). So yes, this row includes some years in the claim period.\n\nRow 8: mihai adam's years are 1962-1976. So 1962-65 are included, so yes.\n\nNow, for each relevant row, check the goals column.\n\nRow 4 (ion oblemenco): goals are 170.\nRow 8 (mihai adam): goals are 160.\n\nThe claim is that during 1950-1965, the goal score was less than 160. So we need to see if all the relevant rows have goals <160.\n\nBut in row 4, ion oblemenco scored 170, which is more than 160. Therefore, this violates the claim. So the claim would be false because at least one of the relevant rows has a goal score equal or above 160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing other rows. Are there any others? Let's check again:\n\nRow 4: ion oblemenco (1964-76) \u2192 goals 170\nRow 8: mihai adam (1962-76) \u2192 goals 160\n\nSo both are in the time frame, and their goals are 170 and 160. Since 160 is not less than 160, it's equal, so that's not less. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check other rows to ensure there are no others that might affect this conclusion. For example, row 5: florea dumitrache is from 1966-83, which starts after 1965, so it doesn't overlap with the claim period. Similarly, rows before ion oblemenco either end before 1950 or start after.\n\nSo the only relevant rows are 4 and 8. Since both have goals >=160 (170 and 160), the claim is false because at least one row has a goal score not less than 160.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during 1950-1965, the goal score was less than 160. However, in row 4 (ion oblemenco) and row 8 (mihai adam), the goals are 170 and 160 respectively, which are not less than 160. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
