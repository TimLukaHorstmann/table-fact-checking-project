The claim says that their enrollment is 587.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, ihsaa football class, and county. The data rows include different schools with various enrollments.\n\nI'm focusing on the Andrean Fighting '59ers. From the table, they are in row index 0. Looking at that row, the columns are: school, location, mascot, enrollment, etc. So the enrollment number is 587 in the fourth column of this row.\n\nThat matches exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell is row 0, column \"enrollment\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
