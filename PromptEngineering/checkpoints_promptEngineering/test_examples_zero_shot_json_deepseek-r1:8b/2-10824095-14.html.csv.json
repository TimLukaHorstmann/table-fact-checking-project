    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the home team of Essendon have a crowd of 47656.\"\n\nFirst, I'll go through each step carefully.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Since the claim is about the home team's crowd, I need to look for the row where the home team is Essendon.\n\n2. **Find Essendon's Row**: Scanning through each row:\n   - 1st row: Geelong\n   - 2nd row: Fitzroy\n   - 3rd row: Collingwood\n   - 4th row: Hawthorn\n   - 5th row: Melbourne\n   - 6th row: Essendon\n\nSo, the 6th row is Essendon's match.\n\n3. **Check Crowd Figure**: In that same row, the crowd figure is listed as 47656. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since all details in the claim are correctly supported by the corresponding cells in the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"there be a crowd of 74656 for essendon home team on 26 june 1952.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions three specific pieces of information:\n\n1. **Crowd size**: 74,656\n2. **Home team**: Essendon\n3. **Date**: June 26, 1952\n\nI need to check each of these against the table to see if such a match exists.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's in JSON format with columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". The data rows contain specific instances of games.\n\nI'll start by locating the relevant rows where the home team is Essendon. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is geelong\n- Row 1: Home team is fitzroy\n- Row 2: Home team is collingwood\n- Row 3: Home team is hawthorn\n- Row 4: Home team is melbourne\n- Row 5: Home team is essendon\n\nSo, only the last row (row index 5) has Essendon as the home team.\n\nNow, let's check the crowd size for this row. The crowd value in row 5 is 47656. However, the claim states a crowd of 74656, which doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify the date. The claim specifies June 26, 1952. Looking at the 'date' column across all rows, every date listed is \"26 june 1982.\" There's no row with a date in 1952, let alone June 26, 1952.\n\nSo, both the crowd number and the date provided in the claim don't align with any data point in the table. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each specified condition against the table. \n\n- **Crowd Size**: The table shows 47656 for Essendon's game, not 74656.\n- **Date**: All games in the table are on June 26, 1982, not 1952.\n\nSince none of the data points match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
