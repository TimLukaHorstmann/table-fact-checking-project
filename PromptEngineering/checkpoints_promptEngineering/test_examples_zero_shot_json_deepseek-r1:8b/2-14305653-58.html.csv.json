    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score of 2:1.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Yugoslavian national team (which I think was later known as Serbia and Montenegro before becoming Serbia) won both their friendly matches with a score of 2:1 each.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check the relevant columns and rows. The columns are date, city, opponent, results, type of game. So, the claim refers to \"friendly\" type games where Yugoslavia won with a score of 2:1.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\n1. March 22, 2023 (assuming the year is not specified but it's irrelevant), in Sarajevo against Uruguay. The result was 2:1 and the type was friendly. So this matches the claim.\n\n2. March 30, 2023, in Belgrade against Romania. Result was 2:0, which doesn't match a score of 2:1. Also, it's a Balkan Cup game, so not relevant for friendly matches.\n\n3. April 26, 2023, in Borovo against Poland. Score is 2:1 and type is friendly. This matches the claim again.\n\n4. August 27, 2023, in Bucharest, Romania against Romania. Result was 1:4 and it's a Balkan Cup game. Doesn't match.\n\n5. September 10, 2023, in Luxembourg against Luxembourg. Score is 5:0, which doesn't match 2:1, but the type is \"1982 wcq\" which might be World Cup qualifying, not friendly.\n\n6. September 27, 2023, in Ljubljana against Denmark. Result was 2:1 and type is \"1982 wcq\". So it's a World Cup qualifier, not a friendly match. Doesn't count for the claim.\n\n7. November 15, 2023, in Torino, Italy against Italy. Score is 0:2, so Yugoslavia lost here. Not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, there are two matches where Yugoslavia won with a score of 2:1 and they were friendly games: row 0 and row 2. \n\nWait, but looking at the rows:\n\nRow 0 (march 22): friendly, 2:1 win.\nRow 2 (april 26): friendly, 2:1 win.\n\nSo that's two matches where they won by 2:1 in friendly games. Therefore, the claim says \"both of its friendly match\" implying all such matches, which are only these two. So yes, the claim is true because both their friendly matches resulted in a 2:1 victory.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are more than two or exactly two. From the table, only rows 0 and 2 fit. So the claim says \"both of its friendly match\", which might mean all friendly matches, implying that there are only two. Therefore, it's true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Yugoslavian national team won both of their friendly matches with a score of 2:1 each.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 1:4 in the balkan cup against romania on august 27.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. \n\n1. **Event Type**: It mentions \"balkan cup.\"\n2. **Date**: August 27.\n3. **Opponent**: Romania.\n4. **Result**: Loss with a score of 1:4.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a match. The columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where:\n- Date is August 27.\n- Opponent is Romania.\n- Results show a loss (score is 1:4).\n- Type of game is Balkan Cup.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: March 22, Sarajevo vs Uruguay. Friendly match, score 2:1. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: March 30, Belgrade vs Romania. Balkan Cup, score 2:0. Not 1:4.\n- Row 2: April 26, Borovo vs Poland. Friendly, 2:1. No.\n- Row 3: August 27, Bucharest vs Romania. Balkan Cup, 1:4 loss. Yes, this matches all criteria.\n- Rows after that are in September and November, so not August.\n\nSo the relevant cell is row index 3, column \"results\" which is \"1:4\", but actually, since the claim mentions the opponent as Romania, I should check the 'opponent' column as well. Wait, no, the claim says Yugoslavia lost against Romania on that date, and the table's third row (row 3) has the opponent as Romania. So both date and opponent match.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3, \"results\" for the score.\n- Also, perhaps \"opponent\" column since it's Romania.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's a match on August 27 against Romania with a 1:4 loss in the Balkan Cup.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We're interested in 'date', 'opponent', 'results', and 'type of game'.\n2. **Search for August 27**: Only row 3 has this date.\n3. **Check Opponent**: Romania matches the claim.\n4. **Result**: The score is 1:4, indicating a loss.\n5. **Type of Game**: It's listed as Balkan Cup, which matches.\n\n**Conclusion:** All conditions are met in row 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim is: \"the yugoslavian national team lose the balkan cup against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n1. The Yugolsavian national team lost.\n2. It was in the Balkan Cup.\n3. Against Romania.\n4. The aggregate score is 3:4.\n\nI need to check if this information matches any row in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the following columns: date, city, opponent, results, type of game. So, I should look for a row where:\n- Opponent is Romania.\n- The game is Balkan Cup.\n- The result is 3:4 against them.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Date: March 22\n- City: Sarajevo\n- Opponent: Uruguay\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type: Friendly\n\nNot relevant because opponent isn't Romania and it's a friendly game, not Balkan Cup.\n\nRow 1:\n- Date: March 30\n- City: Belgrade\n- Opponent: Romania\n- Results: 2:0\n- Type: Balkan Cup\n\nHere, the opponent is Romania, but the result is 2:0. So it's a win, not a loss. Also, the type is Balkan Cup, which matches part of the claim. However, since they won, this row doesn't support the claim that Yugoslavia lost.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: April 26\n- City: Borovo\n- Opponent: Poland\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type: Friendly\n\nNot relevant as opponent is Poland and it's a friendly game.\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: August 27\n- City: Bucharest, Romania\n- Opponent: Romania\n- Results: 1:4\n- Type: Balkan Cup\n\nOpponent is Romania, type is Balkan Cup. The result is 1:4, which is a loss for Yugoslavia (since the opponent is Romania). So this row shows that Yugoslavia lost against Romania in the Balkan Cup with a score of 1:4.\n\nRow 4:\n- Date: September 10\n- City: Luxembourg\n- Opponent: Luxembourg\n- Results: 5:0\n- Type: 1982 WCQ\n\nNot relevant because opponent is Luxembourg and it's a World Cup qualifier, not Balkan Cup.\n\nRow 5:\n- Date: September 27\n- City: Ljubljana\n- Opponent: Denmark\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type: 1982 WCQ\n\nAgain, not relevant for the claim at hand.\n\nRow 6:\n- Date: November 15\n- City: Torino, Italy\n- Opponent: Italy\n- Results: 0:2\n- Type: 1982 WCQ\n\nNot applicable because opponent is Italy and it's a World Cup qualifier, not Balkan Cup.\n\nSo, the only row that matches parts of the claim is Row 3. However, in Row 3, Yugoslavia scored 1 goal against Romania, which resulted in a loss for Yugoslavia (since they are the home team or the team in question). The claim says the aggregate score was 3:4, but here it's 1:4.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if it's an aggregate score. Aggregate usually means total over two legs, but in this table, each game is a single entry. So perhaps each game's result is considered as a single match.\n\nIn Row 3, the result is 1:4, meaning Yugoslavia lost that specific game with a score of 1:4. The claim mentions an aggregate score of 3:4. If it's an aggregate over two games, maybe, but looking at the table, I don't see another match between Yugoslavia and Romania in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misrepresenting the result. Since the row shows a loss with 1:4, not 3:4, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lose the Balkan Cup against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4.\" So maybe it's implying that over two games, Yugoslavia lost 3:4. But in the table, there's only one game where Yugoslavia played against Romania in the Balkan Cup, and that was a 1:4 loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be false because the actual result was a 1:4 loss, not an aggregate of 3:4.\n\nAlternatively, if \"aggregate\" refers to just that single match, then the score is 1:4, which doesn't match 3:4. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim is false because there's no match where Yugoslavia lost against Romania with a score of 3:4; instead, they lost 1:4 in a single game.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 0:2 against italy.\" I need to parse this into two main points:\n\n1. The Yugoslavian team failed to score in only one game.\n2. They lost a World Cup qualifying match with the score of 0:2 against Italy.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. So I need to check for any matches where Yugoslavia scored zero goals because that would mean they failed to score in those games.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- March 22: Yugoslavia vs Uruguay, score 2:1 \u2013 They scored, so not relevant.\n- March 30: Yugoslavia (as Romania?) Wait, no, looking at the table again. The first match is Yugoslavia against Uruguay with a score of 2:1. Next, on March 30, it's Yugoslavia against Romania, 2:0. So in that game, they scored two goals.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"fail to score only 1 time.\" Wait, does that mean they failed once or that they failed once and otherwise succeeded? I think the user might be saying they didn't score in one match, not all matches.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- April 26: Yugoslavia vs Poland, 2:1 \u2013 They scored.\n- August 27: Yugoslavia vs Romania, 1:4 \u2013 They scored once, so that's one goal, but not zero. So no failure there.\n- September 10: Yugoslavia vs Luxembourg, 5:0 \u2013 Definitely scored multiple times.\n- September 27: Yugoslavia vs Denmark, 2:1 \u2013 Scored again.\n- November 15: Yugoslavia vs Italy, 0:2 \u2013 Here, they didn't score at all. So that's one match where they failed to score.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is true because there's only one match (against Italy) where they failed to score.\n\nNow, the second part: they lost a World Cup qualifying match against Italy with a 0:2 scoreline. Looking back at the November 15 match, the opponent was Italy, and the result was 0:2. The type of game is listed as \"1982 wcq,\" which I believe stands for World Cup qualification. So that matches the claim.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the November 15 row's opponent and results columns, along with the type of game column to confirm it's a WCQ.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The '1982 wcq' likely refers to the 1982 World Cup qualifying matches. \n\nNext, I'll go through each row where the type is '1982 wcq':\n\n1. September 10: Against Luxembourg. The result is 5-0 in favor of Yugoslavia.\n2. September 27: Against Denmark. Result is 2-1 for Yugoslavia.\n3. November 15: Against Italy. Result is 0-2, so Yugoslavia lost.\n\nNone of these have a score of 7-3 for Yugoslavia. The highest goals scored by Yugoslavia is 5 against Luxembourg and 2 against Denmark. They didn't score 7 in any match, nor did they allow only 3 goals in the same game during their 1982 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the Yugoslavian national team winning both of its friendly matches by a score of 0:2 is true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score 0:2.\" So, they're talking about two friendly matches where Yugoslavia won with a score of 0:2. But wait, if they won, the score should be in their favor, like 2:0 or something else, not 0:2 because that would mean they lost.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: date, city, opponent, results, type of game. The relevant information for friendly matches and their outcomes are in the 'type of game' (friendly) and 'results' columns.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if there are any friendly matches where Yugoslavia won with a 0:2 score.\n\n1. First row: March 22, Sarajevo vs Uruguay. The result is 2:1. That's a friendly match, but they didn't win; it was a draw? Wait, no, 2:1 means Uruguay scored twice, so Yugoslavia lost. So this isn't a win for Yugoslavia.\n\n2. Second row: March 30, Belgrade vs Romania. Result is 2:0. This is a Balkan Cup match, not friendly. So irrelevant to the claim about friendly matches.\n\n3. Third row: April 26, Borovo vs Poland. Result is 2:1, friendly. Again, Yugoslavia lost because it's 2:1 against them? Wait, no\u2014wait, the result is written as \"2:1\" in the table. So if it's Yugoslavia vs Poland and the result is 2:1, that would mean Poland won by a score of 2:1. So again, Yugoslavia lost.\n\n4. Fourth row: August 27, Bucharest vs Romania. Result is 1:4. This is a Balkan Cup match, so not friendly.\n\n5. Fifth row: September 10, Luxembourg vs Luxembourg? Wait, the opponent is Luxembourg and the type of game is 1982 WCQ. The result is 5:0. So Yugoslavia scored five goals against Luxembourg in a World Cup qualifier. That's a win for Yugoslavia, but it's not a friendly match.\n\n6. Sixth row: September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark. Result is 2:1, and type of game is 1982 WCQ. So another qualifying match, Yugoslavia won with a score of 2:1. Another win, but again in a World Cup context.\n\n7. Seventh row: November 15, Torino vs Italy. Result is 0:2, type of game is 1982 WCQ. Here, Yugoslavia lost to Italy 0:2, which would mean they didn't win this match.\n\nNow, looking for friendly matches where Yugoslavia won with a score of 0:2. But in all the friendly matches listed, the results are either 2:1 losses or wins against lower opponents but not by 0:2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'opponent' column. For example, in the first row, opponent is Uruguay; so Yugoslavia vs Uruguay in a friendly match where the result was 2:1 for Uruguay, meaning Yugoslavia lost. Similarly, third row is Poland, and result is 2:1 against them, so they lost.\n\nLooking at all the friendly matches:\n\n- March 22: lost to Uruguay 2:1.\n- April 26: lost to Poland 2:1.\n- September 10: won against Luxembourg 5:0 (not friendly).\n- September 27: won against Denmark 2:1 (WCQ, not friendly).\n- November 15: lost to Italy 0:2.\n\nSo in the table provided, there are no instances of Yugoslavia winning a friendly match by any score, let alone 0:2. In fact, all their friendly matches result in losses except perhaps some wins against lower-tier teams but those aren't listed as friendly here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence in the table that Yugoslavia won both friendly matches with a score of 0:2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Yugoslavian national team won both of its friendly matches by a score of 0:2.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Yugoslavian national team is true or false by checking the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 2:1 in the balken cup against poland on march 22.\" I need to verify each part of this statement against the table.\n\nThe table has columns: date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. The data is a list of matches. So, I should check if there's a match where Yugoslavia (or whatever name they go by in the table) lost 2:1 against Poland in the Balken Cup on March 22.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: date \"march 22\", city \"sarajevo\", opponent \"uruguay\". The result is 2:1, and type is friendly. So this is a match on March 22, but it's against Uruguay, not Poland.\n  \n- Row 1: March 30, Belgrade vs Romania. Result 2:0, Balkan Cup. Not relevant.\n\n- Row 2: April 26, Borovo vs Poland. Result 2:1, friendly. This is a match against Poland but it's on April 26, not March 22, and the result is a win, not a loss. So Yugoslavia won this one.\n\n- Row 3: August 27, Bucharest vs Romania. Result 1:4, Balkan Cup. Not relevant to the claim.\n\n- Row 4: September 10, Luxembourg vs Luxembourg. 5:0, 1982 WCQ. Not relevant.\n\n- Row 5: September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark. 2:1, 1982 WCQ. Also not relevant.\n\n- Row 6: November 15, Torino vs Italy. 0:2, 1982 WCQ. Again, not relevant to the March 22 match against Poland.\n\nSo, in the table, I don't see a match where Yugoslavia lost 2:1 against Poland on March 22. The closest is Row 0, but that's against Uruguay, and it's a friendly game where they won 2:1. There's also Row 2 where they played Poland on April 26 and won 2:1.\n\nWait, the claim says \"worst outcome\" which implies a loss. So Yugoslavia losing would mean their result is less than 2:1, but in the table, I don't see any match against Poland where they lost. They either drew or won against Poland in the games listed.\n\nAlso, the term \"Balken cup\" might be a typo; maybe it's supposed to be Balkan Cup. Looking at the table, there are two matches under \"balkan cup\": Row 1 and Row 3. But neither of these is against Poland or on March 22.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because there's no match in the provided data where Yugoslavia lost 2:1 against Poland in the Balkan Cup on March 22.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the yugoslavavian national team lose the italy against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The Yugo team is playing against Italy and Romania, but wait, in the table, I see matches involving Yugoslavia (or others) on different dates.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. I need to find any match where Yugoslavia plays against Italy or Romania with a losing score of 3:4 aggregate.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- March 22, Sarajevo vs Uruguay (friendly). Not relevant as it's not Italy or Romania.\n\nRow 1:\n- March 30, Belgrade vs Romania, score 2:0. This is a match between Yugoslavia and Romania. But the claim mentions losing to Italy against Romania. Wait, so this is Yugoslavia playing Romania, but the opponent in this case is Romania, not Italy.\n\nRow 2:\n- April 26, Borovo vs Poland (friendly). Not relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- August 27, Bucharest vs Romania, score 1:4. Again, Yugoslavia plays Romania here. So in these two rows (1 and 3), Yugoslavia lost to Romania with scores of 0:2 and 1:4? Wait no, row 1 is 2:0, which is a win for Yugoslavia against Romania. Row 3 is 1:4, so Yugoslavia lost this one.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lost against Italy. So I need to see if there's any match where Yugoslavia played Italy and lost with an aggregate score of 3:4. But looking at the table, I don't see any matches involving Italy as the opponent except maybe in row 5 or 6.\n\nRow 5:\n- September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark (1982 WCQ). Not relevant.\n\nRow 6:\n- November 15, Torino vs Italy, score 0:2. Here, Yugoslavia plays Italy. The result is 0:2, so Yugoslavia lost this match. But the claim mentions a score of 3:4. Also, the type of game here is \"1982 wcq\". So in this match, Yugoslavia lost to Italy with a score of 0:2.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lost against Italy and Romania. From the table, Yugoslavia played against Romania twice: once won (2:0) and once lost (1:4). They also played against Italy once, losing 0:2.\n\nSo the claim is talking about losing to both Italy and Romania with a total score of 3:4 aggregate. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nWait, in the matches against Romania, Yugoslavia lost once with 1:4, which is a higher score than 3:4? No, 1:4 is 5 goals difference. In the match against Italy, they lost 0:2, which is 2 goals difference. So together, if we add up their losses against both, it's not 3:4.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to a specific aggregate score in total? Or perhaps it's about the total across all matches. Let me check each match:\n\nAgainst Italy: Yugoslavia lost once, 0:2.\nAgainst Romania: They lost once, 1:4. So combined, they have two losses: 0:2 and 1:4, which doesn't add up to 3:4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is mixing up the opponents. It says \"lose the italy against romania\", which might mean that Yugoslavia played against Italy and lost, but also against Romania and lost, with an aggregate score of 3:4. But from the table, the losses are 0:2 (against Italy) and 1:4 (against Romania), totaling to 3:6 across both matches.\n\nSo the claim's aggregate score is incorrect because it says 3:4, but the actual total is higher. Therefore, the claim is false because the scores don't add up as stated.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to check if Yugoslavia lost against Italy and Romania with a combined score of 3:4.\n\n1. **Matches involving Italy**: Only one match where Yugoslavia played Italy (Row 6), resulting in a loss with a score of 0:2.\n2. **Matches involving Romania**: Two matches; Yugoslavia won the first (2:0) but lost the second (1:4).\n   \nThe total scores from these matches are:\n- Against Italy: 0:2\n- Against Romania: 1:4\n\nCombined, it's 3:6, not 3:4. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark.\" Hmm, I need to parse this carefully. It seems like there are two main parts here. \n\nThe first part is about failing to score only once. So the claim is saying that Yugoslavia didn't score in one match but lost 2-1. The second part mentions dropping a World Cup qualifying match against Denmark with the same scoreline.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. Each row represents a different match.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a match where Yugoslavia didn't score (so 0 goals) but lost 2-1. Or wait, actually, the claim says they failed to score only once, which might mean that in one match they didn't score but still lost 2-1. Alternatively, it could mean that they scored only once and lost 2-1.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let's look at each relevant aspect:\n\n1. Did Yugoslavia fail to score only once? That would mean in one match, they had zero goals scored.\n\n2. They dropped (lost) a World Cup qualifying match against Denmark with a score of 2:1.\n\nSo I need to find matches where the results are 2-1 and see if it's against Denmark, and also check if Yugoslavia didn't score (0 goals) in that match.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0:\nDate: March 22\nCity: Sarajevo\nOpponent: Uruguay\nResults: 2:1\nType of game: Friendly\n\nSo Yugoslavia scored 2 goals and won against Uruguay. So this doesn't fit because they did score, and it's not against Denmark.\n\nRow 1:\nMarch 30, Belgrade vs Romania, 2:0, Balkan Cup. Again, 2 goals scored, so not relevant for a 0-2 loss.\n\nRow 2:\nApril 26, Borovo vs Poland, 2:1, Friendly. They scored twice, so not the case where they didn't score but lost 2-1.\n\nRow 3:\nAugust 27, Bucharest Romania vs Yugoslavia, 1:4. So here, opponent is Romania, and results are 1-4. Not against Denmark.\n\nRow 4:\nSeptember 10, Luxembourg vs Luxembourg, 5:0. Wait, the opponent is Luxembourg, but I'm not sure if this is Yugoslavia or their opponents. Let me check:\n\nLooking at row 4: date September 10, city Luxembourg, opponent Luxembourg, results 5-0, type of game 1982 wcq.\n\nWait, so is the team here Yugoslavia? Because the column \"opponent\" is usually another team, but if it's the same country, maybe it's a home match. So perhaps in this case, the match was between Yugoslavia and Luxembourg, and Yugoslavia scored 5 goals. Not relevant for our claim.\n\nRow 5:\nSeptember 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark, 2:1, 1982 wcq. Here, the opponent is Denmark, results are 2-1, and type of game is 1982 wcq, which could be World Cup qualifying.\n\nSo in this match, Yugoslavia scored 2 goals against Denmark and won 2-1. So they did score, but the claim says they failed to score only once, implying that in this match, they didn't score but lost 2-1. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that Yugoslavia failed to score only once in a match where they lost 2-1 against Denmark. But in row 5, they scored twice, so that doesn't fit. Maybe the claim is referring to another match where Yugoslavia didn't score but lost 2-1.\n\nWait, let's check all matches again for any where the opponent was Denmark and results were 2:1 with Yugoslavia scoring zero.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nOnly row 5 has Denmark as the opponent. The result there is 2-1 in favor of Yugoslavia. So they scored twice. Therefore, there's no match where Yugoslavia faced Denmark, didn't score (0 goals), but lost 2-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the claim refers to a different match not listed here, but according to this table, there is no such match. So maybe the answer is false because the claim isn't supported by any of these matches.\n\nAlso, checking for the second part: they dropped (lost) a World Cup qualifying match against Denmark 2-1. But in row 5, Yugoslavia won against Denmark 2-1, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't seem to be supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Yugoslavia failed to score only once and lost a World Cup qualifying match 2-1 against Denmark. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- There is no match where Yugoslavia faced Denmark, did not score (0 goals), and lost 2-1.\n- The only match against Denmark (row 5) was a win for Yugoslavia with a score of 2-1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is unsupported by the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions the Yugoslavian national team scoring 7 goals while allowing 3 goals against them during a 1982 World Cup qualifier.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. The data rows have specific matches from March to November, but I'm only interested in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers. So I need to identify which rows correspond to that year and the World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nI see in the table that there's a match on September 10, 1982, against Luxembourg, with a score of 5:0. That's one row. Then another on September 27, 1982, against Denmark, scored 2:1. Finally, November 15, 1982, against Italy, with a score of 0:2.\n\nWait, the claim mentions scoring 7 goals and allowing 3. Looking at the data:\n\n- September 10, 1982: Yugoslavia vs Luxembourg. The result is 5-0 in favor of Yugoslavia. So they scored 5 goals.\n- September 27, 1982: Yugoslavia vs Denmark. Score is 2-1. Again, Yugoslavia scored 2.\n- November 15, 1982: Against Italy, score 0-2, so Yugoslavia didn't score.\n\nNone of these matches show the Yugoslavian team scoring 7 goals or allowing just 3. The highest score they achieved in these World Cup qualifiers is 5 against Luxembourg and 2 against Denmark. So the claim's numbers don't match any of these games.\n\nI need to check if there are other rows that might fit, but looking through the table, all relevant 1982 World Cup qualifiers are accounted for, and none have the scores mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Yugoslavian national team scored 7 goals and conceded 3 during a 1982 World Cup qualifying match, but the table shows no such match with those scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
