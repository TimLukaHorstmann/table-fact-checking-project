    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a basketball game is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"With a final score of 75 - 86, B Shaw has 5 assists.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's in JSON format with several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and series. The data has five rows, each representing a different game.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where B Shaw had 5 assists when the team scored 75-86. So, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with row 0: The score is \"l 75 - 86\", which means they lost 75-86. Looking at the high assists column, it's listed as \"b shaw (5)\". That matches the claim exactly\u2014B Shaw has 5 assists in this game where they scored 75-86.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure there isn't another row that might also have a score of 75-86. Let me scan through all the rows:\n\nRow 0: Score l 75 - 86\nRow 1: Score w 109 - 103\nRow 2: Score w 115 - 83\nRow 3: Score l 97 - 104\nRow 4: Score l 111 - 116\n\nSo, only row 0 has the score of 75-86. In that same row, B Shaw is listed with 5 assists. That seems to fully support the claim.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information or other rows where B Shaw has 5 assists with that specific score. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row index for this is 0. The columns involved are \"score\" and \"high assists\". So the relevant cells are at row 0, column \"score\" and row 0, column \"high assists\".\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has multiple entries. For example, in row 0, the score is given as \"l 75 - 86\", which I think corresponds to the \"score\" column. The high assists are listed as \"b shaw (5)\", under the \"high assists\" column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells should be both the \"score\" and \"high assists\" in row 0.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden.\" So I'm being asked about a specific game where the location attendance is at Boston Garden. I need to check if this information exists in the provided table and matches the claim.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, series. The data rows have 5 games listed from May 7 to May 15. Each row represents a different game with various statistics.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim mentions \"location attendance,\" so that column is definitely relevant. But the specific part is about \"the 1 - 1\" series result. So I have to find where in the table the series is mentioned as 1 - 1.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: game 1, date May 7, team Detroit Pistons, score l 75 - 86. Series is listed as 0 - 1.\nRow 1: game 2, date May 9, team same, score w 109 - 103. Series is 1 - 1.\nRow 2: game 3, series 2 - 1.\nRow 3: game 4, series 2 - 2.\nRow 4: game 5, series 2 - 3.\n\nSo in row 1 (index 1), the series is 1 - 1. Now, looking at the location attendance column for that row, it's \"boston garden.\" So both conditions are met: the series is 1-1 and the location is Boston Garden.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because there's a game (row index 1) where the series is 1 - 1 and the location attendance is Boston Garden.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let's start by understanding what each part means.\n\nThe claim says: \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2.\" So I'm looking for games played at Boston Garden where the series score is 5-2.\n\nLooking at the table, let me first identify which rows and columns are relevant. The table has several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and series. For this claim, I think the relevant columns would be 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', and 'series'. But more specifically, since we're focusing on the series record, the key column is 'series'.\n\nEach row represents a game with various stats. The series number seems to increment after each game, so for example, row 0 has a series of 0-1, row 1 is 1-1, and so on. Wait, looking again: row 0 shows \"l 75 - 86\" which results in a loss, so the series is 0-1 because it's Detroit Pistons losing to Boston Celtics (I think), but I'm not sure if the series numbers are from Pistons' perspective or overall. But regardless, each game has its own series number based on the order of play.\n\nThe claim is specifically about a series record of 5-2 at Boston Garden. So I need to find a row where 'location attendance' is Boston Garden and the 'series' column shows 5-2.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 0: location is \"boston garden\", series is \"0 - 1\"\nRow 1: same location, series \"1 - 1\"\nRow 2: location is \"the palace of auburn hills\", so not Boston Garden\nRow 3: same as row 2\nRow 4: same as row 0 and 1 (Boston Garden)\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait the 'location attendance' for each game:\n\nRow 0: \"boston garden\"\nRow 1: \"boston garden\"\nRow 2: \"the palace of auburn hills\"\nRow 3: \"the palace of auburn hills\"\nRow 4: \"boston garden\"\n\nSo rows 0,1,4 are at Boston Garden. Now I need to check the 'series' column for these rows.\n\nRow 0: series is \"0 - 1\" (if it's Pistons, then their record is 0-1 in that series)\nRow 1: series is \"1 - 1\"\nRow 4: series is \"2 - 3\"\n\nWait, the claim says a series of 5-2. So none of these rows have a series of 5-2. The highest series for Boston Garden is row 4 at 2-3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'series' column. Let me look again:\n\nRow 0: series \"0 - 1\"\nRow 1: series \"1 - 1\"\nRow 2: series \"2 - 1\" (location is different)\nRow 3: series \"2 - 2\"\nRow 4: series \"2 - 3\"\n\nSo the highest series at Boston Garden is 2-3. There's no row where the series is 5-2.\n\nWait, maybe the series is tracked differently. For example, perhaps each game in the Pistons' series is numbered. So if it's a best-of-seven or something, but looking at the data, there are only five games listed (games 1 to 5). Each row increments the series, so game 0 is series 0-1, game 1 is 1-1, etc., up to game 4 being 2-3. So in total, it's a Pistons team playing multiple games, possibly in a playoff series, but the highest series number at Boston Garden is 2-3.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where the series is 5-2 at Boston Garden. The claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the maximum series record at Boston Garden for these games is 2-3. There are no entries with a 5-2 series record at that location.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
