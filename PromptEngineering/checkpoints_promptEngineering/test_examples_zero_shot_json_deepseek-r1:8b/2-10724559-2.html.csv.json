    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim made about Luca Toni is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Luca Toni has 258 apps and an all-time rank of 53.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the number of appearances, which is given as 258. The second part is about his all-time rank being 53.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their respective data. Since the claim mentions Luca Toni specifically, I should look for the row where \"name\" is \"Luca Toni.\"\n\nChecking the table, there's only one entry where the name is Luca Toni. It's in the fourth row of the data array. So, row_index 3 (since it starts from 0). \n\nNow, let's check each relevant column for this row. The columns to check are:\n1. apps: This should be the number of appearances.\n2. all - time rank: This is his ranking.\n\nLooking at the fourth row, \"apps\" is listed as 114 and the \"all-time rank\" is 53. Wait a minute, that's different from what the claim says. The claim states he has 258 apps, but in the table, it's 114. Also, his all-time rank is indeed 53, which matches.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The app number doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the number of appearances isn't 258 as stated.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the data. Let me double-check the table. The fourth row has \"luca toni\" with goals 114 and apps 258? No, looking again: no, it's 114 apps. So the claim says he has 258 apps, but in reality, it's 114.\n\nTherefore, the app count is wrong, so the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Luca Toni having 258 apps is incorrect; according to the table, he has 114 apps. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Player:** Look for \"luca toni\" in the table's data array. Found in row index 3.\n\n2. **Check Apps Column:** This row's apps value is 114, not 258 as claimed.\n\n3. **Check All-Time Rank:** The all-time rank is correctly stated as 53.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since one part of the claim (apps) doesn't match, the entire statement is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"all - time rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Diego Milito is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Diego Milito debut in 2008 and have 86 goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: rank, all-time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, and apps. The data rows include information about different football players.\n\nI know that Diego Milito is a well-known footballer. So, I need to find his row in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Name is Francesco Totti\n- Row 1: Antonio Di Natale\n- Row 2: Alberto Gilardino\n- Row 3: Luca Toni\n- Row 4: Antonio Cassano\n- Row 5: Giampaolo Pazzini\n- Row 6: Mirko Vondini\u0107 (I think this is him)\n- Then there's another entry with 8, name Diego Milito.\n\nWait, no. Looking closer, the data array has multiple rows. Let me list them properly:\n\nLooking at the data array in JSON:\n\n[\n    [1, \"2\", ...],\n    [2, \"11\", ...],\n    ..., \n    [\n        8,\n        \"97\",\n        \"diego milito\",\n        2008,\n        \"inter\",\n        86,\n        145\n    ],\n    [\n        8,\n        \"97\",\n        \"sergio pellissier\",\n        ...\n    ],\n    [\n        10, ... \n    ]\n]\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, there are two rows where the name is \"diego milito\": one at index 7 and another at index 8? Or perhaps I miscounted. Let me check:\n\nThe data array has elements from index 0 to 9.\n\nLooking at each row's name:\n\nRow 0: francesco totti\nRow 1: antonio di natale\nRow 2: alberto gilardino\nRow 3: lucas toni (spelled as Luca)\nRow4:antonio cassano\nRow5: giampaolo pazzini\nRow6: mirko vondinjac\nRow7: diego milito, with debut year 2008\nRow8: sergio pellissier\nRow9: amauri\n\nSo, Diego Milito is at row index 7.\n\nNow, the claim says he debuted in 2008 and has 86 goals. \n\nLooking at the data for row 7:\n\ndebut year: 2008 (matches)\ngoals: 86 (as per \"goals\" column)\n\nBut wait, looking at the columns, the order is rank, all-time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, apps.\n\nSo, in row index 7, the data is [8, \"97\", \"diego milito\", 2008, \"inter\", 86, 145].\n\nTherefore, both the debut year and the goals are correctly stated as per the claim. \n\nBut I need to check if there's another Diego Milito elsewhere. Wait, the next row (index 8) is sergio pellissier, so no.\n\nWait, but in the table, it's written as \"diego milito\" with 2008 and 86 goals. So both parts of the claim are true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with relevant cells being the row for Diego Milito: column \"debut year\" (index3) and \"goals\" (index5).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Diego Milito is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"Diego Milito, who scored 86 goals, have a debut year of 2008.\" So, there are two specific pieces of information being claimed here: Diego Milito scored 86 goals and he debuted in 2008.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: rank, all-time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, and apps (appearances). The data is provided in rows. My task is to find the relevant cells that can verify each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with Diego Milito's information. I need to check if there's a row where the \"name\" column matches \"Diego Milito.\" Scanning through the data, I see that on row 7 (index 7), the name is \"diego milito.\" Wait, his first name is listed as \"diego,\" but his last name might be in another language. However, it's spelled as \"milito\" here, so that seems correct.\n\nNext, the claim says he scored 86 goals. Looking at the \"goals\" column for this row, it shows 86. That matches up. So the goals part is verified.\n\nThen, the debut year is claimed to be 2008. The \"debut year\" column in the table for this row is indeed 2008. So that's correct too.\n\nNow, I need to check if all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Since both the goals and debut year align with the data, the entire claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider any possible discrepancies or typos in the names. For example, sometimes players might have slightly different name spellings or it might be a translation issue if the table is in another language. However, in this case, \"diego milito\" seems accurate. Also, there's only one Diego Milito in the data, so no confusion with other players.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that there are no other rows for Diego Milito, which could cause ambiguity. Scanning through the table again, I don't see another row with his name. So, the relevant cells are just this single row where all the details match the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe table has several columns: rank, all-time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, and apps. The data includes various players with their respective statistics.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"the person who have an all - time rank of 53 , have 258 apps.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It says that there's a player whose all-time rank is 53 and that this same player has 258 apps (appearances). My task is to check if any such player exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\nI'll go through each row to find someone with an \"all - time rank\" of 53. Wait, in the table, the column names are written as \"all - time rank,\" but I notice that sometimes it's just \"rank.\" Oh, no, actually, looking back, the columns include \"all-time rank\" (with spaces around the hyphen) and other entries. So in the data rows, for example, one row has 53 under \"all - time rank.\" Wait, let me check each row.\n\nRow 0: all-time rank is 2\nRow 1: 11\nRow 2: 16\nRow 3: 53\nRow 4: 77\nRow 5: 81 (twice)\nRow 6: 97 (twice)\nRow 7:10\nRow8: n/a\n\nSo the player with all-time rank of 53 is in row 3. Let's look at row 3.\n\nIn row 3, \"all - time rank\" is 53. Now, what about their apps? The apps column for this row is 258. So yes, they have 258 apps.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because there exists a player with an all-time rank of 53 and 258 apps.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that \"all - time rank\" in the table correctly corresponds to what's being checked. Let me double-check the columns: yes, it's \"all - time rank,\" so that's correct.\n\nSo each row has a rank and an all-time rank? Wait no, looking back at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are:\n- rank\n- all - time rank\n- name\n- debut year\n- current club\n- goals\n- apps\n\nWait, that's confusing. So for example, in row 0: rank is 1, and all-time rank is \"2\". Wait, but the claim refers to a person with an all-time rank of 53.\n\nSo yes, looking at row 3: all - time rank is 53, and apps are 258.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because such a player exists.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains a player with an \"all - time rank\" of 53, and this individual has exactly 258 appearances (apps). This directly supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"all - time rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"0 goal occur with diego milito in a debut year before 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Diego Milito scored 0 goals in his debut year, and that was before 2008. So I need to look for Diego Milito in the table and check two things: his debut year and whether he had any goals during that year.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"name\", \"debut year\", \"goals\", and possibly \"current club\". The claim doesn't mention the club, but knowing it might help confirm if it's the same player. The claim is specifically about his debut year before 2008 with 0 goals.\n\nNow, let's scan through each row for Diego Milito. I see that there are two entries for him:\n\n1. In row index 7 (since rows start at 0), name is \"diego milito\", debut year 2008, goals 86, current club inter.\n2. In row index 8, the name is \"sergio pellissier\", which might be a typo or another player.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, row index 7 has Diego Milito with debut year 2008 and 86 goals. That doesn't fit because the claim says before 2008. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nHold on, perhaps I miscounted the rows. Let me list them out:\n\n- Row 0: francesco totti\n- Row 1: antonio di natale\n- Row 2: alberto gilardino\n- Row 3: luca toni\n- Row 4: antonio cassano\n- Row 5: giampaolo pazzini\n- Row 6: mirko vu\u010dini\u0107\n- Row 7: diego milito\n- Row 8: sergio pellissier\n- Row 9: amauri\n\nSo Diego Milito is in row 7, which has a debut year of 2008. The claim says \"before 2008\", so that's not matching. Therefore, there might be an error here because the claim is about before 2008 but the table shows his debut as 2008.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"0 goal occur with diego milito in a debut year before 2008.\" So perhaps it's not saying that he scored 0 goals in his first season, but rather that at some point (maybe his first game or his debut) before 2008, he had 0 goals.\n\nBut looking at the data, each row represents the player's stats. For Diego Milito in row 7, his goals in that year are 86, not 0. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it. Maybe it's referring to a specific game or context where he had 0 goals before 2008. But according to the table, his first season (debut year 2008) he scored 86 goals, not 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't seem to be supported by the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 96 goal achieve when chievo be the club which debut after 1999.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means and check against the table's data. \n\nThe first part of the claim is about a player achieving 96 goals while playing for Chievo, and Chievo being their debut club after 1999. So, two main points: 1) Does any player have exactly 96 goals at Chievo? 2) Was Chievo that player's debut club and did they join after 1999?\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see \"goals\" and \"debut year.\" The rows are players with their stats. \n\nI'll go through each row to find if any player has 96 goals. Scanning each 'goals' column:\n\n- Row 0: 230\n- Row 1: 180\n- Row 2: 164\n- Row 3: 114\n- Row 4: 99\n- Row 5: 95\n- Row 6: 95\n- Row 7: 86\n- Row 8: 86\n- Row 9: 76\n\nNone of the players have exactly 96 goals. The closest is 95, but that's not 96.\n\nNext, checking for Chievo as a debut club after 1999. Looking at the 'current club' and 'debut year':\n\nIn row 8, the player is Diego Milito with debut year 2008, current club Inter. Not Chievo.\nRow 7: Sergio Pellissier, debut 2002, current club Chievo. His goals are 86.\n\nSo, only one player (Sergio Pellissier) is in Chievo, but his goals are 86, not 96. Also, he debuted in 2002, which is after 1999, so the timing is correct. However, since the goals don't reach 96, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"there be 96 goal achieve when chievo be the club...\" So it's implying that there exists a player with 96 goals in Chievo who debuted after 1999. But from the table, no such player exists because none have 96 goals. Thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a player has achieved 96 goals at Chievo, which debut after 1999. Checking the table, no player meets both criteria: only Sergio Pellissier is with Chievo post-1999, but he scored 86 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107 didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant data in the table. The claim mentions \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107,\" so I should find his row in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see two entries with \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107.\" One is at index 6 and another at index 7.\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I need to check the columns that are relevant to the claim: 'debut year' and 'goals.' \n\nLooking at row 6: debuting in 2004. The claim says \"later than 2008,\" so this is before 2008. Therefore, even though there's data here, it doesn't apply because the debut was earlier.\n\nRow 7: debuting in 2000. Again, this is before 2008, so it also doesn't meet the criteria of a debut year later than 2008.\n\nSince both relevant rows for \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107\" have debut years before 2008, there's no data point where his debut was after 2008. Therefore, we can't confirm whether he scored any goals in a debut year beyond 2008 because such a row doesn't exist in the table.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the other columns like 'goals' might not be necessary here because the claim is about whether he didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008. Since there's no such row where his debut was after 2008, we can't verify or falsify that specific condition.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the table, the claim doesn't hold true because there's no data point supporting it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if there's any row for \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107\" with a debut year later than 2008.
