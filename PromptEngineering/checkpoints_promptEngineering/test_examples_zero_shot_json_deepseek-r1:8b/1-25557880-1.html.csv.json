    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"every team have several win\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to identify which ones are relevant to the claim. The claim mentions 'wins,' so the relevant column is \"wins.\" Each row represents a different context, like a season or series, and each team's performance in that context.\n\nNow, I need to check all the rows for any occurrence where a team didn't have at least one win. If even one team has zero wins in any given context, then the claim isn't fully supported, making it false.\n\nLooking through the \"wins\" column:\n\n1. The first row (2007, Formula Renault 2.0 Italy) shows 0 wins.\n2. The second row (2007, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0) also has 0 wins.\n3. The third row for the same series in 2007 shows 4 wins.\n4. In 2008, both Formula Renault 2.0 and Eurocup entries have 0 wins.\n5. For 2009, the Manor Motorsport teams have 0 wins.\n6. The 2010 Italian Formula Three has 3 wins.\n7. The 2011 Formula Renault 3.5 series shows 0 wins.\n\nFrom this, I see multiple instances where teams had zero wins. Even though some teams did win in certain contexts, the presence of at least one team with no wins contradicts the claim that \"every team have several win.\" \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because not every team has multiple wins; some have none.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
