    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The columns are teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, and series record. The data rows provide information about each game series between different colleges.\n\nThe claim mentions \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here. It probably should say \"90 games were played for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" So, the user is claiming that 90 games were played in a series related to the sawhorse dollar trophy.\n\nLooking at the table data, each row represents a different series between two teams. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"trophy\" and \"games played.\" I need to find the row where the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar.\"\n\nIn the data provided:\n- The first row has \"empire state bowl\" as the trophy.\n- Second row: \"trustee 's cup.\"\n- Third row: \"sawhorse dollar.\"\n- Fourth row: \"the game.\"\n- Fifth row: \"none.\"\n\nSo, the third row is about dartmouth - princeton with the sawhorse dollar trophy. Let's check the games played column for that row. It says 90 games.\n\nNow, let's make sure there isn't another series with the same trophy but different games played. In this table, each series seems unique in their trophy names except maybe \"none,\" which probably means no trophies were awarded or none applicable. Since the third row is the only one with \"sawhorse dollar\" and it lists 90 games, that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should also check if the claim correctly mentions the teams involved. The claim refers to \"the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" In the table, the series between Dartmouth and Princeton has the sawhorse dollar trophy with 90 games played. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate because there is indeed a series with 90 games played for the sawhorse dollar trophy.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in the table where the third row lists \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy and 90 games played.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"more than 100 games be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" Hmm, I notice a typo in \"be play\" but assuming it should be \"played.\" So, the corrected claim would be about whether there are more than 100 games played for the series that has the sawhorse dollar trophy.\n\nNow, let's check the table provided. The table has columns: teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, and series record. Each row in the data corresponds to a specific series with certain details.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row is \"columbia - cornell,\" trophy \"empire state bowl,\" with 98 games played.\n2. Second row: \"cornell - penn,\" no trophy mentioned, 118 games.\n3. Third row: \"dartmouth - princeton,\" trophy \"sawhorse dollar,\" 90 games.\n4. Fourth row: \"harvard - yale,\" trophy none, 129 games.\n5. Fifth row: \"princeton - yale,\" trophy none, 134 games.\n\nWait, the claim is about the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy. So we need to find the row where the trophy column is \"sawhorse dollar.\" Looking at row index 2 (since rows start from 0?), no, wait: in the table, the data array starts with index 0 as columbia - cornell, so row index 2 would be dartmouth - princeton. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 0: empire state bowl\nRow 1: none\nRow 2: sawhorse dollar\nRow 3: none\nRow 4: none\n\nSo the relevant series is in row index 2.\n\nNow, looking at that row, under \"games played\" it says \"90 games.\" The claim is whether more than 100 games are played. So 90 is less than 100. Therefore, the statement is false because the number of games played for the sawhorse dollar series is not over 100.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I misread something. Let's look again:\n\nYes, row index 2 (third entry) has trophy \"sawhorse dollar\" and games played as \"90.\" So that's 90, which is less than 100. Therefore, the claim that more than 100 games were played for this series is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: we need to identify which cells are used to verify this. Since the claim checks the \"games played\" column for the row where the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar,\" the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For row index 2 (since that's where sawhorse dollar is), and the column \"games played.\"\n\nSo, in the data array, each row corresponds to a series. The columns are as given: teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, series record.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include the cell at row 2, column \"games played.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the sawhorse dollar series had only 90 games played, which is less than 100. The relevant cell is where the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar\" and the number of games played.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
