The claim states: \"On March 13, 1990, played against Dundee and resulted in a 3 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers. The data rows provide information about each match.\n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the table. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Date**: March 13, 1990\n   - I'll look for a row where the date is \"13 march 1990.\" Checking the table, yes, there's a row with that exact date in the first column.\n\n2. **Opponent**: Dundee\n   - Looking at the opponent column, one of the rows has \"dundee\" as the opponent. This matches the claim.\n\n3. **Venue**: The venue might be important if it affects something else, but since the claim doesn't specify where the match was held (home or away), I'll focus on other aspects first.\n\n4. **Result**: 3 - 1\n   - The result column shows \"3 - 1\" for a row. Checking each row, yes, one has this exact result.\n\nNow, cross-referencing these points:\n\n- There's a match on March 13, 1990 against Dundee with a 3-1 result.\n- The relevant columns are date, opponent, and result.\n\nI need to ensure that all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Since all three aspects (date, opponent, result) align perfectly in one row, the claim is true. \n\nNext, I'll identify which cells correspond to these verifications:\n\n- For the date: it's in row 3 (since arrays start at 0), column \"date\".\n- Opponent is in row 3, column \"opponent\".\n- Result is also in row 3, column \"result\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row index 3 for date, opponent, and result columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like they're talking about a match where Dundee was the opponent, and the result was 3-4.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers. The data rows contain specific matches.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's any instance where the opponent is Dundee and the result is 3-4.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is East Fife, result is 1-1. Doesn't match.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is East Fife again, result is 2-1. Still not matching.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is Airdrieonians, result is 2-0. Not Dundee or 3-4.\n4. Row 3: Opponent is Dundee. The result here is 3-1. Hmm, that's close but not 3-4. So not a match.\n5. Row 4: Opponent is St Johnstone, result is 0-0. Not relevant.\n6. Row 5: Opponent is Motherwell, result is 3-4. Wait, the opponent here is Motherwell, not Dundee. So that's not it.\n\nSo in none of the rows does the opponent match Dundee with a result of 3-4. The only time the opponent is Dundee is row 3, but the result was 3-1, not 3-4.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true because there's no match where Dundee was the opponent and the result was 3-4 in the provided table.\n\nNow, to determine which cells are relevant. I need to find all rows where either the opponent is Dundee or the result is 3-4. Let me check each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent East Fife, result 1-1. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Same as above.\n- Row 2: Opponent Airdrieonians, result 2-0. No.\n- Row 3: Opponent Dundee, result 3-1. So this row has opponent=Dundee but result isn't 3-4.\n- Row 4: Opponent St Johnstone, result 0-0. No.\n- Row 5: Opponent Motherwell, result 3-4. So this row has result=3-4.\n\nSo the relevant rows are row 3 and row 5 because they contain either opponent=Dundee or result=3-4. However, for the claim in question, we're looking specifically where opponent is Dundee AND result is 3-4. Since that doesn't exist, maybe only row 3's opponent column is relevant, but the result isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include all rows where either condition is met since the user might be referring to any occurrence of Dundee as an opponent or a 3-4 result, even if they don't both occur in the same row. Or maybe only the cells that are directly relevant to the claim, which is both opponent and result.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim. The claim has two conditions: opponent=Dundee and result=3-4.\n\nSo, any row where opponent is Dundee would be relevant for the first condition. Any row where result is 3-4 would be relevant for the second condition. Therefore, I should include all rows that meet either of these criteria.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 3: Opponent=Dundee \u2192 relevant for opponent condition.\nRow 5: Result=3-4 \u2192 relevant for result condition.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row_index=3 (column opponent) and row_index=5 (columns result).\n\nWait, no. The columns for each cell are specific to their headers. For example, in row 3, \"opponent\" is Dundee, so that's one cell. In row 5, the result column has 3-4, which is another relevant cell.\n\nSo I need to include both cells from these rows.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list should include:\n\n- Row 3, column opponent\n- Row 5, column result\n\nThat way, checking those cells would confirm whether there's a match where Dundee was the opponent with a 3-4 result.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check if any row in the table has \"Dundee\" as the opponent and the result \"3 - 4\". Upon reviewing each row, none of them meet both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHowever, to verify, we must check the relevant cells that could potentially support the claim. These are:\n\n- The cell where the opponent is \"Dundee\" (row 3).\n- The cell where the result is \"3 - 4\" (row 5).\n\nThese cells may not directly support the claim, but they are the ones that would be checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
