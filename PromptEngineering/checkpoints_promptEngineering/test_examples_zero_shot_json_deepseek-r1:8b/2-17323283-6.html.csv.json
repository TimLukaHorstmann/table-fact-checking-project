    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that as of February 23rd, the Philadelphia Flyers' record is 40-11-10. \n\nFirst, I should look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns listed are game, february, opponent, score, and record. Since the claim is about the record, I should focus on the \"record\" column.\n\nNext, I need to find out where February 23rd falls in terms of the games listed. Each row has a game number starting from 49 up to 62. The \"february\" column indicates when each game took place. Let me check the rows for February.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- Game 50 happened on February 3rd.\n- Game 51 was on February 5th.\n- Game 52 on February 6th.\n- Game 53 on February 9th.\n- Game 54 on February 12th.\n- Game 55 on February 13th.\n- Game 56 on February 15th.\n- Game 57 on February 17th.\n- Game 58 on February 18th.\n- Game 59 on February 20th.\n- Game 60 on February 22nd.\n- Game 61 on February 23rd.\n\nSo, game 61 is the one that happened on February 23rd. Now, I should check what the record was after this game. The \"record\" column for game 61 shows \"40 - 11 - 10\". \n\nSince the claim directly matches this record value for February 23rd, it seems to be accurate. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is at row 61 with the \"record\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
