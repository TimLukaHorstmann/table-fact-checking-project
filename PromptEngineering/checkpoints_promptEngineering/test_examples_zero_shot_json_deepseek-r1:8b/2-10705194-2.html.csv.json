    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Jeremija Sanders' opponent's record is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying: \"the record of jeremija sanders' opponent be 8 - 4\". So, I need to find out who Jerry (assuming it's a typo for Yeremija) Sanders fought against and check their win-loss record before that fight.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event where someone fought. Each row has several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, etc. So, I should search through each row to find the one where the result is a win for Yeremija Sanders and see her opponent's record in that row.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the opponent's record being 8 - 4. So, I need to find all rows where the res column indicates a win by Yeremija Sanders and then check the opponent's record in those rows. If any of the opponents have an 8-4 record before fighting her, that supports the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: She won against Bubba Mcdaniel. His record is 4-0.\n2. Row 1: She beat Harvell Hunter, whose record was 5-0.\n3. Row 2: Opponent had a 6-0 record when she fought him.\n4. Row 3: She defeated Chester Lauchner, who was 2-0.\n5. Row 4: She fought Ryan Lopez, who was 1-0.\n6. Row 5: She beat Joe Bunch, opponent's record is not shown here but in a previous row? Wait, no\u2014each row represents separate fights.\n\nWait, actually, the table lists multiple rows where she has wins. Each win is against different opponents with varying records. So for each of her wins, we need to check if any opponent had an 8-4 record before fighting her.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\nI see that in Row 0, her opponent was Bubba Mcdaniel with a 4-0 record.\nRow 1: Opponent Harvell Hunter had 5-0.\nRow 2: Opponent was 6-0.\nRow 3: 2-0.\nRow 4: 1-0.\nRows where she lost or did not have an opponent? No, the rows are only about her wins.\n\nWait, but the claim is about her opponents having a record of 8-4. Looking through each row:\n\nI don't see any row where the opponent has an 8-4 record before fighting her. Each time, her opponents had different records like 4-0, 5-0, etc., but none at 8-4.\n\nSo, it seems that there's no evidence in the table supporting that any of her opponents had an 8-4 record before fighting her. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that there are no rows where Yeremija Sanders' opponent had an 8-4 record before their fight against her.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the record of opponent jeremija sander be 8 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"opponent jeremija sander.\" So I should look for rows where the \"opponent\" column has \"jeremija sander\". From the data, I see that in row 8 (index 8), the opponent is indeed \"jeremija sanders\" with a slight difference in spelling: \"sandrs\" vs \"sander.\" Wait, actually looking closely, it's \"jeremija sanders\" with an 'r' in \"sanders,\" which might be a typo. Hmm, but the claim says \"sander,\" so maybe it's a different spelling or perhaps the table has a typo.\n\nNext, the record is stated as \"8 - 2.\" I need to check if this exact record appears for \"jeremija sanders\" in the table. Looking at row 8, the opponent is \"jeremija sanders,\" and their record is \"8 - 2\" under the \"record\" column. So that seems to match.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's written as \"opponent jeremija sander be 8 - 2.\" There might be a discrepancy in the spelling of the opponent's name. In row 8, it's \"jeremija sanders,\" which is slightly different from \"sander\" in the claim. Could this be a typo? Maybe the table has a typo, or perhaps the claim uses a different spelling. I need to check if there are any other rows with \"jeremija sander.\" Scanning through all rows, I don't see another entry for \"jeremija sander\" except row 8.\n\nSo, assuming that \"sander\" and \"sandrs\" are considered the same opponent due to a possible typo, then the record is indeed 8 - 2. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are where the opponent's name appears and the record column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to locate the row where the opponent is \"jeremija sanders\" (or similar) and check their record.\n\n1. **Locate the Opponent**: Find rows with \"jeremija sanders\" in the \"opponent\" column. This occurs at row index 8.\n2. **Check Record**: In this row, the \"record\" is listed as \"8 - 2.\"\n\nSince the opponent's record matches the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
