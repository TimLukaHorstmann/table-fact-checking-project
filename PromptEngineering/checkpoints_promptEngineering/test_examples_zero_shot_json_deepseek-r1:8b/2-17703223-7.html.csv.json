    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that Bruno Brand\u00e3o from Brazil has a snatch of 157.0 kg. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, and total (kg). Each row represents an athlete with their respective data.\n\nI need to find Bruno Brand\u00e3o in the table. Scanning the \"name\" column: there's a row with \"bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )\". So that's the one we're focusing on.\n\nNow, looking at the columns relevant to the claim: the snatch is specifically mentioned. The claim refers to his snatch, so I need to check that value.\n\nLooking at the data for Bruno Brand\u00e3o, under \"snatch\", it says 157.0. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should also make sure there's no other possible interpretation. For instance, does \"bodyweight\" refer to the same thing? No, because bodyweight is separate from snatch lifts. The claim is about his performance in the snatch, so the relevant cell is definitely under the \"snatch\" column.\n\nSo, checking if the claim is fully supported: Yes, because the data directly shows Bruno Brand\u00e3o's snatch as 157.0 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cell confirming Bruno Brand\u00e3o's snatch weight is found at row index 3 under the \"snatch\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be ijose espinoza ( nca ) with total bodyweight greater than 100 kg.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to check each part against the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Person**: The claim refers to \"ijose espinoza (nca).\" Looking at the table, I need to find the row where the name is \"jos&eacute; espinoza (nca)\". Scanning through the rows, I see that this person is in row 7 (since it's the 8th entry, but indexes start at 0).\n\n2. **Check Snatch and Clean & Jerk Values**: The claim mentions a snatch of 153.0 kg and a clean & jerk of 180.0 kg. I'll look for these specific values in the \"snatch\" and \"clean & jerk\" columns for ijose espinoza. In row 7, under \"snatch,\" it's \"-\", which means not applicable or missing. Similarly, the \"clean & jerk\" is also \"-\". Since both are \"-\", there's no data to support these values for this person.\n\n3. **Total Bodyweight**: The claim states that ijose espinoza has a total bodyweight greater than 100 kg. Checking the \"bodyweight\" column in row 7, it's listed as 99.4 kg, which is less than 100 kg. This directly contradicts the claim.\n\nSince two out of three conditions are not met\u2014specifically, the snatch and clean & jerk values are missing, and the bodyweight doesn't exceed 100 kg\u2014the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"there be only 1 person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying two things:\n1. There's exactly one individual whose snatch weight is 153.0 kg.\n2. That same person has a total bodyweight of 104.70 kg.\n\nI need to check the table provided to see if any row meets both these conditions. \n\nLooking at the table, the columns are name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, and total (kg). The data rows have various values for these attributes. \n\nStarting with the first condition: a snatch of 153.0 kg. I'll go through each row to find who has this value in their \"snatch\" column.\n\nRow 0: Snatch is 175.0 \u2192 Not 153.0.\nRow 1: Snatch is 160.0 \u2192 No.\nRow 2: Snatch is 150.0 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: Snatch is 157.0 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: Snatch is 153.0 \u2192 Yes! This is one person.\nRow 5: Snatch is 140.0 \u2192 No.\nRows 6 to 10: Snatch is \"-\" or other values but none have 153.0.\n\nSo, only row 4 has a snatch of 153.0 kg. Now, check the second condition: bodyweight should be 104.70 kg.\n\nLooking at row 4's \"bodyweight\" column, it says 104.7 kg. Hmm, that's close but not exactly 104.70 as written in the claim. The claim specifies 104.70, which is precise to two decimal places. However, in the table, it's listed as 104.7, which might be rounded or formatted differently.\n\nWait, let me check again. Row 4: bodyweight is 104.7 kg. The claim says 104.70 kg. Does this difference matter? If the table has it as 104.7, does that mean it's actually 104.70? Or maybe there's a formatting issue where .70 is written as .7.\n\nI think in terms of numerical values, 104.7 and 104.70 are equivalent because they both represent the same amount to two decimal places. So, technically, it's correct. Therefore, row 4 meets both conditions.\n\nAre there any other rows with a snatch of 153.0 kg? From my earlier check, no. Only row 4 has that value. So, only one person meets both criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's exactly one person with a snatch of 153.0 kg and their total bodyweight is indeed 104.70 kg, considering the precision.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there is exactly one individual meeting both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
