    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 49ers win 8 of the game in the 1947 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions that the 49ers won 8 games during the 1947 season. So, my task is to check if there's any data in the provided table that supports or contradicts this statement.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. Each row represents a game played by what I assume is the 49ers team, given the context of the claim. Wait, actually, the opponents listed are Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, etc. Hmm, none of these are the San Francisco 49ers. That's confusing because the 49ers weren't playing in 1947\u2014they moved to California in 1946. So perhaps the team in question here is not the 49ers but another team.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread. Let me check the table again. The opponents are Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, New York Yankees, Buffalo Bills, etc. None of these teams are associated with the San Francisco 49ers in 1947 because the 49ers didn't exist there yet. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the team mentioned isn't even playing that season.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The table might not include all games, but perhaps one of these teams was known as the 49ers in 1947? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a different league or context.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the 49ers were a team name used by multiple franchises over time. For example, the San Francisco 49ers started in 1951, but before that, there was the Dayton Triangles and other teams with \"49ers\" in their names. But in 1947, the team that would become the San Francisco 49ers wasn't based in California yet.\n\nSo, considering this, the table lists games played by various teams, none of which are the San Francisco 49ers in 1947. Therefore, if the claim is stating that \"the 49ers\" (San Francisco 49ers) won 8 games in 1947, it's definitely false because they didn't exist as a team then.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure by checking each row. Let me go through each week:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent Brooklyn Dodgers, Result W. So this team won that game.\nWeek 2: Los Angeles Dons, Result W.\nWeek 3: Baltimore Colts, Result W.\nWeek 4: New York Yankees, Result L.\nWeek 5: Buffalo Bills, Result W.\nWeek 6: Baltimore Colts, Result T.\nWeek 7: Chicago Rockets, Result W.\nWeek 8: Cleveland Browns, Result L.\nWeek 9: Los Angeles Dons, Result W.\nWeek 10: New York Yankees, Result L.\nWeek 11: Cleveland Browns, Result L.\nWeek 12: Chicago Rockets, Result W.\nWeek 13: Brooklyn Dodgers, Result W.\nWeek 14: Buffalo Bills, Result T.\n\nSo the team in question here won 8 games out of 14. Now, if the claim is about \"the 49ers\" winning 8 games, but this team isn't the 49ers, then regardless of their number of wins, it's not the 49ers. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe the table is for a different team and the 49ers did win 8 games in 1947? No, that doesn't make sense because they weren't formed yet. So I think the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the 49ers first opponent of the season be the brooklyn dodger\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the San Francisco 49ers' first opponent in their season was the Brooklyn Dodgers. So, my goal is to check if this information matches any data in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. The data rows list each game with these details. My focus here is on the \"opponent\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I need to identify which row corresponds to the first game of the season, as the 49ers' first opponent would be in their initial matchup. Typically, a season starts around late August or early September, so I should look for games from those months.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n- Week 1: August 31, 1947 vs. Brooklyn Dodgers\n- Week 2: September 7, 1947 vs. Los Angeles Dons\n\nSo, week 1 is in August, which likely makes it the first game of the season. The opponent for that game is indeed the Brooklyn Dodgers. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's any other row before week 1. The table starts with week 1 as the earliest, so no prior games. Therefore, the first opponent is correctly identified.\n\nAnother point: sometimes teams play exhibitions or pre-season games that aren't part of the regular season. However, in this context, the table seems to represent the regular season games based on the column names and the data provided. So, week 1 is the start of the regular season.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. For example, if another row had the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first opponent but with a higher week number, that would contradict the claim. But looking through all the rows, week 1 is the only time they played the Dodgers in the early part of September.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing each relevant cell, it's clear that the 49ers' first opponent was indeed the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"august 31 1947 be the date of the first game of the season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It claims that August 31, 1947 was the very first game of the season.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. Each row represents a specific game played on a certain date.\n\nFirst, I should check what the \"week\" column indicates because that might help determine the order of games. The first week is usually the starting point of the season. So if August 31 is in week 1, that would make it the first game of the season.\n\nIn the table, the first row has week=1 and date=\"august 31 , 1947\". That seems to fit: week 1 on August 31st. But wait, sometimes sports seasons can start in a different week or even in another month if there's a specific event, like the Labor Day weekend. However, according to the table, week 1 is August 31, so that would be the first game.\n\nI should also check other columns related to the season. The \"record\" column might show how the team was doing over time. For example, after week 1, the record is 1-0. So if week 1 is the opener on August 31st, then yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, sometimes the first game isn't necessarily in week 1. Maybe it's a different structure. But according to the table, week 1 is August 31st, so it seems like the claim is supported by this data.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the table, August 31, 1947 was indeed the first game of the season because it corresponds to week 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the given table is true or false. The claim is: \"the 49ers tie 2 out of 14 game in the 1947 season.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The San Francisco 49ers are an NFL team, right? So they play a certain number of games each season. In this case, the claim is about their performance in the 1947 season. Specifically, it's saying that out of 14 games, they tied two games.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if there are any ties in the 49ers' games during that season. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. Each row represents a game.\n\nI notice that in the data section, each row corresponds to a week (from 1 to 14) with various opponents like Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, etc. Now, I need to check if any of these games resulted in a tie (denoted by 't' in the result column).\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions the 49ers tying 2 out of 14 games. So first, are there any ties at all in their 1947 season? Let me go through each row:\n\nWeek 1: Result is 'w', so win.\nWeek 2: 'w' again, win.\nWeek 3: 'w', another win.\nWeek 4: Opponent is New York Yankees, result is 'l', loss.\nWeek 5: 'w', win.\nWeek 6: Opponent is Baltimore Colts, result is 't'. Oh, so that's a tie. That's the first tie.\nWeek 7: 'w', win.\nWeek 8: Opponent is Cleveland Browns, result is 'l'.\nWeek 9: 'w', win.\nWeek 10: Opponent New York Yankees again, result is 'l'.\nWeek 11: Opponent Cleveland Browns, result is 'l'.\nWeek 12: 'w', win.\nWeek 13: Opponent Brooklyn Dodgers, result is 'w'.\nWeek 14: Opponent Buffalo Bills, result is 't'. So that's the second tie.\n\nSo there are two ties in their season. Now, looking at the claim again: it says they tied 2 out of 14 games. Since the season has 14 games, and there are exactly two ties, the claim seems correct on the surface.\n\nBut wait, I should check if \"49ers\" is referring to San Francisco 49ers. The opponents in the table are like Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, etc., which are historical teams. The San Francisco 49ers started playing later, so perhaps there was a team named the 49ers that tied two games? Or maybe it's an error in the claim.\n\nWait, looking at the opponent column, I don't see any mention of 49ers as opponents. So maybe the table is for another team, not the San Francisco 49ers. Alternatively, perhaps the term '49ers' refers to the year 1947, but that doesn't make sense because it's a team name.\n\nThis confusion might mean that the claim is incorrect because the data in the table doesn't show the San Francisco 49ers playing; instead, it shows other teams like Dodgers, Bills, etc. So perhaps the data isn't about the 49ers at all, making the claim false because there are no ties for the team in question.\n\nAlternatively, if the table is meant to represent the San Francisco 49ers' schedule, then the two ties would support the claim as true. But given that the opponents listed don't include the 49ers, it's more likely that the table is for a different team, making the claim false because the data doesn't pertain to the 49ers.\n\nTherefore, despite there being two ties in the games listed in the table, those games are not attributed to the San Francisco 49ers. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 49ers tied two out of their 14 games in the 1947 season. The table lists various opponents and results for what appears to be other teams rather than the San Francisco 49ers. While there are indeed two ties in the games listed, they don't belong to the 49ers. Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly attributes those ties to a different team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"the 49ers play the los angeles dons 2 times in the 1947 season.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's about two football teams: the San Francisco 49ers (referred to as \"49ers\") and the Los Angeles Dons. The claim states that they played against each other twice during the 1947 season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several games for what seems like a single team, probably the 49ers since their opponents include the Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, etc. The \"opponent\" column will be key here because that's where we can find who each game was against.\n\nI'll need to go through each row of the table and check if any opponent is \"Los Angeles Dons\" (also referred to as \"los angeles dons\"). If I find two such instances, then the claim would be TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me list out the opponents from the table:\n\n1. Brooklyn Dodgers\n2. Los Angeles Dons\n3. Baltimore Colts\n4. New York Yankees\n5. Buffalo Bills\n6. Baltimore Colts\n7. Chicago Rockets\n8. Cleveland Browns\n9. Los Angeles Dons\n10. New York Yankees\n11. Cleveland Browns\n12. Chicago Rockets\n13. Brooklyn Dodgers\n14. Buffalo Bills\n\nNow, I can see that the opponent \"Los Angeles Dons\" appears in row 2 and row 9. That's two times. So the claim is saying they played twice, which seems to be supported.\n\nHowever, I should double-check to make sure there aren't any other instances I might have missed or if perhaps the team names vary slightly. For example, in some contexts, the Los Angeles Dons could also be known as another name, but in this table, it's consistently \"los angeles dons\" with slight capitalization differences.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm that all these games are part of the 1947 season by looking at the dates. The earliest date is August 31, 1947 (week 1), and the latest is December 7, 1947 (week 14). So yes, they span the entire 1947 season.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the claim refers to the \"49ers\" as playing against the Los Angeles Dons twice. If the table represents the 49ers' schedule, then this is correct. However, if the table is another team's schedule, like their opponents, then I need to adjust my analysis. But given the context and the opponents listed (including the 49ers' historical rivals), it's reasonable to assume that the table is indeed about the 49ers.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are where the opponent is \"los angeles dons\" in row indices 1 and 8 (since arrays start at 0). Wait, actually, let me recount:\n\nRow index starts from 0. Looking back:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Los Angeles Dons.\n- Row 9: Opponent is Los Angeles Dons.\n\nSo the relevant rows are 1 and 8? No, wait, in the table provided, row indices are 0 to 13 because there are 14 games listed. Wait, no, the data array has 14 elements, so row indices go from 0 to 13.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: August 31, opponent Brooklyn Dodgers\nRow 1: September 7, opponent Los Angeles Dons (index 1)\nRow 2: September 14, opponent Baltimore Colts\n...\nRow 8: October 26, opponent Cleveland Browns\nWait, no. Let me list them properly:\n\nLooking at each row's data:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Brooklyn Dodgers\n- Week 2: Los Angeles Dons (row index 1)\n- Week 3: Baltimore Colts\n- Week 4: New York Yankees\n- Week 5: Buffalo Bills\n- Week 6: Baltimore Colts\n- Week 7: Chicago Rockets\n- Week 8: Cleveland Browns\n- Week 9: Los Angeles Dons (row index 8)\n- Week 10: New York Yankees\n- Week 11: Cleveland Browns\n- Week 12: Chicago Rockets\n- Week 13: Brooklyn Dodgers\n- Week 14: Buffalo Bills\n\nSo the two instances where the opponent is Los Angeles Dons are at row indices 1 and 8. Therefore, these are the relevant cells.\n\nI need to make sure that the claim refers to two games in the season, which it does\u2014weeks 2 and week 9.

I need to see if there's any row in the table where the opponent is \"49ers\" and the result is a loss, specifically 8 losses in total for the season.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, record. Each row represents a game with those details.\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to find where the opponent is \"49ers.\" Wait, but looking at the data provided, I don't see any opponent named \"49ers.\" The opponents listed are:\n\n1. Brooklyn Dodgers\n2. Los Angeles Dons\n3. Baltimore Colts\n4. New York Yankees\n5. Buffalo Bills\n6. Baltimore Colts\n7. Chicago Rockets\n8. Cleveland Browns\n9. Los Angeles Dons\n10. New York Yankees\n11. Cleveland Browns\n12. Chicago Rockets\n13. Brooklyn Dodgers\n14. Buffalo Bills\n\nThere's no mention of the San Francisco 49ers as an opponent in any of these rows. So, if the claim is about the 49ers losing games, but they aren't opponents here, maybe the table doesn't include their games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 49ers were playing away games where their opponents are listed, and maybe they lost some of those games. But looking at each opponent's name, none match the 49ers.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the 49ers lose 8 of the game in the 1947 season.\" It could mean that the 49ers lost 8 games during the season, regardless of who their opponents were. So perhaps I should check if any team named 49ers is involved as an opponent and has 8 losses.\n\nBut looking through each row, none have \"49ers\" in the opponent column. Therefore, there's no data to support that the 49ers lost 8 games in the 1947 season from this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 49ers are the home team or something else. But without any row where the opponent is the 49ers, it seems impossible to confirm whether they lost 8 games based on this data.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim is about the 49ers losing 8 games in the season, but there's no relevant data in the table since none of the opponents are the 49ers.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 49ers last opponent of the season be the brooklyn dodger\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that in the last game (last week) of the season, the San Francisco 49ers' opponent was the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. The data spans from week 1 to week 14 in 1947. \n\nI need to find out which row corresponds to the last game of the season. Since the weeks go up to 14, week 14 is likely the last one.\n\nIn week 14, the opponent is listed as \"buffalo bills\" with a result of a tie. Wait, but the claim mentions the Brooklyn Dodgers. Hmm, that's different. So the opponent in week 14 isn't the Dodgers.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The table shows for each row, the opponent and the result. In week 13, which is November 27, 1947, the opponent is the Brooklyn Dodgers, and they won that game with a score of 21-7. So week 14 is after that.\n\nTherefore, the last game (week 14) was against the Buffalo Bills, not the Brooklyn Dodgers. That means the claim's assertion about the last opponent being the Brooklyn Dodgers is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me check each row again. Week 1: Dodgers. Weeks go up to 14, with week 14 being December 7 against the Bills. So yes, the last game was against the Bills. \n\nSo the claim says that the 49ers' last opponent of the season (which would be in the highest week number) was the Brooklyn Dodgers, but according to the table, it's actually the Buffalo Bills. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant to verify this. The relevant columns are \"week\" and \"opponent\". For each row, the opponent is listed, so all rows are somewhat relevant, but particularly week 14 because that's the last game. Also, since the claim mentions \"last opponent\", knowing the week number helps.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows where the column is \"opponent\" or \"week\". But perhaps more specifically, for each row, the opponent and whether it's the last week.\n\nBut to pinpoint the exact verification, I should look at the last row. So the row_index 13 (since arrays start at 0) would be week 14. Wait no, wait: in the table, each sub-array is a week starting from 1. The first sub-array is week 1 (row index 0), up to week 14 (row index 13). So the last row is index 13, which corresponds to week 14.\n\nIn that row, the opponent is \"buffalo bills\", not Dodgers. Therefore, the claim is false because the last opponent was the Bills, not the Dodgers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we checked each relevant cell in the table.

So the earliest game is week 1 on August 31 and the latest is week 14 on December 7.\n\nThe claim specifies that August 31 was the last game of the season. However, looking at the table data, each subsequent row has a higher week number than the previous one. For example, week 1 is August 31, then week 2 is September 7, and so on up to week 14 on December 7.\n\nThis means that the season started in August and ended in December.

The claim is: \"the 49ers lose 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. The data spans from weeks 1 to 14.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions \"49ers,\" but looking at the table's opponents: Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, New York Yankees, Buffalo Bills, Chicago Rockets. I don't see \"49ers\" here. Maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps \"49ers\" is another name for one of these teams?\n\nHmm, maybe it's an older term or a different team name. Wait, the San Francisco 49ers were established in the late '40s. Let me check: The San Francisco 49ers were founded in 1946 as the Los Angeles Dons and later moved to San Francisco. So in 1947, they would have been known as the San Francisco 49ers or maybe still called Los Angeles? Wait, no, the team was established in 1946 by Louis Spanos as the San Francisco 49ers, but they played their first season in 1947 as the San Francisco Dons. So perhaps \"49ers\" is a misnomer here.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table, the opponent in week 14 is Buffalo Bills, and I don't see any mention of \"49ers.\" Maybe it's a mistake in the claim, but I need to proceed as per the instruction.\n\nSo the task is to check whether the 49ers lost 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season based on this table. Since the table doesn't list the 49ers, perhaps they didn't exist yet? Or maybe their name was different.\n\nWait, let's verify the team names. In 1947, the San Francisco 49ers weren't formed until later. They were founded in 1946 as the San Francisco Dons, and then renamed to 49ers in 1951 when Louis Spanos sold the team to Joe DiRuzzo. So in 1947, they would have been known as either the San Francisco Dons or perhaps another name.\n\nTherefore, if the claim refers to \"49ers\" as a team in 1947, that might be incorrect because the team wasn't officially called that yet until later. But maybe in popular usage, they were already known as 49ers by then.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this table, the opponent's names are different, and the 49ers are represented under another name. Let me check each row for any indication of the 49ers.\n\nLooking through the opponents: Brooklyn Dodgers (maybe LA Dodgers now), Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, New York Yankees, Buffalo Bills, Chicago Rockets. None of these seem to align with \"San Francisco 49ers.\" So perhaps in this context, the claim is about a different team or the table doesn't include the 49ers.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is about the 49ers losing 2 out of 14 games in 1947, but according to the table, there's no data on the 49ers. Hence, the claim might be incorrect because the 49ers weren't a team yet or aren't listed here. Alternatively, maybe they are represented under another name.\n\nWait, perhaps \"San Francisco Dons\" is considered as the 49ers in this context? But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to check if any row lists an opponent that could be linked to the 49ers, but from the table, none seem to match.\n\nSo, assuming the claim refers to a specific team that isn't present in the table, or perhaps the data only covers other teams, then the claim would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no information supporting that the 49ers lost 2 out of 14 games in 1947 based on this table.\n\nAlternatively, if \"49ers\" refers to a different team in this context, but I don't see any relevant data in the table. So the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"49ers lose 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season.\" Upon examining the table, there are no entries for the San Francisco 49ers, as they were either not yet established or referred to by a different name at the time. Therefore, the claim lacks support from the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** None found in the table supporting the claim about the \"49ers.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 49ers play the los angeles dones 1 time in the 1947 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two teams: the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Don s (I notice there's a typo in \"Dones\" but assume it refers to the Los Angeles Rams, as that's a known team). It says they played against each other once during the 1947 season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from weeks 1 through 14 in the 1947 season. Each row has details like week number, date, opponent, result, score, and record. My task is to find if there's an instance where the 49ers faced the Los Angeles Don s (or Rams) once.\n\nI'll start by checking the 'opponent' column for each row to see who the 49ers played against. I should also check if any of these opponents are the Los Angeles Don s.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent is Brooklyn Dodgers.\n2. Week 2: Opponent is Los Angeles Dons.\n3. Week 3: Opponent is Baltimore Colts.\n4. Week 4: Opponent is New York Yankees.\n5. Week 5: Opponent is Buffalo Bills.\n6. Week 6: Opponent is Baltimore Colts.\n7. Week 7: Opponent is Chicago Rockets.\n8. Week 8: Opponent is Cleveland Browns.\n9. Week 9: Opponent is Los Angeles Dons.\n10. Week 10: Opponent is New York Yankees.\n11. Week 11: Opponent is Cleveland Browns.\n12. Week 12: Opponent is Chicago Rockets.\n13. Week 13: Opponent is Brooklyn Dodgers.\n14. Week 14: Opponent is Buffalo Bills.\n\nI notice that in week 2, the opponent is Los Angeles Dons, and again in week 9. That means the 49ers played against them twice in the season, not once as claimed.\n\nSo, the claim says they played \"1 time,\" but according to the table, it was two times. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 49ers played the Los Angeles Don s (Rams) once in the 1947 season, but the table shows two games against them.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
