    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. There are three main parts:\n1. Adelaide United plays a match.\n2. They play in front of a specific crowd size, which is 25039.\n3. The venue is Adelaide Oval.\n\nSo I need to find a row in the table where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium, and match details. Each row represents a different match with those details.\n\nI'll start by searching for any rows where the home team is Adelaide United because that's who the claim is about. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 1: Home team is Queensland Roar.\n- Row 2: Home team is Sydney FC.\n- Row 3: Home team is Adelaide United. So this is a match where Adelaide United is the home team.\n\nNow, let's check the crowd number for this row. The crowd column in row 3 has the value 25039. That matches the second part of the claim regarding the crowd size.\n\nNext, I need to verify the stadium. In row 3, the stadium is listed as Adelaide Oval. This matches the third part of the claim about the venue.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the score column for this match: it's \"1 - 3\". Since the claim doesn't specify the score, only the crowd and venue, the score isn't a factor in determining the validity of the claim.\n\nNow, let me ensure there are no other rows that might also meet these conditions. Scanning through the remaining rows:\n\n- Rows 4 to 21: The home team is Adelaide United in some matches, but their crowd numbers don't reach 25039 except for row 18. Wait, row 18 has a crowd of 25039 as well. Let me check that.\n\nIn row 18:\n- Home team: Adelaide United.\n- Crowd: 25039.\n- Stadium: Adelaide Oval.\n\nSo both row 3 and row 18 have the same crowd number and venue when Adelaide United is the home team. The claim doesn't specify a particular date, so as long as there's at least one match where these conditions are met, the claim could be considered TRUE.\n\nHowever, wait, the claim says \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval.\" So any occurrence where they played with that crowd and venue makes it true. Since row 3 and row 18 both meet this, there's more than one instance, but the claim doesn't specify a specific match, just that such a match occurred.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, the claim is TRUE because at least one match meets all the criteria: Adelaide United played in front of a crowd of 25039 at Adelaide Oval. Even though row 18 also matches, it's sufficient to have one occurrence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"sydney fc play at adelaide oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, I know that Sydney FC and Adelaide United are both football teams in Australia. The claim mentions that Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval. So, I need to check if there's any match data where Sydney FC is the home team and the venue is Adelaide Oval.\n\nLooking at the table columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium, match details. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"home team\" and \"stadium\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if Sydney FC is listed as the home team and Adelaide Oval is the stadium.\n\nStarting from row 0: home team is Queensland Roar, not Sydney FC.\nRow 1: home team is Sydney FC. Let's check the stadium column. It says \"Sydney Football Stadium\". That's different from Adelaide Oval.\nContinuing through each row:\n- Row 2: away team is Adelaide United; home team is Adelaide United.\n- Rows 3-19: Most have Adelaide United as either home or away, but none list Sydney FC as the home and Adelaide Oval as the stadium.\n- Finally, row 20: home team is Perth Glory. None of them match.\n\nI don't see any matches where Sydney FC is the home team at Adelaide Oval. The only time Sydney FC is listed as a home team is at their own stadium in Sydney. Therefore, there's no evidence supporting the claim that Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"adelaide united play in front of 10256 crowd in hindmarsh stadium on november 18\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements are:\n\n1. Adelaide United plays a match.\n2. They play against another team.\n3. The crowd size is 10,256.\n4. The stadium where this happens is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n5. The date of the match is November 18.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with various details. To verify the claim, I need to find a row that matches all these criteria.\n\nI'll start by checking the \"date\" column for November 18. Scanning through the data, I see rows 12 through 21 are in November and early December. Let's check each:\n\n- Row 12: Date is 10 November.\n- Row 13: Date is 18 November. That's a match on November 18.\n\nNow, checking row 13:\n\n- Home team is Adelaide United (from \"home team\" column).\n- Away team is Newcastle Jets.\n- Crowd size is 10256 (from the crowd column).\n- Stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nSo all the details in this row match exactly what's in the claim. There's a match on November 18 where Adelaide United plays against Newcastle Jets at Hindmarsh Stadium with 10,256 people attending.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 13 for date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
