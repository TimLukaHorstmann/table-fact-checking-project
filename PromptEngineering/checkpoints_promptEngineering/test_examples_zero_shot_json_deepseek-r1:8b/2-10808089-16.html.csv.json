    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim says: \"On August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne while the home team was Collingwood.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to and check it against the table provided.\n\nThe table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows include information about different games on August 13, 1966. \n\nLooking at the claim, I need to verify two things:\n1. On that specific date, was the away team North Melbourne?\n2. Was the home team Collingwood?\n\nTo check this, I should look through each row of the table where the date is \"13 august 1966\". Each of these rows will correspond to a game played on that day.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team is St Kilda, away team is South Melbourne.\n2. Second row: Home team is Essendon, away team is Fitzroy.\n3. Third row: Home team is Collingwood, away team is North Melbourne.\n4. Fourth row: Home team is Carlton, away team is Melbourne.\n5. Fifth row: Home team is Richmond, away team is Geelong.\n6. Sixth row: Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Footscray.\n\nSo in the third row, the home team is Collingwood and the away team is North Melbourne. The date matches August 13th, 1966.\n\nThat means the claim is true because there's a game on that date where Collingwood was the home team against North Melbourne as the away team.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]}",
