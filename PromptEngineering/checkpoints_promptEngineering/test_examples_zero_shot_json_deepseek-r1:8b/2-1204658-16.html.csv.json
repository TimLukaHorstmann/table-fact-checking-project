    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all game be play on 8 august 1908\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the problem. The claim is about all games being played on a specific date, which is August 8th, 1908. So, my task is to check if every game listed in the table was indeed held on that date.\n\nThe table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. Each row represents a different game with its details filled in these columns.\n\nI think I should go through each row of the data array and check the 'date' column for each game to see if it matches August 8th, 1908. If all games have this date, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the first row: The date is \"8 august 1908\". That matches the claim.\nSecond row: Same date, so that's good.\nThird row: Again, August 8th, 1908. Still matching.\nFourth row: Date is the same as well.\nFifth and final row: Same date again.\n\nSo all five games listed were played on August 8th, 1908. Therefore, the claim that \"all game be play on 8 august 1908\" is TRUE because every single game in the table matches this date.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant to support this claim. Since the 'date' column in each row contains the information needed to verify the claim, all these cells are relevant. Each row's 'date' cell should be highlighted as a relevant cell for the claim.\n\nI'll list out each of these cells with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether all games were played on 8 August 1908, I checked each game's date in the table. All five games had this date, making the claim TRUE. The relevant cells are the 'date' columns from each row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne score the most point out of every team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The user is saying that South Melbourne scored the highest points among all teams in the game. So, to verify this, I need to look at the relevant data from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. Each row represents a different match between two teams.\n\nI'm specifically interested in the \"home team\" and \"away team\" scores because the claim is about South Melbourne's performance as either the home or away team. Wait, but South Melbourne could be either the home or away team depending on each game. Hmm, no, actually, looking at the table, each row seems to represent a single match where one team is home and the other is away. So I need to check all instances where South Melbourne appears as either the home or away team.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about \"south melbourne score the most point out of every team.\" That might mean that across all teams, South Melbourne has the highest total points. But in this table, each row is a single game. So perhaps the claim refers to within each game? Or maybe it's referring to multiple games on the same date.\n\nWait, looking at the data, all dates are \"8 august 1908\", so these seem like multiple matches on the same day. So South Melbourne might have played against different teams on that day. Let me check which row has South Melbourne as either home or away.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team is fitzroy, away is university.\n2. Second row: Home is essendon, away is melbourne.\n3. Third row: Home is collingwood, away is st kilda.\n4. Fourth row: Home is south melbourne, away is richmond.\n5. Fifth row: Home is geelong, away is carlton.\n\nSo South Melbourne is only the home team in one game (row 4), and not appearing as an away team in any other row. So their score is 18.12 (120). \n\nNow, to check if they scored the most points out of every team. Wait, does \"every team\" mean all teams listed in this table? Or are there more teams not included here?\n\nLooking at the home teams: fitzroy, essendon, collingwood, south melbourne, geelong. So these are five different home teams. Their scores are:\n\n- fitzroy: 13.16 (94)\n- essendon: 17.17 (119)\n- collingwood: 10.10 (70)\n- south melbourne: 18.12 (120)\n- geelong: 5.9 (39)\n\nSo the highest score is South Melbourne with 120 points.\n\nBut wait, what about the away teams? The away teams in this table are university, melbourne, st kilda, richmond, and carlton. Their scores are:\n\n- university: 11.7 (73)\n- melbourne: 8.11 (59)\n- st kilda: 7.9 (51)\n- richmond: 4.4 (28)\n- carlton: 6.13 (49)\n\nSo all away teams have lower scores than the highest home team score.\n\nBut is South Melbourne's 120 the highest overall? Are there any other teams with higher scores elsewhere in the table that I might be missing?\n\nWait, each row represents a single game, so perhaps we're considering only these games. In that case, yes, South Melbourne has the highest points among all home and away teams listed here.\n\nBut the claim says \"every team\", which might imply that it's considering all possible teams in the competition, not just those listed in this table. Since we don't have data beyond this table, we can't confirm if there are other teams with higher scores. However, based solely on the given data, South Melbourne does score the highest.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the table again: each row is a match, so perhaps the claim refers to all matches listed here, meaning that in these games, South Melbourne's 120 points is the highest across all teams involved.\n\nSo, within the given data, yes, South Melbourne has the highest score. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne scored the most points out of every team based on the provided table. Upon examining each row, South Melbourne's score of 18.12 (120) is indeed higher than any other team's score in the same game. Since all matches are on the same date and within the given data, this makes the claim valid.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"each game be play at a different venue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asserting that every game in the table was held at a unique venue; that is, no two games share the same venue.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, their scores, the venue, and the date. The \"data\" array has five rows, each corresponding to a different game on August 8, 1908. \n\nNow, I should check each game's venue to see if they are all different. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. First game: venue is \"brunswick street oval\".\n2. Second game: venue is \"emcg\". Wait, EMCG? That might be an abbreviation for Melbourne Cricket Ground, but I'm not entirely sure, but it's a venue.\n3. Third game: venue is \"victoria park\".\n4. Fourth game: venue is \"lake oval\".\n5. Fifth game: venue is \"corio oval\".\n\nWait, are all these venues different? Let me list them out:\n\n- brunswick street oval\n- emcg (assuming it's Melbourne Cricket Ground)\n- victoria park\n- lake oval\n- corio oval\n\nI don't recognize any duplicates here. Each seems to be a distinct venue. So, all games were played at different venues.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"each game be play at a different venue.\" Wait, that might be a typo. It should probably say \"be played at a different venue\" with the correct verb tense. But moving past that, the main point is whether each game was at a different venue.\n\nSince all five games have unique venues as per the table, the claim holds true. So the answer should be TRUE. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"venue\" column seems directly related because it's where each game took place. For each row, the \"row_index\" corresponds to their position in the data array, and the relevant column is \"venue\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells will include all five rows under the \"venue\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim that each game was played at a different venue is TRUE or FALSE, we check the 'venue' column in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"no team score more than 120 points in a game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is stating that in every game listed in the table, no team scored more than 120 points. So I have to check each team's score for each row and see if any exceed 120.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several rows. Each row represents a game with details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, and date. The columns related to scores are \"home team score\" and \"away team score.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nFirst row:\n- Home team: fitzroy, score 13.16 (94)\n- Away team: university, score 11.7 (73)\n\nBoth scores are under 120. So no problem here.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team: essendon, score 17.17 (119)\n- Away team: melbourne, score 8.11 (59)\n\nEssendon's score is 119, which is just below 120. Melbourne's is much lower. Still within the limit.\n\nThird row:\n- Home team: collingwood, score 10.10 (70)\n- Away team: st kilda, score 7.9 (51)\n\nBoth are well under 120.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home team: south melbourne, score 18.12 (120)\n- Away team: richmond, score 4.4 (28)\n\nSouth Melbourne's score is exactly 120 here. The claim says \"no team score more than 120,\" so if a team scores exactly 120, does that violate the claim? I think yes because it's not less than or equal; it's equal to. So this might be relevant.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home team: geelong, score 5.9 (39)\n- Away team: carlton, score 6.13 (49)\n\nBoth are way under 120.\n\nSo from the fifth row onwards, I see that in the fourth row, south melbourne scored exactly 120. The claim says \"no team scores more than 120,\" which would mean all teams must have scores equal to or less than 120. However, if a team scores exactly 120, does that count as exceeding? It depends on how \"more than\" is interpreted. If it's strictly greater than 120, then 120 doesn't exceed. But if the claim is saying no team can score more than 120, including equal to, then scoring 120 would mean the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"no team score more than 120 point in a game.\" So it's saying that in every game, none of the teams scored more than 120. If one team scored exactly 120, does that count as more than? I think not because 120 is equal to, not more than. So perhaps the claim is true because no team scored above 120.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user considers 120 as not exceeding, so it's allowed. Therefore, since none have over 120, the claim holds.\n\nWait, but the fourth row has a score of 120. Does that mean the claim is false? Because the claim says \"no team score more than 120.\" So if any team scored exactly 120, is that considered \"more than\"? No, because 120 is not more than 120; it's equal to.\n\nSo in this case, all teams have scores less than or equal to 120. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nBut wait, I should check all columns related to the scores. The relevant cells are where the home and away team scores are listed. So for each row, both home and away scores need to be checked.\n\nIn the fourth row, home score is 18.12 (120). That's exactly 120, so does that break the claim? Let me think about it again.\n\nThe claim is: \"no team score more than 120 point in a game.\" So if a team scored 120, they didn't exceed 120; they just reached it. Therefore, the claim holds because no team scored more than 120.\n\nWait, but maybe the user considers that \"more than\" includes equal to, so 120 would be considered as exceeding? That's a bit of semantics. Typically, \"more than\" means strictly greater. So in this case, since all scores are <=120, the claim is true.\n\nAlternatively, if someone argues that scoring exactly 120 is not allowed because it's not more, then it's still within the claim.\n\nSo after checking each row, none have a score exceeding 120. The highest is 120, which is acceptable under the claim as written.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no team scored more than 120 points in any game. Checking all scores, the highest was 120 by South Melbourne. Since \"more than\" typically means strictly greater, and 120 doesn't exceed it, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne score more point than richmond and carlton combine\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has six columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. There are five rows of data for different games on August 8, 1908.\n\nThe claim is about South Melbourne's score being higher than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So I need to find the relevant cells related to this comparison.\n\nStarting with South Melbourne: From the table, in row index 3, the home team is South Melbourne, and their score is listed as \"18.12 (120)\". That seems straightforward; we'll note that down.\n\nNext, I need Richmond's and Carlton's scores. Looking through the rows:\n\n- In row index 1, the away team is Melbourne against Essendon, so that doesn't include Richmond.\n- Row index 2 has Collingwood vs St Kilda, again not relevant.\n- Wait, actually, let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at each row:\nRow 0: Fitzroy (home) vs University (away)\nRow 1: Essendon (home) vs Melbourne (away)\nRow 2: Collingwood (home) vs St Kilda (away)\nRow 3: South Melbourne (home) vs Richmond (away)\nRow 4: Geelong (home) vs Carlton (away)\n\nAh, so in row index 3, the away team is Richmond, with a score of \"4.4 (28)\". And in row index 4, the away team is Carlton, with a score of \"6.13 (49)\".\n\nSo now I have South Melbourne's score: 18.12 (120), Richmond: 4.4 (28), and Carlton: 6.13 (49).\n\nTo check if South Melbourne's score is higher than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton, I need to calculate the total points for Richmond and Carlton and see if it's less than South Melbourne's.\n\nAdding Richmond and Carlton's scores:\nRichmond: 4 + 4 = 8 points.\nCarlton: 6 + 13 = 19 points.\nCombined total: 8 + 19 = 27 points.\n\nNow, South Melbourne has 18.12 (120). The score format is goals.behinds (total points). So, 18 goals and 12 behinds make up 18 + 12 = 30 points.\n\nComparing 30 (South Melbourne) to the combined 27 (Richmond + Carlton), indeed, South Melbourne has a higher score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. That would be:\n- South Melbourne's home team and score: row 3, columns \"home team\" and \"home team score\".\n- Richmond's away team score: row 3, column \"away team score\".\n- Carlton's away team score: row 4, column \"away team score\".\n\nWait a second, in the claim it says \"south melbourne score more point than richmond and carlton combine.\" So the relevant cells are indeed those where South Melbourne's home team score is compared against Richmond's and Carlton's away scores. Therefore, the relevant_cells should include:\n\nSouth Melbourne's score: row 3, \"home team score\".\nRichmond's score: row 3, \"away team score\".\nCarlton's score: row 4, \"away team score\".\n\nSo that's three cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare South Melbourne's total points with the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify South Melbourne's Score**: \n   - Home Team: South Melbourne\n   - Score: 18.12 (120) \u2192 Total Points = 30.\n\n2. **Richmond's Score**:\n   - Away Team: Richmond\n   - Score: 4.4 (28) \u2192 Total Points = 8.\n\n3. **Carlton's Score**:\n   - Away Team: Carlton\n   - Score: 6.13 (49) \u2192 Total Points = 19.\n\n4. **Combined Scores of Richmond and Carlton**: \n   - 8 (Richmond) + 19 (Carlton) = 27.\n\n5. **Comparison**: \n   - South Melbourne's score (30) > Combined score (27).\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, I should check the 'date' column in the table and see if every game has this date.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date.

The data rows contain specific information for each game.\n\nThe claim is about South Melbourne scoring the least points among all teams. So I need to check the 'home team score' for South Melbourne and compare it with other teams' scores to see if they indeed scored the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table, in row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0), the home team is South Melbourne with a score of 18.12 (120). Now, I need to check all other teams' scores to find the minimum.\n\nLet's list out the scores:\n\n1. Fitzroy: 13.16 (94)\n2. Essendon: 17.17 (119)\n3. Collingwood: 10.10 (70)\n4. South Melbourne: 18.12 (120)\n5. Geelong: 5.9 (39)\n\nWait, hold on. The claim says \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team.\" But looking at the scores, South Melbourne's score is actually quite high\u2014it's 18 points compared to others like Collingwood with 10, Geelong with 5.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. The 'home team score' column uses a format like \"13.16 (94)\", which might represent goals and behinds in Australian rules football, where each goal is 6 points and each behind is 1 point. So 13 goals and 16 behinds would be 13*6 + 16 = 78 + 16 = 94 points.\n\nSo South Melbourne scored 18.12 (120), which translates to 18 goals and 12 behinds, totaling 18*6 +12=108+12=120 points. That's the highest score in the table.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says South Melbourne scored the least. But according to this, they actually have the highest. So that would make the claim false. However, maybe I need to check if there are any other rows or perhaps I misread the column.\n\nLooking back, all teams' scores: Fitzroy 13.16=94, Essendon 17.17=119, Collingwood 10.10=70, South Melbourne 18.12=120, Geelong 5.9=39.\n\nSo the lowest score is Geelong with 5.9 (39), then Collingwood at 70, Fitzroy at 94, Essendon at 119, and South Melbourne at 120.\n\nTherefore, South Melbourne did not have the least points; instead, they had the highest. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team\" is false because South Melbourne's score is actually the highest in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"no team score more than 110 points in a game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has six columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. The data seems to be from multiple games, all played on August 8, 1908, which is interesting because that's over a century ago.\n\nThe claim says that in any of these games, no team scored more than 110 points. To verify this, I need to check each game's scores and see if any exceed 110.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. First row: Home team Fitzroy scored 13.16 (94), away team University scored 11.7 (73). Both are under 110.\n2. Second row: Essendon scored 17.17 (119), Melbourne scored 8.11 (59). Wait, 119 is over 110.\n3. Third row: Collingwood scored 10.10 (70), St Kilda scored 7.9 (51). Both under.\n4. Fourth row: South Melbourne scored 18.12 (120), Richmond scored 4.4 (28). Now, 120 is way over 110.\n5. Fifth row: Geelong scored 5.9 (39), Carlton scored 6.13 (49). Both under.\n\nSo in the second and fourth rows, the home teams have scores above 110: 119 and 120 respectively. That means the claim isn't true because there are teams that exceeded 110 points.\n\nNow, to map which cells are relevant. For each row where a score exceeds 110, I need to note the column name \"home team score\" and their respective row indices.\n\nSo in row 1 (index 0), no issue. Row 2 (index 1) has Essendon's home team score as 119, so that's relevant. Row 3 (index 2) is fine. Row 4 (index 3) has South Melbourne's home team score at 120, so that's another relevant cell. Row 5 (index 4) is okay.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim isn't supported by all data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are teams with scores exceeding 110 points in the games listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"each game be play at the same venue\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that every game in the table was played at the same venue. To check this, I should look at the 'venue' column for all the rows and see if they have the same value.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\n- The first row's venue is \"brunswick street oval\".\n- The second row has \"emcg\".\n- The third row lists \"victoria park\".\n- The fourth row mentions \"lake oval\".\n- The fifth row shows \"corio oval\".\n\nHmm, so each game has a different venue. They are all in the same column, which is \"venue\". I need to check each row's 'venue' field.\n\nSo for each row index from 0 to 4, the 'venue' column varies:\n\n- Row 0: brunswick street oval\n- Row 1: emcg\n- Row 2: victoria park\n- Row 3: lake oval\n- Row 4: corio oval\n\nSince all these venues are different, it means the games weren't all played at the same place. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to list which cells are relevant. The column in question is \"venue\" and each row has this information. So for each row index (0 through 4), the 'venue' data is the relevant cell.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because not all venues are the same, and the relevant cells are all in the 'venue' column across each row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each game was played at the same venue. By examining the 'venue' column of the table, we see different venues for each game, indicating the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"south melbourne score less point than richmond and carlton combine\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim is comparing the scores of South Melbourne with the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So I need to find their respective scores from the table and do the math.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, date. The relevant columns here are \"home team score\" and \"away team score.\" But in this case, since both South Melbourne, Richmond, and Carlton might be either home or away teams depending on their matches.\n\nWait, but the claim is about South Melbourne's score being less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So I need to find each of their individual scores and sum Richmond and Carlton's scores.\n\nFirst, let me look through the data rows to find which games involve South Melbourne as home or away, Richmond, and Carlton.\n\nIn the data:\n\nRow 0: fitzroy (home) vs university (away)\nRow 1: essendon (home) vs melbourne (away)\nRow 2: collingwood (home) vs st kilda (away)\nRow 3: south melbourne (home) vs richmond (away)\nRow 4: geelong (home) vs carlton (away)\n\nSo, in row 3, South Melbourne is the home team with a score of 18.12 (120). Richmond is the away team with a score of 4.4 (28).\n\nIn row 4, Carlton is the away team with a score of 6.13 (49).\n\nWait, but the claim is about South Melbourne's score compared to the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So let me extract their scores.\n\nSouth Melbourne's score: 18.12 (120). Richmond's score is 4.4 (28), and Carlton's score is 6.13 (49). The sum would be 4 + 6 = 10 points? Wait, no. In Australian rules football, the scoring system is goals (between the posts) and behinds (behind the posts). Each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is worth 1 point.\n\nSo for Richmond: 4 goals and 4 behinds = 4*6 + 4*1 = 24 + 4 = 28 points. That's correct as per the table.\n\nCarlton: 6 goals and 13 behinds = 6*6 + 13*1 = 36 + 13 = 49 points, which matches the table.\n\nSo Richmond has 28 points, Carlton has 49 points. Combined, they have 28 + 49 = 77 points.\n\nSouth Melbourne's score is 18 goals and 12 behinds: 18*6 + 12*1 = 108 + 12 = 120 points.\n\nThe claim says South Melbourne's score (120) is less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton (77). Wait, that can't be right because 120 is greater than 77. So the claim would be false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I misread something.\n\nLooking again:\n\nSouth Melbourne: home team, score 18.12 (120)\nRichmond: away team in row3, score 4.4 (28)\nCarlton: away team in row4, score 6.13 (49)\n\nSo their combined scores are indeed 28 + 49 = 77.\n\nBut South Melbourne scored 120, which is more than 77. So the claim that South Melbourne's score is less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton is false because 120 > 77.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares South Melbourne's score to the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. Extracting their scores:\n\n- South Melbourne: 18.12 (120) = 108 + 12 = 120 points\n- Richmond: 4.4 (28) = 24 + 4 = 28 points\n- Carlton: 6.13 (49) = 36 + 13 = 49 points\n\nRichmond and Carlton combined: 28 + 49 = 77 points.\n\nSouth Melbourne's score (120) is greater than 77, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
