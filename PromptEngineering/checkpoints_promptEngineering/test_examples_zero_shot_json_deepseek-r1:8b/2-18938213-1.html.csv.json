    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"yuri kadenatsy ( urs ) win silver in 1983\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and map it to the table's data. The claim mentions three specific things: the name \"yuri kadenatsy ( urs )\", the medal \"silver\", and the year \"1983\". So, I need to find if there's a row in the table where these three elements all match.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an event with columns for year, place, gold, silver, and bronze. The data is given as a list of lists, so I'll have to check each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the top, I see the years listed are 1970, 1973, 1974, etc., but 1983 isn't in the first few rows. Let me look for the row where the year is 1983. Scanning through, I find that row number 8 (since indexing starts at 0) has the year 1983.\n\nIn that row, the place is \"edmonton\". The gold column has \"sergei savostianov ( urs )\", silver has \"nikolai dedov ( urs )\", and bronze is \"jerzy greszkiewicz ( pol )\". So in 1983, yuri kadenatsy isn't listed here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the name. Let me double-check. The claim says \"yuri kadenatsy ( urs )\", but in 1983's row, the silver medalist is \"nikolai dedov ( urs )\". So that doesn't match.\n\nI should continue checking other rows for 1983. But looking through the table, I only see one row with year 1983. So if that's the case, then yuri kadenatsy isn't present in 1983, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me count again. The first few rows are:\n\nRow 0: 1970\nRow 1: 1973\n...\nRow 8: 1986\nRow 9: 1990\n... up to row 12: 2002, 13: 2006, 14:2008, 15:2009.\n\nWait, the rows for 1983 should be row number 7 (since 1970 is 0, adding 13 years would get us to 1983 at row 13). Wait no, let me recount:\n\nRow 0:1970\nRow1:1973 (+3)\nRow2:1974 (+1)\nRow3:1978 (+4)\nRow4:1979 (+1)\nRow5:1981 (+2)\nRow6:1982 (+1)\nRow7:1983 (+1)\n\nYes, so row 7 is for 1983.\n\nIn that row, the gold is sergei savostianov (urs), silver is nikolai dedov (urs), and bronze is jerzy greszkiewicz (pol). There's no mention of yuri kadenatsy there. So the claim is about yuri winning silver in 1983, but according to the table, he didn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check other years where yuri might have competed. For example, looking through all rows, I see that in row6 (1982), \"caracas\" has gold: nikolai dedov (urs), silver: yuri kadenatsy (urs), bronze: jerzy greszkiewicz (pol). Wait, that's interesting.\n\nSo in 1982, yuri kadenatsy was the silver medalist. But the claim is about 1983. So he didn't win silver in both 1982 and 1983? Or maybe he did in one but not the other.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row represents a different year. So in 1982, yuri got silver, but in 1983, someone else did. Therefore, the claim that yuri won silver in 1983 is false because in that specific year, he wasn't listed as the silver medalist.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"silver\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"yuri kadenatsy (urs) win silver in 1982\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should look for \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\" in the table. The column names are year, place, gold, silver, bronze. So, I'll go through each row to find a match.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- 1970: ... no Yuri\n- 1973: ... no\n- 1974: ... no\n- 1978: ... no\n- 1979: ... no\n- 1981: ... Rudnizkiy, not Kadenatsy\n- 1982: yes! \"nikolai dedov (urs)\", \"alexander ivanchikhin (urs)\", \"tibor bodnar\". Wait, is Yuri here? No, the silver column in 1982 has \"jerzy greszkiewicz\". So no Yuri in 1982.\n- 1983: ... no\n- 1986: ... no\n- 1990: ... no\n- 1994: ... no\n- 2002: ... no\n- 2006: ... no\n- 2008: ... no\n- 2009: ... no\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me double-check the table. The user's claim is about 1982, so looking at row index where year is 1982.\n\nLooking at the data for 1982:\n- place: caracas\n- gold: nikolai dedov (urs)\n- silver: alexander ivanchikhin (urs)\n- bronze: jerzy greszkiewicz (pol)\n\nHmm, no Yuri Kadenatsy here. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each row's data again for 1982. The user wrote the table as:\n\n[\n  [\n    1970,\n    \"phoenix\",\n    \"peter cheng ( hkg )\",\n    \"valeri postoianov ( urs )\",\n    \"jogan nikitin ( urs )\"\n  ],\n  ... more rows ...\n  [\n    1982,\n    \"caracas\",\n    \"nikolai dedov ( urs )\",\n    \"alexander ivanchikhin ( urs )\",\n    \"jerzy greszkiewicz ( pol )\"\n  ],\n  ...\n]\n\nSo in 1982, the silver medalist is Alexander Ivan. So Yuri Kadenatsy isn't listed here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check other rows again. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1970: no\n- 1973: no\n- 1974: Peter Cheng won gold.\n- 1978: Peter Cheng again.\n- 1979: Peter Cheng.\n- 1981: Rudnizkiy and Ivan.\n- 1982: dedov, ivanchikhin, greszkiewicz.\n- 1983: savostianov, dedov, greszkiewicz.\n- 1986: solti, huang, li.\n- 1990: zhang, avramenko, kurzer.\n- 1994: racansky, avramenko, janus.\n- 2002: sike, andersson, pelach.\n- 2006: czapla, pelach, jonas.\n- 2008: blinov, pelach, zinenko.\n- 2009: Cheng again.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the table. Let me check if \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\" is present elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row for 1982: no. Next rows after that don't have him either. So perhaps the claim is false because Yuri Kadenatsy didn't win silver in 1982.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row is a year, and each column within the row represents gold, silver, bronze for that place and year.\n\nWait, no: columns are year, place, gold, silver, bronze. So each row has data for one year's event, with place, then medalists.\n\nSo in 1982, caracas: gold is dedov, silver ivanchikhin, bronze greszkiewicz. No Yuri Kadenatsy there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a row. Let me count the rows:\n\nLooking at the table provided by user, there are 14 rows (from year 1970 to 2009). The claim is about 1982, which is one of them. So in that specific row, no Yuri Kadenatsy.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Yuri Kadenatsy didn't win silver in 1982 as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"yuri kadenatsy (urs) win silver in 1982.\" Checking each relevant row:\n\n- **1982 Row**: The gold medalist is Nikolai Dedov, silver is Alexander Ivan, and bronze is Yerzy Greszkiewicz. Yuri Kadenatsy isn't listed here or elsewhere in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"determine if the statement about a person's achievement in a specific year is true based on the given data.\",\n  \"statement\": \"yuri kadenatsy (urs) win silver in 1982\",\n  \"data_source\": [\n    {\n      \"year\": 1982,\n      \"place\": \"caracas\",\n      \"gold\": \"nikolai dedov (urs)\",\n      \"silver\": \"alexander ivanchikhin (urs)\",\n      \"bronze\": \"jerzy greszkiewicz (pol)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"The data for the year 1982 does not list yuri kadenatsy as a silver medalist.
