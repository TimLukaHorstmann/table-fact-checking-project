    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have win 2 fight by tko between 2005 and 2009\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, and time. Each row represents a fight with details filled in these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions \"muhsin corbbrey\" having two wins by TKO (Technical Knockout) between 2005 and 2009. So I need to check if there are any fights in the table where the fighter's name is muhsin corbbrey, the result is a win, the method is TKO, and the date falls within that timeframe.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: The opponent is Troy Nelson, result is win, method is decision. Not TKO.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is Ryan Rayonec, result win, method TKO. Date is 2006-09-15, which is within 2005-2009. So this is a relevant row.\n3. Row 2: Loss, not relevant for wins.\n4. Row 3: Win by TKO, opponent Shelton Barnes, date 2006-04-21. Relevant.\n5. Row 4: Win by decision (unanimous), not TKO.\n6. Row 5: Win by decision (unanimous), same as above.\n7. Row 6: Win by TKO, opponent Ben Lock, date 2005-11-26. Relevant.\n8. Row 7: Loss.\n9. Row 8: Draw, not a win.\n\nSo the relevant rows are row1, row3, and row6 where the result is a win and method is TKO.\n\nNow, checking for muhsin corbbrey as the fighter. Looking at all the opponents in these rows:\n\nRow1 opponent: Ryan Rayonec\nRow3 opponent: Shelton Barnes\nRow6 opponent: Ben Lock\n\nNone of them are muhsin corbbrey. So there's no record of a fight where the fighter is muhsin corbbrey with two wins by TKO in that timeframe.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"have win 2 fights\", so does it mean two separate wins or the same opponent? The table doesn't show any repeats for the same fighter with multiple wins. Each entry seems to be a different opponent each time.\n\nAlso, I need to check if there are two such fights. From the data, there's at least three wins by TKO (rows1,3,6). But none of them are muhsin corbbrey. So even though he has multiple TKO wins, they're not attributed to him.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are no fights in the table where muhsin corbbrey won two fights by TKO between 2005 and 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Muhsin Corbbrey fighting twice in Florida during 2005 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"Muhsin Corbbrey fight 2 fight in florida in 2005.\" So, it's claiming that there were two fights by Muhsin Corbbrey in Florida during 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight. The columns relevant to this claim would likely be:\n- **opponent**: To find out who he fought against.\n- **venue**: Specifically looking for locations in Florida.\n- **date**: To check if any of these fights happened in 2005 and were in Florida.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to see which ones are relevant.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"2009 - 02 - 28\". That's outside the year 2005, so not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Date is \"2006 - 09 - 15\". Again, 2006 isn't 2005, so no.\n3. **Row 2**: Date is \"2006 - 06 - 15\". Still 2006, irrelevant for this claim.\n4. **Row 3**: Date is \"2006 - 04 - 21\". 2006, not matching the year 2005.\n5. **Row 4**: Date is \"2006 - 03 - 09\". Also in 2006, so no.\n6. **Row 5**: Date is \"2006 - 01 - 26\". Still 2006, so not relevant.\n7. **Row 6**: Date is \"2005 - 11 - 26\". This is within 2005 and the location can be checked.\n   - Opponent: Ben Lock\n   - Venue: Show Place Arena in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. So, not Florida.\n8. **Row 7**: Date is \"2005 - 04 - 26\". Location is Miami, Florida. Let's check:\n   - Opponent: Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez\n   - Venue: Radisson Hotel in Miami, FL.\n\nWait a minute, row 6 and row 7 are both in 2005 but different dates. However, I need to confirm if Muhsin Corbbrey fought twice that year in Florida.\n\nLooking at the opponents, it's important to know whether these are two separate fights. From the table:\n- In row 6: Opponent is Ben Lock\n- In row 7: Opponent is Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez\n\nThese are different opponents, so presumably, two different fights.\n\nNow, checking the venues:\n- Row 6: Upper Marlboro, Maryland \u2013 not Florida.\n- Row 7: Miami, Florida \u2013 yes.\n\nSo, there's at least one fight in Florida during 2005. But the claim says \"2 fight,\" meaning two fights.\n\nLooking back at the table, is there another fight by Muhsin Corbbrey in Florida in 2005? Let me check all rows where location is Florida and date is 2005.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Only row 7 (2005 - 04 - 26) is in Miami, FL. No other rows have a Florida venue in 2005.\n  \nSo, there's only one fight mentioned in the table that fits: row 7. Therefore, the claim of two fights might be FALSE because the table only shows one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check if any other rows could pertain to Florida in 2005 without being filtered out.\n\nLooking at all the locations:\n- Only row 7 is in Florida (Miami). Rows 6 and others are not.\n\nThus, only one fight in Florida in 2005. The claim says two fights, so it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in south carolina\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying. It suggests that Muhsin Corbbrey has never lost any fights that took place in South Carolina.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any relevant information about Muhsin Corbbrey's fights in South Carolina. The table has several columns: date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, and time. \n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: The opponent is \"troy nelson.\" There's no mention of Muhsin Corbbrey here, so this isn't relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is \"ryan rayonec,\" again not Corbbrey. Venue is in South Carolina, but without Corbbrey involved, it doesn't help.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is \"tim coleman.\" Location is Maryland, so not in South Carolina. Result is a loss, but opponent isn't Corbbrey.\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is \"shelton barnes.\" Venue is South Carolina. Wait, but the claim is about Corbbrey's losses in SC, and this fight was in SC but Corbbrey won. So it's not a loss for him.\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is \"kareem robinson.\" venue is Maryland, so irrelevant.\n6. **Row 5**: Opponent is \"anthony abrams,\" location is Maryland again.\n7. **Row 6**: Opponent is \"ben lock,\" venue is upper Marlboro, MD.\n8. **Row 7**: Opponent is \"emanuel gonz\u00e1lez.\" Venue is Miami, FL.\n9. **Row 8**: Opponent is \"ricardo planter,\" venue is Port St Lucie, FL.\n\nHmm, I'm going through each row and checking if any of them involve Muhsin Corbbrey fighting in South Carolina. From the table, I can't find any rows where the opponent is Muhsin Corbbrey or his location is South Carolina with a loss. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The claim says Corbbrey has never lost a fight in SC. So, if there's no record of him fighting and losing in SC, then he hasn't lost any there. Alternatively, if the table doesn't mention him at all, that might mean he hasn't fought there or lost there.\n\nLooking through the opponents, none of them are Muhsin Corbbrey. The only Corbbrey I see is \"muhsin corbbrey\" in row 0, but it's spelled slightly differently as \"corbbrey.\" Wait, no, row 0 has opponent as \"troy nelson,\" so that's not him.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there are any rows where the location is South Carolina and the result is a loss. Let me scan through:\n\n- Row 0: Location Hilton Head, SC, USA. Result win.\n- Row 3: Opponent Shelton Barnes in SC, result win.\n- Any other SC entries with a loss? I don't see any rows where the location is South Carolina and the result is a loss.\n\nSo, since there's no record of Muhsin Corbbrey fighting in South Carolina, let alone losing, the claim that he has never lost a fight there would be true. Unless there's another row not shown here or if \"muhsin corbbrey\" exists elsewhere as an opponent, but from what's provided, I don't see it.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for any possible typos or variations in names. For example, is \"muhsin corbbrey\" spelled differently? Looking through the opponents: \"troy nelson,\" \"ryan rayonec,\" \"tim coleman,\" etc.\u2014none seem to match Corbbrey. So, it's likely that there are no fights by him in SC where he lost.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, Muhsin Corbbrey hasn't lost any fights in South Carolina. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in south carolina\" is true, we need to check if there are any records of his fights in SC with a loss.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns**: \n   - Focus on rows where the location is South Carolina and the result is a \"loss.\"\n   \n2. **Analyze Each Row:**\n   - **Row 0**: Opponent \"troy nelson,\" location SC, result win.\n   - **Rows 1-8**: None mention Muhsin Corbbrey as an opponent or have a loss in SC.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** There are no entries indicating that Muhsin Corbbrey lost any fights in South Carolina based on the provided table.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 2 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions \"muhsin corbbrey\" fighting twice, with each fight lasting more than 5 rounds. The time frame is between 2006 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows where the fighter's name is \"muhsin corbbrey.\" Wait, in the data provided, I don't see that exact name. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Troy Nelson. No match for muhsin corbbrey.\nRow 1: Opponent Ryan Rayonec. Not matching.\nRow 2: Tim Coleman. Nope.\nRow 3: Shelton Barnes. No.\nRow 4: Kareem Robinson. No.\nRow 5: Anthony Abrams. No.\nRow 6: Ben Lock. No.\nRow 7: Emanuel Gonzalez. No.\nRow 8: Ricardo Planter. Not matching.\n\nSo, there's no fighter named muhsin corbbrey in this table. That suggests that the claim might be false because none of the fights listed involve him. However, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the opponent names again to ensure I didn't overlook any possible match.\n\nWait, perhaps the name is spelled differently? Maybe it's a typo or different spelling. But in all the rows, the opponents are Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, Anthony Abrams, Ben Lock, Emanuel Gonzalez, and Ricardo Planter. None of these names match muhsin corbbrey.\n\nSo, since there are no fights by muhsin corbbrey in this table, the claim that he fought twice with each fight lasting more than 5 rounds is not supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE. Also, since none of the cells have his name, there are no relevant cells to list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"muhsin corbbrey\" had two fights between 2006 and 2009, each lasting over five rounds.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against muhsin corbbrey in 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says Tim Coleman did not lose any fights against Muhsin Corbrey in 2006. So I need to look for any entries in the table where Tim Coleman fought against Muhsin Corbrey and see if he lost.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, record. The relevant columns here are 'opponent' and 'result'. \n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find where Tim Coleman was involved in a fight in 2006. \n\nRow 0: Opponent is Troy Nelson, date 2009. Not 2006.\nRow 1: Opponent is Ryan Rayonec, date 2006. Not Muhsin Corbrey.\nRow 2: Opponent is Tim Coleman vs someone else, but the result is loss. Wait, in row 2, the opponent's name is \"tim coleman\". So that's a fight where Tim lost, but was he fighting against Muhsin Corbrey?\n\nWait, no. The claim is about Tim losing to Muhsin Corbrey, so I need to see if any of Tim Coleman's fights in 2006 were against Muhsin Corbrey and resulted in a loss.\n\nLooking at the data:\nRow 2: date 2006-06-15, result 'loss', opponent is Tim Coleman. So this is Tim losing, but who was he fighting against? The column shows the opponent as \"tim coleman\". That might mean that Tim fought someone else, perhaps not Muhsin Corbrey.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says Tim didn't lose to Muhsin Corbrey in 2006. So I need to check if there's any row where the opponent is Muhsin Corbrey, and result is loss for Tim Coleman in 2006.\n\nLooking through all rows with date 2006:\nRow 2: 2006-06-15, opponent is Tim Coleman (resulting in a loss). So that's Tim fighting someone else and losing. Not against Muhsin.\nOther 2006 rows: let me check each one.\n\nRow 3: 2006-04-21, result win, opponent Shelton Barnes.\nRow 4: 2006-03-09, result win, opponent Kareem Robinson.\nRow 5: 2006-01-26, result win, opponent Anthony Abrams.\nRow 6: 2005-11-26, but that's 2005. Not relevant.\nRow 7: 2005-04-26, loss, opponent Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez.\nRow 8: 2005-04-08, draw, opponent Ricardo Planter.\n\nNone of the 2006 rows (except row 2) show Tim Coleman fighting against Muhsin Corbrey. In row 2, he's fighting someone else and losing, but not against Muhsin. So in all cases where Tim lost in 2006, it wasn't against Muhsin.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no evidence in the table that Tim Coleman lost to Muhsin Corbrey in 2006.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Tim Coleman lost any fights against Muhsin Corbrey in 2006.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey fight 2 fight in florida in 2006\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim and figuring out what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"muhsin corbbrey.\" I'm not sure if that's a correct name; maybe it's a typo or a misremembered name. Looking at the table data, the opponents listed are names like Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, etc. I don't see any opponent named Muhsin Corbbrey in the table. That might be a red flag because if there's no opponent with that name, then maybe the claim is false.\n\nNext, the claim says \"fight 2 fight.\" I think this refers to a rematch or the second fight between two fighters. Again, looking at the table, each row seems to represent a single fight. So I need to check if Muhsin Corbbrey had any fights in Florida in 2006, as per the claim.\n\nNow, focusing on the date part: \"in 2006.\" The table has several rows with dates in 2005 and 2006. For example, there's a fight on 2006-09-15 and others. So, it's possible that Muhsin Corbbrey had fights in Florida in 2006.\n\nThe location is specified as \"florida,\" which aligns with the table data because some venues are in Florida, like Miami or Port St. Lucie.\n\nLooking at the \"venue\" column in the table, I see entries like \"show place arena\" in Upper Marlboro and \"radisson hotel\" in Miami. These are indeed in Florida. So, that part of the claim seems plausible.\n\nNext, checking if Muhsin Corbbrey had a fight in 2006. The table shows several opponents with fights in 2006, but none named Muhsin Corbbrey. All the opponents listed are different names: Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, Anthony Abrams, Ben Lock, and Emmanuel Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nWait a second, there's no opponent named Muhsin Corbbrey in any of these rows. That suggests that either the name is incorrect or the fight didn't happen as per the table data. Since the claim includes \"muhsin corbbrey,\" which isn't present, it might be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the opponent's name. Maybe \"corbbrey\" is a common misspelling of another name. But in the table, the opponents are clearly listed as those names, so unless there's a variation or a different spelling, it seems like the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlso, considering that the claim mentions \"fight 2 fight,\" which implies a rematch. The table doesn't indicate any second fights for these opponents with each other or anyone else named Muhsin Corbbrey. So even if the location and date are correct, without the opponent's name matching, the overall claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, there is no evidence of a fight by someone named Muhsin Corbbrey in Florida in 2006. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It mentions Muhsin Corbrey winning three fights via TKO (Technical Knockout) within the years 2005 to 2009. So I need to look for any entries in the table where \"result\" is a win, \"method\" is TKO, and the date falls between 2005 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the table's data rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"win\" as result, method is \"decision\", so not TKO.\n2. Second row: \"win\", but method is \"tko\"? Wait, it's written as \"tko\". So that's a possible match.

So let's list them:\n\nRow 0: method \"decision\" \u2192 not TKO\nRow 1: method \"tko\" \u2192 yes, and date 2006-09-15\nRow 2: loss\nRow 3: method \"tko\" \u2192 yes, date 2006-04-21\nRow 4: decision (unanimous)\nRow 5: same as above\nRow 6: method is \"decision (unanimous)\"\nRow 7: TKO and date 2005-11-26\nRow 8: loss\nRow 9: draw\n\nWait, no, the table has 10 entries in data, from row 0 to 9. So rows are:\n\n0: win, decision\n1: win, tko \u2192 yes\n2: loss\n3: win, tko \u2192 yes\n4: win, decision (unanimous)\n5: win, same method\n6: win, TKO and date 2005-11-26\n7: loss\n8: draw\n\nWait, no, row indices in the data array are from 0 to 9:\n\nLooking at each entry:\n\nRow 0: fight on 2009-02-28 \u2192 within 2005-2009? Yes.\nBut method is \"decision\", not TKO.\n\nRow 1: 2006-09-15, result win, method tko \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 2: loss, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 3: 2006-04-21, win, method tko \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 4: 2006-03-09, win, decision (unanimous).\n\nRow 5: 2006-01-26, win, same method.\n\nRow 6: 2005-11-26, result is win, method \"decision (unanimous)\" \u2192 nope.\n\nWait, row 7? Wait the data array has 10 elements, so rows are 0 to 9. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the table, the first entry is row 0, then up to row 9 as the last one.\n\nSo in row 1: opponent Ryan Rayonec, venue Omar Shrine Temple, method tko \u2192 this is a win via TKO, date 2006-09-15. So that's one fight.\n\nRow 3: opponent Shelton Barnes, same venue, method tko, so another win.\n\nRow 7? Wait, the data array has:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n0: all correct\n1: yes, win via TKO\n2: loss\n3: yes, win via TKO\n4: win but not TKO\n5: same as 4\n6: opponent Ben Lock, method tko \u2192 yes, that's another one. So row 6: date 2005-11-26, so within the timeframe.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with indices and opponents. Let me list all rows and check:\n\n1. Row 0:\n   - date 2009-02-28\n   - result win\n   - method decision \u2192 not TKO\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - opponent Ryan Rayonec\n   - method tko \u2192 yes.\n   - So this is a TKO win.\n\n3. Row 2: loss, ignore.\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - opponent Shelton Barnes\n   - method tko \u2192 yes.\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - result win, but method not tko \u2192 no.\n\n6. Row 5:\n   - same as 4? Or is it different?\n\nWait, let me go through each row properly:\n\nData rows (index, date, result, method):\n\n0: 2009-02-28, win, decision\n1: 2006-09-15, win, tko\n2: loss, ignore\n3: 2006-04-21, win, tko\n4: 2006-03-09, win, decision (unanimous)\n5: 2006-01-26, win, same as 4?\nWait the description for row 5 says \"win\", opponent is someone else, method is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\n6: 2005-11-26, result is win, method tko \u2192 yes, that's another one.\n\nSo rows 1,3, and 6 are all wins via tko within the years 2005-2009.\n\nThat makes three fights where the result is a win via TKO during the target timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that there are three such fights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of fights where the outcome was a win by TKO between 2005 and 2009 can be determined by examining each row in the provided table. Specifically, we look for entries where the result is \"win,\" the method is \"tko\" (case-insensitive), and the date falls within the years 2005 to 2009.\n\nUpon reviewing all the data rows:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Date - 2006-09-15, Result - Win, Method - tko\n2. **Row 3**: Date - 2006-04-21, Result - Win, Method - tko\n3. **Row 6**: Date - 2005-11-26, Result - Win, Method - tko\n\nThere are **three** such fights.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in maryland\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Muhsin Corbrey has never lost a fight that took place in Maryland. So, I need to check if there are any fights listed in the table where Corbrey lost and the venue was in Maryland.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight with various details. The columns relevant here are \"opponent,\" \"venue,\" \"method,\" and \"result.\" But more specifically, since we're concerned about whether he lost a fight in Maryland, I should focus on the \"result\" and \"venue\" columns.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is 2009-02-28. Venue is Hilton Head, SC. Result is win. So, not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Date is 2006-09-15. Venue is Mount Pleasant, SC. Result is win. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 2**: Date is 2006-06-15. Venue is Glen Burnie, MD. Result is loss. This is a loss in Maryland. So, this is relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Date is 2006-04-21. Venue is Mount Pleasant, SC. Result is win. Not relevant.\n5. **Row 4**: Date is 2006-03-09. Venue is Glen Burnie, MD. Result is win. Not a loss.\n6. **Row 5**: Date is 2006-01-26. Venue is Glen Burnie, MD. Result is win. Not a loss.\n7. **Row 6**: Date is 2005-11-26. Venue is Upper Marlboro, MD. Result is win. Not a loss.\n8. **Row 7**: Date is 2005-04-26. Venue is Miami, FL. Result is loss. Not in Maryland.\n9. **Row 8**: Date is 2005-04-08. Venue is Port St Lucie, FL. Result is draw. Not a loss.\n\nFrom this analysis, I see that in row 2 (row_index: 2), the venue was Glen Burnie, MD, and the result was a loss. This directly contradicts the claim because it shows Corbrey did lose a fight in Maryland. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it says that Tim Coleman did not lose a fight against Ben Lock in 2006. So my task is to check if there's any evidence in the table where Tim Coleman fought Ben Lock and lost.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight, with various details filled in each column. The relevant columns here are \"opponent\", \"result\", and maybe \"time\" but that's less important for the outcome. \n\nNow, I need to go through each row in the data array to see if any of them match both Tim Coleman vs Ben Lock and a loss.\n\nLet me start by looking at each row:\n\n1. First row: Opponent is Troy Nelson. Result is win. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: Opponent is Ryan Rayonec. Result is win. No.\n3. Third row: Opponent is Tim Coleman. Wait, that's interesting. The opponent here is Tim Coleman, and the result is a loss. But wait, in this context, does \"opponent\" refer to who Tim Coleman fought against? Let me check the columns again.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, each row represents a fight, so the \"opponent\" column is who the fighter faced. So if we have a row where opponent is Tim Coleman, that means someone else fought Tim Coleman and either won or lost. But the claim is about Tim Coleman not losing to Ben Lock. So I need to find a fight where the opponent is Ben Lock and the result is a loss by Tim Coleman.\n\nLooking further:\n\n4. Fourth row: Opponent is Shelton Barnes. Result is win.\n5. Fifth row: Opponent is Kareem Robinson. Win again.\n6. Sixth row: Opponent is Anthony Abrams. Also a win.\n7. Seventh row: Opponent is Ben Lock. This seems relevant. Let me check the details.\n\nIn the seventh row, opponent is Ben Lock. The result is \"decision (unanimous)\", and Tim Coleman's record after that fight is 1 - 1 - 1. Wait, but what's the fighter in this row? Let me see: the data includes columns like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, record.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify who is fighting whom. The first column is \"opponent\", which would be the person Tim Coleman fought against. So if the opponent is Ben Lock, that means in this fight, Tim Coleman faced Ben Lock. The result is a loss because it's \"loss\" but wait no, looking back:\n\nWait no, actually, let me re-examine. In row 7: date is 2005-11-26, result is \"win\", opponent is Ben Lock, and method is decision (unanimous). So if Tim Coleman fought Ben Lock in 2005 and won, that's a win for Tim.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 2006. So I need to look at rows where the date is in 2006. Let me check:\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows 1: 2009\nRow 2: 2006-09-15\nRow 3: 2006-06-15\nRow 4: 2006-04-21\nRow 5: 2006-03-09\nRow 6: 2006-01-26\nRow 7: 2005-11-26\nRow 8: 2005-04-26\nRow 9: 2005-04-08\n\nSo rows 2 through 6 are in 2006. Let's check each of these.\n\nRow 3: Opponent is Tim Coleman, result is loss. But that means someone else fought Tim Coleman and lost to him. So the opponent here is not Ben Lock.\n\nLooking for where the opponent is Ben Lock in 2006. From the rows, I don't see any other occurrence except row 7 which is in 2005. So in 2006, there's no fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: in row 3, opponent is Tim Coleman, so that means someone else fought Tim Coleman. The result is loss, so the fighter lost to Tim Coleman. But the claim is about Tim Coleman not losing against Ben Lock. So if there's no fight in 2006 where Tim Coleman faced Ben Lock and lost, then the claim is true.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again: the claim is \"Tim Coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006.\" So we need to check if in 2006, Tim Coleman fought Ben Lock and lost.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nIn row 3, date is 2006-06-15, opponent is Tim Coleman (so someone else fought him), result is loss. But the opponent isn't Ben Lock.\n\nIn row 7: 2005-11-26, opponent is Ben Lock, but that's in 2005, not 2006. So in 2006, there's no fight where Tim Coleman faced Ben Lock and lost.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's no evidence in the table of Tim Coleman losing to Ben Lock in 2006.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as there are no records in the provided data indicating that Tim Coleman lost a fight against Ben Lock in 2006.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is true.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 4 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\" \n\nHmm, I think there might be a typo there. It probably means that Muhsin Corbrey fought in four fights that lasted more than five rounds between 2006 and 2009.\n\nSo, my task is to check the table for any entries where Muhsin Corbrey had such fights. Wait, but looking at the table provided, I don't see Muhsin Corbrey listed as an opponent in any of the rows. The opponents are names like Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, etc. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to the location or venue being more than five rounds? Or maybe the method? No, I think it's about the fight lasting more than five rounds. So each fight has a 'method' and 'time' column. The time is in minutes and seconds, like \"3:00\" which is 180 minutes.\n\nSo for each of Muhsin Corbrey's fights (if any), I need to check if the time was over 5 rounds, meaning more than 5*3=15 minutes? Or wait, a round usually lasts a certain amount of time. But in mixed martial arts, a five-round fight would mean five rounds, each lasting maybe 5 minutes, so total 25 minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the table's 'time' column: for example, one entry is \"0:54\", which is less than 5 minutes. Another is \"3:00\" (180 minutes), another \"2:43\", etc.\n\nSo if a fight lasted more than 5 rounds, that would mean each round is perhaps 5 minutes? So total time would be over 25 minutes.\n\nWait, but the 'time' in the table seems to just list the duration of the fight in minutes and seconds, not the number of rounds. For example, \"3:00\" might mean the entire fight was 180 minutes, which is three hours, so that's a long time for a fight. But usually, fights don't last that long.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 'round' column is an integer. So if a fight lasted more than five rounds, then the 'round' column would be higher than 5.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nFor instance, row 0 has \"6\" in the round column. So six rounds? But that's unusual for a fight to have six rounds. Most fights are divided into rounds based on the time taken, but it's not common to go beyond five rounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'round' is indicating how many rounds were fought before the method was applied. For example, a decision after six rounds would mean the fight went on for six full rounds.\n\nBut in any case, the claim is about Muhsin Corbrey fighting in four fights that lasted more than five rounds between 2006 and 2009.\n\nFirst, I need to check if Muhsin Corbrey even fought in these years. From the table, the opponents listed are Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, Anthony Abrams, Ben Lock, Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez, Ricardo Planter. None of these names seem to be Muhsin Corbrey.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering the name? Or maybe the table is missing some fights involving him. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about someone else, but it's misstated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'muhsin corbbrey' is a typo and should be another name.\n\nBut assuming the claim is correct as given, I need to check if there are any entries in the table for Muhsin Corbrey between 2006 and 2009 with four fights each lasting more than five rounds.\n\nLooking at the table, all the opponents listed don't include Muhsin Corbrey. So perhaps the answer is FALSE because there's no data supporting the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nThe data includes eight rows, each representing a fight. The 'opponent' column lists the names of other fighters. None of them match \"Muhsin Corbbrey.\" Therefore, it seems that Muhsin Corbrey didn't have any fights listed in this table during those years.\n\nSo the claim is likely FALSE because there's no evidence in the table supporting that Muhsin Corbrey fought four times with fights lasting more than five rounds between 2006 and 2009.\n\nAdditionally, even if I consider that perhaps 'muhsin corbbrey' refers to someone else or there was a typo, since none of the opponents match, it's safe to say the claim isn't supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Muhsin Corbrey fought in four fights lasting more than five rounds between 2006 and 2009. Checking the table, no entries list Muhsin Corbrey as an opponent during those years. The relevant columns are 'date' (to check the year), 'opponent', and 'round' (if applicable). However, since none of the opponents match Muhsin Corbrey, the claim isn't supported.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is unsupported by the provided data. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No evidence found}}",
