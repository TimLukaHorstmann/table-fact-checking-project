    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"player geremi have win only 1 fifa club world championship.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table. There's a column called \"name,\" which lists players, and another column named \"fifa club world championship,\" which probably tracks how many times each player has won that tournament.\n\nNext, I need to find Geremi in the table. Let me go through each row under the \"name\" column:\n\n1. ra\u00fal\n2. fernando morientes\n3. s\u00e1vio\n4. roberto carlos\n5. guti\n6. nicolas anelka\n7. fernando hierro\n8. own goal\n9. steve mcmanaman\n10. rolando zinae\n11. ivan helguera\n12. elvir balji\u0107\n13. jos\u00e9 manuel meca garc\u00eda\n14. perica ognjenovi\u0107\n15. christian karembeu\n16. geremi\n17. totals\n\nI see Geremi is in row 16. Now, looking at the corresponding row for Geremi, I should check the \"fifa club world championship\" column. The data shows that for Geremi, this value is 1.\n\nSo, according to the table, Geremi has won the FIFA Club World Cup once. That matches the claim exactly, so the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
