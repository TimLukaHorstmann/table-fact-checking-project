    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, the table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data includes multiple rows with information about different games. Each row represents a game where one team is at home and another is away.\n\nThe claim says that \"prince park be home to the carlton team.\" So I need to check if in any of the games listed, Carlton was the home team playing at Prince Park.\n\nLooking at the table's data rows:\n\n1. The first row: Home team is Essendon, venue is Windy Hill.\n2. Second row: Collingwood is home, venue Victoria Park.\n3. Third row: Carlton is home, venue Princes Park.\n4. Fourth row: Richmond is home, venue Punt Road Oval.\n5. Fifth row: St Kilda is home, venue Junction Oval.\n6. Sixth row: Geelong is home, venue Kardinia Park.\n\nWait, in the third row, the home team is Carlton and the venue is Princes Park. So that would mean Prince Park (I assume it's a typo for Princes Park) is where Carlton plays as the home team. That matches the claim. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The user might have meant Prince Park versus Princes Park, but in the table, it's written as \"princes park\" with an 's'. So if the claim says \"Prince Park,\" maybe there's a typo or I need to check if it refers to the same place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the venue name is sometimes spelled differently. But according to the data, Princes Park is where Carlton plays as the home team in one of their games on July 14, 1945. So the claim seems correct based on that row.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the third row's \"home team\" and \"venue\" columns because they directly show Carlton as the home at Princes Park.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each game in the table to see if Carlton was the home team at Prince Park. In the third row, Carlton is listed as the home team with the venue as Princes Park. This matches the claim. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
