    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has several columns: event, date, rating, share, and viewers. There are eight rows of data with different events and their corresponding details.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"during the johnson v moraga event there be 2.4 million viewer\". I need to check if this claim is fully supported by the table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate directly to the table's columns. The key part here is \"viewers\" because that's one of the columns provided. The rest of the claim seems to be about the event name, but since the column names don't include \"event\" in a way that would affect the viewer count, maybe I'm only concerned with the viewers' data.\n\nNext, I need to look through each row to see if there's an entry for \"johnson vs moraga\". Looking at the table:\n\n1. The first row is \"velasquez vs dos santos\".\n2. Second: \"evans vs davis\".\n3. Third: \"diaz vs miller\".\n4. Fourth: \"shogun vs vera\".\n5. Fifth: \"henderson vs diaz\".\n6. Sixth: \"johnson vs dodson\".\n7. Seventh: \"henderson vs melendez\".\n8. Eighth: \"johnson vs moraga\".\n\nSo, the eighth row is for \"johnson vs moraga\". Now, I need to check what the viewers column says for that event. In that row, under \"viewers\", it's written as \"2.4 million\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the viewers column of the corresponding row. So, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the one at row 7 (since counting starts from 0) for the \"viewers\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each event until I found \"Johnson vs Moraga\", which is in row 7. The viewers' count there is 2.4 million, matching the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"At the Johnson v Dodson event, the rating be 2.4.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. Each row corresponds to a different event with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Johnson v Dodson\" as the event and specifies the rating should be 2.4. So my first step is to find the row where the event is \"Johnson v Dodson.\"\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n1. The second row (index 1) has the event \"evans vs davis.\"\n2. Third row: \"diaz vs miller.\"\n3. Fourth: \"shogun vs vera.\"\n4. Fifth: \"henderson vs diaz.\"\n5. Sixth row is \"johnson vs dodson.\" So that's our relevant row, which is at index 6.\n\nNow, within this row, the rating column has a value. Let me check what it is. The sixth data row (index 6) under \"rating\" is \"2.4.\"\n\nSo the claim states that for \"Johnson v Dodson,\" the rating is 2.4, and according to the table, that's exactly what it shows.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to specify which cells are relevant. The event column is where the event name is listed, so row index 6, column \"rating\" is also relevant because it directly supports the rating value.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the Shogun vs Vera event is true based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"At the Shogun v Vera event, the rating be 1.4 and the viewer be 2.4 million.\" So, I need to check two things here: the rating and the number of viewers for that specific event.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's a JSON structure with columns: event, date, rating, share, and viewers. The data rows list various events along with their details. My first step is to locate the row where the event is \"Shogun vs vera.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find that exact event name. \n\n1. The first row after the header is \"velasquez vs dos santos\" \u2013 not matching.\n2. Next is \"evans vs davis\" \u2013 still no match.\n3. Then \"diaz vs miller\" \u2013 nope.\n4. \"henderson vs diaz\" \u2013 not this one either.\n5. \"johnson vs dodson\" \u2013 still not the Shogun vs Vera event.\n6. Moving on, \"henderson vs melendez\" isn't it either.\n7. Finally, I find the row: \"shogun vs vera.\" This must be the correct event.\n\nNow, for this row, I need to extract the rating and viewers. According to the data, the rating is listed as \"1.4\" and the viewers are \"2.4 million.\" \n\nComparing this with the claim, it states that both the rating is 1.4 and viewers are 2.4 million. Both pieces of information match exactly what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the relevant cells, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are the ones for the Shogun vs Vera event specifically, which are row index 6 and the columns rating and viewers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table's data for the specified event.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is specifically about the \"Johnson v Moraga\" event scheduled for July 27, 2013, having a rating of 1.5. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the data provided. There's a JSON table with columns: event, date, rating, share, and viewers. Each row corresponds to an event with its details. My goal is to find out if the rating for \"Johnson v Moraga\" on that specific date matches 1.5.\n\nLooking at the claim, I need to extract the relevant information. The event name is \"johnson vs moraga\", and the date is July 27, 2013. So, in the table, I should look for a row where both the event and date match these details.\n\nI'll go through each row of the data:\n\n1. **First row**: Event is \"velasquez vs dos santos\" on Nov 12, 2011. Doesn't match.\n2. **Second row**: \"evans vs davis\" on Jan 28, 2012. Not matching.\n3. **Third row**: \"diaz vs miller\" on May 5, 2012. No match.\n4. **Fourth row**: \"shogun vs vera\" on Aug 4, 2012. Doesn't match.\n5. **Fifth row**: \"henderson vs diaz\" on Dec 8, 2012. Not the right event.\n6. **Sixth row**: \"johnson vs dodson\" on Jan 26, 2013. Close, but different event and date.\n7. **Seventh row**: \"henderson vs melendez\" on April 20, 2013. Different date.\n8. **Eighth row**: \"johnson vs moraga\" on July 27, 2013. This matches both the event name and date.\n\nNow, I need to check the rating for this particular row. The rating is listed as \"1.5\", which exactly matches the claim. \n\nTo confirm, I should note down the relevant cells. The row index here is 7 (since it's zero-indexed), and the column is \"rating\". So, the relevant cells are at row 7, column \"rating\".\n\nPutting it all together, since the rating matches, the claim is true.

The claim says: \"there be 4.4 million viewers on december 8 , 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are event, date, rating, share, and viewers. Each row represents a different event with its details.\n\nI need to check each row to see if any match the claim's criteria. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0 is just the header, so I can skip that. Row 1: event \"velasquez vs dos santos,\" date November 12, 2011, viewers 5.7 million. Doesn't match December 8, 2012.\n\nRow 2: event \"evans vs davis,\" January 28, 2012, viewers 4.7 million. Not December.\n\nRow 3: Diaz vs Miller, May 5, 2012. Viewers 2.4 million. No match.\n\nRow 4: Shogun vs Vera, August 4, 2012. Viewers 2.4 million. Still not December.\n\nRow 5: Henderson vs Diaz, December 8, 2012. That's the date in question. Viewers are listed as 4.4 million. So this row matches both the date and the viewers count.\n\nRow 6: Johnson vs Dodson, January 26, 2013. Viewers 4.2 million, not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Henderson vs Melendez, April 20, 2013. Viewers 3.7 million. Not a match.\n\nRow 8: Johnson vs Moraga, July 27, 2013. Viewers 2.4 million. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the only row that matches both the date December 8, 2012 and viewers of 4.4 million is row 5.

The claim mentions \"johnson vs moraga,\" so I need to find that event in the table. Looking at the data, there's a row with \"johnson vs moraga\" as the first element in the \"event\" column. \n\nNext, I should check which columns are needed to verify the claim. The claim talks about viewers, so I'm looking for the \"viewers\" column for this specific event.\n\nNow, let me find the exact data point. In the table, each row corresponds to a different event with their respective details.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the Johnson vs Dodson event is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the event johnson v dodson have a rating of greater than 2.4 with more than 4.2 million viewers.\" So there are two conditions here: the rating should be >2.4 and the number of viewers should be >4.2 million.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant row for Johnson vs Dodson. The columns are event, date, rating, share, and viewers. I'll go through each row until I find \"Johnson vs Dodson.\"\n\nRow 0: event is \"event,\" so not this one.\nRow 1: \"velasquez vs dos santos\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"evans vs davis\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: \"diaz vs miller\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: \"shogun vs vera\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 5: \"henderson vs diaz\" \u2013 not Johnson vs Dodson.\nRow 6: \"johnson vs dodson\" \u2013 yes, this is the event we're looking for. So it's in row index 6.\n\nNow, let's check the rating and viewers for this event. The rating column has \"2.4.\" Wait, the claim says greater than 2.4. But here, the rating is exactly 2.4. So that means it's not greater than 2.4; it's equal to 2.4. That already fails one part of the claim.\n\nNext, looking at viewers: the number listed is \"4.2 million.\" The claim requires more than 4.2 million. But again, it's exactly 4.2 million, not more. So both conditions aren't met.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Could there be a mistake in my row index? Let me count again. The first data row is index 0: event vs others up to row 6 which is Johnson vs Dodson. That seems correct.\n\nSo the rating is 2.4 and viewers are 4.2 million, both of which don't meet the \"greater than\" conditions stated in the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the event henderson v melendez take place before april 20 , 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's stating that the event between Henderson and Melendez occurred prior to April 20, 2013. So, my goal is to find out if there's an event named \"Henderson vs Melendez\" in the table with a date before April 20, 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: event, date, rating, share, viewers. The data rows include various events with their respective dates. I need to search for the specific event name \"Henderson vs Melendez\".\n\nScanning through each row's \"event\" column:\n\n1. The first row is the header, so it doesn't apply.\n2. The second row is \"velasquez vs dos santos\" \u2013 not relevant.\n3. Third: \"evans vs davis\" \u2013 nope.\n4. Fourth: \"diaz vs miller\" \u2013 no match.\n5. Fifth: \"shogun vs vera\" \u2013 still nothing.\n6. Sixth: \"henderson vs diaz\" \u2013 this is Henderson, but against Diaz, not Melendez.\n7. Seventh: \"johnson vs dodson\" \u2013 unrelated.\n8. Eighth: \"henderson vs melendez\" \u2013 yes! This is the event we're looking for.\n\nNow, I need to check the date associated with this event. Looking at the row where \"event\" is \"henderson vs melendez\", the date is listed as \"april 20 , 2013\". Wait a second, the claim says it took place before April 20, 2013. So if the date in the table is exactly on April 20, does that mean it's not before?\n\nHmm, sometimes dates can be tricky. If the event is listed as happening on April 20, 2013, then \"before\" would imply earlier than that date. Since the date matches the specified date, technically, the event didn't take place strictly before April 20. It happened on that exact day.\n\nBut I should double-check to make sure there's no other occurrence of Henderson vs Melendez in an earlier row. Let me scan again:\n\n- Row 0: header\n- Rows 1-4: no match\n- Row 6: Henderson vs Diaz (different opponent)\n- Row 7: Johnson vs Dodson\n- Row 8: Henderson vs Melendez\n\nNo, there's only one occurrence of Henderson vs Melendez on April 20, 2013. Therefore, the claim that it took place before April 20 isn't accurate because it happened on that date.\n\nWait, but sometimes dates can be ambiguous. For example, if the date was written as \"April, 20, 2013\", it's clear it's the 20th. But in the table, it's written as \"april 20 , 2013\". Depending on how it's formatted, maybe it's considered April 19? No, that seems unlikely. The format looks like \"month day, year\", so it's April 20.\n\nThus, the event happened on April 20, not before. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"the johnson v moraga fight take place just after july 27 , 2013 and have a rating of close to 1.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. The event took place just after July 27, 2013.\n2. The event had a rating close to 1.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. Each row represents a different fight with corresponding data.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that check both parts of the claim. Let me go through each row to see if any match \"Johnson vs Moraga\" and then verify their date and rating.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: event is \"event\", so it's the header, not useful.\n- Row 1: event is \"velasquez vs dos santos\". Not matching.\n- Row 2: \"evans vs davis\". No match.\n- Row 3: \"diaz vs miller\". Nope.\n- Row 4: \"shogun vs vera\". Still no.\n- Row 5: \"henderson vs diaz\". No.\n- Row 6: \"johnson vs dodson\". Close, but the opponent is Dodson, not Moraga. So not a match.\n- Row 7: \"henderson vs melendez\". Nope.\n- Row 8: \"johnson vs moraga\". Yes, this matches the event name in the claim.\n\nNow, for this row (row index 8), I need to check two things:\n1. The date of the event.\n2. The rating.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column for row 8: it's \"july 27 , 2013\". The claim says the fight took place just after July 27, 2013. Hmm, is \"just after\" technically correct? If the date in the table is exactly July 27, then saying it happened just after that might be a bit of a stretch. However, sometimes events might have details like the exact time or whether they are happening on that day. Since the date is listed as July 27, I can assume it's within that timeframe.\n\nNext, the rating: according to the table, it's \"1.5\". The claim mentions a rating close to 1. 1.5 is not particularly close to 1; it's more than halfway between 1 and 2. So this part might not hold up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user instruction says that the date in the claim is \"july 27 , 2013\" and the event took place just after that. In reality, events on a given day might be spread throughout the day, so it's possible that July 27 is correct, and the claim's wording is acceptable.\n\nBut regarding the rating, \"close to 1\" doesn't align with the table's data of 1.5. So there's a discrepancy here. However, perhaps the term \"rating\" in the claim refers to something else, like viewer count or share percentage. But no, the column is clearly labeled as \"rating\", which is 1.5.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n- The event does exist in row 8.\n- The date matches July 27, 2013, though the wording about being just after might be a bit off.\n- The rating is 1.5, not close to 1.\n\nTherefore, while the event exists and the date is accurate, the rating part of the claim doesn't hold true. Hence, the overall claim should be considered false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"rating\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So I'll go through each row until I find one where the date is December 8, 2012. \n\nLet me scan the dates: November 12, 2011; January 28, 2012; May 5, 2012; August 4, 2012; December 8, 2012; and so on. Ah, there's a row with date \"december 8 , 2012\". That should be the one.\n\nNow, for that specific row, I need to check the viewers column. From the table, the viewers for that fight are listed as \"4.4 million.\" The claim says it should be over 4.4 million. Hmm, so does \"over\" mean strictly greater than? If yes, then 4.4 million is not more than itself; it's equal. So the number isn't higher than 4.4 million.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"over.\" In some contexts, \"over\" could include equal to or greater. But typically, in claims like this, if it's stated as \"over,\" it usually means strictly greater. For example, saying someone scored over 100 points implies more than 100, not exactly 100.\n\nSo if the viewers were exactly 4.4 million, then claiming it's over would be false. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the number isn't higher; it's equal to 4.4 million.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the number of viewers for the fight on December 8, 2012, is over 4.4 million. By checking the relevant row in the table, we find that the viewers were exactly 4.4 million, not more than that.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The claim references \"viewers,\" so I look for the \"viewers\" column.\n2. **Locate December 8, 2012:** Find the row where the date matches December 8, 2012.\n3. **Check Viewer Numbers:** Confirm that the viewers for this date are 4.4 million.\n4. **Analyze Claim vs. Data:** Since 4.4 million is not over itself, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}",
