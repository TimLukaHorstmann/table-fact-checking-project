    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"when the opponent is Dan Severn, the method is submission (arm triangle choke) and the event is UFC Japan : Ultimate Japan.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It's in JSON format with columns like res, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. The data is a list of rows, each representing an event or fight.\n\nSo, the claim has three conditions:\n1. Opponent is Dan Severn.\n2. Method is submission (arm triangle choke).\n3. Event is UFC Japan : Ultimate Japan.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if any row satisfies all these three conditions simultaneously.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is johnathan ivey, method is tko (punches), event is pfl - genesis. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is wes sims, method is tko, event is hooknshoot... No match.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is dan severn. Oh, that's a potential. Let me check the method here. It says submission (arm triangle choke). Yes, and the event is world class (wef 9)... Wait, no, the event here is \"wef 9 - world class\", which isn't \"UFC Japan : Ultimate Japan.\" So this row doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nRow 3: Opponent is maurice smith. Not Dan Severn. So skip.\n\nRow 4: Patrick Smith again. No.\n\nRow 5: Kazushi Sakuraba as opponent. Method is submission (armbar). Event is UFC Japan... but opponent isn't Dan Severn, so no.\n\nRow 6: Same opponent as row 5, but it's a no contest. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Maurice Smith again, method tko (kick), location Oklahoma. No match.\n\nRow 8: Carl Franks. Opponent is him, not Dan Severn. So no.\n\nRow 9: Victor Tatarkin. Not the opponent we're looking for.\n\nRow 10: Gary Myers. Again, not Dan Severn.\n\nSo, none of the rows have all three conditions met. The only row with Dan Severn (row 2) has a different event and method than specified in the claim. Therefore, there's no evidence supporting the claim. So it must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table and check the 'record' column to see which fighters have a 5-3 record. \n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Row 0: Record is 6-4\n2. Row 1: 5-4\n3. Row 2: 5-3 \u2013 here's one fighter with 5-3.\n4. Row 3: 5-2\n5. Row 4: 4-2\n6. Row 5: 3-2\n7. Row 6: 3-1 nc\n8. Row 7: 3-1\n9. Row 8: 3-0\n10. Row 9: 2-0\n11. Row 10: 1-0\n\nSo only row 2 has a fighter with a 5-3 record. That's one fighter.\n\nThe claim says \"only 1 fighter\" have this record, which is correct based on the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
