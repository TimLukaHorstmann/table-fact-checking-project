According to the table, row 25's directed by column lists Maxwell Atom.\n\nNow, the viewers for this episode are given in the \"us viewers (millions)\" column. Looking at row 25: the data is \"2.4\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"willam reiss direct the episode title fail fish\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: no in series, title, directed by, story & storyboards by, original air date, and us viewers (millions). Each row represents an episode with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions that \"willam reiss\" directed the episode titled \"fail fish.\" To verify this, I need to check two things: whether there is an episode titled \"fail fish\" and if it was directed by Willam Reiss.\n\nLooking at the table's data rows:\n\n1. The second row has:\n   - no in series: 2\n   - title: \"fish sleepover party\"\n   - directed by: william reiss\n   - story & storyboards by: justin roiland (story) william reiss (storyboards)\n   - original air date: september 24 , 2010\n   - us viewers (millions): 3.0\n\n2. The fourth row is:\n   - no in series: 10\n   - title: \"fail fish\"\n   - directed by: willam reiss\n   - story & storyboards by: tim mckeon (story) ian wasseluk (storyboards)\n   - original air date: november 5 , 2010\n   - us viewers (millions): n / a\n\nSo, the \"fail fish\" episode is indeed present in row 10. The directed by column for that row says \"willam reiss,\" which matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the spelling. In some rows, it's written as \"william reiss.\" For example, row 2 has \"william reiss\" and row 4 also uses \"william reiss.\" The claim mentions \"willam reiss.\" Is that a typo? The table consistently uses \"William Reiss,\" so the claim might have a spelling mistake.\n\nBut regardless of the spelling, if the name in the table matches what's needed for the claim. So even if it's \"william\" instead of \"William,\" it still refers to the same person. But I think in this context, the exact spelling matters because names are often unique and should be matched correctly.\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking back at the data, the directed by column for row 10 is indeed \"willam reiss.\" So even if it's spelled as \"willam,\" it still matches the claim which uses \"willam reiss.\"\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met: there exists an episode titled \"fail fish\" and it was directed by Willam Reiss (spelled as \"willam reiss\" in the table).\n\nSo the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells would be row 10's directed by column and perhaps the title column if needed, but since the claim is about who directed it, the directed by column is sufficient.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Willam Reiss\" directed an episode titled \"Fail Fish.\" By examining the table, we find that there is indeed an episode with the title \"Fail Fish\" at row 10. The directed by column for this row lists \"willam reiss,\" matching the claim's assertion.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Focus on the rows where the title matches \"fail fish\" and who directed it.\n2. **Check Directing Credit:** Confirm that the director's name in such a row corresponds to \"Willam Reiss.\"\n3. **Match Spelling:** Ensure that any spelling variations (like \"william\") don't affect the match, as names can be spelled differently but still refer to the same person.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"1 pair of people do the story and storyboard of the episode title 'Milo 's Big Idea' which aired on June 18, 2011 and is number 30 in the series.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to check three things from the claim:\n1. That there's one pair of people who did the story and storyboard for \"Milo 's Big Idea.\"\n2. The episode aired on June 18, 2011.\n3. The episode is number 30 in the series.\n\nLooking at the table, I should look for the row where the title is \"milo 's big idea.\" Let me scan through each row's \"title\" column.\n\nHmm, here it is: row 30 has the title \"milo 's big idea\". So that part checks out. Now, looking at the original air date, the \"original air date\" for row 30 is listed as \"june 18 , 2011.\" That matches the claim's date.\n\nNow, checking who did the story and storyboard. The table has two columns relevant here: \"story & storyboards by\". For row 30, it says \"jackie buscarino (story) neil graf (storyboards).\" So that means Jackie Buscarino did the story and Neil Graf did the storyboard. That's one pair of people, as per the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions \"1 pair,\" so that's correct. The episode is number 30 in the series, which is also accurate based on the table.\n\nSo all three aspects are true. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"story & storyboards by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"william reiss direct episode 12 , baldwin the super fish\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns are relevant here. The claim mentions two things: \"William Reiss\" and \"episode 12, Baldwin the Super Fish\". So, looking at the table's columns, the relevant ones seem to be:\n\n1. **directed by**: This column will tell me who directed each episode.\n2. **title**: This will help identify which episode we're talking about.\n3. **us viewers (millions)**: Maybe not directly relevant unless needed for verification.\n\nNext, I need to find the row corresponding to \"episode 12, Baldwin the Super Fish\". Let's look at the data:\n\n- Scanning through each row, I see that row index 12 has:\n  - Title: \"baldwin the super fish\"\n  - Directed by: \"william reiss\"\n\nSo, William Reiss is listed as the director for episode 12. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait a second\u2014should I check if there's any other information that might contradict this? For example, are there multiple episodes with the same title or similar details? Looking through all rows, each has a unique \"no in series\" number and a unique combination of director and storyboards. So, no conflicts here.\n\nTherefore, since William Reiss is indeed listed as directing episode 12 titled \"baldwin the super fish\", the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: they are in row 12 for the columns \"directed by\" and the title might also be relevant. Wait, the instruction says to include all relevant cells that support the claim. Since the claim mentions both the director (William Reiss) and the episode title (\"baldwin the super fish\"), I need to include both.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should list the row index 12 for \"directed by\" and perhaps also for \"title\" since it's part of the claim. But wait, the claim doesn't mention the title directly except as part of the episode number. Hmm, but the title is part of identifying which episode it is. So maybe including both columns would be appropriate.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided in the instructions: if the answer is TRUE, only two cells are listed\u2014the ones relevant to verify. In this case, verifying that William Reiss directed it requires checking the \"directed by\" column, and knowing which episode it is might require the title as well, but perhaps not. Since the claim specifies both the director and the episode number (though not explicitly the title), I think only the \"directed by\" column is necessary here.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"William Reiss direct episode 12\". So the key point is whether he directed that specific episode, which is in row 12. Therefore, the relevant cell would be the \"directed by\" column for row 12.\n\nBut to ensure accuracy, maybe including both the title and director columns isn't necessary unless they're part of the claim. Since the claim mentions William Reiss directing episode 12, the main focus is on verifying that in the \"directed by\" column for row 12.\n\nSo, I think the relevant cells are just the \"directed by\" column at row index 12.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"good time at pupu goodtimes be the title of the episode with series number 36.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the series number is 36. Let me scan through each row in the data array.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several rows with different series numbers. The row with series number 36 is near the end. Let me find it:\n\nYes, here's row 36:\n[\n  \"good times at pupu goodtimes\",\n  \"ch greenblatt & william reiss\",\n  \"jessica gao (story) blake lemons (storyboards)\",\n  \"august 12 , 2011\",\n  \"3.5\"\n]\n\nSo the title here is \"good times at pupu goodtimes.\"\n\nNow, checking the claim again: it says the title is \"good time at pupu goodtimes.\" Wait a minute, there's a discrepancy in the spelling of the title.\n\nIn the claim, the title has an apostrophe: \"good time at pupu goodtimes.\" But in the table, row 36, it's spelled as \"good times at pupu goodtimes\" without the apostrophe. The series number matches (it's 36), but the titles don't exactly match because of the missing apostrophe.\n\nSo that means the claim is not entirely accurate. However, I should also check if there are any other rows with a similar title or series number that might support it. Let me quickly scan through the other rows to make sure there isn't another entry for series 36.\n\nLooking back, series numbers go from 1 up to 36, and each seems unique. So row 36 is the only one with series number 36.\n\nTherefore, even though the series number matches, the title doesn't exactly match due to the spelling difference. So the claim is false because the titles don't fully align as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the episode with series number 36 has a slightly different title in the table compared to what's stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The title is \"doggonit\".\n2. Its original air date is April 1, 2011.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information.\n\nThe table has columns: no in series, title, directed by, story & storyboards by, original air date, us viewers (millions).\n\nI need to find the row where the \"title\" column matches \"doggonit\".\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- The third data row (row index 2) has the title \"doggonit\". \n\nNow, check the original air date for this entry. In the same row, under the \"original air date\" column, it says \"october 22 , 2010\".

The claim has \"good time,\" while this one is \"good times.\" So it's a different title.\n\nWait, so perhaps I missed it earlier. Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking back, row 36: Title is \"good times at pupu goodtimes.\" That's plural, so not the same as the claim which uses singular \"time\" and \"good times.\"\n\nNow, checking if Maxwell Adams directed any show with that title. Looking at the \"directed by\" column:\n\n- For each entry in the table, I need to see if any have Maxwell Adams directing a show titled \"good time at pupu goodtimes.\" \n\nGoing through the data:\n- Row 25: Directed by Justin Roiland and Maxwell Adams (storyboards), but the title is \"peopleing.\"\n- Row 36: Directed by Tim McKeon, not Maxwell.\n\nSo nowhere in the table does it mention Maxwell Adams directing a show called \"good time at pupu goodtimes.\" The closest is row 36, which has a similar title but with \"times\" and directed by different people.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because there's no entry in the table that matches both the title exactly as given and directed by Maxwell Adams.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n]}",

The columns are: no in series, title, directed by, story & storyboards by, original air date, and us viewers (millions).\n\nI'll search for the row where the title is \"Fail Fish.\" Scanning through the data, I see:\n\n[\n  [\n    ...\n    \"title\": \"fail fish\",\n    ...\n  ],\n  [\n    10,\n    \"fail fish\",\n    \"willam reiss\",\n    ... \n  ]\n]\n\nWait, in the first entry, it's spelled as \"fail fish\" with lowercase 'f' and 's', but in the second one, it's spelled as \"fail fish.\" Hmm, actually, I think they might be the same. Let me check the exact spelling.\n\nLooking at row 10: the title is \"fail fish.\" So that's the episode we're interested in.\n\nNow, for this row, the column \"directed by\" has \"willam reiss.\" But wait, the claim says two people directed it. So only one person is listed as directing here. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there are other columns that might indicate multiple directors. The next relevant column is \"story & storyboards by,\" which lists two people for row 10: \"tim mckeon (story) ian wasseluk (storyboards).\" So the story and storyboard were done by two people, but does that mean they directed? No, typically, those roles are separate from directing.\n\nSo in the \"directed by\" column, it's only \"willam reiss.\" Therefore, only one person directed the episode. The claim says two people directed it, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I misread the row numbers.

Wait, no, the first entry is no.1, so if I'm using zero-based indexing for rows, row 0 is no.1, row 1 is no.2, etc., but actually, looking at the data, it starts with 1 in \"no in series\" column, then 2, and so on up to 36. So each entry's index corresponds to the \"no in series\".\n\nSo for the claim, I need to find the episode where the title is \"Milo's Big Idea\". From the table, that's in row 30 of the data array (since it starts from 1). Wait, no: the first entry is 1, so if I'm looking at the data as a list, index 0 is the first entry with no.1, and so on. So \"Milo 's big idea\" is in row 30 of the data array because the \"no in series\" is 30.\n\nWait, let me count: The data array has entries from 1 to 36. So for the 30th entry, it's in position index 29 (since arrays start at 0). But regardless, the important part is finding which row and column.\n\nSo for \"Milo 's big idea\", look at the \"story & storyboards by\" column. The claim says that one person did both the story and storyboarding. \n\nLooking at the data: For no.30, the \"story & storyboards by\" is listed as \"jackie buscarino (story) neil graf (storyboards)\". So two people are mentioned: Jackie Buscarino for the story and Neil Graf for the storyboards. That means two different individuals did each part.\n\nBut the claim says that one person did both. Therefore, this contradicts the claim. There's no row where a single person is listed for both the story and storyboarding for \"Milo 's big idea\". So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"story & storyboards by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
