    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the performance of 'higher and higher' in the top 20 bracket garderned an advancement.\" Hmm, I notice a typo here\u2014\"garderned\" should probably be \"garnered.\" So the correct claim is about the performance of \"Higher and Higher\" in the Top 20 bracket leading to an advancement.\n\nLooking at the table provided, the columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, and result. The data has several rows, each representing different weeks with various details.\n\nI need to find if there's a row where the song is \"Higher and Higher\" in the Top 20 bracket, and its result is \"advanced.\" So let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Song is \"Walking on the Moon,\" not relevant.\n2. Second row: Song is \"Living for the City,\" nope.\n3. Third row: Here, the song choice is \"Higher and Higher\" in the Top 20 bracket. The original artist is Jackie Wilson, and the result is \"advanced.\" This seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows just to be thorough. Let's see:\n\n- Fourth row: Song is \"Bring It On Home to Me,\" no.\n- Fifth row: Song is \"Easy,\" not relevant.\n- Sixth row: Song is \"Can't Help Falling in Love Sir Duke,\" nope.\n- Seventh row: Song is \"Red Red Wine,\" no.\n\nSo only the third row matches. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a performance of \"Higher and Higher\" in the Top 20 that resulted in an advancement. Now, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list which columns and rows are involved. The relevant columns are \"song choice\" and \"result.\" The row index is 2 (since it's zero-based), so row_index: 2, column_name for both would be \"song choice\" and \"result.\"\n\nWait, let me double-check the row indices. The first data array is index 0, so the third entry is index 2. Correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells are at row 2, columns \"song choice\" and \"result.\" That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's a performance of \"Higher and Higher\" in the Top 20 bracket with an advanced result. The relevant cells are found in row 2 for song choice and result.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"audition be the week the original artist , lionel richie\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions \"audition\" as the week, so I need to check if there's a row where week is \"audition\" and original artist is Lionel Richie. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Week is audition, original artist is The Police. Not matching.\n2. Row 1: Week is Vegas verdicts, no original artist listed (n/a). Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: Week is top 20, original artist is Jackie Wilson. Not matching.\n4. Row 3: Week is top 10, original artist is Sam Cooke. No match.\n5. Row 4: Week is top 8, original artist is Lionel Richie. Oh, here we go. So the week is top 8 and the original artist is Lionel Richie.\n6. Row 5: Week is top 4, original artist is Elvis Presley & Stevie Wonder combined. Not matching.\n7. Row 6: Week is finale, original artist is Neil Diamond. No match.\n\nSo in row 4, both \"week\" and \"original artist\" are present that fit parts of the claim. The claim says \"audition be the week\", but row 0 has audition as the week with a different original artist (The Police). Therefore, since there's no row where the week is audition and the original artist is Lionel Richie, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim mentions \"audition\" as the week, which would be row 0, but that's The Police, not Lionel Richie. Then in row 4, the week is top 8 with Lionel Richie, but it's not audition week. So there's no matching week and original artist together for the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"audition\" is the week and the original artist is Lionel Richie. Checking each row:\n\n- Row 0: Week is audition, but original artist is The Police.\n- No other rows match both criteria simultaneously.\n\nSince no such row exists, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then find the relevant cells. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"higher and higher song garner an advanced result during top 10 week.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n1. \"higher and higher\" song\n2. \"advanced\" result\n3. \"top 10 week\"\n\nLooking at the table, columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, and result. My task is to find any row that matches all three criteria.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\nRow 0: Week is \"audition,\" so not top 10. Skip.\nRow 1: Week is \"vegas verdicts.\" Not top 10. Skip.\nRow 2: Week is \"top 20.\" Close, but not top 10. The song choice here is \"higher and higher.\" So this row has the correct song and week? Wait, no, week is top 20, not top 10.\nRow 3: Week is \"top 10.\" That's relevant. Song choice is \"bring it on home to me,\" which doesn't match. Result is advanced. Not applicable yet.\nRow 4: Week is \"top 8.\" Not top 10. Skip.\nRow 5: Week is \"top 4.\" No, but song is \"can't help falling in love sir duke\" and result is n/a. Doesn't fit.\nRow 6: Week is \"finale.\" No.\n\nSo, the only row where week is top 10 is row 3. But the song choice there is not \"higher and higher.\" The song in row 2 is \"higher and higher,\" but its week is top 20. Therefore, no row matches all three criteria: week is top 10, song is \"higher and higher,\" and result is advanced.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Row 3 has week as top 10 but song as bring it on home. So the claim mentions \"higher and higher\" specifically, so that's not in row 3.\n\nIs there another occurrence of \"higher and higher\"? Yes, in row 2, but that's under top 20 week. The result for that row is advanced, but since the week isn't top 10, it doesn't fit.\n\nSo no matching rows found. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
