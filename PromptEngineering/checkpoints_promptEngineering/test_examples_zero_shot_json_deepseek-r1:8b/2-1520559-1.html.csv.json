    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim states: \"annika s\u00f6renstam and yani tseng win with the lowest number of stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the data to find entries where either Annika S\u00f6renstam or Yani Tseng is the champion. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0 (2013): Champion is Stacy Lewis.\n- Row 1 (2012): Champion is Jiyai Shin.\n- Row 2 (2011): Champion is Yani Tseng.\n- Row 3 (2010): Champion is Yani Tseng.\n- Row 4 (2009): Champion is Catriona Matthew.\n- Row 5 (2008): Champion is Jiyai Shin.\n- Row 6 (2007): Champion is Lorena Ochoa.\n- Row 7 (2006): Champion is Sherri Steinhauer.\n- Row 8 (2005): Champion is Jeong Jang.\n- Row 9 (2004): Champion is Karen Stupples.\n- Row 10 (2003): Champion is Annika S\u00f6renstam.\n- Row 11 (2002): Champion is Karrie Webb.\n- Row 12 (2001): Champion is Se Ri Pak.\n\nSo, Annika S\u00f6renstam appears only in row 10 (2003), and Yani Tseng appears in rows 2 (2011) and 3 (2010). \n\nNext, I need to check the \"margin of victory\" column for these rows because that's where the strokes are mentioned. \n\nFor row 10 (Annika S\u00f6renstam):\n- Margin of victory: 1 stroke.\n\nFor row 2 and 3 (Yani Tseng):\n- Row 2: 4 strokes.\n- Row 3: 1 stroke.\n\nThe claim says both Annika and Yani won with the lowest number of strokes. But looking at their margins:\n- Annika had 1 stroke, which is low.\n- Yani in 2011 had 4 strokes, which is higher than Annika's 1, so not the lowest together.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lowest number of stroke.\" It might be interpreted as each winning with the same lowest number. Since Annika had 1, and Yani in 2010 also had 1, perhaps that's the case. But wait, row 2 (Yani Tseng) has a margin of victory of 4 strokes, not 1. So actually, only Annika S\u00f6renstam had 1 stroke, and the others have higher numbers.\n\nSo, the claim is saying both Annika and Yani won with the lowest number of strokes. But in reality, only Annika had the lowest (1 stroke), while Yani had 4 strokes in her win. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because not both of them had the lowest; only Annika did.\n\nAlternatively, if \"lowest\" refers to each having their own lowest, but that doesn't make sense because it's a comparison between two players. So, since both didn't have the same lowest (Annika had 1, others higher), the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: Need to find all rows where either Annika or Yani are champions and also extract their margin of victory.\n\nRelevant rows:\n- Row 10: Annika S\u00f6renstam, 1 stroke.\n- Row 2: Yani Tseng, 4 strokes.\n- Row 3: Yani Tseng, 1 stroke.\n\nSo, the cells involved are in columns \"champion\" and \"margin of victory\". Their row indices are 10, 2, and 3.\n\nWait, but the claim is about both Annika and Yani having the lowest. So only their relevant rows where they are champions and their margins matter.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim that \"Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng win with the lowest number of strokes\" is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Rows Where Annika S\u00f6renstam or Yani Tseng are Champions:**\n   - Annika S\u00f6renstam appears as Champion in row 10 (2003).\n   - Yani Tseng appears as Champion in rows 2 (2011) and 3 (2010).\n\n2. **Check the \"margin of victory\" for These Rows:**\n   - In row 10, Annika S\u00f6renstam's margin of victory is **1 stroke**.\n   - In row 2, Yani Tseng's margin of victory is **4 strokes**.\n   - In row 3, Yani Tseng's margin of victory is **1 stroke**.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - Annika S\u00f6renstam indeed won with the lowest number of strokes (1).\n   - However, Yani Tseng did not consistently win with the same or the lowest number of strokes in both her victories:\n     - 4 strokes in row 2.\n     - 1 stroke in row 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng won with the lowest number of strokes is **FALSE** because only Annika achieved this, and Yani's other victory had a higher margin.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For each relevant Champion (Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng), their respective \"margin of victory\" must be checked.\n   - This involves the following cells:\n     - Row 10: Columns \"champion\" and \"margin of victory\".\n     - Rows 2 and 3: Columns \"champion\" and \"margin of victory\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"Yani Tseng be the runner-up in 2008 and become the champion in 2010 and 2011.\" So I need to verify each part of this statement against the data.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the rows for 2008. In the table, the years go from 2001 to 2013. The 2008 row is the 7th one (index 6) in the data array. Let me check the \"runner (s) - up\" column for that year. It says \"yani tseng\" and another name. So she was a runner-up in 2008. That part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to see if she became champion in 2010 and 2011. Looking at the years: the 2010 row is index 3, where the champion is listed as \"yani tseng.\" The 2011 row is index 2, again with her as the champion. So both 2010 and 2011 have her as the winner.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the columns to make sure I'm looking at the right ones. The relevant columns are \"runner (s) - up\" and \"champion.\" These are both present in each row. So for 2008, runner-up is correct; for 2010 and 2011, she's the champion.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information that would make this statement false. Therefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Yani Tseng is true, I need to verify each part of the claim against the provided table. The claim has two main parts: (1) being the runner-up in 2008 and (2) becoming the champion in 2010 and 2011.\n\n### Verification for 2008:\n- **Year:** 2008\n- **Runner-up Column:** \"runner (s) - up\"\n  - The entry for 2008 is \"yani tseng hee young park.\"\n  \nYani Tseng was indeed the runner-up in 2008. This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Verification for 2010:\n- **Year:** 2010\n- **Champion Column:** \"champion\"\n  - The entry for 2010 is \"yani tseng.\"\n  \nIn 2010, Yani Tseng won, making her the champion. This part of the claim is also true.\n\n### Verification for 2011:\n- **Year:** 2011\n- **Champion Column:** \"champion\"\n  - The entry for 2011 is \"yani tseng.\"\n  \nYani Tseng was again the champion in 2011.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Se Ri Pak be the champion in 2001, then come 2nd place 2 year after.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's making two assertions. \n\n1. In 2001, Se Ri Pak was the champion.\n2. Two years after that, she came in second place.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, with various details like the champion for each event. The columns relevant here are \"year,\" \"champion,\" and perhaps \"runner(s) - up\" which might be used for the second part of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first assertion: In 2001, was Se Ri Pak the champion? I'll look through the table rows to find the year 2001. Scanning each row:\n\n- 2001 is in the sixth row from the top (index 6).\n- The \"champion\" for that year is listed as \"se ri pak.\" So the first part checks out.\n\nNext, the second assertion: Two years after 2001 would be 2003. Did Se Ri Pak come in second place that year? Looking at the row for 2003 (index 9), the \"champion\" is \"annika s\u00f6renstam.\" The \"runner(s) - up\" column lists \"se ri pak.\" So yes, in 2003, she was second.\n\nWait a minute, but 2001 + 2 years is indeed 2003. But I should double-check the exact wording of the claim: It says Se Ri Pak comes 2nd two years after being champion. So from 2001 to 2003, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as TRUE based on the provided table. \n\n- **First part**: In 2001, Se Ri Pak was the champion.\n- **Second part**: Two years later (2003), she came in second place.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2012 open with 9 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to identify what needs to be verified.\n\n1. **Event Name**: It mentions \"the 2012 open.\" Looking at the table, each row has a \"year\" column and an \"dates\" column. So I need to find the row where year is 2012.\n\n2. **Champion**: The claim says \"jiyal shin\" is the champion. I'll check the \"champion\" column in the 2012 row to see if it matches.\n\n3. **Runner-up**: It mentions \"inbee park\" as the person beaten by Shin. So I need to verify that Inbee Park was the runner-up in the 2012 Open.\n\n4. **Score Difference (Margin of Victory)**: The claim states a margin of victory, which is typically denoted by the \"margin of victory\" column. It says 9 strokes, so I'll look for this value in the relevant row.\n\nNow, I'll go through each step methodically.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the 2012 Open Row**\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"year\" value. The second row (index 1) is 2012 because the years go from 2013 down to 2001. So row index 1 corresponds to the 2012 event.\n\n**Step 2: Check Champion's Name**\n\nIn the data row for 2012, the champion is listed as \"jiyai shin\" (corrected spelling from claim). The table shows \"jiyai shin,\" so this matches.\n\n**Step 3: Verify Runner-up**\n\nThe claim says Inbee Park was beaten. Looking at the data, in the same 2012 row, under \"runner (s) - up\" it lists \"inbee park.\" So that's correct.\n\n**Step 4: Check Margin of Victory**\n\nThe margin is stated as \"9 strokes.\" The table cell for the 2012 Open shows \"- 9\" and the column name \"margin of victory\" which translates to a 9-stroke lead. This matches the claim.\n\nPutting it all together, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36517 more than yani tseng in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's comparing two players from different years\u2014jiyal (or maybe a typo for Jiyai) Shin in 2012 and Yani Tseng in 2011. The key points are the year of each player and their earnings difference.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's organized with various columns like year, dates, venue, champion, country, score, etc. So I need to find where these specific players and years fit.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data array since they represent different years:\n\n1. **2013**: Stacy Lewis won.\n2. **2012**: Jiyai Shin won.\n3. **2011**: Yani Tseng won.\n4. **2010**: Yani Tseng won again, but in 2010.\n5. And so on down to 2001.\n\nThe claim is about Jiyal Shin in 2012 and Yani Tseng in 2011. So I'm looking for rows where year is 2012 and the champion is Jiyai Shin, and another row where the year is 2011 and the champion is Yani Tseng.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- In **2012**, the champion is \"jiyai shin\" with a score of 279. The winner's share was 2,750,000.\n- In **2011**, the champion is \"yani tseng\" with a score of 272. Her winner's share was 4,025,83.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions the difference in their earnings: 36,517 more by Jiyal Shin over Yani Tseng. However, I need to check how the scores and shares relate to the actual earnings.\n\nLooking at the columns, \"score\" is probably the points or score achieved, not necessarily the earnings. The column called \"winner's share\" seems more related to prize money won. So for each of their years:\n\n- In 2012: Jiyai Shin's winner's share was 2,750,000.\n- In 2011: Yani Tseng's winner's share was 4,025,83.\n\nWait, but the numbers in the table are like 2750000 and 402583. So perhaps there's a formatting issue. For example, 2750000 is 2,750,000, and 402583 is 402,583.\n\nNow, the claim states that Jiyal Shin earned 36,517 more than Yani Tseng in 2011. But looking at their prize money:\n\nIn 2012: 2,750,000\nIn 2011: 402,583\n\nSo, Jiyal Shin's 2012 earnings are way higher than Yani's 2011 earnings. The difference would be much more than 36,517.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the claim is about 2012 vs 2011, but the data shows that in 2012, Jiyai won 2,750,000, and in 2011, Yani won 402,583. The difference is 2,750,000 - 402,583 = 2,347,417, which is much larger than 36,517.\n\nSo the claim's figure of 36,517 doesn't align with the actual data. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the columns.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the \"margin of victory\" or \"score\" relates to points that could affect earnings, but in most tournaments, prize money is separate from points earned towards rankings. So unless it's a specific tournament where the difference in points leads to higher prize money, which isn't evident here.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, Jiyal Shin won 2,750,000 in 2012 and Yani Tseng won 402,583 in 2011. The difference is over 2 million, not around 36k. So the claim seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with the names? Let me double-check the table:\n\n- In row for 2012: Champion is \"jiyai shin\".\n- In 2011: Champion is \"yani tseng\".\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim's figure of 36,517 doesn't match. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where Jiyal Shin (2012) and Yani Tseng (2011) are champions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew win with the lowest number of stroke.\" Hmm, wait, I think it's supposed to be \"lowest number of strokes\" because you can't have a negative number of strokes.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row for Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew and see their scores. Let me start by going through each row one by one.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the \"champion\" column is either Annika S\u00f6renstam or Catriona Matthew. \n\nStarting from 2003: The champion is Annika S\u00f6renstam. The \"to par\" column here says \"-10\". But wait, to par is a score term in golf, right? So \"-10\" would mean she was 10 strokes below par. That's the lowest I've seen so far.\n\nNext, looking for Catriona Matthew: In 2009, the champion is Catriona Matthew. Her \"to par\" is \"-3\". That's better than some others but not the lowest. \n\nWait, are there any other rows where Annika or Catriona are champions? Let me check:\n\n- 2003: Annika, -10\n- 2009: Catriona, -3\nAny others? Let me see.\n\nNo, I think that's it. So Annika has the lowest number of strokes with -10 in 2003, and Catriona has -3. The claim says both of them won with the lowest number of strokes. But since only Annika achieved the lowest, not Catriona, that makes the claim false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does \"lowest number of stroke\" mean the most negative, or the least? In golf, lower scores are better, so -10 is better than -3. So both Annika and Catriona didn't have the lowest; only Annika did. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not both of them.\n\nI need to find which cells are relevant. The \"to par\" column for Annika in 2003 is -10, so that's row 6 (since starting from 0). So the columns would be \"year\", \"champion\", and \"to par\". Or wait, actually, maybe just \"to par\" because that's where the strokes are listed.\n\nWait, let me check the claim again. It says they win with the lowest number of stroke, so I think it refers to their performance in the tournament, which is \"to par.\" So relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Annika S\u00f6renstam: row 6 (2003), \"to par\" column.\n\nFor Catriona Matthew: row 4 (2009), \"to par\" column.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include both their rows and columns. But since the claim is false because only Annika had the lowest, I need to mark those cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew won with the lowest number of strokes. Examining the table:\n\n- Annika S\u00f6renstam's best performance was in 2003 (-10 strokes).\n- Catriona Matthew's best performance was -3 strokes.\n\nSince only Annika achieved the lowest, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The row for 2008 has \"yani tseng\" as the runner-up and the champion is \"jiyai shin.\" So yes, that's correct\u2014Karrie isn't even the runner-up there.\n\nNow checking the years 2010 and 2011 to see if she was the champion. In 2010, the champion is \"yani tseng,\" not Karrie. In 2011, it's \"brittany lang.\" So she didn't win in those years either. \n\nSo the claim has two issues: she wasn't runner-up in 2008 and wasn't a champion in 2010 or 2011. Therefore, the entire statement is false.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For each incorrect part, I'll list the row index and column name.\n\nIn 2008, Karrie wasn't the runner-up\u2014so row 6 (since it's zero-indexed as per the example), \"runner (s) - up.\" And in 2010 and 2011, she didn't win, so row indices 3 and 4 for \"champion.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"Se Ri Pak be the champion in 2001, then come 2nd place 2 year after.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific instances related to Se Ri Pak:\n\n1. She was the champion (winner) in 2001.\n2. Two years after that, she came in second place.\n\nI need to check both of these points against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different year, and each column has details like \"champion,\" \"runner(s)-up,\" etc. So I should focus on the columns relevant to this claim: \"champion\" and \"runner (s) - up.\"\n\nStarting with 2001. I'll search through the table for the row corresponding to 2001. Scanning each row:\n\n- 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001.\n\nYes, there's a row for 2001. Let me check that row:\n\nIn the 2001 row:\n- Year: 2001\n- Champion: Se Ri Pak\n\nPerfect, that matches the first part of the claim. So the champion in 2001 was indeed Se Ri Pak.\n\nNow, the second part says she came in second place two years after 2001. That would be in 2003. Let's check the 2003 row.\n\nIn the 2003 row:\n- Year: 2003\n- Champion: Annika S\u00f6renstam\n- Runner(s) - up: Se Ri Pak\n\nWait, so in 2003, Se Ri Pak was the runner-up, which is second place. That matches the claim that two years after her victory (2001), she came in second place.\n\nSo both conditions are met:\n1. She was champion in 2001.\n2. She finished second in 2003, two years later.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we check the table for Se Ri Pak's performance in 2001 and 2003. In 2001, she won, and in 2003, she was runner-up. Both conditions are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first: \"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2010 open with 9 stroke.\"\n\nOkay, let me parse this. The key points are:\n\n1. **Jiyal Shin** is the champion.\n2. **Inbee Park** was beaten.\n3. This happened in the **2010 Open**.\n4. The margin of victory was **9 strokes**.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The columns relevant here would be year, dates, champion, country, and margin of victory.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a 2010 row where Jiyal Shin is the champion against Inbee Park with a 9-stroke win.\n\nLet me go through each row in the data:\n\n- **Row 3 (2010)**: \n  - Champion: Yani Tseng\n  - No mention of Jiyal Shin or Inbee Park here. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the name. The claim says \"jiyal shin,\" but looking at the table, it's spelled \"jiyai shin\" in 2012 and 2008, etc. Could there be a typo? Or perhaps Jiyal Shin is another name for Jiyai Shin?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check all rows to see if any mention of either Jiyal Shin or Inbee Park in the champion's column around 2010.\n\nLooking at the years:\n\n- **2009**: Champion is Catriona Matthew\n- **2010**: Champion is Yani Tseng\n- **2011**: Champion is Yani Tseng\n- **2012**: Champion is Jiyai Shin\n\nWait, in row 1 (2012), the champion is Jiyai Shin. But the claim refers to 2010, so that's a different year.\n\nIn the 2010 row (row 3), the champion is Yani Tseng, not Jiyal Shin or Inbee Park.\n\nNow, checking for Inbee Park: I see in row 1 (2012) and row 0 (2013) she was the runner-up. But in 2010, she wasn't the champion. The claim says Jiyal Shin beat Inbee Park in 2010. However, from the table:\n\n- In 2010, the champion is Yani Tseng.\n- In 2012, Jiyai Shin won against Inbee Park with a 9-stroke margin.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me check the margin of victory column for 2012. It says \"9 strokes\" in row 1 (2012). So, in 2012, Jiyai Shin defeated Inbee Park by 9 strokes. But the claim refers to 2010, not 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the 2010 Open was won by Yani Tseng, not Jiyal Shin, and the 9-stroke victory happened in 2012.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"in 2012, jiyal shin earn 36517 less than yani tseng in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what's being asked. It mentions two golf players: Jiyai Shin and Yani Tseng. The time frame is 2012 for Jiyai Shin and 2011 for Yani Tseng. The comparison is about earnings, specifically that Jiyai Shin earned $36,517 less than Yani Tseng in 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, with various details like dates, venue, champion, country, score, etc., including the \"purse\" which likely refers to the total prize money or earnings. \n\nI need to find the relevant rows for both Jiyai Shin and Yani Tseng in 2012 and 2011 respectively.\n\nStarting with Jiyai Shin in 2012: I'll scan through each row where the year is 2012. There's only one such row, which is the second entry in the data array (index 1). The champion here is \"jiyai shin\" and the purse is 2750000.\n\nNext, for Yani Tseng in 2011: I'll look at rows where the year is 2011. There are two entries: index 2 and index 3. Wait, index 2 is 2011 with champion Yani Tseng, purse 402583, but that's actually correct? No, wait, no\u2014looking again, index 2 is 2011, champion is \"yani tseng\", purse 402583. But wait, in the table, I see that row 2 (index 1) is 2012 with jiyai shin and purse 2750000. So for 2011, it's row 3 (index 2), which has champion \"yani tseng\" and purse 402583.\n\nWait no, let me count the rows again: The first entry is 2013, then 2012 at index 1, 2011 at index 2, etc. So for 2011, it's row 2 (index 2), with champion \"yani tseng\" and purse 402583.\n\nSo in 2012, Jiyai Shin earned $2,750,000. In 2011, Yani Tseng earned $402,583.\n\nThe claim says that in 2012, Jiyai Shin earned $36,517 less than Yani Tseng in 2011. So I need to subtract the amounts: 402,583 - 2,750,000 = negative number, which doesn't make sense because Jiyai Shin actually earned more.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Jiyal Shin earn 36517 less,\" so perhaps it's a typo and should be $36,517. Wait no, maybe I got the direction wrong. The claim is that in 2012, Jiyai Shin earned less than Yani Tseng in 2011, meaning Jiyai's purse was lower.\n\nBut looking at the numbers: Jiyai Shin (2012) = $2,750,000 and Yani Tseng (2011) = $402,583. So Jiyai earned way more than Yani in 2011, so the claim is false because she didn't earn less but more.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check again. The first row is 2013, then 2012 at index 1: yes, that's correct. So Jiyai Shin in 2012 earned $2,750,000 and Yani Tseng in 2011 earned $402,583.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Jiyai Shin actually earned more than Yani Tseng two years prior.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2012, Jiyai Shin earned $36,517 less than Yani Tseng in 2011. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- **Jiyai Shin in 2012**: Her purse was $2,750,000 (row index 1).\n- **Yani Tseng in 2011**: Her purse was $402,583 (row index 2).\n\nSince $2,750,000 is significantly higher than $402,583, Jiyai Shin earned more than Yani Tseng. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"purse\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"purse\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
