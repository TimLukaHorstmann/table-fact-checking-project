    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the episode nut in season 7, written by amy iglow, have 7.19 million us viewers.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to each column in the table. Let me list out the columns again to make sure: series, season, title, written by, original air date, us viewers (millions).\n\nThe claim mentions an episode called \"nut\" in season 7. So I need to find the row where series is 74, because season 7's first episode starts at 74 and goes up, but looking at the table, each entry increments the series number by 1 each time, so 74 would be season 7.\n\nLooking at row 73 (since indexing starts at 0), the series is 74. The title there is \"nuts.\" So that's a match for \"nut\" in season 7, but wait, the claim says \"nut,\" which might be a shorter version or a typo? Or perhaps it's correct as \"nuts.\" I think it's acceptable as the claim uses \"nut\" and the title is \"nuts.\"\n\nNext, the claim mentions the episode was written by amy iglow. Looking at row 74 (since series 74 is in row index 73), the writer is listed as \"amy iglow.\" That matches.\n\nThen, regarding the viewers, the claim states 7.19 million. In the table for series 74, which is row index 73, the us viewers are 7.19 million. So that's correct too.\n\nI need to verify each part step by step. \n\n1. Series number: The claim says \"episode nut in season 7.\" Season 7 would correspond to series numbers starting at 74 and ending at 80-something. Looking at row index 73 (series 74), yes, that's season 7.\n\n2. Title: The title is listed as \"nuts,\" which the claim refers to as \"nut.\" It could be a variation in naming, but for the purposes of this check, it seems acceptable as both refer to the same episode.\n\n3. Written by: The writer's name matches \"amy iglow.\"\n\n4. Viewers: 7.19 million is exactly what's listed in that row.\n\nSo all conditions are met. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's an episode titled \"nut\" in season 7, written by Amy Iglow, with 7.19 million viewers. \n\n- **Series**: Looking for series number corresponding to season 7. Season 7 starts at series 74 (row index 73).\n- **Title**: The title is listed as \"nuts,\" which aligns with the claim's reference.\n- **Writer**: The writer is Amy Iglow, matching the claim.\n- **Viewers**: The viewers for that episode are indeed 7.19 million.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the episode that be written by jeff astrof and matt goldman be name scream.\" Wait, there are some grammatical issues here, like \"that be\" which should probably be \"that are\" or \"that is.\" Maybe it's a typo. But regardless, I need to check if an episode is written by both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman and is titled \"Scream.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with several columns: series, season, title, written by, original air date, and US viewers. The claim mentions two specific things: the writers (Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman) and the episode's title (\"Scream\").\n\nI should check each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Jeff Astrof is one of the writers, but only in combination with others. The title is \"Bahamian Rhapsody (Part 2).\" No match.\n- Row 1: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer are the writers. Title is \"Burning Love.\" Not matching.\n- Row 2: Jack Burditt is the writer. Title is \"The Mole.\" Not a match.\n- Row 3: Allan Rice is the writer. Title is \"For Love or Money.\" No.\n- Row 4: Frank Pines wrote it. Title is \"Doctor Little Man.\" Nope.\n- Row 5: Matt Goldman is one of the writers, but title is \"The Curious Case of Britney B.\" Not \"Scream.\"\n- Row 6: Amy Iglow wrote it. Title is \"Nuts.\" No.\n- Row 7: Jeff Astrof wrote it alone. Title is \"Love Means Never Having to Say You're Crazy.\" Not matching.\n- Row 8: Jack Burditt wrote it. Title is \"I Love Woo, I Hate You.\" Not a match.\n- Row 9: Frank Pines wrote it. Title is \"Old Christine Meets Young Frankenstein.\" No.\n- Row 10: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer wrote it. Title is \"It's Beginning to Stink a Lot Like Christmas.\" Not matching.\n- Row 11: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer wrote it. Title is \"Whale of a Tale.\" No.\n- Row 12: Jack Burditt wrote it. Title is \"Truth or Dare.\" Not a match.\n- Row 13: Jeff Astrof wrote it. Title is \"A Family Unfair.\" No.\n- Row 14: Frank Pines wrote it. Title is \"Sweet Charity.\" Nope.\n- Row 15: Amy Iglow & Allan Rice wrote it. Title is \"Subway, Somehow.\" Not matching.\n- Row 16: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer wrote it. Title is \"Up in the Airport.\" No.\n- Row 17: Tricia O'Kelly & Alex Kapp Horner wrote it. Title is \"Revenge Makeover.\" Not a match.\n- Row 18: Jack Burditt wrote it. Title is \"I Love What You Do for Me.\" Nope.\n- Row 19: Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman wrote it. Title is \"Scream.\" Oh, this seems to fit! So, row index 19 has the writers as Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman, and the title is \"Scream.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's an episode where both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman wrote it, and its title is \"Scream.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns are \"written by\" and \"title,\" so for row 19, I should include both.\n\nI also need to check if the writers are indeed listed as Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman in that row. Looking back at row 19: yes, under \"written by\" it's Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman. The title is \"Scream.\" So this row fully supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"title\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}]}",

Let me read through the claim again: \"Frank pine write sweet charity , which have 5.56 million viewer in the us.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main things: Frank Pine writing \"Sweet Charity\" and that show having 5.56 million US viewers.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different episode or series with various attributes like series number, season, title, writer(s), original air date, and US viewers in millions. \n\nI need to find if there's an entry where the title is \"Sweet Charity\" and the writer is Frank Pine. Then, check if the US viewers are approximately 5.56 million.\n\nStarting with the title: I'll go through each row to see which one has \"Sweet Charity.\" Scanning the data... \n\nRow 13 (index 12) has series number 82, season 13, and the title is \"sweet charity.\" So that's a match for the show's title. The writers listed are Frank Pines, so that matches as well. The viewers for this row are 5.56 million, which aligns with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"Amy Iglow write the episode nut and it gain 6 million viewer.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: \n1. Amy Iglow wrote the episode titled \"nut.\"\n2. This episode gained 6 million viewers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details like series, season, title, written by, original air date, and US viewers in millions. My goal is to check both statements against this data.\n\nStarting with the first part: Amy Iglow wrote the episode \"nut.\" I'll scan through each row's \"written by\" column. The rows are numbered from 0 to 18 (since there are 19 episodes). \n\nLooking at row_index 3, the title is \"nuts,\" and the writer is \"amy iglow.\" Wait, the claim says \"nut,\" but in the table it's \"nuts.\" So that might be a discrepancy. Let me double-check: row 74 has series 74, season 8, title \"nuts,\" written by amy iglow. So it's plural, \"nuts.\" The claim uses singular, \"nut.\" Does this matter? Yes, because the titles are specific, so \"nut\" is different from \"nuts.\"\n\nNext, checking if the viewers for that episode were around 6 million. Row 74 has us viewers as 7.19 million. So it's more than 6 million but not exactly 6. The claim says it \"gain 6 million viewer,\" which is approximate. But since it's over 6 million, maybe it's close enough? Or perhaps the exact number matters.\n\nWait, another thought: the user might be referring to an episode titled \"nut.\" In the table, I don't see any other episodes written by Amy Iglow with the title \"nut\" besides row 74. So that's a single match, but the title is \"nuts,\" not \"nut.\"\n\nAlso, the viewers for row 74 are 7.19 million, which isn't exactly 6 million. So even if the title was matching, the number of viewers doesn't align. Therefore, both parts of the claim don't fully hold.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering other rows. Let me check again: Amy Iglow is listed as the writer for row 74 (\"nuts\") and row 3? Wait, no, looking at row 3: it's \"for love or money\" written by Allan Rice. So only row 74 has Amy Iglow as the writer with series 74, season 8, title \"nuts.\"\n\nSo, summarizing: \n- Amy Iglow wrote \"nuts,\" not \"nut.\" \n- The viewers for that episode are 7.19 million, not exactly 6 million.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n]}",

The claim says: \"the episode that be written by jeff astrof and matt goldman be name scream.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to check each condition against the table.\n\n1. **Check for episodes written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman**: Looking at the 'written by' column, I need to find any row where both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman are listed as writers.\n\n2. **Check if such an episode is named \"Scream\"**: Once I identify the rows where both are writers, I'll look at the 'title' column to see if the episode's title matches \"Scream.\"\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to find relevant data.\n\n- **Row 0**: Jeff Astrof alone.\n- **Row 1**: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer.\n- **Row 2**: Jack Burditt.\n- **Row 3**: Allan Rice.\n- **Row 4**: Frank Pines.\n- **Row 5**: Matt Goldman alone.\n- **Row 6**: Amy Iglow.\n- **Row 7**: Jeff Astrof alone.\n- **Row 8**: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer.\n- **Row 9**: Jack Burditt.\n- **Row 10**: Frank Pines.\n- **Row 11**: Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman. Here's a match for both writers.\n  \nNow, I'll check the title of this row (row index 11). The title is \"scream.\" \n\nWait, the claim says \"Scream\" with an uppercase 'S', but in the table, it's written as lowercase \"scream\". Does case sensitivity matter? In data tables, titles are often case-sensitive. But sometimes they might be stored with inconsistent casing. However, looking at other rows, like row 6, I see that the title is \"the curious case of britney b,\" so maybe it's just that way. So the title here is indeed \"scream.\"\n\nTherefore, there's an episode written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman named \"scream.\" The claim seems correct.\n\nWait another thing: in the 'title' column for row 11, it's written as \"scream\" with lowercase 's.' But the claim uses \"Scream.\" Does this matter? It might. If case sensitivity is important, then \"scream\" doesn't match \"Scream.\" So perhaps the title isn't exactly as claimed.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim says: \"the episode that be written by jeff astrof and matt goldman be name scream.\" So they're claiming it's named \"scream,\" but in the table, it's lowercase. Maybe it's a typo or case doesn't matter? I'm not sure.\n\nBut looking at other rows, titles are sometimes properly capitalized. For example, row 0: \"bahamian rhapsody (part 2)\" starts with uppercase B. So maybe the title here should be \"Scream,\" but in the table, it's lowercase.\n\nWait no, looking at row 87, which is row index 87: The title is \"scream\" as well? Let me check:\n\nNo, wait, row 11 is index 11, right? Wait, the rows are from 0 to 87. So row 11 (index 11) has title \"i love woo , i hate you.\" No, that's not the one.\n\nWait, let me correct myself. I think I got confused with indices. Let me list out the rows properly.\n\nLooking back, the table is an array of arrays. The first element is row index 0, then 1, up to 87.\n\nLooking for Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman together: It's in row index 87? Wait no. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 11: title \"i love woo , i hate you\" \u2013 writers are Jack Burditt.\n- Row 12: Frank Pines.\n- Row 13: Jeff Astrof alone.\n- Row 14: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer.\n- Row 15: Matt Goldman alone? No, looking at the table, row 15 is index 87. Wait no, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the 'written by' column:\n\nLooking for Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman together. The relevant row is where both are listed as writers.\n\nFrom the table provided, let's list out each row's 'written by':\n\nRow 0: Jeff Astrof\nRow 1: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer\nRow 2: Jack Burditt\nRow 3: Allan Rice\nRow 4: Frank Pines\nRow 5: Matt Goldman\nRow 6: Amy Iglow\nRow 7: Jeff Astrof\nRow 8: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer\nRow 9: Jack Burditt\nRow 10: Frank Pines\nRow 11: Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman\n\nWait, no. Wait the table is from row 0 to 87. Let me check each 'written by' entry:\n\nLooking at each row in the 'written by' column:\n\n- Row 0: [\"Jeff Astrof\"]\n- Row 1: [\"Sherry Bilsing-Graham\", \"Ellen Kreamer\"]\n- ...\n- Row 11: Maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check all rows. Let me count from 0 to, say, 15:\n\nRow 0: Jeff Astrof\nRow 1: Sherry & Ellen\nRow 2: Jack Burditt\nRow 3: Allan Rice\nRow 4: Frank Pines\nRow 5: Matt Goldman\nRow 6: Amy Iglow\nRow 7: Jeff Astrof\nRow 8: Sherry & Ellen\nRow 9: Jack Burditt\nRow 10: Frank Pines\nRow 11: Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman?\n\nWait, I think in row 11, the 'written by' is [\"Jeff Astrof\", \"Matt Goldman\"]. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, row index 11 has both writers. Then, check the title for this row. Looking at the table:\n\nRow 11: title is \"scream.\" Wait no, actually, in the data provided earlier, perhaps I confused rows.\n\nWait the user wrote the table as a JSON array of arrays. Let me look at it again:\n\nThe 'title' column has entries like:\n[\n  \"bahamian rhapsody (part 2)\",\n  ...\n  \"scream\",\n  ...\n]\n\nYes, so row index 11's title is \"scream.\" Therefore, the episode written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman is indeed titled \"scream.\"\n\nSo the claim says: \"the episode that be written by jeff astrof and matt goldman be name scream.\" The grammar in the claim has some issues (\"that be\" should be \"that is\"), but the content is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down the claim first: \"the incredible writer who gains 5.56 million viewers be none other than jack burditt.\" \n\nHmm, let's parse that. The claim seems to suggest that a particular writer, identified by having 5.56 million viewers, is Jack Burditt. So I need to look for the cell where the \"us viewers (millions)\" column equals 5.56 and see who the corresponding \"written by\" is.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: series, season, title, written by, original air date, and us viewers. The data starts from series 68 up to 87 across various seasons.\n\nI should go through each row and check where the viewers are exactly 5.56 million. Let me scan through:\n\n- Row 0: Viewers 7.17\n- Row1: 6.65\n- Row2:6.86\n- Row3:6.99\n- Row4:6.58\n- Row5:6.68\n- Row6:7.19\n- Row7:7.27\n- Row8:7.01\n- Row9:7.49\n- Row10:5.97\n- Row11:6.21\n- Row12:8.1\n- Row13:5.56 \u2192 Here we go, this is the row where viewers are 5.56 million.\n- Then, continuing to check if other rows have 5.56, but I think it's only once.\n\nSo for row 13 (which is index 13 in the data array), the viewers are 5.56. Now looking at the \"written by\" column for this row: it says \"frank pines\". Wait, so if someone gains 5.56 million viewers, according to the table, it's Frank Pines who wrote that episode.\n\nNow, checking Jack Burditt: I know from the data that Jack Burditt is associated with several rows, like row2, row8, row14, etc. But in row13, the writer is Frank Pines, not Jack Burditt.\n\nSo the claim says \"the incredible writer who gains 5.56 million viewers is none other than Jack Burditt.\" But according to the table, it's Frank Pines who has 5.56 million viewers. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something? Let me double-check. In row13, the data is:\n\n[\n  82,\n  15,\n  \"sweet charity\",\n  \"frank pines\",\n  \"march 3 , 2010\",\n  5.56\n]\n\nYes, that's correct.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the episode by Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice be named 'Scream' and gain 6.29 million view.\" Okay, so I need to check two things here\u2014whether there's an episode with the exact name \"Scream\" written by both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice, and whether its viewership was 6.29 million.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: series, season, title, written by, original air date, and US viewers in millions. My goal is to find a row where the \"written by\" field includes both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice, the \"title\" is \"Scream,\" and the \"us viewers (millions)\" is 6.29.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 0: Title is Bahamian Rhapsody (Part 2), writers are Kari Lizer & Jeff Astrof. Not both, so skip.\n\nRow 1: Title is Burning Love, writers Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer. Nope.\n\nRow 2: Title The Mole, writer Jack Burditt.

Oh wait, Matt is here instead of Allan Rice. So the episode \"Scream\" is written by Jeff and Matt, not Jeff and Allan.\n\nFinally, row 20: Scream again? No, it's just Jeff this time. Or wait, no\u2014it's Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman again. But looking at the data, row 87 has the title \"scream\" with writers Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman. The viewers for that episode are 6.29 million.\n\nBut in the claim, they mention both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice as writers. From the table, I don't see any row where the title is \"Scream\" and the writers include both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice. Instead, it's either one or the other but not both together for that specific episode.\n\nSo the claim seems to mix up the writers and there's no exact match where both are involved with \"Scream.\" Also, the viewership of 6.29 is correct because row 87 has that number, but since the writers don't include Allan Rice, the claim is partially wrong.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}]}",
