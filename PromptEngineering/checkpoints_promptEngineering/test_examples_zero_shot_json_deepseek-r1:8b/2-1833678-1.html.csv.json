    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"evita be nominated for a tony award and a drama desk award in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions two specific awards: Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, both in 2012, for the work \"Evita.\" The key here is to check if \"Evita\" was indeed nominated for these awards that year.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, award, category, nominated work, result. Each row represents an instance where someone or something was awarded or nominated.\n\nI'll start by filtering the data for the year 2012. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 19: [2012, \"tony award\", \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical\", \"evita\", \"nominated\"]\n- Row 20: [2012, \"drama desk award\", \"outstanding featured actor in a musical\", \"evita\", \"nominated\"]\n\nSo both the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award are listed as \"nominated\" for Evita in 2012. That matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other row for 2012 that contradicts this or provides additional info. From the table, rows after 20 don't have any more entries for 2012. So only two relevant rows: 19 and 20.\n\nTherefore, both awards were nominated, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant cells in the table for the year 2012 and the specific awards mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"in 2012 evita be nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the data provided in the table. The table has columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions the year 2012, so I should focus on rows where the year is 2012. Scanning through the data, I see that there's one row with year 2012:\n\n[\n  2012,\n  \"tony award\",\n  \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical\",\n  \"evita\",\n  \"nominated\"\n]\n\nSo this row is relevant because it's in 2012 and mentions \"evita\" as the nominated work.\n\nNext, I need to check if the claim mentions \"evita.\" The claim says \"evita be nominate,\" which seems to mean that Evita was nominated. In the table, the column for result is either \"nominated\" or \"won.\" In this 2012 row, the result is \"nominated,\" so that aligns with the claim.\n\nThe award in question is the TONY AWARD, and the category is \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical.\" The claim doesn't specify which award, but since it's about being nominated, the relevant columns here are year (2012), award (\"tony award\"), category (\"best performance by a featured actor in a musical\"), and result (\"nominated\").\n\nSo, the row is at index 12 (since rows start at 0, right? Let me count: the first row is index 0, so yes, the 2012 row is at index 11. Wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the data array, each entry is an array. The 2012 entry is the last one in the list. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\nThe first four rows are from 1993.\n\nThen 2004 has two entries (rows 4 and 5).\n\n2006 has four entries (rows 6-9).\n\n2007 has five entries (rows 10-14? Wait, let me recount. The data starts at index 0 with 1993, then each row is a separate entry.\n\nWait, the data array is as follows:\n\n0: 1993, tony award...\n\n1: 1993, drama league...\n\n2: 1993, outer critics circle...\n\n3: 1993, theatre world...\n\n4: 2004, tony award...\n\n5: 2004, outer critics...\n\n6: 2006, tony award...\n\n7: 2006, drama desk...\n\n8: 2006, drama league...\n\n9: 2006, outer critics...\n\n10: 2007, drama league...\n\n11: 2007, tony award...\n\n12: 2007, drama desk...\n\n13: 2007, drama league...\n\n14: 2007, outer critics...\n\n15: 2012, tony award...\n\n16: 2012, drama desk...\n\nSo the 2012 entries are rows 15 and 16. Wait no, looking back, the data has 17 rows because each entry is a separate array in data.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\n- 1993: 4 entries (rows 0-3)\n- 2004: 2 entries (4-5)\n- 2006: 4 entries (6-9)\n- 2007: 5 entries (10-14)\n- 2012: 2 entries (15-16)\n\nYes, so the 2012 entries are rows 15 and 16.\n\nSo row 15 is:\n\n[\n  2012,\n  \"tony award\",\n  \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical\",\n  \"evita\",\n  \"nominated\"\n]\n\nThis matches the claim. So this row has all the relevant information: year=2012, award=tony award, category=best performance..., work=evita, result=nominated.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 15 (index 15) and columns: year, award, category, and result.\n\nSo in the output, I need to include these four cells as relevant. Each cell is identified by its row index and column name.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2012, \"evita\" was nominated for \"outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" Checking the table, the 2012 entry shows \"evita\" was indeed nominated for the TONY AWARD in that category. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"evita be nominate work after 2006 , that be award the outer critic circle award and the outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" Translating this into English, it seems to say that \"Evita\" was nominated for an award after 2006, specifically from the Outer Critics Circle Award and for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The columns are year, award, category, nominated work, result. I need to find any row where the nominated work is \"evita,\" the award is either \"outer critics circle award\" or related to outstanding featured actor, and the year is after 2006.\n\nLet me scan through each data row:\n\nStarting from the top, most rows are from 1993, 2004, 2006. Let's check the last few years relevant to after 2006.\n\nLooking for \"evita\" in the 'nominated work' column:\n\n- In 2012, there's a row where:\n  - year: 2012\n  - award: tony award\n  - category: best performance by a featured actor in a musical\n  - nominated work: evita\n  - result: nominated\n\nSo \"evita\" was indeed nominated in 2012.\n\nNow, check if it received the Outer Critics Circle Award and Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical. Looking at this row:\n\n- The award here is Tony Award, not Outer Critics Circle Award.\n- The category is best performance by a featured actor, which might relate to Outstanding Featured Actor, but in the table, for 2012, the result is \"nominated,\" so it didn't win.\n\nWait, but the claim says that evita was awarded both the outer critics circle award and outstanding featured actor. From the table, I see that in 2012, evita was only nominated for Tony Award and Outstanding Featured Actor (from drama desk), not the Outer Critics Circle. So did it win any?\n\nLooking at other years after 2006 for \"evita\":\n\n- In 2012, as mentioned, it's only a nomination.\n\nI don't see any row where evita won both awards in question. The claim says that after 2006, evita was the nominee work and that it was awarded both Outer Critics Circle Award and Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical. But from the table, there's no indication of evita winning either of these awards post-2006.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at 2012 rows again:\n\nThere are two entries for 2012:\n1. Tony Award, best performance by featured actor, evita, nominated\n2. Drama Desk Award, outstanding featured actor, evita, nominated\n\nNo Outer Critics Circle Award mentioned here. So the claim is that evita was awarded both, but according to the table, it's only a nomination.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"evita\" won both the Outer Critics Circle Award and Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical after 2006, but the table shows evita was only nominated without winning either award.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the who 's tommy / sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street be the nominated work , nominate for the drama league award after 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two works: \"The Who's Tommy\" and \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\" These are to be the nominated works, specifically for the Drama League Award, after the year 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that \"The Who's Tommy\" is listed in multiple rows with award results. For example, in 1993, it was nominated for several awards including Drama League Award as a nominated work. However, when searching for \"Sweeney Todd,\" I find entries under the year 2006 where it was also nominated for various awards but not specifically the Drama League Award until after 2007.\n\nIn 2007 and onwards, there's no record of \"Sweeney Todd\" being nominated for the Drama League Award. The relevant entries after 2007 are for other works like \"King Lear,\" \"LoveMusik,\" and \"Evita.\" None of these pertain to \"Sweeney Todd.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while \"The Who's Tommy\" was indeed a nominated work for the Drama League Award in 1993, it doesn't hold true for \"Sweeney Todd\" after 2007.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result. Each row represents a different award or nomination. My goal is to find any rows that match all parts of the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the award (Drama League Award), the year (2006), and the nominated work (\"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\"). So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where the award is \"Drama League Award,\" the year is 2006, and the nominated work is exactly as mentioned.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the data, I notice that in 2006, several awards are listed for \"Sweeney Todd.\" One of them is the Drama League Award. Let me check the columns more carefully.\n\nRow 5: 2006, Drama League Award, distinguished performance, Sweeney Todd..., nominated. Wait, no, actually looking at the table data, I think row 4 is for 2006. Wait, let me recount. The first entry is 1993, then 2004, and then 2006 starts around row 5 onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure this more clearly. Let's list out all entries for 2006:\n\nRow 8: 2006, Drama League Award, distinguished performance, Sweeney Todd..., nominated.\nRow 9: 2006, Drama Desk Award, outstanding actor in musical, Sweeney Todd..., nominated.\nRow 10: 2006, Drama League Award, distinguished performance, Sweeney Todd..., nominated.\nRow 11: 2006, Outer Critics Circle Award, outstanding actor in musical, Sweeney Todd..., nominated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me see the exact rows:\n\nLooking at the data array, each sub-array is a row. So for 2006, the relevant rows are index 5 to 11? Wait no, let's recount:\n\nThe table starts with 1993 entries, then 2004 entries, and then 2006 entries.\n\nSo, the first row is 1993, then second 1993, etc., up to four rows for 1993. Then comes 2004, which has four rows (indices 5-8), then 2006 with six rows (indices 9-14). So in 2006, looking at each row:\n\nRow 9: 2006, \"drama league award\", \"distinguished performance\", \"sweeney todd...\", \"nominated\"\n\nSo, the award is Drama League Award, year is 2006, and the nominated work is \"sweeney todd...\" with \"nominated\" as result.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's stated that Sweeney Todd was \"nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\" So this seems to match row 9, which is index 9 (since rows start at 0). Wait no: let me count from the top:\n\nThe first four entries are 1993. Then four entries for 2004 (indices 5-8), then six entries for 2006 (indices 9-14).\n\nSo row 9 would be index 9, which is 2006, Drama League Award, distinguished performance, Sweeney Todd..., nominated.\n\nYes, that matches all criteria: award is \"Drama League Award,\" year is 2006, and the work is \"Sweeney Todd...\" with result \"nominated.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's a row in the table where all these conditions are met. So I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be 'year', 'award', and 'nominated work.' But wait, the claim refers to two specific points: the award name, the year, and the result (implicitly as it's about being nominated). So I should look for those three aspects.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has all five columns. The relevant cells are the ones that match the claim's criteria. Since the claim is specifically about \"nominated,\" we don't need to check the 'result' column beyond ensuring it says \"nominated.\" But perhaps the columns involved are year, award, and nominated work.\n\nAlternatively, since the result is part of the table, but the claim doesn't specify whether it was won or not, just that it was nominated. So the relevant cells would be row_index, award, year, and nominated work.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about being \"nominated,\" so the 'result' column isn't directly part of the claim except that it's a nomination. Therefore, I need to check for the presence of the specific award, year, and nominated work.\n\nSo in the table, each row has all five columns, but we're interested in the cells that correspond to the criteria in the claim. So for this claim, we need:\n\n- Year: 2006\n- Award: Drama League Award\n- Nominated Work: Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nSo in the table, each row has these columns, so the relevant_cells would be those that match.\n\nIn the data, row 9 (index 9) is 2006, \"drama league award\", \"distinguished performance\", \"sweeney todd...\", \"nominated\". So this matches all three criteria. Therefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cells are:\n\n- year: 2006\n- award: \"Drama League Award\"\n- nominated work: \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\"\n\nTherefore, in terms of which columns to include, it's 'year', 'award', and 'nominated work'.\n\nWait, but in the table structure, each row is a sub-array with elements [year, award, ...], so for row 9 (index 9), we have:\n\n[2006, \"drama league award\", \"distinguished performance\", \"sweeney todd...\", \"nominated\"]\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the first element (year), second element (award), and fourth element (nominated work).\n\nTherefore, in terms of indices:\n\nyear is at index 0,\n\naward at index 1,\n\nand nominated work at index 3.\n\nBut perhaps for the output, it's better to state which columns correspond to each part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just include the indices where these values are found. But maybe the user expects us to specify the columns (i.e., their positions in the array) that have the relevant data.\n\nSo the answer is yes, such a row exists, and the relevant cells are:\n\nyear: 2006\n\naward: \"Drama League Award\"\n\nnominated work: \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\"\n\nTherefore, in terms of which columns (indices), it's:\n\n0 for year,\n\n1 for award,\n\n3 for nominated work.\n\nBut maybe I should list the indices as per the overall structure. So each row is an array with 5 elements: [year, award, category, work, result]. So the relevant indices are 0, 1, and 3.\n\nTherefore, in the output, we can specify that in row 9 (index 9), columns 0, 1, and 3 match the criteria.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying whether \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006. By examining each relevant entry, it is confirmed that such a nomination exists.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, there is a record in the table where \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006. The relevant cells are:\n\n- **Year (Index 0):** 2006\n- **Award (Index 1):** \"Drama League Award\"\n- **Nominated Work (Index 3):** \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\"\n\nThese correspond to row 9 in the table.",

Category: Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical\n\nSo, I should look through the table to find any rows where these conditions match.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: year, award, category, nominated work, result. The data is an array of arrays, each representing a row.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from 1993, I see entries for \"the who's Tommy\" but none related to Evita or 2007. \n\nIn 2004, there are two rows: both won Tony and Outer Critics Circle awards for Assassins, not relevant.\n\nThen in 2006, the rows are about Sweeney Todd, which isn't Evita either.\n\nMoving to 2007, I see several rows:\n\n- Row with year 2007, award Drama League Award, category distinguished performance, work Lovemusik, result nominated.\n- Another row for 2007: Tony Award, best performance by leading actor in musical, Lovemusik, nominated. Wait, that's about Lovemusik, not Evita.\n- Next is the Drama Desk Award, same as above.\n- Then another Drama League and Outer Critics Circle, all for Lovemusik.\n\nWait, so none of these are about Evita. The claim mentions Evita being nominated in 2007, but I don't see any row where the work is Evita in 2007. \n\nLooking further down, I find a row with year 2012: Tony Award, best performance by featured actor in musical, Evita, result nominated. But that's for 2012, not 2007.\n\nSo, in 2007, the only nominated works are Lovemusik and King Lear (the latter in another row). There's no mention of Evita being nominated in 2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Evita was not nominated in 2007.
