    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Iowa be the team that jam vanderberg belong to when the completion have a status of redshirt.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It seems to be stating two things:\n\n1. Iowa is the team.\n2. Jam Vanderberg belongs to this team.\n3. When there's a completion status of \"redshirt.\"\n\nWait, that part about completion is a bit confusing. Let me look at the table provided to see if I can find relevant information.\n\nThe table has columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 2008: Iowa, redshirt, redshirt, redshirt, redshirt\n- 2009: Iowa, 87, 42, 48.3%, 470\n- 2010: Iowa, 8,5,62.5%,45\n- 2011: Iowa,404,237,58.7%,3022\n- 2012: Iowa,389,223,57.3%,2249\n- college totals: college totals,888,507,57.1%,5786\n\nWait, the last row has \"college totals\" for both team and another column, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"completion have a status of redshirt.\" Looking at the columns, \"completions\" are numerical values, but there's also a \"completion %\" column. The term \"redshirt\" is used in the 2008 row for both attempts and completions, but I'm not sure if that's referring to the status or just a placeholder for no data.\n\nHmm, perhaps \"redshirt\" here refers to a non-starting player or someone who didn't play much? Or maybe it's an indicator of some sort. But in the context of completions, usually, redshirt would be a status like a player's position or role, not directly related to completions.\n\nWait, but looking at the claim again: \"when the completion have a status of redshirt.\" So, perhaps there is a row where the completion status is \"redshirt,\" indicating that in that particular year, completions were considered as redshirts. But I don't see any column named \"completion status\" in the table. The columns are year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards.\n\nSo, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps \"completions\" with a status of redshirt refers to some other context, but in the given table, we don't have such a column. All the data provided under \"completions\" are numerical except for 2008, which just says \"redshirt.\" Maybe that row is indicating that in 2008, completions were considered as redshirts, but I'm not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that in a year where completions (maybe referring to passes attempted or completed) had a status of redshirt, Iowa was Jam Vanderberg's team. But I don't see any row where \"completion\" has a status. The closest is 2008, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the term \"redshirt\" here refers to a player's status, not completions. So perhaps in a year when players had redshirt statuses, Iowa was the team of Jam Vanderberg. But I'm not sure how that ties into completions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is mixing up terms and trying to say that in the year where completions (passes attempted or completed) were at redshirt status, Iowa was the team of Jam Vanderberg. But since the table doesn't have a \"redshirt\" column for completions, I'm not sure how to verify this.\n\nLooking back, maybe the key is to look for rows where either attempts or completions are \"redshirt,\" and see if in those years, the team is Iowa, and whether Jam Vanderberg was part of that. But without knowing which row corresponds to Jam Vanderberg, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim might be implying that when the completion percentage or completions have a \"redshirt\" status, Iowa is the team. But since the table doesn't show a specific column for redshirt status related to completions, maybe there's no data supporting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"completion % of redshirt\" is meant to imply something else, like a player's role as a redshirt, but again, without that column, it's unclear.\n\nI think I need to focus on the table columns. The claim mentions \"completions have a status of redshirt.\" Since there's no such column in the data, perhaps this part of the claim is false. Alternatively, if the term \"redshirt\" refers to 2008, where all completions are marked as redshirt, but that seems inconsistent because in 2009, they have actual numbers.\n\nSo, without a specific column indicating redshirt status for completions, I can't verify that part of the claim. Therefore, the entire claim might be false because there's no evidence in the table supporting the completion status being redshirt.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"redshirt\" is an abbreviation or shorthand, but given how the data is presented, it's unclear. The only row with \"redshirt\" is 2008, but that doesn't tie directly to Jam Vanderberg unless he was part of that team in 2008, which I don't know.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any mention of Jam Vanderberg in the table. But there's no column or row indicating that. The teams listed are Iowa and college totals, so maybe Jam Vanderberg isn't even in this data set.\n\nTherefore, since the claim mentions Jam Vanderberg belonging to the team when completions have a redshirt status, but neither the completion status nor Jam Vanderberg is explicitly present in the table, I think the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Iowa player in 2010 is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 2010 , the player with iowa make 5 completion for a total of 45 yard.\" Breaking this down, I need to verify two things:\n\n1. In the year 2010, did the Iowa player have exactly 5 completions?\n2. Did those completions result in a total of 45 yards?\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"year\", \"team\", \"attempts\", \"completions\", \"completion %\", and \"yards\". The claim mentions the year 2010, so I should focus on the row where the year is 2010.\n\nIn the data section, there's a row for 2010:\n[\n  \"2010\",\n  \"iowa\",\n  \"8\",\n  \"5\",\n  \"62.5%\",\n  \"45\"\n]\n\nSo, let's check each part of the claim against this row.\n\nFirst, completions: The number given in the claim is 5. In the 2010 row, under \"completions\", it indeed says 5. So that matches.\n\nNext, total yards: The claim states 45 yards. Looking at the \"yards\" column for 2010, it's also 45. That checks out as well.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. There's no discrepancy or missing information that would invalidate either part. \n\nI should make sure there isn't another row for 2010 that might contradict this, but from the table provided, it seems like only one row corresponds to 2010 with those exact numbers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, both the number of completions and the total yards in 2010 for Iowa are correctly represented. The claim holds true based on the data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"team iowa have 42 completion\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"team iowa,\" which refers to the Iowa team in the table. The next part is \"have 42 completion.\" I'm guessing this is about passing completions, like in football where a quarterback completes passes. So, I should look for the row where the team is Iowa and see if there's a value that matches 42 completions.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. Each row represents a different year from 2008 to 2012, plus a final row for college totals.\n\nSo, I should go through each row in the data array until I find the one where \"team\" is \"iowa.\" Let's check:\n\n- First row: team is iowa, but the completions are redshirt. That doesn't make sense because 42 isn't a redshirt.\n- Second row: team is iowa, attempts 87, completions 42. Oh, here we go! The completions column has 42 for this row.\n- Third row onwards also have Iowa, but the completions are 5, 237, 223, etc., which don't match 42.\n\nWait, so in the second row of the data array (which is index 1), the \"completions\" value is 42. Therefore, the claim that Iowa has 42 completions seems to be supported by this data point.\n\nBut wait, the table's first row after the headers is 2008, which might correspond to a specific year or event. The second data row (index 1) is for 2009, so it's correct to say that in 2009, Iowa had 42 completions.\n\nSo, the claim refers to \"team iowa have 42 completion,\" which matches this data point. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is at row_index 1, column_name \"completions.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where Iowa has 42 completions in the year 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"there be 223 completion be record with there be 389 attempt.\" It seems like the claim is talking about a specific number of completions corresponding to a certain number of attempts. So I need to find in the table if when the attempts are 389, the completions are 223.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. Each row represents data for a specific year.\n\nThe claim mentions two numbers: 223 completions and 389 attempts. So I need to look through each row to see if any row has both these numbers in the 'completions' and 'attempts' columns respectively.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Attempts is \"redshirt\", which doesn't make sense as a number, so not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Attempts are 87, completions are 42. Not matching.\n3. Row 2: Attempts are 8, completions are 5. No match.\n4. Row 3: Attempts are 404, completions are 237. Hmm, 237 is close to but not 223. So no match here either.\n5. Row 4: Attempts are 389, completions are 223. Oh, this looks like a match! Here, when attempts are 389, completions are indeed 223. That's exactly what the claim is stating.\n6. Row 5: This row seems to be for college totals, so it probably aggregates data across years, but the specific numbers given in the claim don't match these either.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, there's a row where attempts are 389 and completions are 223. That directly supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in row_index 4 for both 'attempts' and 'completions'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The last row seems like a summary with \"college totals.\"\n\nI need to find if any of the rows between 2008 and 2012 have a total attempts that equals 888.\n\nLet's check each year:\n\n2008: attempts are redshirt, which probably means no valid number. So not relevant.\n2009: attempts are 87\n2010: attempts are 8\n2011: attempts are 404\n2012: attempts are 389\n\nNone of these individual years sum up to 888 on their own. But the last row has \"college totals\" with 888 attempts. This seems like a total across all the years.\n\nThe claim says from 2008 to 2012, so that period includes 2008-2012. The \"college totals\" likely aggregate all those years' attempts. Therefore, the total attempts are 888.\n\nSo, the number of attempts from 2008 to 2012 is indeed 888, but it's in the summary row, not a specific year. Since the claim refers to the number being 888 during that period, it's technically true based on the total, even though it's presented as a single row.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the last data row (row_index 5) for attempts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says \"Iowa record 389 attempt when they also record 2249 yard.\" So, I'm looking for two specific numbers in the table: 389 attempts and 2249 yards. These should correspond to the same year because it's about their record in that particular season or context.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The data rows include various years for Iowa, with corresponding stats. The last row is labeled \"college totals,\" which seems to aggregate all their records across years.\n\nI need to check each row to see if any of them have both 389 attempts and 2249 yards in the same year. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 2008: Attempts are redshirt, yards are redshirt. Not relevant.\n2. 2009: Attempts are 87, yards are 470. Doesn't match.\n3. 2010: Attempts are 8, yards are 45. No.\n4. 2011: Attempts are 404, yards are 3022. Not matching the numbers.\n5. 2012: Attempts are 389, yards are 2249. Wait, that's exactly what I'm looking for! So in 2012, Iowa had 389 attempts and 2249 yards.\n\nNow, to confirm if this row is relevant. The columns \"attempts\" and \"yards\" would be the ones containing these numbers. Each of these columns corresponds to the data points we're checking for in the claim. Therefore, both cells are relevant.\n\nI should also check if there's another row that might have 389 attempts with a different yardage, but from what I see, only 2012 has both those exact numbers together.

The table has several columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The data spans from 2008 to 2012, with some rows that seem to aggregate the totals.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"389 attempt be record when the completion be 237.\" Hmm, I need to break this down. Let me parse it. It seems like the claim is saying that in a certain year, there were 389 attempts and 237 completions, which would result in a completion percentage of (237/389)*100%. The claim is asserting that this attempt and completion figure sets a record.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row to find where both \"attempts\" and \"completions\" are equal to 389 and 237 respectively. Wait, but looking at the table:\n\n- 2008: attempts=redshirt (which isn't a number)\n- 2009: attempts=87, completions=42\n- 2010: attempts=8, completions=5\n- 2011: attempts=404, completions=237\n- 2012: attempts=389, completions=223\n- College totals: attempts=888, completions=507\n\nSo, in 2011, the attempts are 404 and completions are 237. Wait, that's 237 completions but the claim says \"completion be 237.\" So maybe the row with 237 completions is 2011.\n\nBut in 2012, attempts are 389. The claim says \"389 attempt be record when the completion be 237.\" So it's pairing 389 attempts with 237 completions as a record. Wait, but in 2011, completions were 237, and attempts were 404. In 2012, attempts are 389, but completions are 223.\n\nWait, so is there any row where both 389 attempts and 237 completions occur? Let me check each row:\n\n- 2008: not numbers\n- 2009: 87,42 \u2013 no\n- 2010: 8,5 \u2013 no\n- 2011:404,237 \u2013 yes, but attempts are 404\n- 2012:389,223 \u2013 here, attempts=389 and completions=223. So that's not 237.\n- College totals:888,507 \u2013 no\n\nSo in the table, there is a row with 389 attempts (2012) but completions are 223. There isn't a row where both attempts=389 and completions=237.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about a specific year where attempts=389 and completions=237, making it a record. But looking at the data, that's not happening in any single year. The only time completions are 237 is in 2011 with 404 attempts, which doesn't match the 389 attempts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is stating that in some context, like overall college totals, but the college totals have 888 attempts and 507 completions, which don't match either.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no row where both 389 attempts and 237 completions occur together. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"389 attempt be record when the completion be 237,\" I checked each row for the presence of both 389 attempts and 237 completions. None of the rows contain these exact numbers simultaneously. The closest match is a row with 404 attempts and 237 completions in 2011, but not with 389 attempts.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It seems like it's talking about a specific number of attempts (404) made by someone named Vanderberg for the Iowa team, and when their record yard is 2249, something happened. So, I need to find in the table where these numbers appear together.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The rows represent different years from 2008 onwards, with some entries labeled as \"college totals.\"\n\nThe claim mentions Vanderberg, but looking at the data, I see that in each row, the 'team' is listed as \"iowa.\" There's no mention of a coach or player named Vanderberg in the columns. So maybe Vanderberg isn't part of the team names listed here.\n\nBut the key numbers are 404 attempts and 2249 yards. I need to check if there's a row where both these numbers appear together.\n\nLooking at each data row:\n\n1. 2008: Attempts=redshirt, Yards=redshirt \u2013 Not matching.\n2. 2009: Attempts=87, Yards=470 \u2013 No match.\n3. 2010: Attempts=8, Yards=45 \u2013 No match.\n4. 2011: Attempts=404, Yards=3022 \u2013 This row has 404 attempts but yards are 3022, not 2249.\n5. 2012: Attempts=389, Yards=2249 \u2013 Here we have 2249 yards, but the attempts are 389, which isn't 404.\n6. College totals: Attempts=888, Yards=5786 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nSo none of the rows have both 404 attempts and 2249 yards in the same row. Therefore, the claim doesn't seem to be supported by this table.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Could \"record yard\" mean the yards at that point? For example, in 2011, when they had 404 attempts, their yards were 3022, which might not be a record yet. Then in 2012, yards reached 2249 with different attempts.\n\nBut the claim says \"when the record yard be 2249,\" implying that when Vanderberg had 404 attempts, the yardage was at 2249. However, in the same row as 404 attempts (2011), the yards are 3022, not 2249. So it's a different year.\n\nThus, there's no matching row where both 404 attempts and 2249 yards occur together. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify the relevant cells from the table that support this claim. The table is in JSON format with columns like year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The data spans multiple years for the Iowa team.\n\nThe claim is: \"from 2008 to 2011, the number of attempts be 888.\" Hmm, let me break this down. I think the user wants me to check if the total number of attempts from 2008 to 2011 equals 888. Or maybe they're referring to a specific year or row? Wait, looking closer, in the data section, there's a row with \"college totals\" and an attempt count of 888. So that might be a key point.\n\nFirst, I should check each year from 2008 to 2011 and sum up their attempts. Let me look at the table:\n\n- 2008: 88 (wait, no, in the data it's \"redshirt\" but in the column \"attempts\", I think it might be a number. Wait, looking again: in 2008, the row is [ \"2008\", \"iowa\", \"redshirt\", ... ]. So \"redshirt\" might not be a number. Similarly for other years until 2012.\n\nWait, actually, let me check each row's attempts:\n\nRow 0: 2008, Iowa, redshirt (maybe this is a placeholder or a specific term, perhaps non-numeric)\nRow 1: 2009, Iowa, 87\nRow 2: 2010, Iowa, 8\nRow 3: 2011, Iowa, 404\nRow 4: 2012, Iowa, 389\nRow 5: college totals, college totals, 888\n\nSo the \"attempts\" column has values for 2009 (87), 2010 (8), 2011 (404), 2012 (389), and then a total of 888. So if I sum from 2008 to 2011, but since 2008 is \"redshirt\", which might not be a number, perhaps it's not included in the count.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to all attempts from 2008 through 2011. But 2008's attempt value is \"redshirt\". If that's a non-numeric string, then it can't be added. So the sum would be 87 + 8 + 404 = 499. That doesn't equal 888.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the total from 2008 to 2011 including all years except 2012, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the data again: in row 5, it says \"college totals\" for team and attempts as 888. So that's the cumulative total up until 2012? Or perhaps just a total across all years listed?\n\nWait, no, let me parse the rows correctly:\n\nEach row represents a specific year, except the last one which is labeled as \"college totals\". So the data includes:\n\n- 2008: attempts = redshirt (maybe 0 or not counted)\n- 2009: 87\n- 2010: 8\n- 2011: 404\n- 2012: 389\n- college totals: 888\n\nSo if I sum all the numeric attempts from 2008 to 2011, it's 87 + 8 + 404 = 499. But the claim is about the number of attempts being 888 from 2008 to 2011. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their claim, thinking that the total from 2008-2011 is 888, but according to the table, it's actually 499. Alternatively, if they're considering something else.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the claim refers to each year having attempts equal to 888? But looking at the data, each year's attempts are different: redshirt, 87, 8, 404. None of these is 888 except the \"college totals\" row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that in one of those years, the number of attempts was 888, but looking at the numbers, no, it's only in the college totals row.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again. The data is a list of lists:\n\nEach sublist has:\n\nyear (string),\nteam (string),\nattempts (value),\ncompletions,\ncompletion %,\nyards\n\nSo for 2008, attempts are \"redshirt\", which might be a placeholder or an error in the data, but perhaps it's meant to represent zero. If so, then from 2009 to 2011, the attempts are 87,8,404, summing to 499.\n\nThe claim is that from 2008-2011, the number of attempts is 888. So if \"redshirt\" is considered as zero, total would be 499 + 0 = 499, not 888.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant each attempt in those years was 88, but that's not what the data shows.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to a specific column or row. But the claim says \"the number of attempts be 888,\" which seems like it's talking about a total over a range of years.\n\nGiven that, the only occurrence of 888 in the attempts column is in the college totals row, which is after 2012. So from 2008-2011, the sum is 499, not 888.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the actual number of attempts from 2008 to 2011 (excluding 2012) does not equal 888.\n\nSo now, to identify the relevant cells: which rows and columns are needed to verify this. Since we need to check if the sum of attempts from 2008 to 2011 is 888, but in reality, it's 499.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user is referring to each row's attempt count being 88? Or maybe a specific column? Wait, no, because 88 isn't present except as \"redshirt\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing \"attempts\" with another metric. For example, in 2009, attempts are 87, but maybe they're referring to something else.\n\nBut based on the claim, I think the relevant cells would be each row from 2008 to 2011 in the \"attempts\" column because that's where the data is that needs to be summed.\n\nSo for rows 0 (2008), 1 (2009), 2 (2010), and 3 (2011), the attempts column is relevant. So their row indices are 0,1,2,3, and column name \"attempts\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the sum isn't 888, but to check that, we need those cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check each year from 2008 to 2011 for their \"attempts\" values. The data shows these attempts as follows: 0 (assuming redshirt), 87, 8, and 404. Summing them gives 499, not 888. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** The years in question are 2008 to 2011, corresponding to rows 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n2. **Check \"attempts\" Column:** Each of these rows has an \"attempts\" value that needs evaluation.\n   - 2008: 0 (assumed from \"redshirt\")\n   - 2009: 87\n   - 2010: 8\n   - 2011: 404\n3. **Sum the Values:** Total attempts = 0 + 87 + 8 + 404 = 499.\n4. **Compare with Claim:** The claim states that attempts total 888, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The sum of attempts from 2008 to 2011 is 499, not 888, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"statement\": \"The number of attempts from 2008 to 2011 is 888.\",\n  \"verification_process\": {\n    \"relevant_rows\": [\n      { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attempts\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attempts\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\" }\n    ],\n    \"sum_of_attempts\": 0 + 87 + 8 + 404 = 499,\n    \"comparison\": \"The sum (499) does not equal 888.\"\n  },\n  \"result\": false\n}\n```",
