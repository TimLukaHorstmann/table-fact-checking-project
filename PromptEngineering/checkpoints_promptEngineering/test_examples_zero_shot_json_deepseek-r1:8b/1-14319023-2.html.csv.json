    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying: \"When the girl single is Lindaweni Fanetri, the mixed double is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta.\" So, I'm looking for rows where the girl singles column has Lindaweni Fanetri and check if the mixed doubles column for that row is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. The data spans from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI need to check each row to see if the girl singles column contains Lindaweni Fanetri. Let's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (2001):** Girls singles is Maria Kristin Yulianti \u2014 not Lindaweni.\n- **Row 1 (2002):** Girls singles is Fransiska Ratnasari \u2014 nope.\n- **Row 2 (2003):** Wiwis Meilyanna \u2014 still not.\n- **Row 3 (2004):** Pia Zebadiah \u2014 different name, though I think she's related. But it's Pia, not Lindaweni.\n- **Row 4 (2005):** Bellaetrix Manuputty \u2014 nope.\n- **Row 5 (2006):** Sylvinna Kurniawan \u2014 not her.\n- **Row 6 (2007):** Lindaweni Fanetri is in the girls singles here. So, this row is relevant.\n- **Rows after that:** From 2008 onwards, there's no Lindaweni listed.\n\nSo, only Row 6 has Lindaweni Fanetri as the girl singles player.\n\nNow, I check what the mixed doubles are for Row 6 (2007). The data says: \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\". That matches exactly what the claim is stating. So, when the girl single is Lindaweni, the mixed double is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are Row 6 in both the girls singles and mixed doubles columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia , the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\" So, the claim is saying that for a particular year, if the girl's doubles partner is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia, then the boy's doubles partners are Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\nNext, I need to look into the table provided. The table has columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nThe claim mentions \"girl double\" and \"boy double,\" which correspond to the girls doubles and boys doubles columns in the table. So, I should focus on these two columns across all rows to find relevant data.\n\nI'll go through each row (year) and check if any of them have Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia in the girls doubles column and Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita in the boys doubles column simultaneously. If such a combination exists, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me list out each year's data:\n\n2001:\n- Girls doubles: lilyana natsir natalia poluakan\n- Boys doubles: hendra setiawan joko riyadi\n\n2002:\n- Girls doubles: purwati meiliana jauhari\n- Boys doubles: ujang suherlan yoga ukikasah\n\n2003:\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari\n- Boys doubles: fran kurniawan chandra kowi\n\n2004:\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari\n- Boys doubles: aditya dwi putra i made agung\n\n2005:\n- Girls doubles: lily siswanti shendy puspa irawati\n- Boys doubles: rio willianto davin prawidssa\n\n2006:\n- Girls doubles: bellaetrix manuputty samantha lintang\n- Boys doubles: danny bawa chrisnanta afiat yuris wirawan\n\n2007:\n- Girls doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\n- Boys doubles: budi hartono yohanes rendy sugiarto\n\n2008:\n- Girls doubles: suci rizki andini tiara rosalia nuraidah\n- Boys doubles: hermansyah\n\n2009:\n- Girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia\n- Boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\n\n2010:\n- Girls doubles: aris budiharti dian fitriani\n- Boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico\n\nNow, let's analyze each row where Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia appears. From the data, Ayu is present only in the 2009 row for girls doubles.\n\nLooking at the boys doubles column for 2009: it's \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\" This matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, there exists a year (2009) where the girl's doubles are Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia and the boy's doubles are Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita. So, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim. The relevant columns are \"girls doubles\" and \"boys doubles.\" For 2009, both columns have the names mentioned in the claim. \n\nSo, the relevant_cells will include the row index for 2009 and the respective column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim I need to verify is: \"in 2006, the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: the mixed doubles and the boys singles for the year 2006.\n\nStarting with the mixed doubles. The claim states that in 2006, the mixed doubles were Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto. Looking at the table, each row represents a different year, starting from 2001. So I need to find the 2006 row. \n\nIn the data, the first column is \"year,\" so I'll look for the row where year is 2006. Once found, the relevant columns are \"mixed doubles.\" The value in that cell should be checked against the claim.\n\nNext, checking the boys singles part of the claim: it says nugroho andi saputro was the boy single in 2006. Again, I'll locate the 2006 row and check the \"boys singles\" column. If both these cells match the claim, then the statement is true; otherwise, false.\n\nI need to make sure that the names are spelled correctly as per the table data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The task is to check if a specific claim matches the data in the provided JSON table. The claim states that in 2007, the girl double is Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati and the mixed double is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. The data rows each represent a different year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI need to focus on the row corresponding to 2007 because that's when the claim is made. So I'll look at the row where \"year\" is 2007.\n\nIn the 2007 row, the columns are:\n- boys singles: Nandang Arif\n- girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- boys doubles: Budi Hartono Yohanes Rendy Sugiarto\n- girls doubles: Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati\n- mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto\n\nThe claim says two things:\n1. The girl double in 2007 is Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati.\n2. The mixed double in 2007 is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta.\n\nLooking at the data, both of these statements match exactly what's in the table for 2007. The girl doubles column has Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati, and the mixed doubles have Wifqi Windarto paired with Debby Susanto.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the relevant cells, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim states: \"When the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta after the year 2007\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into two main conditions:\n\n1. There is a girl singles player named Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. In the same row as Lindaweni Fanetri in the girl singles column, the mixed doubles player is \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\".\n\nAdditionally, this should occur after the year 2007.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI'll start by finding all rows where the \"girls singles\" column has Lindaweni Fanetri.\n\nChecking each year sequentially:\n\n- 2007: The girls singles are Lindaweni Fanetri (row index 6).\n- 2008: The girls singles are Ana Rovita, so no.\n- 2009: Girls singles is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia, not Lindaweni.\n- 2010: Girls singles is Ganis Nur Rahmadani, so no.\n\nSo, Lindaweni Fanetri is only present in the year 2007. Now, I need to check if in that same row, the mixed doubles column has \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\".\n\nLooking at row index 6 (year 2007):\n\n- Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- Mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto\n\nYes, that matches exactly. So both conditions are satisfied for the year 2007.\n\nSince 2007 is after 2007? Wait, the claim says \"after the year 2007\". Hmm, but if the event happens in 2007, it's not strictly after, it's equal to. But sometimes, \"after\" can be interpreted as including the same year depending on context. However, I think the exact wording is important here.\n\nThe claim says \"after the year 2007\", which would mean years after 2007, so 2008 onwards. Lindaweni Fanetri was active in 2007, and her mixed doubles partner was Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta in that same year. Therefore, if the claim requires it to be after 2007, then this row wouldn't qualify because it's exactly 2007.\n\nWait, but I might need to consider whether \"after\" is inclusive. In many contexts, \"after\" can mean including the mentioned time frame. For example, when someone says they started working after 2020, their first day could be Jan 1, 2020. So it's possible that \"after the year 2007\" includes the year 2007 itself.\n\nIf I consider it as inclusive, then 2007 is acceptable, so the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 6 (year 2007) for girls singles and mixed doubles columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 6 of the table. Lindaweni Fanetri is present in the \"girls singles\" column for the year 2007, and her mixed doubles partner is listed as Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's a JSON with columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. The data is an array of arrays, each representing a year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nThe claim refers specifically to the year 2010. So I need to look at the row for 2010 in the table. Let me check which row that is.\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array:\n- The first element is 2001, second 2002, and so on until 2010 as the last element (row index 7).\n\nNow, within the 2010 row (index 7), I need to find the cells related to boys doubles and girls doubles because the claim mentions these categories.\n\nLooking at each column in that row:\n- Year: 2010\n- Boys singles: \"shesar hiren rhustavito\"\n- Girls singles: \"ganis nur rahmadani\"\n- Boys doubles: \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\"\n- Girls doubles: \"aris budiharti dian fitriani\"\n- Mixed doubles: \"jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico\"\n\nThe claim says that in 2010, the girl double (girls doubles) is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia and the boy double (boys doubles) is Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\nWait a minute. The boys doubles cell in the table for 2010 is \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita,\" which matches the claim's description of Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita for boys doubles.\n\nHowever, the girls doubles cell is listed as \"aris budiharti dian fitriani,\" not Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. The claim mentions Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia in the girl doubles spot, but according to the table, that's not correct.\n\nSo, the claim is making two assertions: one about girls doubles and one about boys doubles. The part about boys doubles seems correct based on the table, but the girls doubles assertion is incorrect because it refers to a different player.\n\nTherefore, since the claim has at least one incorrect statement, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is partially accurate regarding the boys doubles but incorrectly states the girl doubles participant. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"In 2009, the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things for 2009:\n\n1. The mixed doubles pair is \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\" and \"hermansyah.\"\n2. Hermansyah is playing boys singles.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data provided for 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nEach row corresponds to a different year. For 2009, let's find the relevant row in the data array. The rows are indexed starting from 0. Let me count:\n\n- 2001: index 0\n- 2002: index 1\n- 2003: index 2\n- 2004: index 3\n- 2005: index 4\n- 2006: index 5\n- 2007: index 6\n- 2008: index 7\n- 2009: index 8\n- 2010: index 9\n\nSo, 2009 is at row_index 8.\n\nNow, let's look at the data for 2009:\n\n[\n  \"shesar hiren rhustavito\",\n  \"ganis nur rahmadani\",\n  \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\",\n  \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\",\n  \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\"\n]\n\nThe columns for row_index 8 are:\n- boys singles: \"shesar hiren rhustavito\"\n- girls singles: \"ganis nur rahmadani\"\n- boys doubles: \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\"\n- girls doubles: \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\"\n- mixed doubles: \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\"\n\nWait, the claim says that hermansyah is playing boys singles. Looking at the boys singles column for 2009, it's \"shesar hiren rhustavito,\" not hermansyah. So that part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking the mixed doubles: The claim lists two players, but in the table, the mixed doubles for 2009 is only one person: \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\" There's no mention of hermansyah being part of mixed doubles. So that part is also incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, the claim refers to hermansyah as a boys singles player, which doesn't match the data. He isn't listed in the 2009 row for boys singles or any other relevant column.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false. There's no support in the table for either part being true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because:\n1. In 2009, the boys singles is \"shesar hiren rhustavito,\" not hermansyah.\n2. The mixed doubles entry is only \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n- **Year Check:** Confirmed that 2009 corresponds to row_index 8.\n- **Boys Singles:** Data shows \"shesar hiren rhustavito,\" not hermansyah.\n- **Mixed Doubles:** Only one player listed, not two as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 2010 , when mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta and debby susanto , the boy single be nugroho andi saputro\"\n\nI need to parse this claim into two main parts. The first part talks about the mixed doubles pair in 2010 being Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto. The second part mentions that the boys' singles in 2010 are Nugroho Andi Saputro.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010. So for each year, there's data on all these categories.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim about the mixed doubles in 2010. I'll look at the year 2010 row and find the \"mixed doubles\" column. In that row, the name listed is \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto\". Wait, but the claim says Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto as a pair. So in the table, it's written together as one string, which I assume represents the pair.\n\nSo for mixed doubles in 2010, the cell matches the name given in the claim. That part checks out.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim says that the boys singles in 2010 are Nugroho Andi Saputro. So again, looking at the 2010 row, under \"boys singles\" we have \"shesar hiren rhustavito\". The claim states it's Nugroho Andi Saputro, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the two parts of the claim don't both hold true based on the table. The mixed doubles part is correct, but the boys singles part is not.

First, I should look at the table for the year 2009.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- The columns are: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.\n- Each row represents a different year and lists participants in each category.\n\nFor 2009 (row index 8), let's check the relevant cells:\n\nRow 8 (year 2009):\n- Girls doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\n- Mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nWait, the claim says that in 2009, when the girl double is anneke..., the mixed double should be wifqi windarto debby susanta. But according to the table, the mixed doubles for 2009 are \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\".\n\nSo the mixed double in the claim doesn't match what's in the table. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2009, when the girl doubles are anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati, the mixed doubles are wifqi windarto debby susanta. Checking the 2009 row shows different names for mixed doubles, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
