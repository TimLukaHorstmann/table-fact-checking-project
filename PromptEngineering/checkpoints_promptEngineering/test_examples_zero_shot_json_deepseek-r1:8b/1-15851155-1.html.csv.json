    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"Stevens Institute for Technology be based in Rapid City, South Dakota\" is TRUE or FALSE using the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. The claim states that Stevens Institute for Technology has its base in Rapid City, South Dakota. To verify this, I need to check the relevant information in the given table.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: school, location, control, type, enrollment, founded. Since the claim is about the location of the institution, the most relevant column here is \"location\". \n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the data to find the entry where the school is \"Stevens Institute of Technology\" and check its location.\n\nStarting from the first row: The school listed is \"air force institute of technology\", not Stevens. Next, it's California Institute of Technology, then others until I reach row 14, which has \"Stevens institute of technology\". Let me confirm that: Yes, row index 14, column_name \"school\" is \"Stevens institute of technology\".\n\nLooking at the location for this row: It says \"hoboken , new jersey\". That's not Rapid City, South Dakota. So, based on the table data, Stevens Institute for Technology is located in Hoboken, New Jersey, not Rapid City.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the information provided doesn't support it. The relevant cells are the row where the school is Stevens and the location column to check the specific location.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Stevens Institute for Technology is based in Rapid City, South Dakota is **FALSE** because the table shows it's located in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"hoboken , new jersey be where a private school that be found in 1870 be locate.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's stating. It seems to say that Hoboken, New Jersey is the location of a private school established in 1870. So, the key pieces are the location (Hoboken, NJ), the type of institution (private), and the founding year (1870).\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it's structured with columns: school, location, control, type, enrollment, founded. The task is to verify if such a row exists in the data.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data array one by one to check for matching criteria.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- School: Air Force Institute of Technology\n- Location: Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio\nNot matching.\n\nRow 1:\n- School: California Institute of Technology\n- Location: Pasadena, CA\nNo match.\n\nRow 2:\n- School: California Polytechnic State University\n- Location: San Luis Obispo, CA\nStill no.\n\nRow 3:\n- School: California State Polytechnic University, Pomona\n- Location: Pomona, CA\nNot matching.\n\nRow 4:\n- School: Clarkson University\n- Location: Potsdam, NY\nNope.\n\nRow 5:\n- School: Colorado School of Mines\n- Location: Golden, CO\nNo match.\n\nRow 6:\n- School: Colorado Technical University\n- Location: Colorado Springs, CO\nNot this one either.\n\nRow 7:\n- School: Florida Institute of Technology\n- Location: Melbourne, FL\nStill not.\n\nRow 8:\n- School: Georgia Institute of Technology\n- Location: Atlanta, GA\nNope.\n\nRow 9:\n- School: Illinois Institute of Technology\n- Location: Chicago, IL\nNot matching.\n\nRow 10:\n- School: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n- Location: Cambridge, MA\nNo match.\n\nRow 11:\n- School: Michigan Technological University\n- Location: Houghton, MI\nClose, but location is Houghton, MI, not Hoboken, NJ.\n\nRow 12:\n- School: Missouri University of Science and Technology\n- Location: Rolla, MO\nNope.\n\nRow 13:\n- School: Montana Tech of the University of Montana\n- Location: Butte, MT\nStill no.\n\nRow 14:\n- School: New Jersey Institute of Technology\n- Location: Newark, NJ\nHoboken is a different city in NJ. So location doesn't match.\n\nRow 15:\n- School: New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology\n- Location: Socorro, NM\nNope.\n\nRow 16:\n- School: Oregon Institute of Technology\n- Location: Klamath Falls, OR\nNot matching.\n\nRow 17:\n- School: Polytechnic Institute of New York University\n- Location: Brooklyn, NY\nNo match.\n\nRow 18:\n- School: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n- Location: Troy, NY\nClose again, but not Hoboken.\n\nRow 19:\n- School: Rochester Institute of Technology\n- Location: Henrietta, NY\nStill no.\n\nRow 20:\n- School: Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\n- Location: Terre Haute, IN\nNope.\n\nRow 21:\n- School: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology\n- Location: Rapid City, SD\nNot matching.\n\nRow 22:\n- School: Texas Tech University\n- Location: Lubbock, TX\nStill no.\n\nRow 23:\n- School: University of Wisconsin - Stout\n- Location: Menomonie, WI\nNo match.\n\nNow, I realize that none of the schools in the table are located in Hoboken, NJ. However, I notice a mention of \"Stevens Institute of Technology\" elsewhere, but it's not in the provided data. The closest is the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, which is a different location. Therefore, there's no private school in Hoboken, NJ founded in 1870 listed here.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by the table data, meaning the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the data, I see that the first entry has the school name as \"air force institute of technology.\" That's the one.\n\nNext, I need to check if it's private. Looking at the \"control\" column for this row, it says \"public.\" Wait, that contradicts the claim which states it should be private.\n\nThen, I'll verify the founding year. The \"founded\" column shows 1919 for this row. But the claim says 1889, which doesn't match.\n\nSince both the control and founded columns don't align with the claim, the statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"control\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
