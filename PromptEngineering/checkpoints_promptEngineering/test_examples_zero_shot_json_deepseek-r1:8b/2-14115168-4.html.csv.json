    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim is: \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The key points are that both teams are part of the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are school, mascot, conference, national titles, founded. So for each team mentioned in the claim, I need to check their conference.\n\nStarting with Bellevue Bruin: In the table, the first row has \"bellevue university\" as the school and \"bellevue bruins\" as the mascot. Their conference is listed as \"midlands\". So that's one part correct.\n\nNext, York Panther: The last row in the data has \"york college\" as the school and \"york panthers\" as the mascot. Checking their conference, it's also \"midlands\". So both teams are indeed in the Midland Conference.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because both the Bellevue Bruins and the York Panthers play in the Midland Conference. Now, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. For each team, I should find their row index and the relevant column.\n\nFor Bellevue Bruin:\n- School: bellevue university\n- Mascot: bellevue bruins\nLooking at the data, they are in row 0 of the data array.\nSo, relevant cells would be row_index 0 for columns school and mascot.\n\nWait, no. The instruction says to list each relevant cell as a separate object with row_index and column_name. So for Bellevue, I need to note their row index (which is 0) and which columns are relevant. Since both \"school\" and \"mascot\" contain the name, but the claim refers to the mascot specifically. Hmm, maybe I should only consider the mascot column because the claim mentions the team names.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"bellevue bruin\" and \"york panther\". So for each of these, I need their row index and their mascot column. But actually, the table uses \"mascot\" as a column name, so that's the exact match.\n\nSo Bellevue Bruin is in row 0, column \"mascot\" with value \"bellevue bruins\". York Panther is in row 8 (since it's the last one, but let me check the data array: there are 9 rows because the first element is index 0. So row 8 is the ninth entry, which is york panthers.\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\nIndex 0: bellevue university\n...\nUp to index 8 (york college). So row_index for York is 8.\n\nSo, relevant_cells should include both their mascot entries.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are:\n- For Bellevue: row 0, column \"mascot\"\n- For York: row 8, column \"mascot\"\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"according to the date of founding, Peru State College be the oldest\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Peru State College is the oldest among the listed institutions because it was founded earliest. So, I need to look at the 'founded' column in the table for each school and see if Peru State College indeed has the highest founding year.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The data rows have these details. Let's list out the founding years for each institution:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary - 1923\n3. Concordia University - 1894\n4. Doane College - 1872\n5. Hastings College - 1882\n6. Midland University - 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887\n8. Peru State College - 1865\n9. York College - 1890\n\nWait, but wait a minute. According to the table provided, Peru State College is founded in 1865. That's the earliest among all listed. So, it should be the oldest.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm reading the table correctly. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- The first row after 'bellevue university' has \"peru state college\" with founded year 1865.\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Peru State College is indeed the oldest in this group based on the founding date. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim talks about the date of founding, so the 'founded' column is relevant. So, for Peru State College, which row is it? Looking at the data array:\n\nThe first data row is Bellevue University, then College of Saint Mary, then Concordia, etc. Wait, no, the first data row in the table is:\n\n[\n  \"bellevue university\",\n  \"bellevue bruins\",\n  \"midlands\",\n  14,\n  1966\n]\n\nThen next rows are College of Saint Mary, Concordia, etc. So Peru State College is the 8th row (index 7) in the data array.\n\nWait, no: let me count:\n\n0: Bellevue\n\n1: St. Mary\n\n2: Concordia\n\n3: Doane\n\n4: Hastings\n\n5: Midland\n\n6: Nebraska Wesleyan\n\n7: Peru State\n\nYes, so it's row index 7. So the relevant cells are row_index 7 and column_name \"founded\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells list includes {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"founded\"}.\n\nI think that's all.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"only 1 school, york college, have won more than 20 titles.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in JSON format. It has columns like school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The data includes various colleges with their respective details.\n\nThe claim says that only one school, York College, has won more than 20 national titles. So, I need to check each row in the 'national titles' column to see how many schools have titles over 20.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 14\n2. College of Saint Mary - 0\n3. Concordia University - 1\n4. Doane College - 10\n5. Hastings College - 3\n6. Midland University - 2\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 19\n8. Peru State College - 2\n9. York College - 28\n\nI notice that York College has 28 national titles, which is definitely more than 20. Now, I need to check if any other schools also have more than 20.\n\nBellevue has 14, which is less. Saint Mary has 0, so no. Concordia with 1 and Doane with 10 are both below 20. Hastings at 3, Midland at 2, Peru State at 2\u2014all under 20. Nebraska Wesleyan has 19, which is just shy of 20.\n\nSo, only York College meets the criterion of having more than 20 national titles. That seems to support the claim that only one school has done so. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm not missing any other schools with over 20. Let me count again:\n\n- York: 28\n- Bellevue:14\n- Saint Mary:0\n- Concordia:1\n- Doane:10\n- Hastings:3\n- Midland:2\n- Peru State:2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan:19\n\nYes, only York is above 20.

The claim says, \"with a total of 0 , the lowest number of national title belongs to the college of saint mary.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's in JSON format with columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The data rows include various universities along with their details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"national titles\" column. It mentions that the lowest number is 0 and belongs to the college of saint mary. So I need to check if Saint Mary's row in the table has 0 national titles.\n\nLooking through each row, let me identify which school is \"college of saint mary\". Scanning the first column:\n\n1. Bellevue University\n2. College of Saint Mary\n3. Concordia University\n4. Doane College\n5. Hastings College\n6. Midland University\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University\n8. Peru State College\n9. York College\n\nYes, row 1 (index 0 if starting from 0) is the college of saint mary.\n\nNow, check the \"national titles\" column for that row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"In term of its founding date, the youngest school is Bellevue University\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that when you look at how old the schools are (their founding dates), Bellevue University is the youngest among them. So, I need to check the \"founded\" column for all schools and see which one has the highest or earliest date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different school with details like name, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded year. The relevant column here is \"founded,\" so that's where I should focus.\n\nI'll list out the founding years from each row to see which is the most recent or earliest. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: 1923\n3. Concordia University: 1894\n4. Doane College: 1872\n5. Hastings College: 1882\n6. Midland University: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n8. Peru State College: 1865\n9. York College: 1890\n\nNow, comparing these numbers, the youngest would be the one with the highest year because that means it was founded more recently. Looking at the list, Bellevue University is the only one with a founding date in 1966, which is much later than all others listed here.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any rows. There are nine schools total, and Bellevue has the highest year, so it should be the youngest. The next closest would be Hastings (1882), Midland (1883), Nebraska Wesleyan (1887), York (1890), Concordia (1894), Peru State (1865), Doane (1872), and Saint Mary (1923). So yes, Bellevue is definitely the youngest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because when comparing founding dates, Bellevue University has the latest year, making it the youngest among the listed schools.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Bellevue University's founded year of 1966 is the most recent, making it the youngest school compared to others in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference.\" Hmm, that seems a bit off because I think Bellevue might not be the correct school when it comes to Nebraska teams. Anyway, let's check the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different college or university with details like school name, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded year. The columns are: school, mascot, conference, national titles, founded.\n\nFirst, I need to find all schools that are in Nebraska because the claim mentions \"nebraska team.\" Wait, actually, the table lists the conferences as either \"midlands\" or \"great plains.\" So, maybe the schools in the midland conference are the ones with \"midlands\" under the conference column. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Bellevue University is in the Midlands conference.\n- College of Saint Mary is also in the Midlands.\n- Concordia University and Doane College, Hastings College, Midland University, Nebraska Wesleyan University are all in the Great Plains conference.\n\nPeru State College and York College are also in the Midlands.\n\nNow, wait, but none of these schools seem to be from Nebraska. Wait, no\u2014Wait, the claim says \"nebraska team,\" so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim is about Nebraska teams in the Midland Conference. So perhaps I need to look for any Nebraska-based colleges or universities that are part of the Midland Conference.\n\nBut looking at the table, all the schools listed have either Midlands or Great Plains as their conference. None of them mention Nebraska except maybe Peru State College? Wait, no\u2014Peru State is in Nebraska, but its conference is Midlands.\n\nWait, but I don't see any other schools that might be from Nebraska besides those. Let me check each school:\n\n- Bellevue University: Located in Nebraska, part of Midlands conference.\n- College of Saint Mary: Also in Nebraska, Midlands.\n- Concordia University: Not in Nebraska, Great Plains.\n- Doane College: In Nebraska, Great Plains.\n- Hastings College: In Nebraska, Great Plains.\n- Midland University: In Nebraska, Great Plains.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: In Nebraska, Great Plains.\n- Peru State College: In Nebraska, Midlands.\n- York College: In Nebraska, Midlands.\n\nWait a minute, so all these schools are in Nebraska. But the claim is about \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference.\" So Bellevue Bruin is one team, but according to the table, there's also College of Saint Mary (Saint Mary Flames) and Peru State Bobcats and York Panthers, all in Midlands. So if the claim says Bellevue is the only Nebraska team in Midland Conference, that would be false because others are also there.\n\nBut wait, the user might have meant something else. Let me read the claim again: \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference.\" So it's saying Bellevue is the sole Nebraska school in Midland Conference. But according to the table, Bellevue is one of several Nebraska schools in Midlands.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be those that show other Nebraska schools in Midlands besides Bellevue. Looking at the columns:\n\n- For each row, check if the school is in Nebraska and conference is Midlands.\n- So, for Bellevue (row 0), it's Nebraska and Midlands\u2014so yes.\n- College of Saint Mary (row 1): Nebraska and Midlands\u2014yes.\n- Peru State College (row 7): Nebraska and Midlands\u2014yes.\n- York College (row 8): Nebraska and Midlands\u2014yes.\n\nSo, there are multiple Nebraska schools in the Midland Conference. Therefore, the claim is false because Bellevue isn't the only one.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant: each of these schools (Bellevue, Saint Mary, Peru State, York) would be relevant as they contradict the claim. So I need to list their row indices and the column name \"conference\" to check that they are indeed in Midlands.\n\nWait, but for the answer, I just need to state whether it's TRUE or FALSE, which is FALSE, and then list the cells that confirm this. The cells would be those where school is Nebraska and conference is Midlands, because that shows other teams besides Bellevue playing in Midland Conference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to something else, but based on the given data, the claim isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference.\" However, upon examining the table, there are multiple Nebraska schools listed under the Midlands conference, including College of Saint Mary and Peru State College.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"peru state college be the last institution founded in the 19th century\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Peru State College was the last institution established in the 19th century. That means I need to check when each institution in the table was founded and see if Peru State College indeed has the latest founding date in the 1800s.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"founded\" column seems relevant here. Let me list out all the values in that column:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nWait, I see that some of these are in the 19th century. The 19th century runs from 1801 to 1900. So any institution founded after 1900 wouldn't count for this claim.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Concordia University: 1894 (19th century)\n- Doane College: 1872 (19th century)\n- Hastings College: 1882 (19th century)\n- Midland University: 1883 (19th century)\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887 (19th century)\n- Peru State College: 1865 (19th century)\n- York College: 1890 (19th century)\n\nBellevue and Saint Mary are founded in the 20th century, so they don't apply here.\n\nNow, I need to find which of these institutions were founded later in the 19th century. The claim says Peru State is last, but let me check all of them:\n\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1872 is earlier than 1883, which is before 1887, and so on until York at 1890.\n\nSo the latest among these would be York College with 1890. But Peru State College was founded in 1865, which is earlier than York's 1890.\n\nWait, that means Peru State isn't the last one. So the claim is FALSE because York College has a later founding year (1890) within the 19th century.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nPeru State: 1865\n\nYork College: 1890\n\nSo York was founded later in the 19th century than Peru State. So the claim that Peru State is last would be incorrect because York comes after Peru State and also is in the 19th century.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows again to ensure I didn't miss any:\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n0: peru state college (1865)\n1: college of saint mary (1923)\n2: concordia university (1894)\n3: doane college (1872)\n4: hastings college (1882)\n5: midland university (1883)\n6: nebraska wesleyan university (1887)\n7: peru state college (1865)\n8: york college (1890)\n\nWait, row 7 is again Peru State College with 1865. So in the table, the relevant columns are \"founded\" and perhaps \"school name\".\n\nSo to verify the claim, I need to look at the 'founded' year for each institution. The claim says Peru State is last, so their founded year should be the highest among all institutions in the 19th century.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- 1865 (Peru)\n- 1872 (Doane)\n- 1882 (Hastings)\n- 1883 (Midland)\n- 1887 (Nebraska Wesleyan)\n- 1890 (York)\n\nSo York is the latest in the 19th century. Therefore, Peru State isn't the last. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014Peru State is in row 0 and row 7? No, looking back, the data array has:\n\nRow 0: peru state college (1865)\nRow 1: saint mary (1923)\nRow 2: concordia (1894)\nRow 3: doane (1872)\nRow 4: hastings (1882)\nRow 5: midland (1883)\nRow 6: nebraska wesleyan (1887)\nRow 7: peru state college (1865) \u2014 wait, no. Wait, the data array has 9 rows. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table's \"data\" array:\n\n[\n  [\"bellevue university\", ... , 1966], // row 0\n  ..., // row1\n  ..., // row2: concordia (1894)\n  ..., // row3: doane (1872)\n  ..., // row4: hastings (1882)\n  ..., // row5: midland (1883)\n  ..., // row6: nebraska wesleyan (1887)\n  ..., // row7: peru state college, 1865\n  [\"york college\", ..., 1890] // row8\n]\n\nSo rows 0 to 8. So in row 7, it's Peru State again? Wait no, the data array has 9 elements, each representing a row. The first row is Bellevue (1966), then College of Saint Mary (1923), then Concordia (1894), then Doane (1872), Hastings (1882), Midland (1883), Nebraska Wesleyan (1887), then Peru State (1865) in row 7, and finally York College in row8 with 1890.\n\nWait no, the data array is as follows:\n\n- Index 0: Bellevue\n- Index1: Saint Mary\n- Index2: Concordia\n- Index3: Doane\n- Index4: Hastings\n- Index5: Midland\n- Index6: Nebraska Wesleyan\n- Index7: Peru State (1865)\n- Index8: York College (1890)\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the data array in the table, it's a list of 9 arrays. Each corresponds to one row.\n\nThe first element is [ \"bellevue university\", ... , 1966 ] which would be row index 0.\n\nThen college of saint mary is row1.\n\nConcordia is row2.\n\nDoane: row3.\n\nHastings: row4.\n\nMidland: row5.\n\nNebraska Wesleyan: row6.\n\nPeru State: row7? Or wait, the table shows data as:\n\n[\n  [\"bellevue university\", ... , 1966],\n  [ ..., 1923],\n  [ ..., 1894],\n  [ ..., 1872],\n  [ ..., 1882],\n  [ ..., 1883],\n  [ ..., 1887],\n  [ \"peru state college\", ..., 1865 ],\n  [ \"york college\", ..., 1890 ]\n]\n\nWait, no. Let me check the data array as given:\n\nThe user wrote the data array as:\n\n[\n  [\"bellevue university\", ... , 1966], // row0\n  [\"college of saint mary\", ... , 1923], // row1\n  [\"concordia university\", ..., 1894], // row2\n  [\"doane college\", ..., 1872], // row3\n  [\"hastings college\", ..., 1882], // row4\n  [\"midland university\", ..., 1883], // row5\n  [\"nebraska wesleyan university\", ..., 1887], // row6\n  [\"peru state college\", ..., 1865], // row7\n  [\"york college\", ..., 1890] // row8\n]\n\nSo in this case, Peru State is at row7 with 1865, and York is at row8 with 1890.\n\nTherefore, the latest founded year among institutions that are still in operation in the 19th century (since 1923 is outside) would be York's 1890. So the claim that Peru State is last is incorrect; hence, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Peru State College is the last institution to close\" is based on an analysis of the founding years of each listed institution. The task involves determining which institution closed latest by examining their founding years.\n\nTo evaluate this claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Extract the founding year for each institution from the provided list.\n2. **Determine the Most Recent Closure**: Identify the institution with the highest founding year that falls within the 19th century (1800s).\n3. **Compare with Claimed Institution**: Check if Peru State College's closing year matches this highest value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **List of Institutions and Their Founding Years:**\n   - Bellevue University: 1966 (20th century)\n   - College of Saint Mary: 1923 (early 20th century)\n   - Concordia University: 1894\n   - Doane College: 1872\n   - Hastings College: 1882\n   - Midland University: 1883\n   - Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n   - Peru State College: 1865\n   - York College: 1890\n\n2. **Identify the Latest Closure in the 19th Century:**\n   - Among institutions still operating in the 19th century, the latest founding year is **1890** (York College).\n\n3. **Compare with Peru State College:**\n   - Peru State College closed in **1865**, earlier than York's 1890.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPeru State College did not close last among the listed institutions. Instead, York College had its founding year in 1890, making it the most recent closure within the 19th century. Therefore, the original claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim that Peru State College is the last institution to close is false; York College closed later in the 19th century.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim states: \"only 2 schools, york college and peru state college, have won more than 20 times.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that only two schools in the table have achieved more than 20 national titles. According to the table data, there are several columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded year.\n\nMy task is to check which schools have more than 20 national titles. So I should look at the \"national titles\" column for each row and see which schools have values greater than 20.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 14 national titles.\n2. College of Saint Mary - 0.\n3. Concordia University - 1.\n4. Doane College - 10.\n5. Hastings College - 3.\n6. Midland University - 2.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 19.\n8. Peru State College - 2.\n9. York College - 28.\n\nNow, let's identify which schools have more than 20 national titles. Only one school stands out here: York College with 28 national titles. None of the others reach 21 or more. \n\nThe claim says \"only 2 schools\" but according to this, only York College has over 20 titles. Peru State College has 2, which is not over 20, so it doesn't qualify.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's only one school (York College) with more than 20 national titles, not two as stated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"national titles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the college of saint mary hold the highest number of national title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. The table has five columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. Each row represents a different college with their respective details.\n\nThe claim in question is about the number of national titles that the College of Saint Mary holds. So, my first step is to locate where the College of Saint Mary is in the data. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Bellevue University\n- Row 1: College of Saint Mary\n- Row 2: Concordia University\n- And so on.\n\nSo, the College of Saint Mary is in row index 1. Now, I need to check the value in the \"national titles\" column for this specific row. From the table data, the national titles for the College of Saint Mary are listed as 0, which is found under the third column (index-wise, it's column 3 since columns start at 0).\n\nNext, I should verify if this number is indeed the highest among all the colleges listed. To do this, I'll need to compare the national titles column across all rows. Let me list out the national titles for each school:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0\n3. Concordia University: 1\n4. Doane College: 10\n5. Hastings College: 3\n6. Midland University: 2\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19\n8. Peru State College: 2\n9. York College: 28\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest number of national titles is 28, held by York College. The College of Saint Mary has only 0 national titles, which is the lowest in this group.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the College of Saint Mary holds the highest number of national titles is definitely FALSE.\n\nNow, to provide the relevant cells for the JSON response. I need to specify the row index and column name where the relevant data is found. Since we're looking at the \"national titles\" of the College of Saint Mary, which is in row 1 (index 1) and column \"national titles\". \n\nSo, the relevant_cells should be a list containing an object for each cell that's relevant. In this case, only one cell is relevant: row 1, column \"national titles\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we first locate the College of Saint Mary in the table, which is at row index 1. The national titles for this school are listed as 0. Comparing this to other schools' national titles, York College has the highest with 28. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell is where the College of Saint Mary's national titles (0) are located: row 1 and column \"national titles\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "bellevue university be the first college found in the 20th century",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Bellevue University be the first college founded in the 20th century\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that Bellevue University was the very first college established during the 20th century. That means I should look for when Bellevue University was founded and see if it's the earliest among all the colleges listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different college with various attributes like school name, mascot, conference, national titles, and founding year. The relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"founded.\" Since the claim is about the founding date, I should focus on the \"founded\" column.\n\nNow, let me go through each row to find out the founding years of all colleges:\n\n1. Bellevue University: founded in 1966.\n2. College of Saint Mary: founded in 1923.\n3. Concordia University: founded in 1894.\n4. Doane College: founded in 1872.\n5. Hastings College: founded in 1882.\n6. Midland University: founded in 1883.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: founded in 1887.\n8. Peru State College: founded in 1865.\n9. York College: founded in 1890.\n\nWait a second, the claim is about the 20th century. The 20th century runs from 1901 to 2000, right? So any college founded before 1901 wouldn't count because they were established earlier than the 20th century.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966 (within 20th century)\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923 (within 20th century)\n- Concordia University: 1894 (19th century, so not relevant for this claim)\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nSo the colleges founded in the 20th century are Bellevue (1966) and Saint Mary (1923). Now, who was founded earlier between these two? Saint Mary was founded in 1923, which is earlier than Bellevue's 1966.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the first college,\" meaning the earliest in the 20th century. So if both are in the 20th century, Saint Mary would be the first one, not Bellevue. Therefore, the claim that Bellevue is the first is incorrect. It should be Saint Mary, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The table has nine colleges listed, and among them, only two were founded in the 20th century (1923 and 1966). So yes, Bellevue isn't the first; it's the second college in the 20th century based on this data.\n\nAnother thing to consider: sometimes institutions might have different names or be part of larger universities now, but according to the table, they are listed as separate entities. So I don't think that affects the founding date comparison.\n\nAlso, checking for any possible mistake in the years\u2014Saint Mary was founded in 1923, which is indeed within the 20th century and earlier than Bellevue's 1966.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because Saint Mary College was established earlier in the 20th century than Bellevue University. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
