    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"french and portuguese be the language for the film title used in nomination for eles.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It's talking about languages associated with a film's title when it was nominated. Specifically, it mentions French and Portuguese as the languages, and refers to \"elles\" as the film title.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, result. The data rows provide information for each of these categories for different films.\n\nI need to find if there's a row where:\n- The film title used in nomination is \"elles\".\n- The languages include both French and Portuguese.\n- It was nominated (so the result would be \"not nominated\"? Wait, no. Because being disqualified or not nominated affects it. But in this claim, it says \"french and portuguese be the language for the film title use in nomination for elles\". So I think it's about whether the languages include French and Portuguese when \"elles\" was nominated.\n\nWait, let me rephrase: The claim is stating that for the film \"elles,\" both French and Portuguese are the languages used in its nomination. But looking at the table, let's check each row where the film title is \"elles\".\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 0:\nyear (70th), \"elles\", \"elles\", \"french , portuguese\", director, \"not nominated\"\n\nSo here, for the 1997 ceremony, the film used in nomination is \"elles\". The original title is also \"elles\". Languages are French and Portuguese. The result is \"not nominated\".\n\nSo this row matches both the film title being \"elles\" and languages being French and Portuguese.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be referring to this case. So the statement is true because for \"elles,\" the languages used in the nomination are indeed French and Portuguese.\n\nI should make sure there's no other row where \"elles\" is the film title with different languages or something else, but from the table, it's only row 0 that has \"elles\" as the film title. So this seems to be the correct row.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE because in the data, the relevant cells support it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true based on the data provided in the table where \"french and portuguese\" are listed as languages for the film \"elles.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"French be the language use for the film title used in nomination for r\u00e9fractaire.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate directly to the data in the table. The key elements here are \"film title used in nomination,\" \"language,\" and \"r\u00e9fractaire.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with various details. To check this claim, I need to find the row where the film title is \"refractaire\" or similar and see what language it's listed under.\n\nI'll go through each row of the data:\n\n1. The first entry (1997) is about \"elles,\" not relevant.\n2. Second (1998) talks about \"back in trouble,\" not relevant.\n3. Third (2003) mentions \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte,\" which translates to \"I Always Wanted to Be a Saint.\" Not the film in question.\n4. Fourth entry (2005) is about \"le roman de renart,\" so \"Renard the Fox.\" Not relevant.\n5. Fifth row (2006) mentions \"your name is justine\" and languages are Polish and English. Disqualified, but not relevant to the claim.\n6. Sixth row (2007) discusses \"perl oder pica,\" which isn't \"refractaire.\"\n7. Seventh entry (2008) talks about \"nuits d'arabie,\" so not relevant.\n8. Eighth row (2009) is for \"r\u00e9gfractaire\" in French, with the language as French.\n\nWait, I think there's a typo here. The claim refers to \"r\u00e9fractaire,\" but the table has it as \"refractaire.\" Maybe they're the same? In any case, looking at row 7 (2009), the film title used in nomination is \"r\u00e9gfractaire\" and the language is French. \n\nSo, the relevant columns here are \"film title used in nomination,\" which is \"r\u00e9gfractaire,\" and the column for languages, which is French. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because in that row, the film's title in nomination uses French as the language.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the original title le roman de renart have 1 language.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find where the original title \"le roman de renart\" appears. Let me scan through each row of the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: columns are year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, result.\n\nI need to check the 'original title' column for \"le roman de renart.\" Scanning down:\n\n- Row 0: original title is \"elles\" \u2013 not it.\n- Row 1: \"back in trouble\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\" \u2013 that's French, but the original title isn't \"le roman de renart.\"\n- Row 3: The original title here is \"le roman de renart.\" Yes, that's the one we're looking for. So row index is 3.\n\nNow, in the same row (row 3), check the 'languages' column. What does it say? It says \"french\". Wait, but the claim says \"have 1 language.\" \n\nWait, in the table, under languages, it's listed as \"french,\" which is singular. So that means only one language. But let me double-check if there's more than one language. The original title's languages are just \"french\" here.\n\nSo the original title \"le roman de renart\" has only one language, which is French. Therefore, the claim that it has 1 language is true.\n\nI also need to note which cells are relevant. So for row index 3, the columns would be 'original title' and 'languages'. But wait, the claim refers to \"original title le roman de renart,\" so I should check both the original title column and the languages column in that row.\n\nWait no, the original title is a value in the 'original title' column. The claim is about the number of languages for that original title, which is found in the 'languages' column.\n\nBut perhaps the relevant cells are the row where the original title is \"le roman de renart\" and both the original title and languages columns because it's about that specific title's language count.\n\nSo I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 3, column_name: \"original title\"\n- row_index: 3, column_name: \"languages\"\n\nI should list these in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the original title and its languages.

The claim says, \"the result of the 2005 (78th) ceremony be not nominate.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. The table has several columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result. Each row corresponds to a different year.\n\nI'll start by finding the 2005 (78th) ceremony in the table. Scanning through the \"year (ceremony)\" column, I see that one of the rows is \"2005 (78th)\". So that's the relevant row, which should be row index 3 since the first row is 1997.\n\nNow, within this row, there are several columns to check. The claim specifically mentions the result, so I need to look at the \"result\" column for this row. According to the table, under \"result\", it says \"not nominated.\"\n\nSo putting it together: In 2005 (78th), the result was \"not nominated.\" Therefore, the claim that the result was not nominate is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because in the year 2005 (78th), the result was indeed not nominated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"pol cruchten be the director for the original title perl oder pica\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main parts: the director's name and the original title. It states that Pol Cruchten was the director for a film whose original title is \"perl oder pica.\" So, my goal is to find in the table whether there's an entry where the director is Pol Cruchten and the original title is \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result. The data rows contain various entries corresponding to these columns.\n\nI'll need to go through each row of the data array to check for the presence of both \"pol cruchten\" as the director and \"perl oder pica\" as the original title.\n\nLet me start by examining each row:\n\n1. First row: Director is \"lueds galvao teles,\" original title is \"elles.\" Doesn't match.\n2. Second row: Director is \"andy bausch,\" original title is \"back in trouble.\" No match.\n3. Third row: Director is \"genevi\u00e8ve mersch,\" original title is \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte.\" Not matching.\n4. Fourth row: Director is \"thierry schiel,\" original title is \"le roman de renart.\" Nope.\n5. Fifth row: Director is \"franco de pena,\" original title is \"your name is justine.\" Doesn't fit.\n6. Sixth row: Director is \"pol cruchten,\" original title is \"perl oder pica.\" Wait, here's a possible match! The original title matches \"perl oder pica\" and the director is listed as \"pol cruchten.\"\n7. Seventh row: Director is \"paul kieffer,\" original title is \"nuits d'arabie.\" Doesn't match.\n8. Eighth row: Director is \"nicolas steil,\" original title is \"r\u00e8fractaire.\" No match.\n\nFrom this, the sixth row seems to have both \"pol cruchten\" as the director and \"perl oder pica\" as the original title. However, I should double-check the columns to make sure I'm not mixing up any data points.\n\nLooking at the sixth row:\n\n- year (ceremony): 2007 (80th)\n- film title used in nomination: \"little secrets\"\n- original title: \"perl oder pica\"\n- languages: \"l\u00ebtzebuergesch\" (which is Luxembourgish, a language spoken in Luxembourg)\n- director: \"pol cruchten\"\n- result: \"not nominated\"\n\nSo yes, the director for the film with the original title \"perl oder pica\" is indeed Pol Cruchten. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any other rows where these two pieces of information might appear together again or if perhaps another row matches better. From the data provided, only the sixth row has both the director as Pol Cruchten and the original title as \"perl oder pica.\" So that seems to be the only relevant entry.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm not missing any details. For example, sometimes films have alternate titles or multiple directors, but based on this table, each row represents a single film submission with its own director and original title.\n\nAnother thing to consider is case sensitivity. The claim uses \"pol cruchten\" in lowercase, while the table has it as is. Since the column data appears to be case-sensitive (e.g., original titles have accents and specific cases), but the director's name here is also in lowercase. Therefore, it matches correctly.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the data, the claim that Pol Cruchten was the director for the film titled \"perl oder pica\" is supported by the sixth row of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where Pol Cruchten is listed as the director and the original title is \"perl oder pica.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the data, I see that \"renart the fox\" appears in row 4 (since it's the fifth element in the data array, but indices start at 0). So row index 4.\n\nNow, the claim says \"be in polish and english.\" Looking at the table columns, there's a column called \"languages.\" For row 4, the languages are listed as \"french.\" Wait, that doesn't match. The original title is also \"le roman de renart,\" which is French, but the claim refers to Polish and English.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. In the table, for the fifth entry (row 4), the languages are \"french\" only. So \"renart the fox\" is in French, not Polish or English. That seems contradictory to the claim which says it's in Polish and English.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at another column, like \"original title.\" For row 4, the original title is \"le roman de renart,\" which is French. There's also a \"director\" column, but that doesn't relate to languages. The \"result\" for row 4 is \"not nominated.\"\n\nSo, putting it together: the claim states that \"renart the fox\" is in Polish and English. But according to the table, the film is listed under French, with no Polish or English mentioned. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm looking at the right columns. The claim talks about the film's languages, so it's probably best to focus on the \"languages\" column in each row where \"renart the fox\" appears. Since there's only one occurrence of that film title in the table, and its language is French, not Polish or English, the claim is false.\n\nI think I'm confident enough now.

Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It states that \"your name is justine\" is in French. To verify this, I should look for any relevant cells in the table that mention both the film title used in nomination and whether it's in French.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related to the claim would likely be \"film title used in nomination\" and perhaps another column that specifies languages or original titles. Wait, the table has a specific column called \"original title,\" but I'm more interested in how the film was nominated\u2014so maybe \"film title used in nomination\" is where the alternative title would be listed.\n\nNow, scanning through the data rows:\n\n- The first row mentions \"elles,\" which seems to be French.\n- Second row: \"back in trouble\"\u2014doesn't relate.\n- Third row: \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\"\u2014that's French for \"I always wanted to be a saint.\"\n- Fourth row: \"le roman de renart\"\u2014also French.\n- Fifth row: Here's the film title \"your name is justine.\" Looking at the original title, it's also \"your name is justine,\" and under languages, it says Polish and English. But the claim is about the film being in French.\n\nWait, but looking again, the fifth row has the film title used in nomination as \"your name is justine\" and the original title is the same. The languages column lists Polish and English, so the original language isn't French. Hmm, that seems conflicting with the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"your name is justine be in french.\" So does it mean that the film's title is \"your name is justine\" and it's in French? But according to the table, both film title and original title are the same as \"your name is justine,\" but the languages are Polish and English. So perhaps the film's language isn't French, which would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another row where this applies.

Hmm, perhaps years are not in order, but that doesn't affect our check.\n\nWait, the fifth row is for 2006 (79th). The film title used in nomination is \"your name is justine,\" and original title same, languages Polish and English. So it was disqualified, which might mean it wasn't a nominee or winner, but the claim is about the language of the film.\n\nBut according to the table, this film's languages are Polish and English, so the French version isn't listed here. Maybe another entry?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The original title for \"your name is justine\" might be in French elsewhere? Or maybe I misread the columns.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- For 2006 (79th), film title used in nomination: \"your name is justine,\" original title same. Languages: Polish, English.\n\nSo if the claim says that this film is in French, but according to the table, it's not listed as a French language for this particular entry. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because the data shows the languages are Polish and English.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm confusing \"original title\" with \"film title.\" The original title might be in French elsewhere. Let me check other rows:\n\n- 1997: \"elles\"\u2014French.\n- 2003: French original title.\n- 2005: French original title.\n- 2006: Not French.\n- 2008: French and Arabic.\n- 2009: French.\n\nSo only some of the films are in French, but for \"your name is justine,\" it's not listed as French.

The table has several columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result. Each row represents a different entry with these details.\n\nThe claim is about two specific pieces of information:\n1. \"le roman de renart\" being the original title.\n2. This original title corresponds to \"little secret\".\n\nI need to check if there's an entry where the original title is \"le roman de renart\" and the film title used in nomination or another relevant column matches \"little secret\". \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Original title is \"elles\", which doesn't match.\n- Row 1: Original title is \"back in trouble\", no match.\n- Row 2: Original title is \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\", not matching.\n- Row 3: Original title is \"le roman de renart\". Now, I should check if the film title used in nomination for this row is \"little secret\".\n\nLooking at the 'film title used in nomination' column:\nIn row 3, the film title is listed as \"renart the fox\".

Let me think. The claim says \"le roman de renart\" is the original title for \"little secret\". So in the table, I should look for a row where 'original title' is \"le roman de renart\" and the corresponding 'film title used in nomination' is \"little secret\".\n\nBut looking at row 3:\n- film title: \"renart the fox\"\n- original title: \"le roman de renart\"\n\nThis doesn't match because the film title isn't \"little secret\". Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps \"little secret\" is another version of \"le roman de renart\"?\n\nWait, in row 3, 'original title' is \"le roman de renart\", and the languages are French. So the film might have been submitted under that original title but translated into other languages for nomination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a row where both the original title is \"le roman de renart\" and the film title used in nomination is \"little secret\".\n\nBut in the table, row 3 has 'film title' as \"renart the fox\", which doesn't match. So perhaps there's no such row.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I'm supposed to check if any of the other columns have a connection.

But in the table, the film titles don't include \"little secret\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong columns. Maybe the 'original title' is \"le roman de renart\", and the claim says it's used for \"little secret\". So if the film's original title is \"le roman de renart\" but was nominated under another name, like \"perl oder pica\" in row 5, that might not be relevant.\n\nWait no, looking at row 5: \n- Original title: \"perl oder pica\"\n- Film title used: \"little secrets\"\n\nHmm, maybe the claim is mixing up original and film titles. Let me re-examine each row's data:\n\nRow 3:\n- year: 2005 (78th)\n- film title: \"renart the fox\"\n- original title: \"le roman de renart\"\n- languages: French\n- director: thierry schiel\n- result: not nominated\n\nSo, here, the original title is \"le roman de renart\", but the film submitted was titled \"renart the fox\". Therefore, if the claim says that \"le roman de renart\" is the original title for \"little secret\", we need to check if any row has both \"le roman de renart\" as original and \"little secret\" as the film title.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Only row 3 has \"le roman de renart\" as original.\n- None of the rows have \"little secret\" in the 'film title used in nomination' column. The closest is row 6, which has \"perl oder pica\" as the film title but lists languages as l\u00ebtzebuergesch.\n\nWait, actually, row 6:\n- film title: \"perl oder pica\"\n- original title: \"l\u00ebtzebuergesch\"\n\nNo, that's not it. So perhaps there is no row where 'original title' is \"le roman de renart\" and 'film title used in nomination' is \"little secret\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to the fact that \"le roman de renart\" was submitted under a different name, but I don't see any matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's a row where both the original title is \"le roman de renart\" and the film title used in nomination is \"little secret\". But looking at the table:\n\nNo such row exists. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because \"le roman de renart\" doesn't correspond to \"little secret\" in any of the entries.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship between original title and film title. Let me think again: The 'original title' might be the official title, while the film title used in nomination could be a different version or translation.\n\nBut in this case, for row 3, the film is submitted as \"renart the fox\", with the original title being \"le roman de renart\". So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's stating that \"le roman de renart\" is the original for \"little secret\", but in reality, the film was submitted under a different name.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"le roman de renart\" is the original title of \"little secret\". Checking each row:\n\n- Only row 3 has \"le roman de renart\" as the original title. Its film title is \"renart the fox\", not \"little secret\".\n- No other rows mention \"little secret\".\n\nThus, there's no evidence supporting the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. There is no entry where \"le roman de renart\" is listed as the original title of \"little secret.\"\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"renart the fox have the original title of perl oder pica\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that \"Renart the Fox\" has an original title of \"perl oder pica.\" So, essentially, it's saying that the original title of the film \"Renart the Fox\" is \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to find any relevant cells that might support or contradict this claim. The columns in the table are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result.\n\nSince the claim is about the original title of \"Renart the Fox,\" I should focus on the columns that relate to the original title and the film's title. That would be the \"original title\" column and the \"film title used in nomination\" column.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see if any mention \"Renart the Fox.\" Let me look through the \"film title used in nomination\" column first because that's where the main titles are listed.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- 1997: \"elles\"\n- 1998: \"back in trouble\"\n- 2003: \"i always wanted to be a saint\"\n- 2005: \"renart the fox\"\n- 2006: \"your name is justine\"\n- 2007: \"little secrets\"\n- 2008: \"nuits d'arabie\"\n- 2009: \"refractaire\"\n\nSo, in 2005, the film title used in nomination is \"renart the fox.\" That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check what the original title was for that same film. The \"original title\" column has entries like:\n- 1997: \"elles\"\n- 1998: \"back in trouble\"\n- 2003: \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\"\n- 2005: \"le roman de renart\"\n- 2006: \"your name is justine\"\n- etc.\n\nWait, for the 2005 row, the original title is listed as \"le roman de renart.\" So, that's different from \"perl oder pica.\" Hmm, but I remember that \"Renart the Fox\" might have another version or translation. Could it be that \"perl oder pica\" is a translation or alternative title in another language?\n\nLooking at the languages column for 2005: it says \"french.\" So the original title was in French as \"le roman de renart,\" but perhaps there's an alternative title in another language, like German, which would be \"perl oder pica.\" \n\nWait, the claim is about the original title being \"perl oder pica.\" If the original title is \"le roman de renart\" in French and maybe \"perl oder pica\" in L\u00ebtzebuergesch (which is Luxembourgish), then perhaps the original title isn't exactly \"perl oder pica,\" but it's the same story translated into different languages.\n\nBut in the table, for each film, the \"original title\" seems to be the one listed first. For example, in 2005, the original title is \"le roman de renart.\" So that would mean that the claim is incorrect because the original title isn't \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nAlternatively, if \"perl oder pica\" is another name for \"Renart the Fox,\" perhaps as a different language version, then maybe it's considered an alternative title rather than the original. But in the context of the table, each row lists the film's title used in nomination (which might be the title they were nominated under) and the original title.\n\nSo, if the claim is stating that \"Renart the Fox\" has the original title \"perl oder pica,\" but according to the table, the original title for that film is \"le roman de renart,\" then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The 2005 row: film title used in nomination is \"renart the fox,\" and the original title is \"le roman de renart.\" So the original title is not \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nBut perhaps \"perl oder pica\" is another version of it, maybe in Luxembourgish. Let me check if any other rows have \"perl oder pica\" as their original title. Looking through the table:\n\n- 2007: original title is \"l\u00ebtzebuergesch,\" which I think is Luxembourgish. The film title used in nomination is \"perl oder pica.\" So, for that row, the film title is \"perl oder pica,\" and the original title is the Luxembourgish version, perhaps \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nWait, but no, in 2007, the film title used in nomination is \"little secrets,\" and the original title is \"perl oder pica.\" So that's a different film. In 2005, it's about \"renart the fox\" with an original title of \"le roman de renart.\"\n\nSo, to clarify: The claim is specifically saying that \"Renart the Fox\" has the original title \"perl oder pica.\" But according to the table, in 2005, the film titled \"renart the fox\" (used in nomination) has an original title of \"le roman de renart,\" not \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused about whether \"perl oder pica\" is considered the original title or just another title. Maybe the claim is implying that \"Renart the Fox\" was known as \"perl oder pica,\" which could be correct if it's an alternative name in a different language. However, according to the table, for the film \"renart the fox,\" the original title is \"le roman de renart.\" So the original title isn't \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Renart the Fox\" has an original title of \"perl oder pica.\" However, according to the table, the film's original title for the entry titled \"renart the fox\" in 2005 is \"le roman de renart,\" not \"perl oder pica.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the original title for refractaire be back in trouble\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. The claim has two main points:\n1. The original title of a film is referred to as \"refractaire.\"\n2. This original title is associated with the film titled \"back in trouble.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an entry from 1997 to 2009. The columns include \"year (ceremony),\" \"film title used in nomination,\" \"original title,\" \"languages,\" \"director,\" and \"result.\"\n\nTo check if \"refractaire\" is the original title of a film, I'll look for rows where the original title column matches that term. Similarly, I need to see if this original title is associated with \"back in trouble\" as its film title.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- 1997: Original title \"elles,\" not matching.\n- 1998: Original title \"back in trouble.\" Now, check if any other column refers to \"refractaire.\" It's not here; the original title is \"back in trouble.\"\n- 2003 onwards: None of these have \"refractaire\" as the original title.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says \"the original title for refractaire be back in trouble.\" So, does that mean the film \"back in trouble\" has its original title as \"refractaire\"?\n\nLooking at row 1998, the film title used is \"back in trouble,\" and the original title is also \"back in trouble.\" So there's no mention of \"refractaire\" here.\n\nI need to check if any other row has \"refractaire\" as either the original or the film title. The only occurrence is row 2009: original title \"r\u00e9mifraire,\" which might be a typo, but it doesn't match \"refractaire.\"\n\nSo, in the table, there's no film where the original title is \"refractaire,\" nor is \"back in trouble\" linked to that original title.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
