    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"player gil morgan represents the united state tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are three main points here:\n\n1. Player: Gil Morgan\n2. Place: Tie for 7th\n3. To Par: -2\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the \"player\" column in the data rows, I search for \"gil morgan.\" Scanning through each row... Yes, there's a row where player is \"gil morgan.\" Let me note that down.\n\nNext, place. The claim mentions \"tie for 7th place.\" In the table, the \"place\" column has values like \"1,\" \"t2,\" \"4,\" \"t5,\" and so on. I need to see if any of these are a tie for 7th. Scanning through, I see multiple rows with \"t7\" in the place column. So, yes, there is a tie at 7th place.\n\nLastly, to par. The claim says \"-2.\" Looking at the \"to par\" column, one row has \"-2.\" That's correct.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
