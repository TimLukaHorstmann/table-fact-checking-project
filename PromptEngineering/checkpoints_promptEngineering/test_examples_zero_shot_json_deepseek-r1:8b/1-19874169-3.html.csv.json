    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then compare it with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"yes! fm broadcast.\" Looking at the table, each row starts with \"yes! fm...\" followed by a specific location. So, the brand name is consistent across all entries. That part seems to match, but I don't know if that's enough on its own.\n\nNext, it says \"broadcast at 101.1 mhz.\" So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table where the frequency is exactly 101.1 MHz. Let me look through each row:\n\n- Row 0: frequency is \"101.1 mhz\" \u2013 that's a match.\n- Row 1: frequency is \"104.1 mhz\"\n- Row 2: frequency is \"91.1 mhz\"\n- Row 3: frequency is \"106.3 mhz\"\n- Row 4: frequency is \"104.7 mhz\"\n\nSo, only the first row has a frequency of 101.1 mhz. Now, I need to check where in the table this occurs. The relevant columns for the claim are \"frequency\" and perhaps \"location,\" but the claim doesn't mention location, so maybe it's not needed. But since the question is about the accuracy of the claim regarding the frequency, the location might be a secondary point.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim has two parts: \"yes! fm broadcast\" and \"broadcast at 101.1 mhz.\" So I need to confirm both parts are true based on the data.\n\nLooking back, the first part is about the brand name. All entries have \"yes! fm,\" so that's correct. But does the term \"broadcast\" apply here? The column names are branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location. \"Broadcast\" isn't a specific column, but since all entries have the same branding, it's implied they are broadcasting.\n\nBut for the second part of the claim, the important part is the frequency. Only row 0 has 101.1 mhz. So the claim that yes! fm broadcasts at 101.1 mhz is TRUE because there is an entry with that exact frequency. However, I should check if any other rows also have this frequency or if it's unique.\n\nLooking again, none of the other frequencies match 101.1 mhz, so only row 0 has that specific frequency. Therefore, the claim is supported by at least one row in the table.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: since both \"branding\" and \"frequency\" are involved, I need to include cells from these columns for the row where frequency matches. So row index 0, columns branding and frequency.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to list each relevant cell as a separate object in the array. So each occurrence where a condition is met should be included. Since both \"branding\" and \"frequency\" are part of the claim, I need to include their cells for row 0.\n\nSo, the answer is TRUE because there's an entry with branding yes! fm and frequency 101.1 mhz. The relevant_cells would be the cells in row 0 for branding and frequency.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro be the branding for the call sign dxyr.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part of the claim means and check it against the table.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" is the branding.\n2. The call sign is \"dxyr\".\n\nI should look for a row in the table where the brand matches this, and also see if the corresponding call sign is dxyr.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\nThere are five rows, each representing a different radio station with various details like branding, callsign, frequency, power, and location.\n\nLet me check each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Branding is \"yes! fm 101.1\", Callsign is \"dwys\". Doesn't match.\n- Row 1: Branding is \"yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\", Callsign is \"dzvm\". Not our target.\n- Row 2: Branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\", Callsign is \"dyyr\". Hmm, this callsign doesn't match dxyr.\n- Row 3: Branding is \"yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\", Callsign is \"dyyd\". Still not matching.\n- Row 4: Branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\", Callsign is \"dxyr\". This matches both the branding and the call sign mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, in row 4, both conditions are satisfied. The branding is exactly what's stated, and the callsign matches dxyr.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that there aren't any other rows with the same branding or callsign that might affect this. Scanning through again, no other entries have \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" as branding. The callsign dxyr only appears once in row 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"branding\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"1 kw be the power for yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, let's look at the components of the claim. The station name is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay,\" and the power is stated as \"1 kw.\" So I need to check if this particular row in the table has a power value of 1 kw.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different radio station with details like branding, callsign, frequency, power, and location. The columns are: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location.\n\nI should find the row where \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" appears as the branding. Scanning through each data row:\n\nRow 0: Branding is \"yes! fm 101.1\"\nRow 1: Branding is \"yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\"\nRow 2: Branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" \u2013 this must be the row we're interested in.\nRow 3: Branding is \"yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\"\nRow 4: Branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\"\n\nSo, row 2 has the branding that matches the claim. Now, checking the power (kw) column for this row. According to the table, it's \"1 kw.\" That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are verified by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the specific row where the branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" and check the power (kw) column.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"the frequency for callsign dxyr be from brand yes! fm 101.1\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), location. The rows are data entries for each station.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any row where the callsign is \"dxyr\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: callsign is dwys\n- Row 1: callsign is dzvm\n- Row 2: callsign is dyyr\n- Row 3: callsign is dyyd\n- Row 4: callsign is dxyr\n\nSo, the relevant row for \"dxyr\" is row index 4.\n\nNow, within that row, I need to check the columns mentioned in the claim. The claim refers to two main aspects: the brand and the frequency.\n\nFirst aspect: brand. The branding column for row 4 is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\". This doesn't match \"yes! fm 101.1\" from any other row, especially not the one in question. Wait, actually, each row has a different branding because they're different stations. So yes! fm 101.1 is another station (row 0), but here it's 104.7.\n\nSecond aspect: callsign dxyr and its frequency. Looking at the frequency column for row 4, it's \"104.7 mhz\".\n\nNow, the claim says that the frequency for callsign dxyr should be from brand yes! fm 101.1. So, they're trying to link the frequency of dxyr to the branding of 101.1 MHz.\n\nBut in reality, dxyr is associated with 104.7 MHz and the branding is yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro. The station at 101.1 is a different one (row 0: dwys), which has its own frequency and location.\n\nSo, the claim's statement is incorrect because:\n\n- Callsign dxyr doesn't have a frequency of 101.1 MHz; it's actually 104.7 MHz.\n- The branding for dxyr is not yes! fm 101.1 but rather 104.7 in Cagayan de Oro.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the callsign dxyr corresponds to a frequency of 104.7 MHz and a different branding than specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"dyyd be the callsign for the branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay with a power of 1 kw.\" \n\nI'll break down the components of the claim to see if they match any row in the table.\n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. The callsign is \"dyyd.\"\n2. The branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\"\n3. The power is \"1 kw.\"\n\nNow, I'll examine each row of the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\nRow 0:\n- Branding: yes! fm 101.1\n- Callsign: dwys\n- Frequency: 101.1 MHz\n- Power: 25 kW\n- Location: Metro Manila\n\nThis doesn't match because the branding is different, and power is higher than 1 kw.\n\nRow 1:\n- Branding: yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\n- Callsign: dzvm\n- Frequency: 104.1 MHz\n- Power: 1 kW\n- Location: Urdaneta\n\nHere, the callsign is dzvm, not dyyd, so it doesn't match.\n\nRow 2:\n- Branding: yes! fm 91.1 boracay\n- Callsign: dyyr\n- Frequency: 91.1 MHz\n- Power: 1 kW\n- Location: Boracay\n\nThis row has the branding and power as in the claim, but the callsign is dyyr, not dyyd.\n\nRow 3:\n- Branding: yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\n- Callsign: dyyd\n- Frequency: 106.3 MHz\n- Power: 10 kW\n- Location: Dumaguete\n\nThe callsign here is dyyd, but the branding and frequency are different from the claim.\n\nRow 4:\n- Branding: yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\n- Callsign: dxyr\n- Frequency: 104.7 MHz\n- Power: 10 kW\n- Location: Cagayan de Oro\n\nThis row doesn't match at all; different branding, callsign, and power.\n\nNow, let's cross-reference the claim with each row:\n\nThe claim's branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay,\" which matches Row 2. The power in that row is indeed 1 kW. However, the callsign for this row is dyyr, not dyyd as stated in the claim.\n\nSo, two out of three elements match: branding and power, but the callsign doesn't.

The claim says: \"dyyr be the call sign for yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location. Each row represents a different radio station.\n\nThe claim has two main parts: \"dyyr\" as the call sign and it's for \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\". \n\nI'll go through each row to find where these match.\n\nStarting with the first column, branding: yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro. Looking at the data, in the fifth row (row_index 4), the branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\". So that's a match for the station name.\n\nNext, callsign. The claim says \"dyyr\" should be the call sign. I'll check each row's callsign column:\n\n- Row 0: dwys\n- Row 1: dzvm\n- Row 2: dyyr\n- Row 3: dyyd\n- Row 4: dxyr\n\nWait, in row 4, the callsign is \"dxyr\", not \"dyyr\". So that's different. The claim says \"dyyr\" is the call sign for that station, but according to the table, it's actually \"dxyr\".\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because the call sign doesn't match. But I should make sure there are no other rows with \"dyyr\". Looking at row 2: yes! fm 91.1 boracay has callsign dyyr, but that's a different station.\n\nSo, only the fifth row is relevant for both the branding and call sign.
