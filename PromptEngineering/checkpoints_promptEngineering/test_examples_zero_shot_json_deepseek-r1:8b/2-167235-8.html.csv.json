In the table, looking for rows where \"name\" is \"ilir meta\". There's only one row (row 6), and under \"political party\", it says \"socialist party of albania.\" So ilir meta is indeed a member of the socialist party.\n\nNext, bashkim fino. Searching for his name in the table: found in row 4. His political party is listed as \"socialist party of albania.\" So he's also a member.\n\nThen ylli bufi. In row 1, the political party is \"socialist party of albania.\" He is a member too.\n\nNow, pandeli majko (1st time). Looking for that exact name: found in row 2 and row 9. Row 2 lists his party as \"socialist party of albania,\" but row 9 also says the same. Wait, but the claim specifies \"pandeli majko (1st time)\", which might refer to a specific term. However, in both rows where his name appears, the party is socialist. So regardless of the term, he's a member.\n\nSo all four individuals are part of the socialist party. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow for relevant cells: I'll need to find each person's row and check the political party column.\n\nIlir meta is in row 6, so column \"political party\" there is relevant.\nBashkim fino is in row 4, same column.\nYlli bufi is in row 1, same column.\nPandeli majko (1st time) is in row 2 and row 9.

The claim is: \"the term end for vilson ahmeti be after the term end for ylli bufi.\" \n\nFirst, I'll locate where Vilson Ahmeti and Ylli Bufi are in the table. Looking at the data rows, I see that Vilson Ahmeti is in row 3 (since indexing starts from 0), specifically the fourth entry in the data array. Ylli Bufi is in row 1.\n\nNext, I need to find the \"term end\" for both individuals. For Vilson Ahmeti, the term end is listed as \"13 april 1992.\" For Ylli Bufi, the term end is \"10 december 1991.\"\n\nNow, comparing these two dates: \"13 april 1992\" comes after \"10 december 1991.\" Therefore, Vilson Ahmeti's term ended after Ylli Bufi's term ended. \n\nSo, the claim should be TRUE because it correctly states that Vilson Ahmeti's term end is indeed after Ylli Bufi's.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. Let me look at the table structure. The columns are name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party.\n\nThe data has multiple rows, each representing a different leader with their details. So, I need to find the specific entries for both Bashkim Fino and Vilson Ahmeti.\n\nI'll go through each row until I find their names. Let's see:\n\nRow 5: Aleksand\u00ebr Mesi... Hmm, not them.\nRow 6: Bashkim Fino is in row 6. His term start is \"11 March 1997\" as per the data. Term end is \"24 July 1997.\"\n\nNow, where is Vilson Ahmeti? Let me scan through the rows. Row 3 has Vilson Ahmeti with a term start of \"22 February 1991\" and term end on \"10 December 1991.\" So his term started earlier than Bashkim Fino's.\n\nWait, so the claim says that Bashkim Fino's term start is after Vilson Ahmeti's. But looking at the dates, Vilson's term starts in 1991 while Bashkim starts in 1997. That means Bashkim's term does indeed come after Vilson's. So the claim should be true.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. For Vilson Ahmeti, he's in row 3 (since rows start at 0). The column for term start is the third one, so column index 2. For Bashkim Fino, he's in row 6 (row_index:6) and same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, column \"term start\"\n- Row 6, column \"term start\"\n\nThat's what I need to check.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}]}",

The claim says: \"Sali Berisha be the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meqi, to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party.\" \n\nFirst, I should check which parts of the claim need verification from the table. The relevant aspects are whether Sali Berisha was elected by the Democratic Party and if she is indeed the first after Aleksand\u00ebr Meqi.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related are \"name,\" \"born - died,\" \"term start,\" \"term end,\" and \"political party.\" Since the claim mentions being a member of the Democratic Party, I should focus on the \"political party\" column.\n\nI'll need to locate Sali Berisha in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see her at row index 9 (since it's zero-based or not? Wait, let me check: the first data entry is row 0, so Sali Berisha is row 9). Her political party is listed as \"democratic party of albania.\"\n\nNow, checking Aleksand\u00ebr Meqi. He is at row 4. His political party is also \"democratic party of albania.\" So both are members of the same party.\n\nThe claim says Sali Berisha is the first after Meqi to be elected. But looking at the table, after Meqi's term (which ended in March 1997), the next leader was Bashkim Fino from the socialist party. Then later, Sali Berisha took over as Prime Minister in September 2005, so she might have been elected by her party before that.\n\nWait, but the claim is about being elected as a member of the Democratic Party. So perhaps Sali Berisha was indeed the first after Meqi to be elected within the same party. But I need to see if there's anyone else in between or after who was elected by the Democratic Party.\n\nLooking at the rows, after Meqi (row 4), the next prime ministers are from other parties until Sali Berisha comes in row 9. So she might be the first after Meqi within her party to become PM again. But wait, she was already part of the party before, so maybe she's not the first after Meqi but perhaps the first to return or something else.\n\nAlternatively, the claim could be implying that Sali Berisha is elected by the Democratic Party after Meqi left it, which might make her the first since Meqi. Therefore, I need to check if there was anyone else from the Democratic Party who became PM after Meqi but before Sali Berisha.\n\nLooking at the table, after Meqi's term ended in March 1997, the next Prime Minister was Bashkim Fino (row 5), who is from the socialist party. Then came Fatos Nano again (row 6) and others until Sali Berisha took over in row 9. So, between Meqi and Sali Berisha, no one from the Democratic Party became PM again until her.\n\nTherefore, Sali Berisha is indeed the first after Meqi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania, becoming Prime Minister again in 2005. Hence, the claim seems true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to suggest that there's only one individual who was both a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and elected, or something along those lines. I'll need to check each row in the table to see which individuals belong to this party and whether they held any position that might make them \"elect.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first data row seems to be a header or summary, so it's not a specific individual.\n2. Starting from row 1 (index 0 in programming but probably 1 here), \"fatos nano\" is listed as part of the Party of Labour of Albania. His term starts on Feb 22, 1991 and ends June 5, 1991. So he was elected once.\n3. Row 2: ylli bufi is from the Socialist Party, so not relevant.\n4. Row 3: vilson ahmeti is non-party, so no.\n5. Row 4: aleksand\u00ebr meksi is Democratic, not Labour.\n6. Row 5: bashkim fino is Socialist, nope.\n7. Row 6: fatos nano again, same as row 1, but this time it's his second term. So he was elected twice for the Party of Labour.\n8. Row 7: pandeli majko is Socialist, not Labour.\n9. Row 8: ilir meta is Socialist, no.\n10. Row 9: pandeli majko again, same party as before.\n11. Row 10: fatos nano third time, still in Labour.\n12. Row 11: sali berisha is Democratic, not Labour.\n13. Row 12: edi rama is Socialist.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 person have been a member of the Party of Labour... and be elect.\" But looking at row 1 (fatos nano) and rows 6,10 (his second and third terms), he's in the Labour party multiple times. So he's not just one person; he's been elected multiple times for that party.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect.\" Perhaps it's saying only one person was a member and held an elective position? But fatos nano was elected multiple times, so that would mean he is more than one in terms of being elected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to only one individual overall being part of that specific party. But looking at the table, I see fatos nano listed multiple times as part of the Party of Labour. So perhaps the claim is FALSE because there's only one person associated with that party and holding an elective position, but actually, he held multiple terms.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The claim says \"only 1 person have be a member...\" which might mean only one person in total has been a member of that party and been elected. But fatos nano is listed as being part of the Labour party three times (rows 1,6,10). So he's multiple entries, but it's the same person.\n\nSo if the claim is saying \"only one person\" overall, then it would be FALSE because there are multiple mentions of fatos nano in the Labour party. However, each entry represents a term, so technically, only one person (fatos nano) has been a member and held an elective position for the Labour party, but he's done it more than once.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim is about being a member of the party and being elected. So if fatos nano is the only one in the Labour party who was elected, then the statement would be TRUE because there's only one person (fatos nano) who has been both a member and elected for that party. But wait, in the table, he's listed multiple times as being part of the Labour party, each time with different term periods.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is saying that only one person from the Labour party was elected, which is TRUE because only fatos nano is listed under that party as having been in an elective position. But wait, maybe I'm missing others.\n\nLooking again: The other parties are Socialist and Democratic. So for Labour, only fatos nano is present multiple times. Therefore, there's only one person (fatos nano) who has been a member of the Party of Labour and held an elective position. So the claim would be TRUE because only one person meets that criterion.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the claim again: \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect.\" It seems to say that among all people in the table, only one person was both a member of Labour and elected.\n\nLooking at the table, fatos nano is listed multiple times under Labour and each time he's in an elective position (prime minister). The other members are from different parties. So yes, only fatos nano fits that condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be TRUE because only one person (fatos nano) was a member of the Party of Labour and held an elective office.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n]}",

The claim is: \"the term end for aleksand\u00ebr meksi be after the term end for ylli bufi.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. It's comparing the term end dates of two individuals from the table.

Scanning through the data rows, I see that there's a row where name is \"ylli bufi\". Let me check which one that is. It seems like it's the second row (index 1) because the first row after the headers is index 0. Wait, no, let me count again: the header is row 0, then data rows start from index 1. So Ylli Bufi is in row 1. His term end date is listed as \"10 december 1991\" under the term end column.\n\nNow for Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i. I need to find which row corresponds to him. Looking through each row's name, I see that one of them is \"aleksand\u00ebr meski\". Wait, it might be a typo, but in the table, it's written as \"aleksand\\u00ebr meksi\", which looks like a Unicode representation of \"And\u00ebr Me\u00e7i\" perhaps. So that's likely Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i. He's in row 4 (index 4) because after Ylli Bufi is row 1, then rows 2,3,4: row 4 is his term end date.\n\nHis term end is listed as \"11 march 1997\". \n\nNow comparing the two term ends: Ylli Bufi ended on December 10, 1991.

The relevant columns for this analysis are \"name,\" \"born - died,\" and \"political party.\" Specifically, the political party column is crucial because it tells us which party each person was associated with.\n\nI'll start by locating Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find him at row index 4. His political party is listed as the Democratic Party of Albania. So, he's a member of that party.\n\nNext, I need to look for Ilir Meta. He appears at row index 5. His political party is also the Socialist Party of Albania. Wait, but the claim mentions the Democratic Party of Albania, not the Socialist one. That might be a problem because if Ilir Meta is in a different party, then he's not part of the same political group as Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.\n\nSo, if the claim is saying that Ilir Meta joined the Democratic Party after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi did, but according to the table, Ilir Meta is actually in the Socialist Party. That means there's a discrepancy. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold because Ilir Meta isn't part of the same party as Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.\n\nAdditionally, looking at when each person started their term and ended, I see that Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term was from 1939 to 1997, while Ilir Meta's term started in 1969. But again, since they belong to different parties, the claim doesn't apply.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is false because Ilir Meta isn't a member of the Democratic Party of Albania but rather the Socialist Party.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says: \"only 1 person have been a member of the socialist party of albania.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Since the claim is about being a member of the socialist party of albania, the relevant column here would be \"political party.\" \n\nNext, I need to look at each row's data under the \"political party\" column to see who was part of the socialist party of albania. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\n1. The first row says \"prime ministers 1991 onwards,\" which is general and not a person, so it doesn't apply.\n2. Row 2: Fatos Nano (1st time) is in the Socialist Party of Albania.\n3. Row 3: Ylli Bufi is also in the Socialist Party of Albania.\n4. Row 4: Wilson Ahmeti is non-party, so not relevant.\n5. Row 5: Aleksand\u00ebr M\u00ebksi is in the Democratic Party, so not relevant.\n6. Row 6: Bashkim Fino is in the Socialist Party.\n7. Row 7: Fatos Nano (2nd time) is again with the Socialist Party.\n8. Row 8: Pandeli Majko (1st time) is with the Socialist Party.\n9. Row 9: Ilir Meta is also a member of the Socialist Party.\n10. Row 10: Pandeli Majko (2nd time) continues with the Socialist Party.\n11. Row 11: Fatos Nano (3rd time) remains in the Socialist Party.\n12. Row 12: Sali Berisha is in the Democratic Party, so not relevant.\n13. Row 13: Edi Rama is in the Socialist Party.\n\nSo, counting the number of people who are members of the Socialist Party of Albania from the list: Fatos Nano (twice), Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Pandeli Majko twice, Ilir Meta, and Edi Rama. That's a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Wait, that's more than one person.\n\nWait, but let me recount properly. Each time a leader is in the Socialist Party, it counts as a separate member. So, Fatos Nano appears three times: rows 2,7,11. That's three instances, but each is a different term, so does each term count as a different person? No, because it's the same person holding office multiple times. So each instance in the table for Fatos Nano (1st time), (2nd time), (3rd time) are the same person. Similarly, Pandeli Majko appears twice but is one person.\n\nSo, let me list them:\n\n- Fatos Nano: 3 entries, but it's the same person.\n- Ylli Bufi: One entry.\n- Bashkim Fino: One entry.\n- Ilir Meta: One entry.\n- Edi Rama: One entry.\n- Pandeli Majko: Two entries, but one person.\n\nSo total unique individuals in the Socialist Party of Albania are Fatos Nano, Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Ilir Meta, and Edi Rama. That's five people. So more than one member.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"only 1 person have been a member\" is false because there are multiple members from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because multiple individuals have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
