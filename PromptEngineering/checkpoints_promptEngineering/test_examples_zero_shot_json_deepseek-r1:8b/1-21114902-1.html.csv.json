    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 submission of the night when matt wiman be the fighter\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the data provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that there is exactly 1 submission of the night where Matt Wiman was the fighter. So I need to look for Matt Wiman in the \"fighter\" column and check how many submissions he has in the \"submissions of the night\" column for that specific row.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for the row where the fighter is Matt Wiman. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Joe Lauzon\n2. Anderson Silva\n3. Chris Lytle\n4. Nate Diaz\n5. Frankie Edgar\n6. Clay Guida\n7. Sam Stout\n8. Wanderlei Silva\n9. Diego Sanchez\n10. Forrest Griffin\n11. Tyson Griffin\n12. Carlos Condit\n13. Tito Ortiz\n14. Joe Stevenson\n15. Donald Cerrone\n16. Jon Jones\n17. Jim Miller\n18. Chris Leben\n19. Brad Pickett\n20. Matt Wiman\n\nYes, Matt Wiman is in row 20 (assuming the list starts at 0 or 1; I think it's 0-based). So row_index is 20.\n\nNow, looking at the \"submissions of the night\" column for this row. The data provided for Matt Wiman is [4, 0, 1, 6], so let me see: 4 submissions? Wait, no, wait. Each row has 5 numbers after the fighter's name, right? Let's count:\n\n- \"Matt wiman\", then 4, 0, 1, 6, and status as \"active\". So the first number is 4.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 submission.\" So if the data for Matt Wiman in that column is 4, that means he had 4 submissions. That doesn't match the claim of 1 submission.\n\nWait, I might be misunderstanding. Let me double-check. The columns are: fighter, fights of the night, knocks of the night, submissions of the night, awards total, status.\n\nSo for Matt Wiman's row, the numbers after his name are:\n\n4 (fights), 0 (knocks), 1 (submissions), 6 (awards), and \"active\".\n\nAh! So the submission count is 1. That matches the claim of 1 submission when Matt Wiman was the fighter.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"there be 1 submission\", which is correct because in his row, submissions are 1.\n\nSo that would mean the claim is TRUE. But I need to make sure that the relevant cells are correctly identified.\n\nRelevant cells are the row where Matt Wiman is the fighter and the column for submissions. So row_index would be the index of Matt Wiman's row. Let me count the rows starting from 0:\n\nRows 0-19, so Matt Wiman is at row 20? Wait, no. The list has 20 entries (from 0 to 19), but wait, I'm counting wrong.\n\nWait, the data array has 20 elements because I see up to \"stefan struve\" as the last entry, which is index 18 or 19? Let me recount:\n\nThe user provided a list starting with Joe Lauzon (index 0) through Stefan Struve. Let's count: 1. Joe, 2. Silva, 3. Lytle, 4. Diaz, 5. Edgar, 6. Guida, 7. Stout, 8. Silva, 9. Sanchez,10. Griffin,11. Tyson,12. Condit,13. Ortiz,14. Stevenson,15. Cerrone,16. Jones,17. Miller,18. Leben,19. Pickett,20. Wiman,21. Machida,22. Struve.\n\nWait, that's 23 entries? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the list is numbered from 0 to n-1. So Matt Wiman is at index 19 if there are 20 rows. Wait, no, I think it's better to count each line as a row:\n\nThe data array starts with:\n\n[\n  \"joe lauzon\",\n  \"anderson silva\",\n  ...,\n  \"stefan struve\"\n]\n\nSo Matt Wiman is somewhere in the middle. Let me list them numerically:\n\n0: Joe Lauzon\n1: Anderson Silva\n2: Chris Lytle\n3: Nate Diaz\n4: Frankie Edgar\n5: Clay Guida\n6: Sam Stout\n7: Wanderlei Silva\n8: Diego Sanchez\n9: Forrest Griffin\n10: Tyson Griffin\n11: Carlos Condit\n12: Tito Ortiz\n13: Joe Stevenson\n14: Donald Cerrone\n15: Jon Jones\n16: Jim Miller\n17: Chris Leben\n18: Brad Pickett\n19: Matt Wiman\n20: Lyoto Machida\n21: Stefan Struve\n\nWait, that's 22 entries. So Matt Wiman is at index 19.\n\nTherefore, row_index is 19, and the \"submissions of the night\" column is the third one (index 2), since columns are:\n\n0: fighter\n1: fights\n2: knocks\n3: submissions\n4: awards\n5: status\n\nSo for Matt Wiman's row, the relevant cells are row_index=19 and column_name=\"submissions\".\n\nWait, but wait. The claim says \"submission\" singular, but in the table, it's plural: \"submissions of the night\". So when the claim refers to \"1 submission\", does that mean 1 occurrence? Yes.\n\nSo Matt Wiman had 1 submission, so the claim is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are at row_index=19, column_name=\"submissions\".\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the row index. If the data array starts at 0, then:\n\nMatt Wiman is in position 19 (since 0-18 is up to Brad Pickett), so yes.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should be [ {\"row_index\":19, \"column_name\":\"submissions\"} ]\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that Matt Wiman has exactly one submission. From the table, Matt Wiman's row at index 19 shows a submission count of 1 in the \"submissions\" column. This supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"submissions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Joe Lauzon is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Joe Lauzon has 5 fights of the night and 1 knockout of the night.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate Joe Lauzon in the table. Looking through the data rows, I see that the first row is for \"joe lauzon\". That's the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, the claim mentions two specific statistics: fights of the night and knockouts of the night. In the table, these correspond to the second column (\"fights of the night\") and the third column (\"knockouts of the night\").\n\nLooking at Joe Lauzon's row, under \"fights of the night\" it says 5, which matches the claim. Then for \"knockouts of the night,\" it also shows 1, which again aligns with the claim.\n\nI should double-check to make sure there are no typos or misunderstandings. The fighter's name is correctly spelled as \"joe lauzon.\" The columns are clearly labeled, so I'm confident that the second number is indeed the knockouts.\n\nSince both numbers in the claim match exactly what's listed for Joe Lauzon in the table, the claim must be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells confirm both statistics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fights of the night\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that there were 2 submissions in a single night where the fighter involved was Matt Wiman. So I need to check if such an occurrence exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: fighter, fights of the night, knocks of the night, submissions of the night, awards total, and status. The data is listed under \"data\" as multiple rows, each corresponding to a fighter with their respective stats for that night.\n\nMy first task is to locate Matt Wiman's row in the table. Scanning through the list, I see Matt Wiman's entry:\n\n[\n  \"matt wiman\",\n  4,\n  0,\n  1,\n  5,\n  \"active\"\n]\n\nSo Matt Wiman's row has a submission of the night as 1. That means on that particular night, he had only one submission. The claim says there were two submissions when he fought, which contradicts this data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could the column \"submissions of the night\" be cumulative or per-fight? No, each row represents a single fight or event, so it's per occurrence that night. Since Matt Wiman has only 1 submission in his row, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Matt Wiman didn't have two submissions on that night.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells. The claim refers to \"submission of the night\" and specifically mentions Matt Wiman. So I need to identify which columns are involved. The relevant columns here would be \"submissions of the night\" because it's part of the claim, and \"fighter\" since we're checking a specific fighter's data.\n\nSo, for Matt Wiman, his row is index 18 (since indexing starts at 0). In that row, the column \"submissions of the night\" is 1. Therefore, the relevant cells are the ones with row_index 18 and column_name \"submissions of the night\", along with the fighter's column.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions two submissions, but Matt Wiman only had one. So maybe I should also check if any other rows have Matt Wiman, but looking through the list, he appears only once.\n\nSo, to sum up, since Matt Wiman only had 1 submission on that night, the claim about two is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Matt Wiman had two submissions during a fight. However, checking the table shows Matt Wiman's single fight with only one submission. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"submissions of the night\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"fighter\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nFirst, I should find Joe Lauzon in the table. Looking at the data array, the first row has \"joe lauzon\" as the fighter. So that's row index 0.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"knockouts of the night.\" In the table, this corresponds to the column named \"knockouts of the night\". For Joe Lauzon, the value is 1. Wait, the claim says he has 4 knockouts, but according to the table, it's only 1. So that seems off.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check. The columns are: fighter, fights of the night, knockouts of the night, submissions of the night, awards total, and status. So for Joe Lauzon, knockouts are indeed 1, not 4. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure there's no other row with \"joe lauzon.\" Scanning through all the rows, it only appears once in row 0. So the data is clear: Joe Lauzon has 1 knockout according to the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Joe Lauzon has 4 knockouts is false because the table shows he has only 1 knockout.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout\" is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify the fighter in question**: Look for \"joe lauzon\" in the table. He appears in row index 0.\n2. **Locate the relevant column**: The term \"knockouts of the night\" corresponds to the third column (index 2) in each row.\n3. **Check the value for Joe Lauzon**: In row 0, under the \"knockouts of the night\" column, the value is 1.\n\nSince the table shows Joe Lauzon has only 1 knockout, not 4, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n- **Find Joe Lauzon's row**: The first entry in the data array is \"joe lauzon\", at row index 0.\n- **Identify the knockouts column**: The third element (index 2) of each row represents \"knockouts of the night\".\n- **Retrieve the knockout count for Joe Lauzon**: This value is 1, not 4.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect, leading to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
