    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Scotland be the country that have stolen end less than 9 and a Craig Brown as the skip.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two main parts. \n\n1. Scotland has fewer than 9 stolen ends.\n2. Scotland's skip is named Craig Brown.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different country with their respective details. The columns relevant here are \"country,\" \"skip,\" and \"stolen ends.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: checking if Scotland's stolen ends are less than 9. I need to find the row where the country is Scotland. Scanning through the data, the second row corresponds to Scotland. In that row, under \"stolen ends,\" the value is 10. Wait, 10 is not less than 9, so this part doesn't hold true.\n\nNow, checking the second part: whether Scotland's skip is Craig Brown. Again, looking at the same row for Scotland, the \"skip\" column has the name David Murdoch, not Craig Brown. So that's another point against the claim.\n\nSince both conditions aren't met\u2014Scotland doesn't have stolen ends less than 9 and their skip isn't Craig Brown\u2014the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails because Scotland's stolen ends are 10, not less than 9, and their skip isn't Craig Brown but David Murdoch.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
