    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim is true or false based on a given table and then identify which cells in the table support that claim. The table has information about various tournaments, years, venues, results, and extras like the event type. \n\nThe claim in question is: \"in 1979 the tournament of european indoor championship play where the extra be 800 m and the result be 2nd.\" So I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions the year 1979. Looking at the table data, I should find rows for that specific year. Scanning through the 'year' column: 1973, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1978, 1979. So there's a row for 1979.\n\nNext, the tournament is \"european indoor championship.\" Checking each row: the first row is European junior championships, then European indoor championships in 1975, again in 1979. Wait, no, looking closer, 1979's row is indeed \"european indoor championships\" as per the data.\n\nNow, the claim says that in 1979, the extra was 800 m and the result was 2nd. So I need to check both of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the 1979 row (which is the last one), the 'extra' column has \"800 m,\" so that matches. Then the 'result' column for that row is \"2nd,\" which also matches the claim.\n\nSo putting it all together, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data in the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the table confirms that in 1979, at the European Indoor Championships held in Vienna, the extra event was 800 m and the result was 2nd.

Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It mentions that the European Championship has an extra event called \"400 m hurdles.\" So I'm looking for any row in the table where both the tournament is \"European championships\" (or similar) and there's an entry for \"400 m hurdles\" under the \"extra\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific year with details about the tournament, venue, result, and extra event. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Year is 1973, Tournament is \"european junior championships.\" The extra event here is \"4x400 m relay.\" Not relevant because it's not about 400 m hurdles.\n\n2. **Row 1:** Year is 1975, Tournament is \"european indoor championships,\" and the extra is \"800 m.\" No mention of 400 m hurdles.\n\n3. **Row 2:** Year is 1976, Tournament is \"olympic games,\" with an extra event of \"800 m.\" Again, no hurdles mentioned.\n\n4. **Row 3:** Year is 1978, Tournament is \"european championships,\" venue in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The result is \"6th\" and the extra is \"800 m.\" So this row doesn't have 400 m hurdles either.\n\n5. **Row 4:** Same year as above (1978), same tournament (\"european championships\"), but now the extra event is listed as \"400 m hurdles.\" This seems relevant because it's exactly what the claim is about.\n\n6. **Row 5:** Year is 1979, Tournament is \"european indoor championships,\" with an extra of \"800 m.\" Not relevant for this claim.\n\nSo, in row 4, we have a specific instance where the European Championships in 1978 had an extra event of \"400 m hurdles.\" This directly supports the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's at least one occurrence where the European Championship included that extra event.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"extra\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 1979 be the year of the tournament play call the european indor champion where the team finish 2nd with an extra of 800 m\". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think there might be some typos or misphrasing here. Let me try to parse it.\n\nThe claim is talking about a tournament that happened in 1979, specifically referring to \"european indor champion\". Wait, the term should probably be \"European Indoor Championships\" since that's how it's written in the table. Also, the user might have made a typo with \"indor\" instead of \"indoor\". So I'll assume they meant \"European Indoor Championships\".\n\nNext, the claim mentions that the team finished 2nd and had an extra of 800 m. Looking at the table, let me find any entries for 1979.\n\nLooking at the data section:\n\n- The first entry is 1973.\n- Second: 1975.\n- Third: 1976.\n- Fourth: 1978 with two entries.\n- Fifth: 1979.\n\nYes, there's a row in 1979. Let me check that row. The columns are year, tournament, venue, result, extra.\n\nSo for 1979:\n\n[\n  1979,\n  \"european indoor championships\",\n  \"vienna , austria\",\n  \"2nd\",\n  \"800 m\"\n]\n\nThat matches the claim's criteria: the year is 1979, the tournament is European Indoor Championships (assuming correction), the result is 2nd place, and the extra event is 800m.\n\nNow, I need to check each part of the claim against the table. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index for 1979: which row is that? Let's count the rows starting from 0.\n\n1st row (index 0): 1973\n2nd (1): 1975\n3rd (2): 1976\n4th (3): 1978\n5th (4): 1979\n\nSo, for 1979, it's row index 4. Now, the columns relevant are:\n\n- year: must be 1979 \u2192 column 0.\n- tournament: \"european indoor championships\" \u2192 as per table, that's what's in column 1 for row 4.\n- result: \"2nd\" \u2192 column 3.\n- extra: \"800 m\" \u2192 column 4.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are columns at indices 0,1,3,4 of row 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe claim is true because there's a matching entry in 1979 with the European Indoor Championships, 2nd place, and 800m as extra.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"european junior championship come in second place since 1975.\" So, this is making a statement about the European Junior Championships placing second since 1975.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. The data rows have years from 1973 to 1979, tournaments including \"european junior championships\" and others, venues in different countries, results like \"1st,\" \"4th,\" etc., and extras which sometimes mention events like \"800 m\" or \"400 m hurdles.\"\n\nI need to check each occurrence where the tournament is \"european junior championships\" and see if they placed second since 1975.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In row 0: year 1973, tournament \"european junior championships,\" result \"1st.\" So that's first place, not second.\n- Next, I need to find when the tournament is \"european junior championships\" and the result is \"2nd.\"\n\nBut wait, let me check the rows. The first row has \"european junior championships\" in 1973 with a result of \"1st.\" Then, looking at the rest:\n\nRow 4: year 1978, tournament \"european championships,\" which is different. So that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, actually, I might have misread. Let me check each row properly.\n\nThe first data row is:\n[\n  1973,\n  \"european junior championships\",\n  \"duisburg , west germany\",\n  \"1st\",\n  \"4x400 m relay\"\n]\n\nSo that's 1973, European Junior Championships, 1st place. So not relevant for second place.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's any row where the tournament is \"european junior championships\" and result is \"2nd\" and the year is >=1975.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nThe next occurrence of \"european junior championships\" is in row 4? Wait no, let me check each data row properly. The data has six rows:\n\nRow 0: 1973, European Junior Championships, Duisburg, 1st, 4x400m relay.\nRow 1: 1975, European Indoor Championships, Katowice, 1st, 800m.\nRow 2: 1976, Olympic Games, Montreal, 4th, 800m.\nRow 3: 1978, European Championships, Prague, 6th, 800m.\nRow 4: 1978, European Championships, Prague, 6th, 400m hurdles.\nRow 5: 1979, European Indoor Championships, Vienna, 2nd, 800m.\n\nWait, so in row 1: tournament is European Indoor Championships, not Junior. So the only other relevant one is row 5: 1979, European Indoor Championships, result \"2nd.\" But that's not European Junior Championships; it's Indoor Championships again.\n\nSo, I don't see any rows where the tournament is specifically \"european junior championships\" and the result is \"2nd\" since 1975. The only mention of European Junior Championships in the table is row 0 with a 1st place, which is before 1975 (1973), so it's not relevant to the claim about \"since 1975.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"european junior championship come in second place since 1975\" is false because there's no data supporting that they placed second from 1975 onwards. The only time European Junior Championships are mentioned is in 1973 with a 1st place, and other instances are either different tournaments or results.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to find which cells are relevant. Since none of the rows support the claim, but I have to consider that maybe the tournament names might not exactly match, so perhaps I should check for any mention of European Junior Championships beyond 1975 with second place. But in this table, there are no such rows. Therefore, all rows where the result is \"2nd\" and year >=1975 would be relevant because they don't show a second place for European Junior Championships.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"european junior championship,\" which is a specific tournament. So I should look for that exact name in the tournament column and see if any of them have a result of \"2nd\" since 1975.\n\nIn this table, only row 0 has \"european junior championships\" with a result of \"1st.\" The other mentions are of different tournaments: European Indoor Championships, Olympic Games, European Championships. So none of these are relevant for the claim about European Junior Championships placing second since 1975.\n\nTherefore, there are no cells that support the claim, so the answer is \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells would be all rows where tournament is \"european junior championships\" but result isn't \"2nd\" and year >=1975. But actually, since none exist, maybe I should list all rows with tournament as \"european junior championships\" because they don't support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that any row after 1975 where tournament is \"european junior championships\" would be relevant if they show a result of \"2nd.\" Since there are none, but for completeness, I should list all such rows as irrelevant.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I have to identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim is about European Junior Championships placing second since 1975, and in the table, the only mention of European Junior Championships is in row 0 (1973) with a result of \"1st,\" so that's not supporting the claim. Therefore, perhaps there are no relevant cells because none of the rows meet the criteria.\n\nBut maybe I should consider any rows where tournament is \"european junior championships\" and year >=1975, even if the result isn't second. Because those are the ones we need to check whether they have a second place or not.\n\nSo in this case, there's only row 0 as European Junior Championships before 1975, so no relevant cells. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE,\" and there are no relevant cells because none of the data supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

It's looking for instances in the table where the tournament is the European Indoor Championships, the year is before 1979 (so years less than 1979), the venue has \"800 m\" as the extra event, and the result is \"2nd.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are year, tournament, venue, result, and extra.

Year is before 1979. Extra is 800 m. Result is 1st. So doesn't match result being 2nd.\n- Row 2 (1976): Not European Indoor. Skip.\n- Row 3 (1978): European Championships, not European Indoor. Skip.\n- Row 4 (1978): Same as above, European Championships. Skip.\n- Row 5 (1979): Tournament is European Indoor. Year is 1979, which is the year in question. The claim says \"before 1979,\" so maybe 1979 isn't considered 'before.' So, this might not qualify.\n\nWait, the claim says \"before 1979.\" So events before 1979 would be up to and including 1978. So row 5 (1979) is for that year, which is not before 1979. Therefore, it doesn't apply.\n\nSo in the table, looking for European Indoor Championships with extra as 800 m and result as 2nd, before 1979.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: 1975, European Indoor, Katowice, Poland, 1st, 800m. So the extra is 800m, but the result is 1st, not 2nd.\n\nRow 6 (wait, rows are from 0 to 5): Let me recount. The last row is row 5: 1979. So before that, in row 3 and 4, it's 1978 for European Championships, not Indoor.\n\nSo, is there any row where the tournament is European Indoor, year <1979, extra is 800m, result is 2nd?\n\nLooking at row 1 again: 1975, European Indoor, Katowice, Poland. Result is 1st, so doesn't match.\n\nThen, in row 5 (1979), it's European Indoor, Vienna, Austria. Extra is 800m, and result is 2nd. But since the year is 1979, which is not before 1979, it doesn't fit the \"before\" condition.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before 1979,\" so maybe 1979 isn't included. So no row matches all criteria except possibly none.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me parse it again: \"before 1979 , be when the tournament of european indoor championship play where the extra be 800 m and the result be 2nd.\"\n\nIt's a bit confusingly phrased. It seems to say that before 1979, there was an instance where European Indoor Championships took place with those specifics.\n\nSo I need a row where:\n\n- year <1979\n- tournament is European Indoor Championships\n- extra is \"800 m\"\n- result is \"2nd\"\n\nLooking at the table, in rows 0 to 5, which are years up to 1979. So for years before 1979: 1973, 1975, 1976, 1978.\n\nIn those rows:\n\n- Row1 (1975): European Indoor, extra=800m, result=1st\n- Any others?\n\nNo, the only other instance is row5, but that's 1979, which isn't before. So no row matches all criteria except for none.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no such event in the table as described.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
