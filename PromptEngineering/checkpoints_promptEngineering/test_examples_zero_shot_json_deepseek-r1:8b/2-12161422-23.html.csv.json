    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"Michael Tuck played 23 more games than Kevin Bartlett in their careers.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for Michael Tuck in the table. Scanning through each row's 'player' column, I see that Michael Tuck is at row index 0. His game count is 426.\n\nNext, I need to find Kevin Bartlett. He's at row index 1 with a game count of 403. \n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in their games played. Michael Tuck has 426 and Kevin Bartlett has 403. Subtracting Kevin's games from Michael's: 426 - 403 = 23. So that's exactly 23 more games.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells beyond these two, but in this case, only the 'games' column for both players is needed to verify the claim. The rest of the columns like rank, player name, club, and career span don't directly affect the calculation of the number of games played.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"TRUE\" because the claim holds true based on their game counts in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Michael Tuck played 23 more games than Kevin Bartlett, we look at their respective \"games\" column values. Michael Tuck has 426 games, while Kevin Bartlett has 403. The difference is indeed 23.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"Kevin Murray be the only player who have a 3 year break in between\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Kevin Murray is unique among all players listed because he had a three-year break in his career. So, I should look through the table for any other players who also have a three-year gap.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various details like rank, games, player name, club, and career span. My main focus is on the \"career span\" column because that's where breaks in a player's career would be mentioned.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one:\n\n1. Michael Tuck - Career span from 1972 to 1991. That's a span of 19 years without any break mentioned, so no three-year gap here.\n2. Kevin Bartlett - Career from 1965 to 1983, which is 18 years. No break noted.\n3. Robert Harvey - From 1988 to 2008. That's 20 years. No mention of a break.\n4. Dustin Fletcher - Started in 1993 and is still present. Doesn't have a break.\n5. Simon Madden - Career from 1974 to 1992, which is 18 years. No three-year gap mentioned.\n6. Craig Bradley - From 1986 to 2002, 16 years. No breaks.\n7. Brad Johnson - Played from 1994 to 2010, so 16 years. No break noted.\n8. Brent Harvey - Started in 1996 and still present. No break.\n9. Andrew McLeod - From 1995 to 2010, 15 years. No three-year gap.\n10. Kevin Murray - Career spans from 1955 to 1964 and then again from 1967 to 1974. Wait, that's a two-year break between 1964 and 1967 (since 1964 +3 would be 1967). So he has a three-year break?\n11. Adam Goodes - From 1999 to present. No breaks.\n12. Ian Nankervis - Career from 1967 to 1983, which is 16 years without a break.\n13. Simon Black - Started in 1998 and still playing. No breaks.\n14. Tony Shaw - Played from 1977 to 1994, so that's 17 years. No three-year gap mentioned.\n15. David Neitz - From 1993 to 2008, 15 years. No breaks.\n16. Matthew Pavlich - Started in 2001 and still playing. No break.\n17. Glen Jakovich - Played from 1991 to 2004, so 13 years. No three-year gap.\n18. Kane Cornes - From 1997 to present. No breaks.\n19. Roger Merrett - Career from 1988 to 1996, which is 8 years. No mention of a break.\n20. Bert Hurrey - Played from 1908 to 1913, so that's 5 years. No three-year gap here.\n21. Gary Ablett - From 2011 to present. No breaks.\n22. Jonathan Giles - Started in 2012 and still playing. No break.\n\nWait, I might have missed some players. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table again, each row is a separate player except for Kevin Murray who has two entries. Wait, no, each row is a separate entry. So, let's list all the career spans to check for three-year breaks.\n\nMichael Tuck: 1972-1991 (19 years)\nKevin Bartlett: 1965-1983 (18 years)\nRobert Harvey: 1988-2008 (20 years)\nDustin Fletcher: 1993-present\nSimon Madden: 1974-1992 (18 years)\nCraig Bradley: 1986-2002 (16 years)\nBrad Johnson: 1994-2010 (16 years)\nBrent Harvey: 1996-present\nAndrew McLeod: 1995-2010 (15 years)\nKevin Murray: 1955-1964, then 1967-1974. So between 1964 and 1967 is a three-year break? Let me calculate:\nFrom 1964 to 1967 inclusive, that's 3 years. If the break is from 1964 to 1967, that's three years in between? Or does it mean he took a three-year break after 1964, starting again in 1967? So the gap is two years because 1964 to 1966 would be two off-seasons, but if he played in 1965 and 1966, then a break in 1967. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIf his career is listed as \"1955 - 1964 , 1967 - 1974\", the break between 1964 and 1967 would be two years? Or three years because it's from end of 1964 to start of 1967. So, that's a three-year gap.\n\nNow, looking for other players with similar or longer breaks.\n\nLooking through all the career spans:\n\nI don't see any other player who has a break as large as three years. Most either play continuously or have one or two breaks, but not three years.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n- Michael Tuck: continuous from 1972 to 1991, no break.\n- Kevin Bartlett: same, no break.\n- Robert Harvey: same, no break.\n- Dustin Fletcher: still playing, so active; no break.\n- Simon Madden: same, no break.\n- Craig Bradley: same, no break.\n- Brad Johnson: same, no break.\n- Brent Harvey: still playing, no break.\n- Andrew McLeod: 1995-2010, no breaks mentioned.\n- Kevin Murray: has a three-year break between 1964 and 1967. Is this the only one?\n- Adam Goodes: continuous since 1999.\n- Ian Nankervis: same.\n- Simon Black: same.\n- Tony Shaw: same.\n- David Neitz: same.\n- Matthew Pavlich: same.\n- Glen Jakovich: same.\n- Kane Cornes: same.\n- Roger Merrett: career from 1988 to 1996, so that's eight years. No break mentioned.\n- Bert Hurrey: only five years, so no breaks.\n- Gary Ablett: continuous since 2011.\n- Jonathan Giles: continuous since 2012.\n\nSo, Kevin Murray seems to be the only one with a three-year break in his career. Therefore, the claim that he is unique in having a three-year break would make the statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the provided table to determine if Kevin Murray is uniquely identified as the only player with a three-year break in his career.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:** The statement asserts that Kevin Murray had a three-year break and is unique among all listed players in this regard.\n2. **Reviewing Career Spans:** Each row in the table lists a player's career span, which can indicate breaks.\n3. **Kevin Murray's Break:** His career is noted as spanning from 1955 to 1964, then resuming from 1967 to 1974. This indicates a break between 1964 and 1967\u2014specifically, three years (1965, 1966, 1967).\n4. **Checking Other Players:** All other players' career spans either show continuous periods or breaks of one or two years without any player having a three-year gap.\n5. **Conclusion:** Kevin Murray is the only player with a documented three-year break in his career.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe statement is TRUE because Kevin Murray is the sole player listed with a three-year career break, making him unique among the others.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided. The claim says: \"as of the september 2013 source , 8 player on the list be still play.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that as of September 2013, there are 8 players listed in the table who are still playing. So, my task is to check each row (player) and see if their career span extends beyond 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each player and analyze their \"career span\" column. The columns in the table are: rank, games, player, club, and career span. \n\nStarting with the first row:\n1. Michael Tuck - Career: 1972-1991. He retired before 2013.\n2. Kevin Bartlett - 1965-1983. Retired by 1983.\n3. Robert Harvey - 1988-2008. Retired in 2008, which is before 2013.\n4. Dustin Fletcher - 1993-Present. Still playing as of now, but the claim refers to September 2013. In 2013, he was still active. But wait, I need to check each player's career up to 2013.\n\nWait, the fifth row is:\n5. Simon Madden - Career: 1974-1992. Retired in 1992.\n6. Craig Bradley - 1986-2002. Retired in 2002.\n7. Brad Johnson - 1994-2010. Retired in 2010.\n8. Brent Harvey - 1996-Present. Still active as of now, but again, we need to check up to 2013.\n9. Andrew McLeod - 1995-2010. Retired in 2010.\n10. Kevin Murray - Career: 1955-1964, 1967-1974. Retired in 1974.\n11. Adam Goodes - 1999-Present. Still active as of now, so by September 2013, he was still playing.\n12. Ian Nankervis - 1967-1983. Retired.\n13. Simon Black - 1998-Present. Active in 2013.\n14. Tony Shaw - 1977-1994. Retired.\n15. David Neitz - 1993-2008. Retired.\n16. Matthew Pavlich - 2001-Present. Still active, so as of 2013, he was still playing.\n17. Glen Jakovich - 1991-2004. Retired.\n18. Kane Cornes - 1997-Present. Active in 2013.\n19. Roger Merrett - 1988-1996. Retired.\n20. Bert Hurrey - 1908-1913. Retired a long time ago.\n21. Gary Ablett - 2011-Present. Still active, so as of 2013, he was playing.\n22. Jonathan Giles - 2012-Present. Also active.\n\nNow, the claim says there are 8 players still playing as of September 2013. Let's count how many were still active then.\n\nLooking at each player's career span up to 2013:\n- Dustin Fletcher: 1993-Present. By 2013, he was still playing.\n- Brent Harvey: 1996-Present. Still active.\n- Adam Goodes: 1999-Present. Active.\n- Simon Black: 1998-Present. Active.\n- Matthew Pavlich: 2001-Present. Active.\n- Kane Cornes: 1997-Present. Active.\n- Gary Ablett: 2011-Present. Active.\n- Jonathan Giles: 2012-Present. Active.\n\nWait, that's eight players: Fletcher (row 4), Harvey (row7), Goodes (10), Black (12), Pavlich (15), Cornes (17), Ablett (20), and Giles (21). That makes eight.\n\nBut looking back at the table, each row has a rank from 1 to 21. So, in September 2013, the claim says that 8 players on the list are still playing. From my analysis, yes, there are 8 who were active as of that time.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other rows have a career span beyond 2013. For example, row4 is Dustin Fletcher, who is still active now (as of 2023). But in 2013, he was indeed still playing, so that's correct. Similarly, others like Brent Harvey, Adam Goodes, etc., were active.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"8 player on the list be still play.\" So it's asserting that exactly eight are still playing as of September 2013. From my count, there are eight players who retired after 2013 or are still playing now, but in 2013, their careers were ongoing. Therefore, the statement is correct.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim holds true: as of September 2013, eight players listed were still active.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each player's career status as of September 2013, the claim that eight players from the list were still actively playing at that time is accurate. These players include Dustin Fletcher (row4), Brent Harvey (row7), Adam Goodes (row10), Simon Black (row12), Matthew Pavlich (row15), Kane Cornes (row17), Gary Ablett (row20), and Jonathan Giles (row21). Each of these individuals had active careers extending beyond 2013, confirming the validity of the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is accurate. As of September 2013, there were eight players on the list who were still actively playing.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim that \"Michael Tuck's career span is three years longer than Brad Johnson's\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where Michael Tuck and Brad Johnson are in the table. Looking at the data, Michael Tuck is the first entry, row index 0. His career span is listed as \"1972 - 1991\". Now, for Brad Johnson, I need to locate his row. Scanning through the rows, I see that Brad Johnson is in row index 5. His career span is \"1994 - 2010\".\n\nNext, I should calculate the duration of each career. For Michael Tuck, from 1972 to 1991: Let me subtract 1972 from 1991. That gives 19 years because 1991 minus 1972 is 19. Wait, no, actually, that's correct. From 1972 inclusive to 1991 inclusive, it's 20 years if you count both start and end. Hmm, wait, maybe I should calculate the exact duration properly.\n\nLet me do this correctly. Career span is typically from the year they joined until the year they left. So Michael Tuck: 1972 - 1991. The number of years can be calculated by subtracting the starting year from the ending year and adding one if both start and end are included. So 1991 - 1972 = 19, plus 1 equals 20 years.\n\nBrad Johnson's career span is \"1994 - 2010\". So that's 2010 minus 1994, which is 16, plus 1 equals 17 years.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. If you join in 1994 and leave in 2010, how many years is that? From 1994 to 2010 inclusive: 2010 - 1994 = 16, but since both years are included, it's 17 years. So Michael Tuck has a career span of 20 years, Brad Johnson has 17 years.\n\nThe claim says Michael's career is three years longer than Brad's. Let's see: 17 + 3 equals 20. Yes, that's correct. So Michael's 20-year career is indeed three years longer than Brad's 17-year career.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure about the calculation methods because sometimes people might count differently. For example, if someone started in 1994 and ended in 2010, that's 16 seasons or 17 calendar years, depending on how it's counted. But in this context, career spans are usually counted as the number of completed years, so from 1994 to 2010 inclusive would be 17 years.\n\nSo Michael Tuck: 1972-1991 is 20 years.\nBrad Johnson: 1994-2010 is 17 years.\nDifference is 3 years, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. Now I need to identify which cells are relevant. Michael Tuck is row index 0, career span column. Brad Johnson is row index 5, career span column.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be [ { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career span\" }, { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"career span\" } ].\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career span\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"career span\"} ]}",

The claim is: \"Essendon be the club when Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden be the player.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It's stating two things:\n1. The club in question is Essendon.\n2. The players involved are Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden.\n\nI need to check the table to see if both of these conditions hold true based on their respective columns: 'club' for the first part and 'player' for the second part, specifically looking at the rows where each player is mentioned.\n\nLooking at the data in the table, I'll go through each row and look for the players Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden. \n\nStarting with Dustin Fletcher, I find him in row 4:\n[\n  4,\n  378,\n  \"dustin fletcher\",\n  \"essendon\",\n  \"1993 - present\"\n]\n\nHere, the club is Essendon, which matches the first part of the claim. So, for Dustin Fletcher, everything checks out.\n\nNext, I look for Simon Madden. He's in row 5:\n[\n  4,\n  378,\n  \"simon madden\",\n  \"essendon\",\n  \"1974 - 1992\"\n]\n\nAgain, the club is Essendon, which aligns with the claim's first condition. So, Simon Madden is also connected to Essendon.\n\nWait a minute, but both players are in the same row with the same rank (row index 4) and games (378). That might be confusing because having two players with the same rank could imply they're from different eras or circumstances. However, according to the table, both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden are indeed associated with Essendon.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied\u2014Essendon is the club for both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden\u2014the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: I need to list the cells that support this. For Dustin Fletcher, it's row 4, 'club' column. For Simon Madden, also row 4, same column. So the relevant_cells would include those two entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking both players' clubs.

The claim says, \"Kevin Murray be one of the players who have a 3-year break in between.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find Kevin Murray. Scanning down the data, I see he's at row index 9 with the following details: rank is 9, games are 333, player name is Kevin Murray, club is Fitzroy, and career span is \"1955 - 1964 , 1967 - 1974\". \n\nSo his career is from 1955 to 1964, which is a 9-year period. Then he had another stretch from 1967 to 1974, which is another 7 years. But wait, between those two periods, there's a gap from 1964 to 1967, which is exactly 3 years. That matches the claim of having a 3-year break in between.\n\nI need to check if any other players have similar breaks. Looking at the table, I see Robert Harvey (row 3) has a career span from 1988-2008, so that's 20 years without any breaks mentioned. Dustin Fletcher (row 4) plays until present, so no break there. Adam Goodes has a long career with no breaks either.\n\nNow, focusing back on Kevin Murray, his career has two periods separated by exactly 3 years.

The claim is: \"Kevin Bartlett played 23 more games than Michael Tuck did in their careers.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim refers to. It mentions two players: Kevin Bartlett and Michael Tuck. So, I need to find their respective data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: rank, games, player, club, career span. The relevant column for the number of games is \"games.\" \n\nLet me locate Michael Tuck first. Scanning down the rows, I see his entry is row 0 with rank 1, so that's Michael Tuck. His games are listed as 426.\n\nNext, Kevin Bartlett. Let me check each row: row 1 has Kevin Bartlett with 403 games. So, Michael Tuck has 426 and Kevin Bartlett has 403.\n\nWait, the claim says Kevin played 23 more games than Michael. But here, Michael has more games (426) than Kevin's 403. The difference is 426 - 403 = 23. So it seems like Michael has 23 more games, not Kevin.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check: the claim says \"Kevin Bartlett play 23 more game[s] than Michael Tuck.\" So if Kevin's games are higher than Michael's by 23, that would mean Kevin has more. But according to the table, Michael has 426 and Kevin has 403. That means Michael actually has more games.\n\nSo the claim is stating it the other way around. Therefore, the statement is false because Kevin played fewer games than Michael Tuck, not 23 more.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Kevin Bartlett playing 23 more games than Michael Tuck is true, we compare their respective game counts in the table.\n\n1. **Michael Tuck's Data**: Found in row 0 with 426 games.\n2. **Kevin Bartlett's Data**: Found in row 1 with 403 games.\n\nThe claim states that Kevin has 23 more games than Michael.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are rank, games, player, club, and career span. Each row represents a player with their respective stats. \n\nThe claim specifically compares Michael Tuck's career span to Brad Johnson's. So I need to find the rows for both players in the table.\n\nStarting with Michael Tuck: Scanning through the data, I see that the first row has his details. His rank is 1, games are 426, and his career span is listed as \"1972 - 1991\". Let me calculate the length of this career. From 1972 to 1991 inclusive, that's 20 years.\n\nNext, looking for Brad Johnson in the table. The sixth row is Brad Johnson with rank 6, games 364, and his career span is from \"1994 - 2010\". Calculating that duration: 2010 minus 1994 gives 16 years. But wait, does this include both the starting and ending years? So from 1994 to 2010, that's 17 years because you count each year he played. Hmm, but sometimes career spans are reported as the number of seasons, which might not always add up exactly due to draft systems or other factors.\n\nWait, actually, when you subtract the start year from the end year, adding one gives the total duration in years. So 2010 - 1994 = 16, plus 1 is 17 years. But I think in this context, it's just the range provided, so maybe we should take it as 16 years because from 1994 to 2010 is 16 years later.\n\nNow, Michael Tuck has a career span of 20 years and Brad Johnson has 17 years. The claim says Tuck's is three years shorter than Johnson's. So let me check the difference: 20 (Tuck) vs. 17 (Johnson). Wait, that would mean Tuck has a longer career, which is the opposite of what the claim states.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating. Let me double-check. For Michael Tuck: from 1972 to 1991. So 1991 - 1972 = 19 years. Adding 1 for the starting year, that's 20 years. Brad Johnson: 2010 - 1994 = 16 years. Adding 1 gives 17 years.\n\nSo Tuck played for 20 years and Johnson for 17. The claim says Tuck is three years shorter than Johnson, which would mean Tuck's career should be 17 + 3 = 20. Wait, no: if it's three years shorter, then Tuck's career is Johnson's minus three. So if Johnson played 20, Tuck would have 17. But here, Tuck has a longer career than Johnson.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me rephrase the claim: Michael Tuck's career span is three years shorter than Brad Johnson's. So Tuck's = Johnson's - 3. If Johnson played until 2010, then Tuck would have played from 1994 to 2013 (16 + 3 =19? Wait, no: 17 -3=14? This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that Tuck's career span is three years shorter in terms of duration. So if Johnson's is 17 years, then Tuck's should be 14 years (17-3). But Tuck has a 20-year career. That doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false because Michael Tuck's career is longer than Brad Johnson's by three years.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check again: Tuck from '72-'91: that's 19 years (since 1991-1972=19). So 19 years? Or 20? Wait, if you include both the start and end years, it's 20. For example, 2010 - 1994 =16, plus 1 is 17.\n\nSo Tuck: 1972-1991: 20 years. Johnson: 1994-2010: 17 years. So Tuck's career is 3 years longer (20 vs 17). Therefore, the claim that Tuck's is three years shorter than Johnson's is false because it's actually longer.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, regarding which cells are relevant: Michael Tuck is at row 0, columns rank (1), games (426), and career span. Brad Johnson is at row 5, with rank 6, games 364, and career span from '94-'10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are Michael Tuck's row 0 and \"career span\", and Brad Johnson's row 5 and his \"career span\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Michael Tuck's career span is three years shorter than Brad Johnson's is false. Michael Tuck's career was longer by three years.\n\n**Answer:**\n- **Statement:** FALSE\n- **Relevant Cells:**\n  - Michael Tuck: Row 0, Column \"Career Span\"\n  - Brad Johnson: Row 5, Column \"Career Span\"\n\nThe career spans are:\n- Michael Tuck: 1972 - 1991 (20 years)\n- Brad Johnson: 1994 - 2010 (17 years)\n\nTuck's career is three years longer than Johnson's.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table lists players with various details like rank, games, player name, club, and career span. The claim is: \"as of the september 2013 source , 8 player on the list be retire.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems to state that as of September 2013, there should be 8 players listed who are retired. My goal is to check if this is true by looking at the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table's data, each row represents a player with their rank, games played, club, and career span. The \"career span\" column gives years when they started and ended their careers. I need to determine for each player whether they were retired as of September 2013.\n\nSo, my approach is:\n\n1. Identify which players had retired by September 2013.\n2. Count how many such players are in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"career span\" to see if their career ended before or up to September 2013.\n\nStarting with the first player: Michael Tuck, career span 1972-1991. He retired in 1991, which is before September 2013. So he should be considered retired.\n\nSecond player: Kevin Bartlett, 1965-1983. Retired by 1983, so yes.\n\nThird: Robert Harvey, 1988-2008. Retired in 2008, still before 2013.\n\nFourth: Dustin Fletcher with career span 1993-present. He's still active as of 2023, so not retired in 2013.\n\nFifth player is Simon Madden, career 1974-1992. Retired by 1992, yes.\n\nSixth: Craig Bradley, 1986-2002. Retired in 2002, yes.\n\nSeventh: Brad Johnson, 1994-2010. Retired in 2010, yes.\n\nEighth: Brent Harvey, career 1996-present. Still active, so not retired in 2013.\n\nNinth: Andrew McLeod, 1995-2010. Retired in 2010, yes.\n\nTenth: Kevin Murray, with two spans: 1955-1964 and 1967-1974. He had a break, but his last career end is 1974, so he's retired by 2013, yes.\n\nEleventh: Adam Goodes, career 1999-present. Still active, not retired in 2013.\n\nTwelfth: Ian Nankervis, 1967-1983. Retired by 1983, yes.\n\nThirteenth: Simon Black, career 1998-present. Active, so no.\n\nFourteenth: Tony Shaw, 1977-1994. Retired by 1994, yes.\n\nFifteenth: David Neitz, 1993-2008. Retired in 2008, yes.\n\nSixteenth: Matthew Pavlich, 2001-present. Active, not retired in 2013.\n\nSeventeenth: Glen Jakovich, 1991-2004. Retired by 2004, yes.\n\nEighteenth: Kane Cornes, 1997-present. Active, no.\n\nNineteenth: Roger Merrett, 1988-1996. Retired in 1996, yes.\n\nTwentieth: Bert Hurrey, 1908-1913. Retired by 1913, way before 2013.\n\nTwenty-first: Gary Ablett, career 2011-present. Active, not retired in 2013.\n\nNow, let's count the number of players who were retired by September 2013:\n\n1. Michael Tuck\n2. Kevin Bartlett\n3. Robert Harvey\n4. Simon Madden\n5. Craig Bradley\n6. Brad Johnson\n7. Brent Harvey \u2013 Wait, no. Wait, the eighth player is Brent Harvey, but he's active as of 2013, so not retired.\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nRows 0-20 (since there are 21 rows, indices 0 to 20). Each row corresponds to a player. Now, for each player, determine if they were retired as of September 2013.\n\nSo, I'll list them with their index and whether they're retired:\n\nRow 0: Michael Tuck \u2013 Retired\nRow 1: Kevin Bartlett \u2013 Retired\nRow 2: Robert Harvey \u2013 Retired\nRow 3: Dustin Fletcher \u2013 Not retired\nRow 4: Simon Madden \u2013 Retired\nRow 5: Craig Bradley \u2013 Retired\nRow 6: Brad Johnson \u2013 Retired\nRow 7: Brent Harvey \u2013 Not retired\nRow 8: Andrew McLeod \u2013 Retired\nRow 9: Kevin Murray \u2013 Retired\nRow 10: Adam Goodes \u2013 Not retired\nRow 11: Ian Nankervis \u2013 Retired\nRow 12: Simon Black \u2013 Not retired\nRow 13: Tony Shaw \u2013 Retired\nRow 14: David Neitz \u2013 Retired\nRow 15: Matthew Pavlich \u2013 Not retired\nRow 16: Glen Jakovich \u2013 Retired\nRow 17: Kane Cornes \u2013 Not retired\nRow 18: Roger Merrett \u2013 Retired\nRow 19: Bert Hurrey \u2013 Retired\nRow 20: Gary Ablett \u2013 Not retired\n\nNow, count the number of players who are retired:\n\nRows 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,11,13,14,16,18,19.\n\nThat's 14 players. Wait, but wait, I might have miscounted.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nFrom row 0 to row 20 (21 players):\n\nRetired players are:\n\nRow 0: Yes\n1: Yes\n2: Yes\n4: Yes\n5: Yes\n6: Yes\n8: Yes\n9: Yes\n11: Yes\n13: Yes\n14: Yes\n16: Yes\n18: Yes\n19: Yes\n\nTotal of 14.\n\nSo, in the table, there are 14 players who were retired by September 2013. But the claim is that \"8 player on the list be retire.\" So the claim says exactly 8, but the actual number is 14.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. So the task was to assess if it's true or not, and conclude.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are eight retired players as of September 2013. However, upon reviewing the table, 14 players were found to have retired by that time. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; there are actually 14 retired players on the list as of September 2013.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"St Kilda be the club when Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden be the player.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It's saying that in the data, there are players named Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden who play for the St Kilda club.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find these names.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Player is Michael Tuck, club is Hawthorn.\n- Row 1: Kevin Bartlett, Richmond.\n- Row 2: Robert Harvey, St Kilda. Not relevant yet.\n- Row 3: Dustin Fletcher, Essendon. So he's with Essendon, not St Kilda.\n- Row 4: Simon Madden, Essendon as well, from 1974 to 1992.\n\nSo both Dustin and Simon are listed here with Essendon. \n\nContinuing:\n\n- Row 5: Craig Bradley, Carlton.\n- Row 6: Brad Johnson, Footscray/Western Bulldogs.\n- Row 7: Brent Harvey, North Melbourne/Kangaroos.\n- Row 8: Andrew McLeod, Adelaide.\n- Row 9: Kevin Murray, Fitzroy, with two spans.\n- Row 10: Adam Goodes, South Melbourne/Sydney Swans.\n- Row 11: Ian Nankervis, Geelong.\n- Row 12: Simon Black, Brisbane Lions.\n- Row 13: Tony Shaw, Collingwood.\n- Row 14: David Neitz, Melbourne.\n- Row 15: Matthew Pavlich, Fremantle.\n- Row 16: Glen Jakovich, West Coast Eagles.\n- Row 17: Kane Cornes, Port Adelaide.\n- Row 18: Roger Merrett, Brisbane Bears.\n- Row 19: Bert Hurrey, University.\n- Row 20: Gary Ablett, Gold Coast.\n- Row 21: Jonathan Giles, Greater Western Sydney.\n\nFrom this, neither Dustin Fletcher nor Simon Madden are listed as being with St Kilda. They're both with Essendon.\n\nSo the claim is that St Kilda is their club, which isn't correct based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where both players are listed, but not for St Kilda.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
