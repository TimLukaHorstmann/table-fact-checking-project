    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is specifically about the total attendance on May 28 being 17132.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The table has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, series. Each row represents a game or event with details filled in each column.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\nThere are six rows in the data array. I need to find which row corresponds to May 28 and then check the 'attendance' value for that specific date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to locate the May 28 entry.\n\n1. First row: May 24, Pittsburgh is the visitor, attendance is 20066.\n2. Second row: May 26, same as above.\n3. Third row: May 28, visitor is Detroit, and I see the attendance is 17132 here.\n4. Fourth row: May 31, different date.\n\nSo, the third row (index 2) is the one for May 28. Now, looking at this row, the 'attendance' column has the value 17132. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the total attendance on May 28 is indeed 17132.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The columns involved are 'date' and 'attendance'. For May 28, which is row index 2, both these columns are needed to verify the claim. So, the relevant cells would be at row_index 2 for both 'date' and 'attendance'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific things: the score must be 0 - 4 and the attendance must be the highest at 20,066.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all matches where the score is exactly \"0 - 4.\" Then among those, check if any have an attendance of 20,066. Also, since it's about the highest attendance, there should be more than one match with this attendance, or at least that no higher attendance exists.\n\nLet me go through each row in the data:\n\n1. Row 0: date is May 24, visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 0 - 4. Attendance is 20,066.\n2. Row 1: May 26, same team and home (Pittsburgh vs Detroit), but score is 0 - 3. So not relevant for the claim.\n3. Rows 2-5: Various scores like 2 - 3, 2 - 1, etc., which don't match 0 - 4.\n\nSo only row 0 has a score of 0 - 4. Now, check if any other rows have a score of 0 - 4. From the table, I see that row 5 has a score of 3 - 2 but not 0 - 4. So only one match has the score 0 - 4.\n\nNow, the claim states that this is the highest attendance for such matches. Since there's only one such match, if its attendance is 20,066 and no other match with a 0 - 4 score exists (which I don't see), then it would be the highest by default, even though there might not be multiple entries.\n\nWait, but to have \"the highest,\" there must be at least two matches. If only one match has that score, then it's automatically the highest because there are no others to compare. However, in this case, the claim specifies that the attendance is 20,066. Since only row 0 meets both conditions (score and attendance), and it's the only one, technically, it's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066.\" So even if there's only one such match, its attendance is 20,066, which is indeed the maximum because no others exist. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to check the cells that confirm both conditions: the score being 0 - 4 and attendance being 20,066. The relevant cells are row 0 for both 'score' and 'attendance'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the attendance on May 28 be lower than the attendance on May 31\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim are relevant to the table. The claim specifically mentions two dates: May 28 and May 31. So, I'm looking for the \"attendance\" column values for these two dates.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns include \"date,\" \"visitor,\" \"score,\" \"home,\" \"decision,\" \"attendance,\" and \"series.\" The \"attendance\" column is one of the relevant ones here.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find the entries corresponding to May 28 and May 31. \n\n- The first row has \"may 24\" as the date, so that's not relevant.\n- Second row: \"may 26,\" still not our target dates.\n- Third row: \"may 28.\" Here, the attendance is listed as 17132. So, May 28 attendance is 17,132.\n- Fourth row: \"may 31.\" Attendance here is also 17,132.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says that May 28's attendance was lower than May 31. But according to the table, both dates have the same attendance numbers\u201417,132 each. So, they are equal, not one being lower than the other.\n\nSo, the claim implies that May 28 had fewer attendees than May 31, but since both attendances are equal, the claim is false.\n\nTo double-check, I'll look at the columns again to ensure I haven't missed any details. Attendance column definitely has those numbers for those dates. No discrepancies there.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the attendance on May 28 is not lower than that on May 31; they are the same.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the total lowest attendance with a score of 4 - 2 be higher than 20066.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part means. \n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. Each row represents a game with specific details.\n\nThe claim is about two things:\n1. The lowest total attendance (I assume this refers to the minimum attendance across all games that meet certain criteria).\n2. That this lowest attendance corresponds to a game where the score was 4 - 2.\n\nSo, I need to find all games where the score is exactly \"4 - 2\" and then check if their attendance numbers include one that's higher than 20066. Or wait, no\u2014the claim says the total lowest attendance with that score is higher than 20066. Hmm, actually, it might mean that among games with a 4-2 score, what's the lowest attendance, and does that number exceed 20066.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: The claim is saying that the lowest attendance (among those games) is higher than 20066. So if all games with a 4-2 score have attendances above 20066, then the lowest among them would still be above 20066, making the statement TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nLet me go through each row and check for the \"score\" column to see if it's \"4 - 2\". \n\nRow 0: Score is \"0 - 4\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 1: \"0 - 3\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"2 - 3\" \u2013 no.\nRow 3: \"2 - 1\" \u2013 no.\nRow 4: \"4 - 3\" \u2013 close but not exactly 4-2.\nRow 5: \"3 - 2\" \u2013 nope.\n\nWait, none of the rows have a score of \"4 - 2\". That\u2019s odd. If that's the case, there are zero games with a 4-2 score in this table. So, does that mean the claim is automatically FALSE? Because if there are no such games, then there can't be any attendance related to them.\n\nBut let me double-check each row's score:\nRow 0: \"may 24\", visitor is Pittsburgh, score \"0 - 4\"\nRow1: may26, score 0-3\nRow2: may28, detroit visitor, score 2-3\nRow3: may31, score 2-1\nRow4: jun2, pittsburgh visitor, score 4-3\nRow5: jun4, score 3-2.\n\nYes, none of the scores are exactly \"4 - 2\". So there's no data to support any game with that exact score. Therefore, when looking for the lowest attendance among those games, there are none, so it can't be compared to 20066. \n\nThus, the claim is based on a premise that doesn't hold because there are no games in the table with a 4-2 score. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the scores. Let me check again:\n\nRow0: \"0 - 4\" \u2013 Pittsburgh scored 0, Detroit 4.\nRow1: \"0 - 3\" \u2013 same team?\nWait, no, in row1, visitor is still Pittsburgh, score is 0-3, home is Detroit, decision Osmund? Wait, I think I misread. The column after attendance is series, so that's probably the series name or identifier.\n\nBut regardless of that, looking at all rows, none have a score of \"4 - 2\". So no relevant data points exist to evaluate the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to games where the score is exactly \"4 - 2\", but upon reviewing the table, no such game exists. Therefore, there are no attendance figures to compare, making the statement unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
