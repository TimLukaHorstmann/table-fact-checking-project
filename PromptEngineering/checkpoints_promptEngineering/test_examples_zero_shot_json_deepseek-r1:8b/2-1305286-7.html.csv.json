    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions Susan Sarandon being a winner or nominee in 2001. Looking at the table, I should check the 'year' column for 2001 and see if there's an entry where she is listed as either a winner or nominee.\n\nFirst, let me find the row for 2001. Scanning through the data:\n\n- The first row is 1997, not relevant.\n- Second row: 1999, no.\n- Third row: 2001, yes, that's the one I need to check.\n\nLooking at the third row (index 2), the columns are:\n- year: 2001\n- category: favorite voice from an animated movie\n- film: rugrats in paris : the movie\n- winner / nominee (s): susan sarandon\n- result: won\n\nSo, Susan Sarandon was a winner in 2001 for that category. The claim says \"winner nominee,\" which might be a typo or misunderstanding. It should just be \"winner.\" So, the statement is partially correct but not fully accurate because it mentions both \"winner\" and \"nominee.\"\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001.\" Does that mean she was either a winner or a nominee? If so, then technically she was a winner, so the statement is partially true. But if it's meant to say she was both, which isn't the case here, then it might be misleading.\n\nBut the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant. So I need to see if there's any inconsistency or support for the claim as stated.\n\nIn 2001, Susan Sarandon was a winner, so she did win that category. The term \"winner nominee\" seems incorrect because she won, not nominated. Maybe it's a misunderstanding of the term. However, based on the table, she was indeed a winner in 2001 for her category.\n\nSo, does the claim as stated hold true? The claim says she was a winner and a nominee, but according to the table, she was only a winner. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's claiming two roles (winner and nominee) when she only held one. Alternatively, if \"nominee\" was intended as just part of being considered for an award, then maybe it's acceptable, but strictly speaking, she wasn't both.\n\nWait, no, in the table, each row has either 'nominated' or 'won.' So Susan was a winner, not a nominee in that year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says \"winner nominee\" when she was only a winner. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again. The claim is: Susan Sarandon was the winner and nominee in 2001. But according to the table, she was the winner, not a nominee. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's claiming she was both, which isn't the case.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, but I need to make sure about that.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Susan Sarandon was both a winner and a nominee in 2001, while the table shows she only won. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"bruce willis be nominate for the film rugrats go wild\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim against the table data.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main things: Bruce Willis being nominated and the film being \"rugrats go wild.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where either \"bruce willis\" is mentioned or \"rugrats go wild\" as the film. Let me scan through each row.\n\nRow 0: Year 1997, category \"favorite movie actress,\" film \"harriet the spy,\" winner/nominee Rosie O'Donnell, result \"nominated.\" Doesn't match since it's about an actress and a different film.\n\nRow 1: Year 1999, category \"favorite movie,\" film \"the rugrats movie,\" winner/nominee N/A, result \"won.\" Not relevant because the film is different and the winner isn't Bruce Willis.\n\nRow 2: 2001, category \"favorite voice from an animated movie,\" film \"rugrats in paris : the movie,\" winner Susan Sarandon, result won. Again, not related to Bruce or rugrats go wild.\n\nRow 3: Year 2004, category \"favorite voice from an animated movie,\" film \"rugrats go wild,\" winner/nominee Susan Sarandon? Wait, no\u2014looking closer, the third row has category \"favorite voice from an animated movie,\" film is \"rugrats go wild,\" and winner/nominee is \"bruce willis.\" The result is \"nominated.\" So this row directly mentions Bruce Willis being nominated for \"rugrats go wild.\"\n\nRow 4: 2005, category \"favorite movie actor,\" film \"lemony snicket's...,\" nominee Jim Carrey. Not relevant.\n\nRows after that don't mention Bruce or rugrats go wild again.\n\nSo the only relevant cell is in row 3 where Bruce Willis was nominated for \"rugrats go wild.\" Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are this specific row and column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"film\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the winner / nominee (s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions \"winner / nominee (s)\" which corresponds to a column in the table labeled \"winner / nominee(s).\" It also specifies the category as \"favorite movie actor,\" the year is 2007, and the individual is Rosie O'Donnell.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for 2007 under \"favorite movie actor.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first data row is 1997, so not relevant.\n2. Next is 1999, also not 2007.\n3. Then there's 2001, which isn't the target year.\n4. 2004: nope.\n5. 2005: still not 2007.\n6. The next entry is for 2007 and it says \"favorite movie actor,\" so that's the right category and year.\n\nIn this row, under \"winner / nominee (s),\" it says \"nominated.\" So the result was a nomination, not a win. But the claim mentions \"the winner / nominee (s)\", which could refer to either a winner or a nominee.\n\nWait, but Rosie O'Donnell isn't listed here. The 2007 row under \"winner / nominee(s)\" is \"nominated,\" and the person is Jack Black. So Rosie isn't mentioned in this row at all.\n\nI should check other rows for 2007 to see if there's another entry, but looking back, I see that the only 2007 row is about \"favorite movie actor\" with Jack Black as the nominee. There's another 2007 row for \"favorite movie actress,\" which involves Dakota Fanning and a win, but that's not related to the claim in question.\n\nSo, the claim says Rosie was the winner or nominee for favorite movie actor in 2007, but according to the table, she wasn't even nominated that year. In fact, Jack Black was nominated for that category in 2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Rosie O'Donnell isn't listed as a winner or nominee for the \"favorite movie actor\" category in 2007.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Rosie O'Donnell was the winner or nominee for \"favorite movie actor\" in 2007.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns: year, category, film, winner / nominee(s), and result. Each row represents an entry for a specific year in one of the categories.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"result\" of the 1999 \"favorite movie\". So I need to find the row where the year is 1999, the category is \"favorite movie\", and then check the result column.\n\nLooking at the table data, let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 1997, favorite movie actress, harriet the spy, rosie o'donnell, nominated. Doesn't match because it's 1997 and category is different.\n\nRow 1: 1999, favorite movie, the rugrats movie, n/a, won. Here, year is 1999, category is \"favorite movie\", film is \"the rugrats movie\". Result is \"won\".\n\nSo the result for 1999 favorite movie was \"won\", not \"nominated\" as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I got all the details right. The claim says \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\" So they're claiming it's a nomination. But according to the table, in 1999, for favorite movie, the result was \"won\". Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: we need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim refers to two specific pieces of information: the year (1999), the category (\"favorite movie\"), and the result (\"nominated\"). So, in the table, for 1999, the row is index 1. \n\nLooking at that row, the columns involved would be \"year\", \"category\", and \"result\". So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column \"year\"\n- Row 1, column \"category\"\n- Row 1, column \"result\"\n\nWait, but the problem might consider each piece of information separately. Alternatively, maybe each specific fact in the claim should be checked against the table. The claim says two things: that it's a result and that it's a nomination.\n\nBut actually, the claim is a single statement combining both elements. So to verify whether the result was a nomination for 1999 favorite movie, we need to check all three columns for that row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part of the claim corresponds to specific cells. For example, \"result\" refers to the result column, and \"nominated\" is the value in that column. But since the actual result is \"won\", it's false.\n\nSo in terms of relevant cells, we need to include all the columns that are used to evaluate the claim. The claim uses three pieces: year (1999), category (\"favorite movie\"), and result (\"nominated\"). So each of these corresponds to specific columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be row 1's \"year\", \"category\", and \"result\" columns.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether the claim is true or false, we check the relevant data in the table. The claim states that the 1999 favorite movie's result was a nomination, but according to the table, it was won.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - The claim refers to the year 1999.\n   - The category is \"favorite movie\".\n   - The result is claimed to be \"nominated\".\n\n2. **Locate the Row for 1999 in \"favorite movie\" Category:**\n   - Scanning through the rows, we find that row 1 corresponds to 1999, \"favorite movie\", \"the rugrats movie\", and the result is \"won\".\n\n3. **Compare the Result:**\n   - The claim states the result was \"nominated\".\n   - The actual result from the table is \"won\".\n\nSince the actual result does not match the claim, the statement is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 1 (1999), columns: year, category, and result.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
