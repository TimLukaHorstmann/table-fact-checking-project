    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my answer. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"jabaquara lost 14 game and have 57 against.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, and difference. Since the claim is about jabaquara, I should focus on their row in the data section.\n\nLooking through each row in the data array:\n- Row 0: palmeiras\n- Row 1: corinthians\n- Row 2: portuguesa\n- Row 3: s\u00e3 Paulo\n- Row 4: ypiranga - sp\n- Row 5: santos\n- Row 6: juventus\n- Row 7: portuguesa santista\n- Row 8: comercial - sp\n- Row 9: nacional - sp\n- Row 10: jabaquara\n\nSo, jabaquara is in row 10. Now, I need to check the relevant columns for their data.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. \"lost 14 game\" \u2013 This relates to the 'lost' column.\n2. \"have 57 against\" \u2013 This refers to the 'against' column.\n\nLooking at row 10:\n- position: 11 (but not needed here)\n- team: jabaquara\n- points: 8\n- played: 20\n- drawn: 14\n- lost: 4 (Wait, that's conflicting with the claim. The claim says they lost 14 games.)\n- against: 57\n- difference: -35\n\nHmm, in row 10, under 'lost', it's 4, not 14. But according to the 'drawn' column, it's 14. So the claim might be confused between 'lost' and 'drawn'. The 'lost' games are 4, while 'drawn' is 14.\n\nThe claim states \"lost 14 game,\" which doesn't align with the data since 'lost' is 4. However, the 'against' column has 57, which matches the claim. So there's a mix-up between 'lost' and 'drawn.'\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again. The columns are: position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, difference.\n\nIn row 10:\n- 'lost' is 4\n- 'drawn' is 14\n\nSo the claim's first part (\"lost 14 game\") is incorrect because it's actually drawn that's 14. The second part about having 57 against is correct.\n\nSince the claim has an error in one of its parts, does that make the entire claim false? Or do I consider each part separately?\n\nWait, the instructions say to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine if they're fully supported. If any part isn't supported, the answer is false.\n\nSo, the claim has two conditions:\n1. lost 14 games\n2. have 57 against\n\nThe second condition is correct, but the first is incorrect because they actually drew 14 games, not lost them. Therefore, since one part of the claim isn't fully supported, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: for both conditions, we need to check 'lost' and 'against'. So row_index is 10, columns are 'lost' and 'against'.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is false because the number of lost games doesn't match. The relevant cells are the 'lost' and 'against' entries for jabaquara.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
