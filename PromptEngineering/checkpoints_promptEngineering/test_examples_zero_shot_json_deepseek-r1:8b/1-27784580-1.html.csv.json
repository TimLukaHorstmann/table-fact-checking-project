    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 7 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, I should break this down into parts to understand which cells in the table might be relevant. The key elements here are:\n\n1. \"arienai kisu\" - This seems like an episode title.\n2. \"broadcast 7 day after\" - Indicates a time frame between two broadcasts.\n3. \"the title with the earliest broadcast date\" - Refers to another episode's title that was first aired earlier.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like the episode number, title in Japanese (romanized), translation of the title, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nI need to find two episodes: one is \"arienai kisu\" which I believe is the second episode as seen from row index 1. The other is the earliest broadcast date, which would be the first episode aired on May 10, 2010 (row index 0).\n\nThe claim says that \"arienai kisu\" is broadcast 7 days after this earliest date. So I should check if there's a 7-day difference between their broadcast dates.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"episode title\" is \"arienai kisu\", broadcast date May 17, 2010. The earliest is May 10, so the difference is 7 days (May 17 - May 10 = 7). That fits perfectly.\n\nNow, I should identify which columns are relevant. The relevant data points would be the row indices and their \"broadcast date\" column since that's where the dates are located. So for row index 1 and row index 0, we look at the broadcast date cells.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For \"arienai kisu\": row_index=1, column_name=\"broadcast date\"\n- For the earliest broadcast date: row_index=0, column_name=\"broadcast date\"\n\nI think that's all. So the claim is TRUE because there's a 7-day gap between these two episodes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast exactly seven days after the first episode.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim is: \"arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of this claim correspond to data in the table. The key elements here are \"arienai kisu\" and \"rating.\" So, I need to find the row where the episode is titled \"arienai kisu\" and then compare its rating with another episode that has the earliest broadcast date.\n\nLooking at the table structure: each row represents an episode, with columns like \"episode title,\" \"romanized title,\" etc. The relevant column for this claim seems to be the \"ratings\" column.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find the one where the \"episode title\" is \"arienai kisu.\" Scanning the data:\n\n- ep 1: omae ga hosii\n- ep 2: arienaikisu\nWait, in the table, the second row's \"romanized title\" is \"arienai kisu,\" but the \"episode title\" is \"ep 2.\" So the exact wording of the claim uses \"arienai kisu\" as the title. I need to check if that's an exact match.\n\nWait, in the table, for ep 2, the \"romanized title\" is \"arienai kisu,\" and the \"episode title\" is \"ep 2.\" So perhaps the claim refers to the romanized title? Or does it mean the episode title is exactly \"arienai kisu\"? Hmm. The claim says \"arienai kisu have...\", so I think it's referring to that specific episode, which in the table is ep 2.\n\nSo, the relevant row is row index 1 (since it's zero-indexed) and the column is \"ratings,\" which is 19.2%.\n\nNext, I need to find the title with the earliest broadcast date. Let me look at the \"broadcast date\" column.\n\nThe dates are:\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which is in ep 1.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"arienai kisu\" has a rating that is 3.2% less than this earliest episode's rating.\n\nSo, let me calculate: The earliest rating is ep 1's 22.4%. If we subtract 3.2%, what do we get? Let's see: 22.4 - 3.2 = 19.2%.\n\nLooking at ep 2 (arienai kisu)'s rating, it's 19.2%, which matches the calculated value.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. The claim refers to \"arienai kisu,\" which we found in row 1. Its rating is 19.2%, and the earliest broadcast date is ep 1 with 22.4%. 19.2 is indeed 3.2% less than 22.4 because 22.4 - 3.2 = 19.2.\n\nSo, yes, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the rating for \"arienai kisu\" and the earliest broadcast date's episode's rating.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of this claim means. The key elements are \"suki to ietara iinoni\" and \"the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like \"episode title,\" \"romanized title,\" etc., but there's also a column called \"broadcast date.\" My first thought is that I need to find the episode titled \"suki to ietara iinoni\" and check its broadcast date.\n\nIn the data part of the table, I see several rows. Each row corresponds to an episode, starting from ep 1 up to ep 6. The fifth row (since it's zero-indexed, so row_index 4) has the details for \"ep 5.\" The romanized title there is \"suki to ietara iinoni,\" which matches the name in the claim.\n\nSo, I should focus on that row. The relevant columns here are \"broadcast date\" because the claim is about the date when this episode was broadcast. \n\nLooking at the data for ep 5, the broadcast date is listed as \"june 7 , 2010.\" Now, I need to determine whether this date is the second most recent in the table.\n\nTo do that, I should list all the broadcast dates from the table:\n\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nNow, arranging these dates in order from most recent to least recent:\n\n1. June 14, 2010 (ep 6)\n2. June 7, 2010 (ep 5)\n3. May 31, 2010 (ep 4)\n4. May 24, 2010 (ep 3)\n5. May 17, 2010 (ep 2)\n6. May 10, 2010 (ep 1)\n\nSo, the most recent broadcast date is June 14, 2010 (ep 6), and the second most recent is June 7, 2010 (ep 5). \n\nThe claim says that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. Since ep 5's broadcast date is June 7, which is indeed the second most recent, the claim seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify the relevant cells. The relevant cell is in row_index 4 (since it's the fifth episode) and the column_name \"broadcast date.\"\n</think>\n\nThe episode \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has the broadcast date of June 7, 2010, which is the second most recent among all episodes listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 2.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nI need to check if the specific episode titled \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has a rating that is exactly 2.2 percentage points higher than the episode with the latest broadcast date.\n\nLooking at the table, I should first identify which row corresponds to \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" Let me scan through the 'episode title' column:\n\n- ep 1: omae ga hosii\n- ep 2: arienai kisu\n- ep 3: fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\n- ep 4: konna ni suki dattanda...\n- ep 5: suki to ietara iinoni\n- ep 6: saish\u016bshojomakuwakare\n\nSo, the episode in question is ep 3. Now, I need to find its rating. From the table, the 'ratings' column for ep 3 is 15.6%.\n\nNext, I should determine which title has the most recent broadcast date. The broadcast dates are:\n\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe most recent broadcast date is June 14, 2010, which corresponds to ep 6. Looking at the 'ratings' column for ep 6, it's 13.4%.\n\nNow, calculate the difference between ep 3's rating and ep 6's rating: 15.6% - 13.4% = 2.2%. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other episodes with the same broadcast date or if I missed something. No, each episode has a unique broadcast date in ascending order. So ep 6 is indeed the most recent.\n\nTherefore, since 15.6% (ep 3) - 13.4% (ep 6) = 2.2%, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to verify that \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has a rating 2.2% higher than the episode with the most recent broadcast date.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row and column:**\n   - The episode title \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" is in ep 3.\n   - The ratings are in the 'ratings' column for each episode.\n\n2. **Check the ratings:**\n   - Ep 3's rating is 15.6%.\n   - The most recent broadcast date (ep 6) has a rating of 13.4%.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 15.6% - 13.4% = 2.2%.\n\nSince this matches the claim, it is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 4% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are:\n- Unnamed: 0\n- episode title\n- romanized title\n- translation of title\n- broadcast date\n- ratings\n\nThe data has six rows, each representing an episode from ep 1 to ep 6.\n\nI need to check two main things for the claim:\n\n1. Does \"suki to ietara iinoni\" refer to a specific episode's title?\n2. Is that episode's rating exactly 4% higher than the lowest-rated episode?\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll search through each row's 'romanized title' and 'episode title' for \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Looking at row 5:\n\n- Romanized title: \"suki to ietara iinoni\"\n- Episode title: same as romanized.\n\nSo this is the fifth episode, ep 5. Its rating is 17.4%.\n\nNext, I need to find the lowest-rated episode. Let's look through all ratings:\nep1:22.4%, ep2:19.2%, ep3:15.6%, ep4:15.5%, ep5:17.4%, ep6:13.4%\n\nThe lowest is ep6 with 13.4%.\n\nNow, I need to see if ep5's rating (17.4%) is 4% higher than ep6's. Let's calculate the difference:\n\n17.4 - 13.4 = 4%. \n\nWait, exactly 4%, so that fits. So the claim seems TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Ep5:17.4, ep6:13.4. The difference is indeed 4 percentage points. Since 17.4 is higher than 13.4 by exactly 4%, it's correct.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells. For the claim, I need to know which row and column for \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Looking at the table, it's in data[5], which is row index 5 (since arrays start at 0), but wait, ep1 is row 0, so ep5 would be row index 4. Wait no: the first element is ep1, so row 0 is ep1, row 1 ep2... up to row 5 being ep6.\n\nWait, no. The data array starts with ep1 as the first row (index 0). So:\n\nRow 0: ep1\nRow 1: ep2\nRow 2: ep3\nRow 3: ep4\nRow 4: ep5\nRow 5: ep6\n\nSo \"suki to ietara iinoni\" is in row index 4, column 'ratings' as well. So relevant cells are the ratings for ep5 and the lowest-rated episode, which is ep6 (row5).\n\nWait, but the claim is about comparing two specific episodes, so I need both of their ratings columns.\n\nSo:\n\n- For \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (ep5), we look at row index 4, column 'ratings'.\n- For the lowest-rated episode, which is ep6 (row5), column 'ratings'.\n\nTherefore, relevant_cells should include these two rows and columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a rating of 17.4%, which is exactly 4% higher than the lowest-rated episode, ep6 with 13.4%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 14 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think it means that the episode titled \"Arikenai Kisu\" was aired 14 days after another episode with the earliest broadcast date. Or maybe it's saying that this particular episode was 14 days after another one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode. The columns include \"Unnamed: 0\" (which seems to be the episode number), \"episode title\", \"romanized title\", \"translation of title\", \"broadcast date\", and \"ratings\". \n\nI need to find where \"arienai kisu\" is mentioned in the table. Scrolling through the data, I see that in row 1 (row_index: 1) the romanized title is \"arienai kisu\". So this is episode 2, with a broadcast date of May 17, 2010.\n\nNow, the claim says it should be broadcast 14 days after another title. The other title would be the earliest one, which is probably episode 1 on May 10, 2010. Let's calculate the difference between May 10 and May 17. That's exactly 7 days apart, not 14 days. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Maybe the claim is about being 14 days after another episode with the earliest date. But in this case, \"arienai kisu\" is on May 17, and if we look for an episode that's 14 days before it, that would be April 3, 2010. Is there such a date? No, the earliest broadcast date here is May 10. So even if I check 14 days after May 10, that would be May 24, which is another episode (episode 3). But \"arienai kisu\" isn't on May 24.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcasted 14 days after the earliest broadcast date. The earliest broadcast in the table is May 10, so adding 14 days would bring us to May 24. Let's see if \"arienai kisu\" is on May 24. But looking at the data, it's on May 17, which is only 7 days after May 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim again. The claim says \"the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" So maybe another episode has the earliest broadcast date, and then \"arienai kisu\" is 14 days after that. But in this table, \"arienai kisu\" is on May 17, which is 7 days after May 10 (earliest). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcasted 14 days after another episode's title. So maybe it's referring to another episode being 14 days before \"arienai kisu\". Let me check: if an episode was on May 3 (14 days before May 17), but the table starts with May 10, so that's not possible either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim could mean that for the episode titled \"Arikenai Kusu,\" it was broadcasted 14 days after another episode with the earliest broadcast date. Since the earliest is May 10, adding 14 days would be May 24. But in the table, \"arienai kisu\" is on May 17, which is not 14 days later. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to check if \"arienai kisu\" was broadcasted on the same date as another episode plus 14 days. Looking at all episodes:\n\n- Episode 1: May 10\n- Episode 2: May 17 (7 days after)\n- Episode 3: May 24 (another 7 days later)\n- Episode 4: May 31\n- Episode 5: June 7\n- Episode 6: June 14\n\nSo each week is a 7-day difference. Therefore, \"arienai kisu\" is 7 days after the earliest date, not 14. So the claim's assertion of 14 days isn't correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are where \"arienai kisu\" is located because that's the episode in question.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast 14 days after another episode with the earliest broadcast date. However, analyzing the table shows that \"arienai kisu\" aired on May 17, which is only 7 days after the earliest broadcast of May 10. Since this doesn't meet the 14-day requirement, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"romanized title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which episodes are relevant here. The claim mentions \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu,\" which translates to \"The Proposal Out of Revenge.\" Looking at the table data, that's episode 3, so row index 2 (since it starts from 0).\n\nNext, I need to look into the broadcast dates for each episode to see where this one stands. The broadcast dates are May 10, 2010; May 17, 2010; May 24, 2010; May 31, 2010; June 7, 2010; and June 14, 2010.\n\nNow, I should list these dates in order to determine the most recent and second most recent. Starting from the latest:\n\n1. June 14, 2010 (Episode 6)\n2. June 7, 2010 (Episode 5)\n3. May 31, 2010 (Episode 4)\n4. May 24, 2010 (Episode 3)\n5. May 17, 2010 (Episode 2)\n6. May 10, 2010 (Episode 1)\n\nSo the most recent is June 14, and the second most recent is June 7. The claim is about \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu,\" which is Episode 3 on May 24. Looking at the list, that's the fourth most recent. Therefore, it doesn't have the second most recent broadcast date.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. The dates in order are June 14 (1), June 7 (2), May 31 (3), May 24 (4), May 17 (5), May 10 (6). So Episode 3 is on May 24, which is the fourth latest.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"arienai kisu have 5.8% more rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" So, I need to check two main things:\n\n1. Does \"arienai kisu\" refer to an episode in the table?\n2. Is there a title (episode) that was broadcasted earliest, and does \"arienai kisu\" have a rating that's 5.8% higher than that?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details like episode number, title in different languages, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which row corresponds to \"arienai kisu.\" Scanning through the 'romanized title' column:\n\n- Row 0: \"omae ga hosii\"\n- Row 1: \"arienai kisu\" \u2192 This is our target episode.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6: Other episodes.\n\nSo, row 1 is where \"arienai kisu\" is located.\n\nNext, I need to find the episode with the earliest broadcast date. The 'broadcast date' column gives the dates:\n\n- Row 0: May 10, 2010\n- Row 1: May 17, 2010\n- Row 2: May 24, 2010\n- Row 3: May 31, 2010\n- Row 4: June 7, 2010\n- Row 5: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest date is May 10, 2010, which is in row 0. So, the episode with the earliest broadcast date is \"ep 1\" or \"omae ga hosii.\"\n\nNow, I need to check if \"arienai kisu\" (row 1) has a rating that's 5.8% higher than \"omae ga hosii\" (row 0). Let me calculate the percentages:\n\n- Row 0: 22.4%\n- Row 1: 19.2%\n\nTo find if row 1 is 5.8% more than row 0, I'll compute 22.4 + (0.058 * 22.4) = 22.4 + approx 1.302 = 23.702%. But the rating for row 1 is 19.2%, which is actually lower than 23.7%. So, it's not higher by 5.8%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation is done differently, like whether row 1 is 5.8% higher than row 0 in another way. Let me check: (19.2 - 22.4)/22.4 = (-3.2)/22.4 \u2248 -14.29%. That's a decrease of about 14%, not an increase.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is phrased as \"have 5.8% more rating than...\", so maybe it's that row1's rating is higher than the earliest by 5.8%. But in reality, it's lower. So the claim is false.\n\nBut I should also ensure there are no other interpretations. Maybe the claim refers to the first episode as \"the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" That seems correct. So yes, row0 is the earliest, and row1 isn't higher by 5.8%.\n\nSo the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. The claim says: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 3.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" is one of the episode titles in the table. Looking at the data, that's from ep 3, where the romanized title is \"the proposal out of revenge.\" The rating for that episode is 15.6%.\n\nNext, the claim refers to \"the title with the most recent broadcast date.\" To find this, I should look for the episode that was broadcasted latest in time. Scanning through the broadcast dates: ep 1 on May 10, 2010; ep 2 on May 17, 2010; ep 3 on May 24, 2010; ep 4 on May 31, 2010; ep 5 on June 7, 2010; and ep 6 on June 14, 2010. The most recent one is ep 6 from June 14, 2010.\n\nSo the title for ep 6 is \"a prologue of final chapter , farewell,\" with a rating of 13.4%.\n\nNow, comparing these two ratings: 15.6% vs. 13.4%. To see if the claim holds, I need to check if 15.6% is 3.2% higher than 13.4%. Let's calculate the difference: 15.6 - 13.4 equals 2.2%, which is less than 3.2%. Therefore, the claim that \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has a 3.2% higher rating isn't accurate.\n\nI should also verify which cells in the table are relevant. The column for ratings is \"ratings,\" and the specific row for ep 3 is row index 2 (since rows start at 0). So, the relevant cells would be the \"row_index\": 2 and the \"column_name\": \"ratings.\"\n\nTherefore, since the claim's percentage difference isn't supported by the table data, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. I need to find two things: \n1. Which episode has the title \"suki to ietara iinoni.\"\n2. What is the lowest rating among all episodes.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like \"Unnamed: 0,\" which seems to be the episode number or identifier, \"episode title\" as the title, and so on. The data rows have each episode's details.\n\nStarting with the first part: Find the row where the \"episode title\" is \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: \"ep 1\" has the title \"\\u304a\\u307e\\u3048\\u304c\\u6b32\\u3057\\u3044\", which I think translates to \"Omae ga hosii\" or \"I want you.\"\n- Row 1: \"ep 2\" has \"arienai kisu,\" which is \"The unthinkable kiss.\"\n- Row 2: \"ep 3\" has a longer title that doesn't match.\n- Row 3: \"ep 4\" translates to something else.\n- Row 4: \"ep 5\" has the title \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Okay, found it. So this is row index 4.\n\nNow, looking for the lowest rating in the ratings column. Let me list out the ratings:\n\n- ep 1: 22.4%\n- ep 2: 19.2%\n- ep 3: 15.6%\n- ep 4: 15.5%\n- ep 5: 17.4%\n- ep 6: 13.4%\n\nSo, the lowest rating is 13.4%, which is from ep 6.\n\nNow, checking the claim: \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (ep 5) has a rating of 17.4%. The claim says it's 5.8% higher than the lowest-rated episode (13.4%). Let me calculate the difference: 17.4 - 13.4 = 4.0%. The claim states 5.8%, which is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. \n\nThe columns involved are \"episode title\" (to find the specific episode) and \"ratings\" (to get both ratings). So, for ep 5, the row index is 4. The columns needed are \"episode title\" at row 4 and the \"ratings\" column across all rows to identify the lowest rating.\n\nWait, actually, maybe not. Because the claim refers to the specific episode's rating compared to another. But in terms of relevant cells, it's about which data points we check. So, the \"suki...\" episode is at row 4, so its title and ratings are needed. Also, the lowest-rated episode is ep 6 (row 5), so we need that row's rating as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the specific cells for the ratings of both episodes. Hmm.\n\nThe instruction says to list relevant cells that verify the claim. The claim compares two things: the \"suki...\" title's rating and the lowest-rated episode's rating. So, I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- For \"suki...\", it's row 4, column \"ratings.\"\n- For the lowest-rated, we need to check all ratings to find the minimum, but perhaps each row's \"ratings\" cell is involved in determining that.\n\nBut since the table provides all data, maybe it's just the specific cells of ep5 and ep6. Alternatively, the claim doesn't specify which title is lowest, so I think the relevant cells would be:\n\n- The \"episode title\" column at row 4 (to identify the correct episode)\n- The \"ratings\" column for that row (17.4%) and also for all rows to find the minimum (which is ep6's 13.4%).\n\nBut since the user wants the cells that are checked, perhaps it's:\n\n1. The cell in \"episode title\" at row 4.\n2. The cell in \"ratings\" at row 4 (17.4%) and the cell at row 5 (13.4%).\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row 4, column \"episode title\"\n- row 4, column \"ratings\"\n- row 5, column \"ratings\"\n\nBut wait, maybe not all of them. Alternatively, since the claim is about comparing two specific episodes' ratings, we need to verify their individual ratings and that the lowest rating exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n- For ep5: row index 4, columns \"episode title\" and \"ratings.\"\n- For ep6: row index 5, column \"ratings.\"\n\nBecause to check if ep5's rating is higher than the lowest, we need both their ratings.\n\nSo in the answer, I should list the cells that are used for verification. So, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The cell with \"suki to ietara iinoni\" at row 4, column \"episode title.\"\n2. The rating for ep5 (row 4, column \"ratings\").\n3. The ratings of all episodes to find the lowest one, so each row's \"ratings\" column.\n\nBut perhaps more specifically, since we need to verify that ep5's rating is higher than the minimum, which comes from ep6. So, the cells needed are:\n\n- The \"episode title\" cell for ep5 (row 4)\n- The \"ratings\" cell for ep5 (17.4%)\n- The \"ratings\" cell for ep6 (13.4%)\n\nBut also, perhaps all ratings to find the minimum.\n\nHmm, but the user's example includes two cells: one row and one column, or both rows and columns.\n\nWait, in their example, they have two relevant cells from different rows and columns.\n\nIn this case, since we need to check both ep5's rating and compare it to the lowest (ep6's), I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- For ep5: row 4, \"episode title\" and row 4, \"ratings.\"\n- For finding the minimum: all \"ratings\" columns.\n\nBut maybe it's just the specific two ratings involved. So, the cells at row4 and row5 in the \"ratings\" column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to check the claim, we need to retrieve ep5's rating (17.4%) and ep6's rating (13.4%), so their respective \"ratings\" columns.\n\nBut also, knowing which episode is ep6 requires looking up its \"episode title\".\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nI think the correct approach is:\n\n- Identify that ep5 has a higher rating than ep6.\n- So, we need to check ep5's rating (17.4%) and ep6's rating (13.4%).\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. ep5's \"episode title\" (row4)\n2. ep5's \"ratings\" (row4)\n3. ep6's \"episode title\" (row5) to confirm it's the lowest.\n4. ep6's \"ratings\" (row5)\n\nAlternatively, maybe we just need to know which is the lowest, so perhaps all ratings are considered.\n\nBut since the claim only refers to two specific episodes, I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- The \"episode title\" at row4 and the \"ratings\" at row4 (ep5)\n- The \"ratings\" column across all rows to identify the minimum.\n\nBut in terms of data points, it's about knowing which episode is lowest. So, we need to check all ratings.\n\nSo perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n1. ep5's \"episode title\" (row4)\n2. ep5's \"ratings\" (17.4%)\n3. ep6's \"ratings\" (13.4%)\n\nThus, in the answer, I should include these three points.\n\nWait, but maybe not. The instruction says to list the cells that verify the claim, which would be:\n\n- For the subject of the claim (\"suki...\"), we need its \"episode title\" and rating.\n- To know if it's higher than another (lowest), we need to check all ratings to find the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row4, column \"episode title\"\n2. Row4, column \"ratings\"\n3. All rows, \"ratings\" column\n\nBut as specific data points, perhaps just the cells of ep5 and ep6.\n\nI think the safest way is to include both the \"episode title\" at row4 and their respective ratings (ep5's 17.4% and ep6's 13.4%).\n\nSo in the answer, list:\n\n- Row4, column \"episode title\"\n- Row4, column \"ratings\"\n- Row5, column \"ratings\"\n\nBecause that allows us to confirm that ep5 has a higher rating than ep6.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (17.4%) is only 4% higher than the lowest-rated episode (13.4%), not 5.8%. The relevant cells are:\n\n1. **Row 4, Column \"episode title\"**: Identifies the correct episode.\n2. **Row 4, Column \"ratings\"**: Ep5's rating of 17.4%.\n3. **Row 5, Column \"ratings\"**: Ep6's rating of 13.4%.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false. Relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column \"episode title\"\n- Row 4, column \"ratings\"\n- Row 5, column \"ratings\"\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{The claim is false.}}$",
