    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play mariner 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"play mariner\" suggests that the Toronto Blue Jays are playing against the Mariners. So, I should look for any entries in the table where the opponent is either the Mariners or the Blue Jays.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column is \"date,\" the second is \"opponent,\" and so on. Let's go through each row to see who the opponents are.\n\n- April 4: Opponent is Mariners\n- April 5: Mariners again\n- April 6: Angeles (so that's Los Angeles Angels)\n- April 7: Angeles\n- April 8: Angeles\n- April 9: Athletics\n- April 10: Athletics\n- April 13: Rangers\n- April 14: Rangers\n- April 15: Rangers\n- April 17: Orioles\n- April 18: Orioles\n- April 19: Orioles\n- April 20: Angeles\n- April 21: Angeles\n- April 22: Angeles\n- April 23: Mariners\n- April 24: Mariners\n- April 25: Athletics\n- April 26: Athletics\n- April 27: Royals\n- April 28: Royals\n- April 29: Postponed\n- April 30: Postponed\n\nFrom this list, the only opponents are Mariners, Angeles (LA Angels), Athletics (Oakland A's), Rangers, Orioles, and Royals. The Blue Jays from Toronto aren't listed as opponents here. So, there are no games where Toronto Blue Jays play against Mariners in this table.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"toronto blue jay play mariner 4 time.\" The key elements are that it's the Blue Jays playing the Mariners on April 4. But in the table, April 4 is a game between Mariners and someone else, but not the Blue Jays. The opponent for that date is Mariners, which I assume means they're playing another team, possibly the Seattle Mariners.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data, the first row has \"mariners\" as the opponent on April 4, but it's unclear if that's the home team or away. However, regardless of that, the key point is whether the Blue Jays are playing the Mariners on April 4. Since none of the rows have \"blue jay\" in the opponent column, this claim doesn't hold.\n\nMoreover, even if the opponent was the Blue Jays, the date given in the claim is April 4, which isn't a date where Blue Jays are playing the Mariners according to the table. The Blue Jays opponents are not listed at all here; they only play against other teams like Angeles, Athletics, Rangers, Orioles, and Royals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided in the table. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"toronto blue jay play mariner 4 time\" isn't supported by the table since there are no Blue Jays opponents listed. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is asking. It seems like it's saying that the Toronto Blue Jays played a game against the Royals with a score of 3-0. So, the key points are: Toronto Blue Jays, Royals (opponent), score of 3 - 0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a game on a specific date, with various details like opponent, score, and attendance. The columns are: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record. So, for each relevant game, these fields will have data.\n\nNow, my task is to check if there's any game in the table where Toronto Blue Jays played against Royals with a score of 3-0.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to see if the opponent is \"Royals\" and the score matches \"3 - 0\".\n\nGoing row by row:\n\n1. April 4: Opponent is Mariners, score 3 - 2.\n2. April 5: Mariners again, score 13 - 5.\n3. April 6: Angeles (Angels), score 11 - 5.\n4. April 7: Angels, score 3 - 1.\n5. April 8: Angels, score 4 - 3.\n6. April 9: Athletics, score 4 - 3.\n7. April 10: Athletics, score 3 - 0.\n   Wait, here we have the opponent as Athletics, not Royals. So, score is 3-0, but opponent is wrong.\n\n8. April 13: Rangers, score 3 - 2.\n9. April 14: Rangers, score 6 - 2.\n10. April 15: Rangers, score 2 - 1.\n11. April 17: Orioles, score 3 - 2.\n12. April 18: Orioles, score 7 - 1.\n13. April 19: Orioles, score 2 - 1.\n14. April 20: Angels, score 10 - 6 (13).\n15. April 21: Angels, score 8 - 4.\n16. April 22: Angels, score 9 - 6.\n17. April 23: Mariners, score 8 - 5.\n18. April 24: Mariners, score 4 - 2.\n19. April 25: Athletics, score 11 - 0.\n20. April 26: Athletics, score 7 - 4.\n21. April 27: Royals, score 1 - 0.\n22. April 28: Royals, score 6 - 0.\n23. April 29: Postponed game against Royals due to rain.\n24. April 30: Rangers, postponed due to wind.\n\nSo, looking through all these, I don't see any row where the opponent is \"Royals\" and the score is exactly \"3 - 0\". The closest is on April 10, but that's against Athletics with a score of 3-0. But since the opponent isn't Royals there, it doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"play royal 3 time,\" which I think refers to playing the Royals three times, but the table shows multiple games against different teams on various dates, and specifically against Royals on April 27, 28, and 29, with scores of 1-0, 6-0, and a postponed game. None of these have a score of 3-0.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table supporting the claim that Toronto Blue Jays played Royals with a score of 3 - 0. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 3 time\" is not supported by any relevant data in the provided table.

The claim is \"toronto blue jay play royal on april 30.\" The table provided has several columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of the claim relate to each column. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Team Name**: Toronto Blue Jay\n2. **Opponent**: Royal (I think this refers to Kansas City Royals)\n3. **Date**: April 30\n\nSo I need to check if there's a game on April 30 where the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Royals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific date. The last few rows are:\n\n- Row 27: April 28 vs. Royals\n- Row 29: April 29 is postponed\n- Row 30: April 30 is also postponed\n\nWait, in row 30, it's listed as \"rangers\" as the opponent. So on April 30, the Toronto Blue Jays didn't play against the Royals because their game was postponed.\n\nI need to check each relevant column for April 30. The columns that are important here would be:\n\n- **Opponent**: To see who they were supposed to play.\n- **Date**: To confirm it's April 30.\n- Maybe others, but opponent and date are key.\n\nLooking at row index 29 (April 30), the opponent is \"rangers.\" So the game between Blue Jays and Royals didn't happen on April 30; instead, they played against Rangers that day but postponed against Royals. Therefore, there's no game where Blue Jays played Royal on April 30.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there was no such game recorded in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. Each row seems to represent a game, with details about when it was played, who the opponent was, the score, whether they lost, how many people attended, and their overall record after that game.\n\nThe claim is specifically about April 28. So I should look for any row where the date is April 28. Let me scan through each row's date:\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The first few dates are April 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n- Then it jumps to April 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.\n- So on April 28, there is a game against the Royals. The opponent column says \"royals.\"\n\nThe claim says \"Toronto Blue Jays play Athletics on April 28.\" But according to the table, on April 28, the opponent was the Royals, not the Athletics. The Athletics games are on other dates like April 9, 10, 25, 26.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because on April 28, the Blue Jays were playing against the Royals, not the Athletics.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"Toronto Blue Jays play Athletics on April 28\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check the table for any game where both teams are Toronto Blue Jays and their opponent is the Athletics, specifically on April 28.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**: The columns that matter here are \"date,\" \"opponent,\" and possibly others if needed.\n2. **Search for April 28 in the table**: Find the row where the date is April 28.\n3. **Check the opponent on April 28**: Look at who the Blue Jays played on that date.\n\nUpon checking, there is no game on April 28 involving the Athletics as the opponent.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"toronto blue jay.\" From what I know, the Toronto Blue Jays are a baseball team, so they must be playing against another team called the Mariners. Wait, in the table, there's an opponent column with entries like \"mariners,\" which I think refers to the Seattle Mariners. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim says \"play mariner 5 time.\" The word \"time\" here is a bit confusing, but I think it might mean that the game started at a certain time or had a specific duration. Looking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and record. There's no column about the start time or duration of the game.\n\nI need to verify if the table provides any information related to the time aspect of the game. Scanning through the columns: date is there, but that's just the day. No column mentions anything about when the game started or its duration. So, I can't find any relevant cells that support the \"time\" part of the claim.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide information on the time aspect, the claim isn't fully supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"toronto blue jay play angel on april 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It mentions two teams: Toronto Blue Jay and Angel. The game is supposed to have happened on April 9. My goal is to find out if such a game exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI'll start by checking which rows correspond to April 9. Scanning through the \"date\" column:\n\n- Row 0: April 4\n- Row 1: April 5\n- Row 2: April 6\n- Row 3: April 7\n- Row 4: April 8\n- Row 5: April 9\n\nAh, there's a row for April 9. Now, I need to check the \"opponent\" column for that date. In row 5, under \"opponent\", it says \"angels\". So the opponent is the Angels.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"toronto blue jay play angel.\" The opponent in the table is the Angels, so does that mean the Blue Jays played against the Angels on April 9? Yes. \n\nLet me confirm the other details to be thorough. The score for April 9 is listed as \"4 - 3\". There's also a pitcher named \"jackson (0 - 1)\" in the loss column. Attendance was \"24095\". So all these match up.\n\nPutting it all together, the Blue Jays played against the Angels on April 9, which aligns perfectly with the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should make sure there's no mistake in row indices either. The first data row is index 0, so April 4 is row 0. Following that, each subsequent day increments by one. So April 5 is row 1, and April 9 would indeed be row 5 (since 5 - 4 = 1, but considering the starting point correctly). Wait, no, if row 0 is April 4, then row 5 should be April 9 because each day increments by one. So that's correct.\n\nIn conclusion, all aspects of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each relevant cell in the table:\n\n1. **Date Check**: Found the row for April 9 at index 5.\n2. **Opponent Check**: Opponent listed is \"angels\", matching the Angels.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to be about a game where the Toronto Blue Jays are playing against the Royal team, and it's mentioned as \"play royal 4 time.\" I think this might refer to a playoff series or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe they're indicating that the Blue Jays have played the Royals four times.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. The columns are: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record.\n\nSo, I need to check if there's any information in the table that supports this claim. Specifically, I'm looking for instances where the Blue Jays are playing against the Royals with four games in total.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's \"opponent\" column to see if any match \"royals.\" Let me go through each entry:\n\n1. Mariners: Opponent is Mariners.\n2. Mariners: Same here.\n3. Angels: Opponent is Angels.\n4. Angels: Same.\n5. Athletics: Opponent is Athletics.\n6. Athletics: Same.\n7. Rangers: Opponent is Rangers.\n8. Rangers: Same.\n9. Orioles: Opponent is Orioles.\n10. Orioles: Same.\n11. Angels: Again, Angels.\n12. Angels: Same.\n13. Mariners: Back to Mariners.\n14. Mariners: Continue.\n15. Orioles: Orioles again.\n16. Orioles: Same.\n17. Orioles: Still Orioles.\n18. Orioles: Continue.\n19. Orioles: Opponent is Orioles once more.\n20. Angels: Finally, the 20th row has Angeles as the opponent.\n21. Angels: Yes, same here.\n22. Angels: Opponent remains Angeles.\n23. Mariners: Mariners again.\n24. Mariners: Same.\n25. Athletics: Back to Athletics.\n26. Athletics: Continue.\n27. Royals: Now, here's \"royals\" in the opponent column. So, row 27 is about the Blue Jays playing against Royals.\n28. Royals: Same opponent.\n29. Postponed game: This one is about a rain delay and rescheduled.\n30. Rangers: Opponent is Rangers.\n\nSo, only rows 27, 28 have \"royals\" as the opponent, meaning the Blue Jays played the Royals on April 27 and April 28. The claim mentions \"4 time,\" which would imply four games. However, from the table, I can see that there are only two games against Royals. Therefore, it looks like the claim is FALSE because the Blue Jays only play the Royals twice in the given data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Perhaps \"play royal 4 time\" refers to a different context, not necessarily four games. But considering the table only shows two games against Royals, the information available doesn't support four times. So, without additional evidence, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The game is supposed to take place on April 29th.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record.

Because the table doesn't list a game for that date. The only relevant info is that the game was canceled due to rain and rescheduled for July.\n\nAlso, I should check if any of the opponents are the Toronto Blue Jays in the vicinity of April 29.

No, opponents are Mariners.\n- April 5: Mariners again.\n- Then it moves on to Angels starting April 6.\n- April 6: Angeles against Orioles?\nWait, no, the opponent column shows \"angels\" and so on.\n\nWait, in the data, for each row, the first element is the date, then the opponent.

Let me list all the rows and their dates correctly.\n\nWait the table has 19 entries from April4 to April30, but some have same dates or are postponed.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row0: April4\n- Row1: April5\n- Row2: April6\n- Row3: April7\n- Row4: April8\n- Row5: April9\n- Row6: April10\n- Row7: April11? Wait, no. The row7 is April29, with postponed info.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list each row's date correctly:\n\nRow0: April4\nRow1: April5\nRow2: April6\nRow3: April7\nRow4: April8\nRow5: April9\nRow6: April10\nRow7: April11? No, wait no\u2014looking again, the table has rows beyond that.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the given table:\n\nIt's a list of 19 entries. Let me number them properly from row0 to row18.\n\n- row0: date=April4, opponent=Mariners\n- row1: April5, Mariners\n- row2: April6, Angeles (Angels)\n- row3: April7, Angels\n- row4: April8, Angels\n- row5: April9, Athletics\n- row6: April10, Athletics\n- row7: April11? Wait no.\n\nWait the table's dates go up to April30 but with some entries in between. Let me list all 19 rows properly:\n\nRow0: April4, Mariners\n\nRow1: April5, Mariners\n\nRow2: April6, Angeles (Angels)\n\nRow3: April7, Angels\n\nRow4: April8, Angels\n\nRow5: April9, Athletics\n\nRow6: April10, Athletics\n\nRow7: April11? Wait no.\n\nWait actually, looking at the table again:\n\nThe entries are as follows (from date April4 to April30):\n\n1. April4: Mariners\n2. April5: Mariners\n3. April6: Angels\n4. April7: Angels\n5. April8: Angels\n6. April9: Athletics\n7. April10: Athletics\n8. April11: ??? Wait no.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused because the table includes a game on April29 which is postponed.\n\nLooking at the exact rows:\n\nRow17 (assuming 0-based) would be April29? Let me count up to that point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all 19 rows with their dates:\n\n- Row0: April4\n- Row1: April5\n- Row2: April6\n- Row3: April7\n- Row4: April8\n- Row5: April9\n- Row6: April10\n- Row7: April11 (Is there an April11 entry? The original table shows the last non-postponed game is April28, then April29 and April30 are postponed.)\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the given data, the rows go up to April30. So between April4 to April30, each row is a date except when games are canceled.\n\nSo, for each date from April4 to April30, there's an entry, but some (like April29 and April30) have all cells as \"postponed\".\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Row0: April4\n- Row1: April5\n- Row2: April6\n- Row3: April7\n- Row4: April8\n- Row5: April9\n- Row6: April10\n- Row7: April11 (but in the table, perhaps it's not there; maybe only up to April30)\nWait no, the table includes entries for each date from April4 onwards, up to April30, but some are postponed.\n\nSo, specifically:\n\n- For April29, row17: all cells say \"postponed\".\n\nNow, looking at the claim: Toronto Blue Jays play Angel on April29. So we need to find a game where:\n\n1. Date is April29\n2. Opponent is either \"Blue Jays\" or \"Angels\"\n\nLooking through the table, for April29 (row17), the opponent column says \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for july23\". So the opponent is not mentioned as Blue Jays.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check if any row has the opponent as Toronto Blue Jays. Let me scan each row's opponent:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- Opponent: Mariners, Angels, Athletics\n\nNo mention of Blue Jays. Therefore, in the given table, there are no games on April29 where Toronto Blue Jays play Angeles.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Toronto Blue Jays played the Los Angeles Angeles on April 29 is incorrect based on the provided data. There are no entries indicating such a game, and the only entry for April 29 mentions a postponed game due to rain.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; there was no game played by the Toronto Blue Jays against the Los Angeles Angeles on April 29.",
