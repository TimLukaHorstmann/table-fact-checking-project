    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"at mcg , the away team , footscray , score 10.11 (71)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the columns in the table. The claim mentions several things: the venue (\"mcg\"), the away team (\"footscray\"), and their score (\"10.11 (71)\"). \n\nLooking at the table's columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". So, I need to check each of these parts against the corresponding cells.\n\nStarting with the venue: The claim says \"at mcg\". In the data, one row has the venue as \"mcg\". Let me find which row that is. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. Hawthorn vs South Melbourne at Glenferrie Oval\n2. Essendon vs Richmond at Windy Hill\n3. Carlton vs Collingwood at Princes Park\n4. St Kilda vs North Melbourne at Junction Oval\n5. Melbourne vs Footscray at McG (that's the one)\n6. Geelong vs Fitzroy at Corio Oval\n\nSo, row 5 has the venue as \"mcg\". So that part matches.\n\nNext, the away team: The claim says \"footscray\" is the away team. Looking for rows where the away team is Footscray. In the data:\n\nLooking at each row's away team:\n- Row 0: South Melbourne\n- Row 1: Richmond\n- Row 2: Collingwood\n- Row 3: North Melbourne\n- Row 4: Footscray (this one)\n- Row 5: Fitzroy\n\nSo, yes, in row 4, the away team is Footscray. That matches.\n\nThen, their score: The claim says \"10.11 (71)\". Let me check the score for Footscray in that row. In row 4, the data shows:\n- home team: Melbourne\n- home team score: 13.9 (87)\n- away team: Footscray\n- away team score: 10.11 (71)\n\nYes, that's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are correctly supported by the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is about the crowd size for the Footscray vs Melbourne game being 20244.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows include information about various games.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"Footscray v Melbourne\" and the crowd size of 20244. So I need to find a row in the table where both the home team is Footscray and the away team is Melbourne, or vice versa. Then check if the crowd column matches 20244.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Hawthorn, away is South Melbourne. Crowd is 11000.\n2. Row 1: Essendon vs Richmond. Crowd 15000.\n3. Row 2: Carlton vs Collingwood. Crowd 35000.\n4. Row 3: St Kilda vs North Melbourne. Crowd 10000.\n5. Row 4: Melbourne vs Footscray. Home team is Melbourne, away is Footscray. Crowd is 20244.\n6. Row 5: Geelong vs Fitzroy. Crowd 9000.\n\nWait, the claim is about Footscray vs Melbourne. So in row 4, it's Melbourne (home) against Footscray (away). The crowd size here is indeed 20244, which matches the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones from row 4: \"crowd\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"at mcg , the home team score 10.11 (71)\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a venue called \"mcg\", and that the home team scored \"10.11 (71)\". So I need to check if there's a row in the table where the venue is \"mcg\" and the home team's score matches that.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: home team, home team score, away team, etc. The data rows each have values for these columns.\n\nI should go through each row to find where the venue is \"mcg\". Let me look at the 'venue' column:\n\n1st row: glenferrie oval\n2nd row: windy hill\n3rd row: princes park\n4th row: junction oval\n5th row: mcg\n6th row: corio oval\n\nSo only the 5th row has \"mcg\" as the venue. Now, I need to check if this row's home team score is \"10.11 (71)\".\n\nLooking at the home team scores:\n\n1st row: 11.10 (76)\n2nd row: 10.12 (72)\n3rd row: 16.11 (107)\n4th row:13.19 (97)\n5th row:13.9 (87)\n6th row:20.22 (142)\n\nThe home team scores are listed in the \"home team score\" column. The 5th row's home team score is \"13.9 (87)\", which doesn't match \"10.11 (71)\". \n\nWait, but the claim says \"the home team score 10.11 (71)\" at mcg. So according to the table, the home team at mcg scored 13.9 (87), not 10.11 (71). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there's another row where venue is mcg and home team score matches. Since only the 5th row has mcg as the venue, and its score doesn't match, it seems the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the home team at mcg did not score 10.11 (71).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"On May 30, 1931, Hawthorn and Richmond play at Princess Park with attendance of 9000.\" \n\nFirst, let's look at each part of the claim against the table data.\n\nStarting with the date. The claim mentions May 30, 1931. Looking at the 'date' column in the table, all rows have \"30 may 1931\". So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the teams involved. The claim lists Hawthorn and Richmond as playing each other. In the table's first row (row_index 0), the home team is Hawthorn, and the away team is South Melbourne. Then in the third row (row_index 2), the home team is Carlton, and the away is Collingwood. Wait, but in the last two rows (rows 4 and 5), it's Melbourne vs Footscray and Geelong vs Fitzroy. So I don't see Hawthorn or Richmond playing each other in any row. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 0: Hawthorn (home) vs South Melbourne (away)\nRow 1: Essendon vs Richmond\nRow 2: Carlton vs Collingwood\nRow 3: St Kilda vs North Melbourne\nRow 4: Melbourne vs Footscray\nRow 5: Geelong vs Fitzroy\n\nAh, in row 1, the away team is Richmond. So Hawthorn isn't playing Richmond on that date. So the claim says Hawthorn and Richmond play each other, but according to the table, they aren't facing each other on May 30, 1931.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading it. The first row has Hawthorn as home against South Melbourne. Then row 1: Essendon is home vs Richmond away. So perhaps in that game, Richmond is playing Essendon, not Hawthorn. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Hawthorn isn't playing Richmond on that date.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Hawthorn and Richmond play\", so maybe it's a mistake. Because according to the table, Hawthorn plays South Melbourne, Essendon plays Richmond, Carlton plays Collingwood, etc. So no game between Hawthorn and Richmond in this dataset.\n\nAlso, regarding the venue. The claim mentions Princess Park as the venue. Looking at the 'venue' column:\n\nRow 0: Glenferrie Oval\nRow 1: Windy Hill\nRow 2: Princes Park\nRow 3: Junction Oval\nRow 4: MCG\nRow 5: Corio Oval\n\nIn row 2, the venue is Princes Park. So if the claim says they play at Princess Park, then it should be row 2. However, in row 2, the teams are Carlton vs Collingwood. The claim mentions Hawthorn and Richmond playing there, but according to the table, it's Carlton and Collingwood. Therefore, the venue doesn't match either because Princess Park is where a different game took place.\n\nAdditionally, the attendance for May 30, 1931 games varies:\n\nRow 0: 11000\nRow 1: 15000\nRow 2: 35000\nRow 3: 10000\nRow 4: 20244\nRow 5: 9000\n\nThe claim says attendance is 9000. Looking through the 'crowd' column, only row 5 has 9000. But row 5's teams are Geelong and Fitzroy, not Hawthorn and Richmond.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Date matches.\n- Venue doesn't match (Princes Park is correct but different teams played there).\n- Teams don't match (Hawthorn isn't playing Richmond; Essendon is playing Richmond in another row).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the teams involved aren't Hawthorn and Richmond, the venue isn't Princess Park for that game, and the attendance figure doesn't correspond to that particular match.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has some data with different columns and rows. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the crowd size be 20244 for the game at fitzroy.\" So, I need to find out if in the table there's a row where the home team is \"fitzroy\" or the away team is \"fitzroy,\" and then check if the crowd column has the value 20244.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows have these filled in for each game.\n\nI should probably go through each row to see which ones might relate to \"fitzroy.\" Let me look at each row's 'away team' because the claim mentions \"game at fitzroy,\" so maybe fitzroy is either the home or away team. Alternatively, the venue could be at fitzroy.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is hawthorn, away is south melbourne. Venue is glenferrie oval.\n2. Row 1: Home team is essendon, away is richmond. Venue is windy hill.\n3. Row 2: Home team is carlton, away is collingwood. Venue is princes park.\n4. Row 3: Home team is st kilda, away is north melbourne. Venue is junction oval.\n5. Row 4: Home team is melbourne, away is footscray. Venue is mcg.\n6. Row 5: Home team is geelong, away is fitzroy. Venue is corio oval.\n\nAh, in row 5, the away team is fitzroy. So that's relevant because the claim mentions \"fitzroy.\" Now, check the crowd column for this row. Looking at row 5's 'crowd' value: it's 9000, not 20244. So the crowd size doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. The claim is about the crowd being 20244 for the game at fitzroy. So, does any row have fitzroy as either home or away and a crowd of 20244?\n\nLooking through all the rows again:\n\nRow 0: crowd 11000\nRow 1: 15000\nRow 2: 35000\nRow 3: 10000\nRow 4: 20244\nRow 5: 9000\n\nSo in row 4, home team is melbourne vs footscray. The venue is mcg, and the crowd is 20244. So that's where the 20244 comes from, but the away team is footscray, not fitzroy.\n\nIn row 5, fitzroy is away but the crowd is only 9000. So there's no row where the away or home team is fitzroy and the crowd is 20244.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if any game was played at a venue called \"fitzroy.\" But looking at the 'venue' column:\n\nRow 0: glenferrie oval\nRow 1: windy hill\nRow 2: princes park\nRow 3: junction oval\nRow 4: mcg\nRow 5: corio oval\n\nNone of these venues are fitzroy. So the claim is about a game at fitzroy, but in the table, there's no such venue.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because either:\n\n- There's no row where the away team is fitzroy with crowd 20244.\n- No row has a venue named fitzroy with that crowd size.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the crowd size of 20244 occurs in a different game (row 4) against footscray at mcg, not fitzroy. And fitzroy is only playing in row 5 with a smaller crowd.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd size was 20244 for a game at fitzroy. Checking each relevant column:\n\n1. **Away Team**: Looking for rows where the away team is \"fitzroy.\"\n2. **Venue**: Check if any venue is \"fitzroy.\"\n\nOnly row 5 mentions fitzroy as the away team, but its crowd is 9000, not 20244.\n\nAdditionally, none of the venues listed are \"fitzroy,\" so no game matches both criteria in the claim.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
