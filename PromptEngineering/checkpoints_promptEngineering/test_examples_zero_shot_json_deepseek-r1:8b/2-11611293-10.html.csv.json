    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"lj burger be a player on 19 - 2 - 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions \"lj burger\" as the player and specifies the date as \"19 - 2 - 2003\". So I need to find if there's a row in the table where the player is \"lj burger\" and the date matches \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: catches, player, versus, venue, date. The data rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0:\n4, \"m kaif\", \"sri lanka\", \"johannesburg\", \"10 - 03 - 2003\"\n\nRow 1:\n3, \"v sehwag\", \"netherlands\", \"paarl\", \"12 - 02 - 2003\"\n\nRow 2:\n3, \"lj burger\", \"england\", \"port elizabeth\", \"19 - 02 - 2003\"\n\nWait, that's the third row (index 2) where the player is \"lj burger\" and the date is \"19 - 02 - 2003\". So it matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells are at row index 2 for the 'player' column.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains a row where the player is \"lj burger\" on \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"m kaif have 4 catch vs sri lanka\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"m kaif,\" which appears to be a player's name. Then it says \"have 4 catch,\" meaning they have made 4 catches in total. Lastly, it specifies that these catches are \"vs sri lanka,\" implying that all four catches were against Sri Lanka.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents an event with information about a player's performance. The columns relevant to this claim are \"catches,\" \"player,\" \"versus,\" and \"date.\" \n\nI need to check if there's any row where the player is \"m kaif,\" catches equal 4, and versus is Sri Lanka. Since I don't see any row with \"m kaif\" as the player, it seems like this information isn't present in the table. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, because there's no relevant data in the table that matches the claim, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check for a row where the player is \"m kaif,\" catches are 4, and versus is Sri Lanka. Since such a row doesn't exist in the provided table, the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"jp maher have a date of 19 - 02 - 2003.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that J.P. Maher's entry in the table has a specific date. So I need to look into the table and find the row where the player is \"jp maher.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are catches, player, versus, venue, and date. Each row represents a different match or event with details filled in those columns.\n\nNow, scanning through each row's player name:\n\n1. First row: m kaif\n2. Second row: v sehwag\n3. Third row: lj burger\n4. Fourth row: jp maher \u2013 this is the one we're interested in.\n5. Fifth row: hh dippenaar\n6. Sixth row: d mongia\n7. Seventh row: v sehwag again\n8. Eighth row: af giles\n\nSo, jp maher is in the fourth row (row_index 3). Now, I need to check what their date is. The claim says it's \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\nLooking at the date column for this row: It's \"20 - 02 - 2003.\" Hmm, that's different from what the claim states. So the date in the table doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait a second\u2014did I read that correctly? Let me double-check. The fourth row has \"jp maher\" and the date is \"20 - 02 - 2003.\" Yes, that's correct. So the date isn't the same as what the claim says.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the row index. Let me count again. The rows are:\n\n0: m kaif\n1: v sehwag\n2: lj burger\n3: jp maher \u2013 this is row 3.\n4: hh dippenaar\n5: d mongia\n6: v sehwag\n7: af giles\n\nSo, jp maher is indeed in row 3. The date there is \"20 - 02 - 2003.\" So the claim's date of \"19 - 02 - 2003\" doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the date associated with jp maher in the table doesn't match what's stated.\n\nAlso, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The player column is definitely relevant since we're looking for jp maher, and the date column is relevant to check the actual date. So the relevant_cells should include both these columns for the specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"jp maher\" has a date of \"19 - 02 - 2003.\" However, upon examining the table, \"jp maher\" is found in row 3 with a date of \"20 - 02 - 2003,\" which does not match the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
