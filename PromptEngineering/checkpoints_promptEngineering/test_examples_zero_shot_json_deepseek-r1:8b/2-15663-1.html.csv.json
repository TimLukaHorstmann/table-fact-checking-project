Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"43243 live birth have a migration of -14873\". Hmm, this seems to be about two specific numbers from the data\u2014live births and migration. The claim is stating that 43243 live births correspond with a migration value of -14873.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns like \"average population (x 1000)\", \"live births\", \"deaths\", etc., and each row has corresponding data. So, for each row, these columns have numbers. My task is to find if any cell in the table matches both 43243 as live births and -14873 as migration.\n\nI'll start by checking the \"live births\" column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 49,291\n- Row 1: 47,464\n- Row 2: 45,559\n- Row 3: 44,843\n- Row 4: 46,370\n- Row 5: 43,243\n- Row 6: 43,385\n- Row 7: 42,782\n- Row 8: 40,508\n- Row 9: 39,673\n- Row 10: 39,348\n\nI don't see any row where \"live births\" is exactly 43,243. The closest I get is 43,243 in row 5, but the migration there is -14,873. Wait, no, let me check the numbers again.\n\nLooking at row 5, the data is: \n- \"average population (x 1000)\": 2 657 760\n- \"live births\": 43 243\n- \"deaths\": 18 960\n- ... and so on.\nThe migration here is listed as -14,873. So yes, in row 5, live births are 43,243 and migration is -14,873.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"43243 live birth have a migration of -14873\". There's an inconsistency in formatting: the migration is written with a space before the number (e.g., \"- 26 342\") versus without. In the table, some cells have spaces, like \"2 610 529\" which I assume is 2610529.\n\nSo, does that affect anything? Let me check row 5 again:\n\nIn row 5, migration is \"- 14 873\", which would be -14873 if we remove the space. Similarly, live births are 43 243, which is 43243. So yes, this row matches both numbers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because in row 5 (index 5), \"live births\" is 43243 and migration is -14873.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"live births\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"migration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
