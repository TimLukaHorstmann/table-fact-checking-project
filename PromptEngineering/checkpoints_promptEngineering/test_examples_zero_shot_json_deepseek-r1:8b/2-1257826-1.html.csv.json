    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 3 be january 20 2001.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's looking for a game (from the table) where the goal was 3 and happened on January 20, 2001. So I need to check each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. The relevant columns here are \"goal\" and \"date.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Goal is 1, Date is January 17, 2001. Doesn't match because goal isn't 3 and the date is different.\n\nRow 1: Goal is 2, Date is January 20, 2001. Again, doesn't match because goal is 2, not 3.\n\nRow 2: Same date as row 1 but goal is 3. Wait, row 2's goal is 3 and date is January 20, 2001. So this seems to fit the claim.\n\nRow 3: Goal is 4, Date is March 15, 2001. Doesn't match because goal isn't 3.\n\nRow 4: Goal is 5, which is a different competition, Copa Am\u00e9rica. Doesn't apply here.\n\nRow 5: Goal is 6, date in November 2004. Not relevant.\n\nWait, so row 2 has the goal of 3 and the date as January 20, 2001. That matches exactly what the claim is saying. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns involved are \"goal\" and \"date.\" For row 2, both columns matter because they directly address the conditions in the claim. So the relevant_cells would be for row 2, columns goal and date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a matching entry in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the provided instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 4 be march 15 , 2001.\" So, the claim is stating that there was a game where the score was 4 goals (for either team) and the date of this game was March 15, 2001.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. The data rows contain information about different games. Each row represents a unique game with specific details.\n\nI need to find a row in the table where the 'goal' is 4 because that's what the claim is referring to. Then, I'll check if the 'date' for that particular game matches March 15, 2001.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- goal: 1\n- date: January 17, 2001\n- score: 2 - 0\n\nSo, this isn't the game we're looking for because the goal is only 1 and the date doesn't match March 15.\n\nRow 1:\n- goal: 2\n- date: January 20, 2001\n- score: 1 - 0 vs. 2 - 0\n\nAgain, the goal here is 2, which isn't our target of 4. Date also doesn't match.\n\nRow 2:\n- goal: 3\n- date: January 20, 2001\n- score: 2 - 0\n\nStill, the goal is 3 and the date is January 20, so not relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- goal: 4\n- date: March 15, 2001\n- score: 3 - 1 vs. 3 - 1\n\nHere, the 'goal' is 4, which matches our criteria. The date is March 15, 2001, as mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 4:\n- goal: 5\n- date: July 14, 2004\n- score: 0 - 1 vs. 1 - 1\n\nGoal and date don't match.\n\nRow 5:\n- goal: 6\n- date: November 17, 2004\n- score: 2 - 1 vs. 2 - 1\n\nAgain, not relevant.\n\nSo, the only row that meets both conditions (goal=4 and date=March 15, 2001) is Row 3. Therefore, the claim is true because there's a game with goal 4 on March 15, 2001.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the date of the game with 5 goal be 15 march 2001.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Goal number**: 5\n2. **Date**: 15 March 2001\n\nSo, I need to find in the table which row corresponds to a game with a goal number of 5 and check if its date is 15 March 2001.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has the following columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. So, for each row, I can check the \"goal\" column to see if it's 5.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Goal is 1 \u2192 Not 5\n- **Row 1**: Goal is 2 \u2192 Not 5\n- **Row 2**: Goal is 3 \u2192 Not 5\n- **Row 3**: Goal is 4 \u2192 Not 5\n- **Row 4**: Goal is 5 \u2192 This is the row we need to check.\n- **Row 5**: Goal is 6 \u2192 Not 5\n\nSo, only Row 4 has a goal of 5. Now, I'll look at its date. The date in Row 4 is \"14 july 2004.\" That's not 15 March 2001.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the game with goal number 5 occurred on 14 July 2004, not 15 March 2001.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Since only Row 4 (index 4) has the goal of 5, and we're checking the date in that row, the relevant columns would be \"date.\" So, the relevant_cells should include the details for Row 4, specifically the date column.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is FALSE because the date doesn't match. The relevant cells are the row index 4 and the \"date\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game with a goal of 5 occurred on 15 March 2001. By checking the table, we find that the game with goal 5 took place on 14 July 2004, not 15 March 2001. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
