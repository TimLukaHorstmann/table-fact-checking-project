    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the match against lucian bute be 1 of the 5 fight that librado andrade lose.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that in one of Librado Andrade's losses, he fought Lucian Bute, and this was one of five such fights where he lost.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various boxing matches with different opponents, results (win or loss), types of matches, rounds, times, and dates. So I need to find any instance where Librado Andrade faced Lucian Bute and resulted in a loss.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the opponent \"Lucian Bute.\" Let's go through the data:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Rowland Bryant, result is loss.\nRow 1: Opponent Matt O'Brien, result win.\nRow 2: Opponent Aaron Pryor Jr., loss. Not Lucian.\nRow 3: Eric Lucas, win.\nRow 4: Lucian Bute, result loss. That's one match where Andrade lost to Bute.\n\nSo that's the first relevant cell at row index 4.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is one of five such losses. So I'll look for other rows where Librado Andrade lost.\n\nLooking further:\nRow 5: Opponent Vitali Tsypko, win.\nRow 6: Lucian Bute again, result loss. That's the second loss.\nSo row index 6 is another relevant cell.\n\nContinuing to find all Andrade losses:\nRow 7: Win against Robert Stieglitz.\nRow 8: Win against Yusaf Mack.\nRow 9: Win against Ted Muller.\nRow 10: Loss against Mikkel Kessler. That's third loss.\nRow 11: Win against Richard Grant.\nRow 12: Win against Otis Grant.\nRow 13: Win against Ruben Perez.\nRow 14: Win against Jimmy Hagar.\nRow 15: Win against Harold Lowe.\nRow 16: Win against Eric Benito Tzand.\nRow 17: Win against Sheridan Page.\nRow 18: Win against Marcus Harvey.\nRow 19: Loss against Bernard Temple. Fourth loss.\nRow 20: Win against Terry Smith.\nRow 21: Win against Paul Jones.\nRow 22: Win against George Johnson.\nRow 23: Win against Marcus Harvey again.\n\nSo the losses by Andrade are at row indices 4, 6, and 10, 19. Wait, row index 19 is another loss? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking back, rows beyond 4: \n\nWait, in the table provided, I think it's easier to list all matches where the result is a loss for Librado Andrade.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row 0: loss vs Rowland Bryant\n- Row 2: loss vs Aaron Pryor Jr.\n- Row 4: loss vs Lucian Bute\n- Row 6: loss vs Lucian Bute again\n- Row 10: loss vs Mikkel Kessler\n- Row 19: loss vs Bernard Temple\n\nWait, that's five losses. So Librado Andrade has lost five fights.\n\nBut the claim says \"the match against lucian bute be 1 of the 5 fight that librado andrade lose.\" So in two of those losses, he fought Lucian Bute (rows 4 and 6), which are the first and second relevant cells. The other three are against different opponents.\n\nSo the claim is saying that one of the five fights Andrade lost was against Lucian Bute. That's correct because there are two such matches.\n\nBut does the claim say \"the match\" singular, implying just one? Or does it mean \"one of the five\"? If it's the latter, then yes, it's TRUE because at least one is correct. However, if it's interpreted as saying that Andrade lost only one fight against Bute and that's one of five total losses, which is also true.\n\nBut wait, the exact wording is: \"the match against lucian bute be 1 of the 5 fight that librado andrade lose.\" It seems to say that among the five fights he lost, one was against Lucian Bute. So since there are two such matches (rows 4 and 6), the claim is still true because both are included in his five losses.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows where opponent is Lucian Bute and result is loss, which are rows 4 and 6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that among Librado Andrade's five losses, one was against Lucian Bute. The table shows two such matches (rows 4 and 6). Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"librado andrade win the fight against otis grant but lose the fight against mikkel kessler.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's making two statements:\n\n1. Librado Andrade beat Otis Grant.\n2. Librado Andrade lost to Mikel Kessler.\n\nI need to check the table to see if both these statements are supported.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like result, opponent, type, rd, time, and date. Each row represents a fight outcome for a specific fighter.\n\nI'll start by looking for fights involving Librado Andrade. I need to scan each row's \"opponent\" column to find where \"librado andrade\" is listed as the winner or loser.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- The first row: Opponent is \"rowland bryant,\" result is \"loss.\" So that's a loss, not relevant.\n- Second row: Opponent \"matt o'brien,\" result \"win.\" Not Andrade.\n- Third row: Opponent \"aaron pryor jr,\" result \"loss.\" Not relevant.\n- Fourth row: Opponent \"eric lucas,\" result \"win.\" Still not Andrade.\n- Fifth row: Opponent \"lucian bute,\" result \"loss.\" Not the one.\n- Sixth row: Opponent \"vitali tsypko,\" result \"win.\" Nope.\n- Seventh row: Opponent \"lucian bute\" again, result \"loss.\" Still not.\n- Eighth row: Opponent \"robert stieglitz,\" result \"win.\" Moving on.\n- Ninth row: Opponent \"yusaf mack,\" result \"win.\" Not relevant.\n- Tenth row: Opponent \"ted muller,\" result \"win.\" No.\n- Eleventh row: Opponent \"mikkel kessler,\" result \"loss.\" This is a loss, so that's part 2 of the claim. I'll note this down as relevant because it shows Andrade lost to Kessler.\n\nContinuing:\n- Twelfth row: Opponent \"ruben perez,\" result \"win.\" Not needed.\n- Thirteenth row: Opponent \"jimmy hagar,\" result \"win.\"\n- Fourteenth row: Opponent \"harold lowe,\" result \"win.\"\n- Fifteenth row: Opponent \"eric benito tzand,\" result \"win.\"\n- Sixteenth row: Opponent \"sheridan page,\" result \"win.\"\n- Seventeenth row: Opponent \"marcus harvey,\" result \"win.\" Note that Andrade has a win here.\n- Eighteenth row: Opponent \"bernard temple,\" result \"win.\"\n- Nineteenth row: Opponent \"terry smith,\" result \"win.\"\n- Twentieth row: Opponent \"paul jones,\" result \"win.\"\n- Twenty-first row: Opponent \"george johnson,\" result \"win.\"\n- Twenty-second row: Opponent \"marcus harvey\" again, result \"win.\" So Andrade has multiple wins here.\n- Last row: Opponent is \"librado andrade\"? Wait, no, the opponent is \"marcus harvey\" and the result is \"win.\" But this seems like a different row.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check each row to see if any have \"librado andrade\" as the opponent.\n\nLooking back, in the first few rows, none of them have Andrade as the opponent. Then, when looking for Andrade as the fighter, maybe he's not present at all? Or is he in the opponent column?\n\nWait, actually, I think I may have misread. The claim mentions Librado Andrade winning against Otis Grant and losing to Mikel Kessler. So I need to find a row where the result is \"win\" with opponent Otis Grant, and another row where the result is \"loss\" with opponent Mikkel Kessler.\n\nLet me scan each row again for these specific opponents:\n\nLooking for any row where opponent is Otis Grant:\n\n- Second row: Opponent is Matt O'Brien.\n- Fourth row: Opponent is Eric Lucas.\n- Sixth row: Opponent Vitali Tsypko.\n- Seventh row: Lucian Bute.\n- Eighth: Robert Stieglitz.\n- Ninth: Yusaf Mack.\n- Tenth: Ted Muller.\n- Eleventh: Mikkel Kessler (opponent, result loss).\n- Twelfth: Ruben Perez.\n- Thirteenth: Jimmy Hagar.\n- Fourteenth: Harold Lowe.\n- Fifteenth: Eric Benito Tzand.\n- Sixteenth: Sheridan Page.\n- Seventeenth: Marcus Harvey (win).\n- Eighteenth: Bernard Temple.\n- Nineteenth: Terry Smith.\n- Twentieth: Paul Jones.\n- Twenty-first: George Johnson.\n- Twenty-second: Marcus Harvey again, result win.\n- Last row: Opponent is \"marcus harvey,\" result win.\n\nWait, I don't see any row where the opponent is Otis Grant. The claim says Librado Andrade beat Otis Grant, so there should be a row where the opponent is Otis Grant and the result is win for Andrade.\n\nBut in the table provided, I'm not finding such a row. All the opponents listed are different from Otis Grant and Mikkel Kessler except for the eleventh row where the opponent is Mikkel Kessler, and Librado Andrade lost that fight.\n\nSo, according to the table:\n\n- There's no evidence that Librado Andrade beat Otis Grant because Otis Grant isn't listed as an opponent in any of Andrade's wins.\n- Andrade did lose to Mikkel Kessler, which is mentioned in row 11.\n\nTherefore, since the first part of the claim (Andrade beating Grant) isn't supported by the table, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each row for Librado Andrade's fights against Otis Grant and Mikkel Kessler. The table shows that Andrade lost to Kessler but doesn't show a victory over Grant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"librado andrade never win the fight against paul jones\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who is involved in the claim. The claim mentions two boxers: Librado Andrade and Paul Jones. The claim states that Andrade never wins a fight against Jones. So, I need to check if there are any records where Andrade beats Jones.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with \"columns\" and \"data\". The columns include \"result\", \"opponent\", \"type\", \"rd , time\", and \"date\". Each row represents a fight result for a particular boxer against another.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's any instance where the opponent is Paul Jones and the result is a win for Librado Andrade. \n\nStarting from row 0, the opponent is Rowland Bryant, so not relevant. Row 1: opponent is Matt O'Brien; nope. Row 2: Aaron Pryor Jr., still not matching. Moving on to row 3: Eric Lucas? No. Row 4: Lucian Bute? Not Paul Jones.\n\nContinuing down the list, I see opponents like Vitali Tsypko, Lucian Bute (twice), Robert Stieglitz, Yusaf Mack, Ted Muller, Richard Grant, Otis Grant, Nicolas Cervera, Thomas Reid, Vitali Kopitko, Tito Mendoza, Willie Stewart, Leonard Townsend, Eduardo Ayala, Errol Banner, Juan Carlos Barreto, Shannon Miller, Pat Lawlor, Ruben Perez, Jimmy Hagar, Harold Lowe, Eric Benito tzand (not sure if the name is a typo), Sheridan Page, Marcus Harvey (twice), Bernard Temple, Terry Smith, Paul Jones. Oh, here we go\u2014row 18: opponent is Paul Jones.\n\nLooking at row 18, the result is \"win\" for George Johnson against Paul Jones on December 2, 1999. So, does this mean that Librado Andrade never won against Paul Jones? Wait, but I need to check if there's any fight where Andrade fought Jones and won.\n\nSo far, in all the rows up to row 19, I haven't seen Librado Andrade fighting against Paul Jones with a win. Maybe he didn't have such fights recorded here, or perhaps he never did. Alternatively, maybe Andrade did fight Jones but it's not listed here.\n\nWait, let me check if there are any other instances where the opponent is Paul Jones. Row 18: George Johnson vs. Paul Jones\u2014Johnson won. Row 19: Marcus Harvey fighting against whom? It says opponent is Paul Jones again. Wait, row 19: opponent is Paul Jones for Marcus Harvey. Result is \"win\" for Marcus Harvey on August 14, 1999.\n\nSo both rows 18 and 19 have Paul Jones as the opponent, but neither of them are Andrade winning against him. The claim specifically mentions Andrade, not Harvey or Johnson. Therefore, in the table provided, there's no instance where Librado Andrade wins against Paul Jones.\n\nIf there were such a fight, it would be listed in one of these rows with \"result\" as a win for Andrade and opponent as Paul Jones. Since I don't see any such entries, the claim that Andrade never won against Jones seems to hold true based on this data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, because there's no evidence in the table where Andrade beat Jones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the most recent fight that librado andrade won be on 2011 - 08 - 27.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n- It's about Librando Andrade.\n- He won a fight.\n- The date is August 27, 2011.\n\nI need to look through the table to see if there's an entry where \"result\" is \"win\", \"opponent\" is Librando Andrade, and the \"date\" matches 2011 - 08 - 27.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like result, opponent, type, etc. The columns are: result, opponent, type, rd/time, date.\n\nSo I'll go through each row to find Librando Andrade's wins on that specific date.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n1. First row: result \"loss\", so not relevant.\n2. Second row: result is \"win\". Opponent is Matt O'Brien. Date is 2011 - 08 - 27. Wait, but the claim says Librando Andrade won a fight on that date. But in this row, it's Matt O'Brien who has the win. So no match here.\n3. Third row: result \"loss\", so not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: result is \"win\". Opponent is Eric Lucas, date 2010 -05-28. Not our target date.\n5. Fifth row: loss again.\n6. Sixth row: win against Lucian Bute on 2009-04-04.\n7. Seventh row: loss to Lucian Bute on 2008-10-24.\n8. Eighth row: win against Robert Stieglitz on 2008-03-22.\n9. Ninth row: win against Yusaf Mack on 2007-07-26 (assuming, but date in the table is 2007? Wait, looking back at the data, I think the dates might be in yyyy-mm-dd format or not? Actually, in the table, it's written as \"2011 - 08 - 27\", so each row's date follows that format. So for example, the second row has date \"2011 - 08 - 27\". Wait, but the opponent is Matt O'Brien, and result is win.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at each row, starting from row 0 to row 38 (since there are 39 fights listed).\n\nI need to find a fight where:\n- Result is \"win\"\n- Opponent is Librando Andrade\n- Date is \"2011 - 08 - 27\"\n\nWait, no. The claim says the most recent fight that Librando Andrade won was on 2011-08-27.\n\nSo perhaps I should first find all fights where opponent is Librando Andrade and result is win, then see if any of them have the date as 2011-08-27.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: result loss, opponent N/A.\nRow 1: result win, opponent Matt O'Brien. So this can't be it because the opponent isn't Andrade.\n\nContinuing:\n\nLooking for rows where opponent is Librando Andrade and result is win.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I don't see any row where opponent is Librando Andrade. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has a typo or mislabeling? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding who Librando Andrade is. Wait, maybe \"Librando Andrade\" refers to someone else, not necessarily listed as an opponent in the table.\n\nWait, no, because if the claim is about him, then his opponents should be in the table. So perhaps none of the rows have \"Librando Andrade\" as the opponent with a win on 2011-08-27.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting or missing something.\n\nLet me list all the fights where result is \"win\":\n\nRow 1: opponent Matt O'Brien, date 2011-08-27\nRow 2: opponent Eric Lucas, date 2010-05-28\nRow 4: opponent Lucian Bute, date 2009-04-04\nRow 8: Robert Stieglitz, 2008-03-22\nRow 9: Yusaf Mack, ?\nWait, looking back, the table's exact entries:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 38.\n\nLooking for opponent = \"Librando Andrade\" and result = \"win\":\n\nI don't see any row where opponent is Librando Andrade. So perhaps he didn't fight that specific date in the table, or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about a different fighter named Andrade, not Librando. Or perhaps it's a fictional name.\n\nWait, the table lists many fighters with surnames like Alvarado, Benito, Harvey, etc., but \"Andrade\" isn't listed as an opponent in any row.\n\nTherefore, if there are no fights by Librando Andrade on 2011-08-27, then the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table might have a fighter named Librando Andrade, and perhaps his most recent win was on that date.\n\nWait, looking at each row again:\n\nRow 0: opponent N/A\nRow 1: Matt O'Brien, result win, date 2011-08-27\n\nSo in this row, someone else (Matt O'Brien) won against the opponent (probably a fighter named Eric Alvarado or similar), but not Librando Andrade.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where Librando Andrade is the winner on that specific date.

It mentions three names: Librado Andrade, Terry Smith, and Marcus Harvey. The claim suggests that there's a sequence of fights: first between Librado Andrade and Marcus Harvey, and then after that, a fight between Librado Andrade and Terry Smith.\n\nSo, I should look for any entries in the table where these three fighters are involved. Let me start by looking through each row to see who was fighting against whom.\n\nLooking at the \"opponent\" column first:\n\n- The first row has \"rowland bryant\" as the opponent.\n- The second row is \"matt o'brien\".\n- Third is \"aaron pryor jr.\"\n- Fourth: \"eric lucas.\"\n- Fifth: \"lucian bute.\"\n- Sixth: \"vitali tsypko.\"\n- Seventh: \"lucian bute\" again.\n- Eighth: \"robert stieglitz.\"\n- Ninth: \"yusaf mack.\"\n- Tenth: \"ted muller.\"\n- Eleventh: \"mikkel kessler.\"\n- Twelfth: \"richard grant.\"\n- Thirteenth: \"otis grant.\"\n- Fourteenth: \"nicolas cervera.\"\n- Fifteenth: \"thomas reid.\"\n- Sixteenth: \"vitali kopitko.\"\n- Seventeenth: \"tito mendoza.\"\n- Eighteenth: \"willie stewart.\"\n- Nineteenth: \"leonard townsend.\"\n- Twentieth: \"eduardo ayala.\"\n- Twenty-first: \"errol banner.\"\n- Twenty-second: \"juan carlos barreto.\"\n- Twenty-third: \"shannon miller.\"\n- Twenty-fourth: \"pat lawlor.\"\n- Twenty-fifth: \"ruben perez.\"\n- Twenty-sixth: \"jimmy hagar.\"\n- Twenty-seventh: \"harold lowe.\"\n- Twenty-eighth: \"eric benito tzand.\"\n- Twenty-ninth: \"sheridan page.\"\n- Thirtieth: \"marcus harvey.\"\n- Thirty-first: \"bernard temple.\"\n- Thirty-second: \"terry smith.\"\n- Thirty-third: \"paul jones.\"\n- Thirty-fourth: \"george johnson.\"\n- Thirty-fifth: \"marcus harvey\" again.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant names:\n\n1. **Marcus Harvey** appears in row 30 and 35.\n2. **Terry Smith** is in row 32.\n3. **Librado Andrade** isn't directly mentioned in any opponent or fighter names in the table.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The claim mentions Librado Andrade, but I don't see him listed as an opponent in any of these fights. That might mean he wasn't involved in any recorded fight here, which would make the claim false because if he didn't fight Marcus Harvey first, there's no subsequent fight with Terry Smith.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I'm not missing something. Maybe he's a fighter who isn't listed as an opponent? Or perhaps he's part of another column, like maybe the \"fighter\" name in each row? The table doesn't specify which side is the opponent; it just lists one fighter against another.\n\nLooking again, the columns are \"row_index,\" \"fighter,\" \"opponent,\" and other metrics. So, if Librado Andrade was a fighter, he would be listed in the \"fighter\" column, but since none of the rows have his name there, he wasn't involved in any of these fights.\n\nTherefore, since there's no record of Librado Andrade fighting Marcus Harvey or Terry Smith, the claim isn't supported by the data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list which cells are relevant. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"librado andrade lose the fight against otis grant but win the fight against mikkel kessler.\" So there are two parts to this claim. The first part is that Andrade lost against Grant, and the second part is that Andrade won against Kessler.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: result, opponent, type, rd (time), date. Each row represents a fight outcome for someone, presumably Andrade, given that all wins and losses are from his perspective.\n\nI'll need to check each row to see if Andrade fought against Grant and Kessler, and then whether he lost or won those fights.\n\nStarting with the first part: loss against Otis Grant. I should look through each row for where opponent is \"otis grant\" and result is \"loss\". Let's scan the table:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is rowland bryant, result is loss.\nRow 1: Opponent is matt o'brien, result is win.\nRow 2: Opponent is aaron pryor jr, result is loss.\nRow 3: Opponent is eric lucas, result is win.\nRow 4: Opponent is lucian bute, result is loss.\nRow 5: Opponent is vitali tsypko, result is win.\nRow 6: Opponent is lucian bute, result is loss.\nRow 7: Opponent is robert stieglitz, result is win.\nRow 8: Opponent is yusaf mack, result is win.\nRow 9: Opponent is ted muller, result is win.\nRow10: Opponent is mikkel kessler, result is loss.\nRow11: Opponent is richard grant, result is win.\nRow12: Opponent is otis grant, result is win.\nRow13: Opponent is ruben perez, result is win.\n... and so on.\n\nWait, I see in row 6, opponent is lucian bute, result loss. Row12 has opponent as richard grant, result win. Hmm, then row13 is otis grant? Wait no, let me check the exact data.\n\nLooking at row indices more carefully:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 39, I think. Let me list them properly:\n\nRows:\n\n0: result=loss, opponent=rowland bryant\n1: win, matt o'brien\n2: loss, aaron pryor jr\n3: win, eric lucas\n4: loss, lucian bute\n5: win, vitali tsypko\n6: loss, lucian bute (again)\n7: win, robert stieglitz\n8: win, yusaf mack\n9: win, ted muller\n10: loss, mikkel kessler\n11: win, richard grant\n12: win, otis grant\n13: win, ruben perez\n14: win, jimmy hagar\n15: win, harold lowe\n16: win, eric benito tzand\n17: win, sheridan page\n18: win, marcus harvey\n19: win, bernard temple\n20: win, terry smith\n21: win, paul jones\n22: win, george johnson\n23: win, marcus harvey (again)\n24: win, ... etc.\n\nWait, so row12's opponent is otis grant, and the result is win. That would mean Andrade won against Grant, which contradicts the claim where he lost to Grant. So that would make the first part of the claim false.\n\nThen looking for a loss by Andrade against Grant: since in row12, he won, there's no row where opponent is otis grant and result is loss. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, the second part: Andrade wins against Mikkel Kessler. Looking for rows where opponent is mikkel kessler and result is win. Checking row10: opponent is mikkel kessler, result is loss. So he lost that fight.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false because both parts are not supported in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Andrade lost to Grant but won against Kessler. However:\n\n1. **Loss vs. Grant**: No row shows Andrade losing to Grant; all relevant entries show wins or losses against other opponents.\n2. **Win vs. Kessler**: The only entry against Kessler is a loss, not a win.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the match against lucian bute be the only fight that librado andrade lose.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of this statement are relevant to the data in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: \"match against lucian bute\" and \"librado andrade.\" So I need to check if there's any row in the table where both these entities appear together, specifically a loss by Andrade against Bute.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are result, opponent, type, rd (time), and date. The data has multiple rows, each representing a fight outcome.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's any where the result is a loss, the opponent is Lucian Bute, and the fighter is Librado Andrade.\n\nChecking row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Loss, Opponent Bute? No, it's Bryant.\n2. Row 1: Win against O'Brien, so not relevant for Andrade's losses.\n3. Row 2: Loss, opponent Pryor Jr., not Bute.\n4. Row 3: Win against Lucas; not a loss by Andrade.\n5. Row 4: Loss, but opponent is Bute... Wait, let me check the data again.\n\nWait, in row 4, the result is \"loss,\" opponent is Lucian Bute, and type is ko. So that's a loss by Andrade against Bute.\n\nLooking further:\n\nAfter that, rows 5-16: many wins by Andrade, but no losses except row 4.\n\nRow 17 onwards: more wins, and then in the later part, there's another loss by Andrade against Kessler (row 10), but not against Bute.\n\nWait, actually, I see row 0: loss to Bryant. Row 2: loss to Pryor Jr. Row 4: loss to Bute. Then row 10: loss to Kessler. So that would mean Andrade has lost multiple times, including once against Bute.\n\nSo the claim says \"the only fight that Librado Andrade lose.\" But if there's at least one other loss besides the Bute match, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure whether the table includes all of Andrade's losses. If he lost to Bute and others, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the table doesn't include all his fights? No, looking at the data provided, it seems comprehensive, as it starts from 1999 up to 2000, with various opponents.\n\nSo in row 4 (assuming rows are numbered starting at 0), Andrade lost against Bute. Then in row 10, he lost again against Kessler. So that's two losses, making the claim false because it says \"the only fight\" he lost is against Bute.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be where result is loss, opponent is Lucian Bute, and the fighter is Andrade.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if Librado Andrade has any other losses besides the one against Lucian Bute. From the table:\n\n- Row 4: Result is \"loss,\" Opponent is Lucian Bute. So that's one loss.\n- Row 10: Result is \"loss,\" Opponent is Bernard Temple, not Bute.\n\nBut wait, looking again, row 10's opponent isn't Bute; it's Kessler. So only row 4 matches the criteria of a loss against Bute. However, the claim says it's the ONLY fight he lost, which is incorrect because there's at least one more loss (against Kessler). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake. The user's table shows that row 4 is Andrade losing to Bute, and then in row 10, Andrade loses again, but against someone else. So indeed, there are multiple losses, making the claim incorrect.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the data, I realize that rows beyond row 17 might have more info, but in this dataset, only one loss against Bute exists. Wait, no\u2014row 4 is the only loss against Bute in the provided table. So if the claim says it's the only fight he lost, but he actually lost at least once more, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: Loss (vs Bryant)\n- Row 2: Loss (vs Pryor Jr.)\n- Row 4: Loss (vs Bute)\n- Row 10: Loss (vs Kessler)\n\nSo he lost multiple times, not just against Bute. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut in the initial analysis, I thought only row 4 was relevant for Bute. So the answer is FALSE because there are other losses by Andrade beyond the Bute fight.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the claim specifies that it's the \"only fight\" he lost. Since he has at least one more loss (against Kessler), the claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row 4, columns: result, opponent, type, and date.\n\nBut since the answer is FALSE, I need to provide the cells that confirm this.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rd (time)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the oldest fight that librado andrade won be on 2011 - 08 - 27.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. The user wants me to check if there's a fight in the table where Librado Andrade won, and whether the date of that fight is August 27, 2011.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like result, opponent, type, rd (time), and date. Each row represents a fight with details filled in those columns. \n\nI need to go through each row to find any where \"result\" is \"win\", the \"opponent\" is Librado Andrade, and the \"date\" is August 27, 2011.\n\nLet me scan the table rows one by one.\n\nRow 0: result is loss, so not relevant.\nRow 1: result is win.

Maybe there's a more efficient way. Let me look for \"Librado Andrade\" in the opponent column.\n\nLooking through each row's opponent:\n\nRow1: Matt O'Brien\nRow3: Eric Lucas\nOthers seem to be different names; none of them are Librado Andrade.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nIs there any row where opponent is Librado Andrade? The table provided seems to have opponents like Matt O'Brien, Eric Lucas, Lucian Bute, Vitali Tsypko, Robert Stieglitz, etc., but none of them are Librado Andrade.\n\nIf Librado Andrade isn't listed as an opponent in any of the rows, then there's no fight where he won. Therefore, the claim that he has a fight on August 27, 2011 is not supported because he didn't have such a fight.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the task. Maybe the table includes more opponents beyond what's listed here? No, each row lists the opponent for that specific fight. Since none of the opponents are Librado Andrade, there's no relevant data to support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no evidence in the provided table of a fight won by Librado Andrade on August 27, 2011.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the table as Librado Andrade isn't listed as an opponent in any winning fights. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"librado andrade have a fight with terry smith before the fight with marcus harvey\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two fights involving Librado Andrade: one against Terry Smith and another against Marcus Harvey. It says that the fight with Terry Smith happened before the fight with Marcus Harvey. So, I need to check if both these fights are present in the table and in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like result, opponent, type, rounds/time, and date. I should look for entries where the fighter is Librado Andrade (opponent column) against Terry Smith and Marcus Harvey.\n\nStarting with Librado Andrade vs. Terry Smith: I'll scan through each row's \"opponent\" column. Going down the list:\n\n- The 17th row (row_index 16) has \"opponent\" as \"terry smith\". The result is a win, type is ko, rounds/time is \"2 (4)\", and date is \"2000 - 04 - 13\".\n  \nNext, looking for Librado Andrade vs. Marcus Harvey: \n\n- The 18th row (row_index 17) has \"opponent\" as \"marcus harvey\". Result is a win, type is ko, rounds/time is \"4 (4)\", date is \"2000 - 02 - 03\".\n\nWait, but looking back at the claim, it's said that Andrade fought Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey. However, in the table, the fight with Terry Smith happened on April 13, 2000, and the fight with Marcus Harvey was on February 3, 2000. That means the fight with Marcus Harvey actually occurred before the fight with Terry Smith, which contradicts the claim.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let me check again:\n\n- Row 16 (Terry Smith) is April 13.\n- Row 17 (Marcus Harvey) is February 3.\n\nSo, February comes before April, meaning Marcus Harvey's fight was earlier than Terry Smith's. Therefore, the claim that Andrade fought Terry Smith before Marcus Harvey is incorrect because in reality, it was the other way around.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to find if the claim is fully supported by the table. So, even though both fights exist, their order contradicts the claim. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Librado Andrade have a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey,\" we need to check if both fights occurred in that specific order.\n\n1. **Finding Librado Andrade vs. Terry Smith**: \n   - Look for rows where the opponent is Terry Smith.\n   - Found at row_index 16 (February 3, 2000).\n\n2. **Finding Librado Andrade vs. Marcus Harvey**:\n   - Search for Marcus Harvey as the opponent.\n   - Found at row_index 17 (April 13, 2000).\n\n3. **Order Analysis**:\n   - Marcus Harvey's fight occurred on February 3, 2000.\n   - Terry Smith's fight was on April 13, 2000.\n   - Therefore, the fight with Marcus Harvey happened before Terry Smith.\n\nSince the actual order is reversed from what the claim states, the claim is not fully supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"librado andrade win all his fight against paul jones\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Librado Andrade won all his fights against Paul Jones. So, to verify this, I need to look for any entries in the table where both \"Librado Andrade\" and \"Paul Jones\" are involved as opponents, specifically where Librado wins.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: result, opponent, type, rd , time, and date. Each row represents a fight with these details. My task is to find any rows where the opponent is Paul Jones, and the result is a win for Librado Andrade.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Opponent: rowland bryant, result: loss\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- Opponent: matt o'brien, result: win\nNope.\n\nRow 2:\n- Opponent: aaron pryor jr, result: loss\nNo.\n\nRow 3:\n- Opponent: eric lucas, result: win\nNo.\n\nRow 4:\n- Opponent: lucian bute, result: loss\nNot matching.\n\nRow 5:\n- Opponent: vitali tsypko, result: win\nNo.\n\nRow 6:\n- Opponent: lucian bute, result: loss\nStill no.\n\nRow 7:\n- Opponent: robert stieglitz, result: win\nOpponent is not Paul Jones.\n\nRow 8:\n- Opponent: yusaf mack, result: win\nNope.\n\nRow 9:\n- Opponent: ted muller, result: win\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 10:\n- Opponent: mikkel kessler, result: loss\nNo match.\n\nRow 11:\n- Opponent: richard grant, result: win\nNo.\n\nRow 12:\n- Opponent: harold lowe, result: win\nNo.\n\nRow 13:\n- Opponent: eric benito tzand, result: win\nNot Paul Jones.\n\nRow 14:\n- Opponent: sheridan page, result: win\nNo.\n\nRow 15:\n- Opponent: marcus harvey, result: win\nNope.\n\nRow 16:\n- Opponent: bernard temple, result: win\nNo match.\n\nRow 17:\n- Opponent: terry smith, result: win\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 18:\n- Opponent: paul jones, result: win\nAh, here we go. This row is key. The opponent is Paul Jones, and the result is a win for whoever is the fighter. But wait, in this case, I need to check if Librado Andrade is the one who won against Paul Jones.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column is \"result.\" So in this row, the result is \"win,\" but who is the opponent? It says Paul Jones. The fighter in this row isn't specified as \"Librado Andrade\" though. I need to check if there's a row where both Librado Andrade is the fighter and Paul Jones is the opponent with a win.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it earlier. Let me go back.\n\nRow 18:\n- Opponent: paul jones\n- Result: win\n\nBut who is the fighter in this row? The table doesn't list the fighter's name; it only lists the opponent. So the second column is \"opponent,\" and presumably, the first column \"result\" refers to whether the fighter won or lost.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The columns are: result (the outcome of that fight for whoever is listed in the row), opponent, type, rd , time, date.\n\nSo each row represents a fight where someone fought against an opponent, and the result was either a win or loss. So to find if Librado Andrade beat Paul Jones, I need a row where the opponent is Paul Jones and the result is a win for the fighter (Librado), but since the table doesn't list the fighters, maybe the first column refers to the fighter's name.\n\nWait no, looking at the columns again: \"result\" is likely the outcome of that fight. So each row is about a specific fight between two boxers. The columns are:\n\n- result: who won (e.g., \"win\")\n- opponent: who they fought against\n- type: probably the method or style\n- rd, time, date: as expected.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014 looking at the table, each row has six columns: result, opponent, type, rd , time, date. So for example, in row 0: result is \"loss\", opponent is \"rowland bryant\". So this indicates that the fighter lost to rowland bryant.\n\nSimilarly, in row 1: result is \"win\", opponent is \"matt o'brien\"\u2014 so the fighter (not specified) won against matt o'brien.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't specify who the fighter is in each row\u2014 it only lists the opponent. So if I'm looking for a fight where Librado Andrade fought Paul Jones and won, I need to find a row where the opponent is Paul Jones, result is \"win\", and presumably the fighter is Librado.\n\nBut since the table doesn't specify the fighter's name in each row, maybe it's inferred that the fighter is someone else. Or perhaps the \"result\" column refers to whether the opponent was beaten or not.\n\nWait, this might be a misunderstanding. Maybe the table lists each fight as being between two people, with columns: result (the outcome), opponent, type, etc. So for example, if a fighter fought Paul Jones and won, that row would have \"win\" in result, \"paul jones\" as opponent.\n\nBut to know who the fighter is, maybe we need to see all rows where the opponent is Paul Jones and the result is a win. But without knowing the fighter's name, it's hard to tell if it's Librado Andrade.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"librado andrade win all his fight against paul jones.\" So that would mean every time Librado fought Paul, he won.\n\nBut in the table, each row is a single fight between two people. So to check if Librado beat Paul, there should be at least one row where opponent is Paul Jones and result is \"win\" for the fighter (Librado).\n\nIn the given table, I see row 18 has opponent: paul jones, result: win.\n\nBut who is the fighter in that row? The first column is \"result\", so perhaps it's the fighter's result. So if the fighter's name isn't listed, but only the opponent and result, then this might not help us directly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check other rows where Paul Jones was the opponent and see if any of them resulted in a win for someone else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured such that each row represents a fight between two boxers, with columns: who they fought against (opponent), whether they won or lost, and other details.\n\nSo to find fights where Librado Andrade fought Paul Jones and won, I'd look for rows where opponent is Paul Jones and result is \"win\".\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- row 18: opponent paul jones, result win\n\nThat's it. So in that case, someone fought against Paul Jones and won. But who was the fighter? If it's Librado Andrade, then yes. But if not, then no.\n\nSince the table doesn't specify the fighter's name, only the opponent and result, perhaps we can assume that the first column refers to the fighter's name. Wait no, the columns are: result, opponent, type, rd, time, date.\n\nSo for example:\n\nrow 0: result \"loss\", opponent \"rowland bryant\"\n\nThis would mean that the person who fought Rowland Bryant lost the fight.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nrow 18: result \"win\", opponent \"paul jones\"\u2014 so the person who fought Paul Jones won.\n\nBut without knowing the fighter's name, it's hard to associate with Librado Andrade. Unless we have a row where the opponent is Paul Jones and the result is win for someone named Librado.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong column\u2014 perhaps the first column isn't the fighter's name but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the table structure is: each row represents a fight, with columns:\n\n- Result (whether the boxer won)\n- Opponent\n- Type (e.g., knockout)\n- Rd (round)\n- Time\n- Date\n\nBut then, where is the fighter's name? It seems missing. So each row doesn't specify who the fighter was, only the opponent and result.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the fighter's name in those rows, we can't say whether it's Librado Andrade.\n\nWait, but maybe the first column is actually the fighter's name. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nLooking at the columns as provided: \"result\", \"opponent\", \"type\", \"rd\", \"time\", \"date\".\n\nSo that would mean each row lacks the fighter's name. So unless the fighter's name is in another column, which it isn't, we can't know.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the table is not providing enough information to confirm whether Librado Andrade fought Paul Jones and won.\n\nBut then, how else could we approach this? Maybe the initial instruction was that each row is a fight between two boxers, with result (win/loss), opponent, type, etc. So if someone fought Paul Jones and won, it's in row 18.\n\nSo unless we have another row where Librado Andrade fought Paul Jones, but I don't see any other rows with Paul Jones as the opponent except row 18.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check all the rows:\n\nLooking through the list of opponents:\n\nrow 0: rowland bryant\n\nrow1: matt o'brien\n\nrow2: eddie kaprunski\n\n...\n\nrow 14: sheridan page\n\nrow15: marcus harvey\n\nrow16: bernard temple\n\nrow17: terry smith\n\nrow18: paul jones\n\nSo only row 18 has Paul Jones as the opponent.\n\nTherefore, only in that row did someone fight and win. But unless we can tie that fighter to Librado Andrade, which I don't see how, since the table doesn't list the fighters' names.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial instruction was wrong, or maybe the table is misaligned. Alternatively, maybe the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"result\" column indicates whether the boxer won against the opponent. So if Librado Andrade fought Paul Jones and won, that would be a row where opponent is Paul Jones, result is win.\n\nBut again, without knowing the fighter's name, I can't confirm it's Librado.\n\nWait, but maybe in the context of the problem, each row refers to someone named in the previous question or something. But since I don't have that, perhaps the only information we have is that Paul Jones was fought once and the result was a win for someone.\n\nGiven that, can we assume it's Librado Andrade? Or do we need more evidence?\n\nThe problem says: \"You are tasked to determine whether Librado Andrade won all his fights against Paul Jones.\"\n\nSo we need to check if in every fight between Librado Andrade and Paul Jones, Librado won.\n\nBut in the table provided, there's only one fight where Paul Jones was the opponent, and it resulted in a win. But without knowing that the fighter is Librado Andrade, we can't confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe each row has more columns beyond what was listed. Or maybe the columns are misaligned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first column is actually the fighter's name, which would make sense. So in that case:\n\nColumn 1: Fighter's Name\n\nColumn 2: Opponent\n\nColumn 3: Result (win/loss)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIf that's the case, then row 18 would have Librado Andrade as the fighter who defeated Paul Jones.\n\nBut since the user didn't specify the columns, it's unclear. So perhaps I need to make an assumption based on the most logical structure.\n\nGiven that, I think the table is structured with:\n\n1. Fighter's Name\n\n2. Opponent\n\n3. Result (win/loss)\n\n4. Type\n\n5. Rd\n\n6. Time\n\n7. Date\n\nBut since the user didn't list all columns, maybe only some are provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are:\n\n- Boxer A: the fighter\n\n- Boxer B: opponent\n\n- Result: win/loss\n\n- Type\n\n- Rd\n\n- Time\n\n- Date\n\nIf that's the case, then looking for rows where Boxer A is Librado Andrade and Boxer B is Paul Jones with result win.\n\nBut again, without knowing which columns are present, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps I can infer from the problem statement. The task is to determine whether Librado Andrade won all his fights against Paul Jones.\n\nSo in the table provided, if any row shows a fight between them (Librado vs Paul), with Librado winning, that would be one instance.\n\nBut since we only have one row with Paul as the opponent and result win, and no rows showing fights where both opponents are named, it's unclear.\n\nTherefore, perhaps based on the information given, we can only conclude that there is at least one fight where someone defeated Paul Jones, but without knowing if it was Librado, we can't say he won all his fights against him.\n\nBut that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem says \"You are tasked to determine whether Librado Andrade won all his fights against Paul Jones.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the table provided, if we see any fight where both boxer and opponent are mentioned as Librado and Paul with result win, then yes. But without such a row, maybe there's none.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that each row is a fight between two boxers, and if any of those fights involve both Librado Andrade and Paul Jones, whether Librado won all such fights.\n\nBut again, without the specific rows, it's difficult.\n\nWait, another angle: in many datasets, sometimes the fighter's name isn't explicitly listed, but perhaps inferred from the context. For example, if a boxer has a distinct nickname or something that can be linked to their name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is incomplete, and only shows some of the fights. So perhaps we need to assume that all such rows are included.\n\nBut without more information, it's challenging.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best approach is to state that based on the provided data, there is one fight where someone defeated Paul Jones, but without knowing if it was Librado Andrade, we can't confirm whether Librado won all his fights against Paul Jones.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem expects a different interpretation. Maybe each row includes both boxers, and in the rows involving Paul Jones, the result is always a win for someone named Librado Andrade.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nThe opponent list includes Paul Jones once (row 18). The result is a win. But without knowing who the fighter was, we can't say if it's Librado.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion would be that there isn't enough information to determine whether Librado won all his fights against Paul Jones based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, it is not possible to confirm whether Librado Andrade won all his fights against Paul Jones. The table includes only one fight involving Paul Jones, which resulted in a win, but does not specify the fighter's name.
