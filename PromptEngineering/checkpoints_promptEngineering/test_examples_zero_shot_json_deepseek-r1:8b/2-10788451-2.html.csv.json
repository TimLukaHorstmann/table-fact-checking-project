    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and data. The claim is: \"prince park venue have the largest crowd in the 1965 VFL season.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Prince Park had the biggest crowd attend a game in the 1965 VFL season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows include information for different matches on April 24, 1965.\n\nSo, my goal is to find if Prince Park had the largest crowd in that season. To do this, I should identify all the venues and their corresponding crowds from the table, then see which one has the highest number.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Melbourne vs North Melbourne at McG: Crowd 21744\n2. Essendon vs Hawthorn at Windy Hill: Crowd 20500\n3. Collingwood vs Richmond at Victoria Park: Crowd 31370\n4. Carlton vs Geelong at Princes Park: Crowd 34945\n5. South Melbourne vs St Kilda at Lake Oval: Crowd 23979\n6. Footscray vs Fitzroy at Western Oval: Crowd 16998\n\nWait, the claim mentions Prince Park venue. So I need to check if any row has \"Prince Park\" as the venue and what the crowd number is.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 3: Venue is Victoria Park, not Prince Park.\n- Row 4: Venue is Princes Park. Hmm, that's different from Prince Park. Maybe a typo? Or maybe it's the same place referred to differently?\n- Other rows don't mention Prince Park either.\n\nWait, perhaps there was only one match at Prince Park in this season. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking at column \"venue\", which is the 5th element in each data array.\n\nRow 0: mcg\nRow 1: windy hill\nRow 2: victoria park\nRow 3: princes park\nRow 4: lake oval\nRow 5: western oval\n\nNone of these are Prince Park. So does that mean there was no match at Prince Park in the 1965 season, or maybe it's represented differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Prince Park\" is another name for Princes Park. Sometimes venues might be referred to slightly differently. For example, Princes Park and Prince Park could be the same place. If that's the case, then the crowd number would be 34945.\n\nNow, I need to compare this with other crowds to see if it's the largest. Let's list out all the crowd numbers:\n\n- McG: 21744\n- Windy Hill: 20500\n- Victoria Park: 31370\n- Princes Park (assumed Prince Park): 34945\n- Lake Oval: 23979\n- Western Oval: 16998\n\nLooking at these, the highest number is 34945 at Princes Park. So if Prince Park is indeed Princes Park, then it had the largest crowd.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifically mentions \"Prince Park venue.\" If in the table, there's no entry for Prince Park, but only Princes Park, does that mean the claim is false because Prince Park didn't have a match or wasn't present in the data?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is incomplete, and only some matches are listed. Perhaps there was a match at Prince Park with a higher crowd not shown here.\n\nBut based on the given data, we can only see what's presented. Since Princes Park (if same as Prince Park) has the highest crowd in the list, it would be the largest among those listed. If other matches had higher crowds at different venues not listed here, but since we don't have that info, we can only go by what's provided.\n\nSo, assuming that \"Prince Park\" is the correct venue name and corresponds to Princes Park, then the crowd is 34945, which is the highest in the data. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but the columns in the table for the venue are specific: mcg, windy hill, etc., and I don't see Prince Park as a separate entry. So perhaps there was no match at Prince Park in this season, or it's not included in the table. If that's the case, then the claim is FALSE because Prince Park didn't have any matches, so it can't be the venue with the largest crowd.\n\nBut I'm confused because sometimes venues might have different names or be referred to differently. For example, maybe \"Prince Park\" and \"Princes Park\" are the same place but spelled slightly differently. In that case, since Princes Park is present in the table with a high crowd number, we can consider it as Prince Park.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says Prince Park had the largest crowd, so to verify, I need to check if there's any row where venue is \"Prince Park\" and see its crowd. Since none of the rows have that exact name, maybe the claim is FALSE because there was no match at Prince Park in this season.\n\nBut wait, looking again, perhaps \"prince park\" is a typo for \"princes park.\" If so, then it's present as row 3 with a crowd of 34945. So, if the claim refers to Princes Park as Prince Park, then it's TRUE because that venue had the largest crowd in the data provided.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if they are the same place. If they are different venues, and none of the matches were at Prince Park, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to check for the exact name \"Prince Park\" as the venue in the table. Since it's not present, the claim might be false.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to consider whether the claim is fully supported by the table. So if the claim refers to a venue that doesn't exist in the table's data, then the claim isn't supported and should be false.\n\nTherefore, since \"Prince Park\" isn't listed as any of the venues, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the venue name \"Prince Park.\" Checking the table's \"venue\" column shows entries like mcg, windy hill, etc., none matching \"Prince Park.\" Since the table doesn't include a match at Prince Park, the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination. The claim is: \"hawthorn be the away team with the lowest score in the 1965 vfl season.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It's a JSON with columns like home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data is a list of rows, each representing a match.\n\nI need to check if Hawthorn was indeed the away team with the lowest score in that season. So I should look for any row where the away team is Hawthorn and then check their score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different match on April 24, 1965. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team is Melbourne, away is North Melbourne. Not Hawthorn.\n2. Second row: Home is Essendon, away is Hawthorn. Here, the away team is Hawthorn with a score of 6.8 (44). So that's one data point.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs Richmond. Away team is Richmond. Not Hawthorn.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs Geelong. Away team is Geelong. No.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne vs St Kilda. Away team is St Kilda. No.\n6. Sixth row: Footscray vs Fitzroy. Away team is Fitzroy. No.\n\nSo the only time Hawthorn is an away team in this table is the second row, with a score of 6.8 (44). Now I need to see if this is indeed the lowest score among all away teams in that season. But wait, the table only shows six matches, but it's unclear if these are all the games for the 1965 VFL season or just a sample.\n\nAssuming these are all the matches on April 24, 1965, then we can compare the away team scores:\n\n- Hawthorn: 6.8 (44)\n- Richmond: 9.10 (64)\n- Geelong: 9.11 (65)\n- St Kilda: 12.12 (84)\n- Fitzroy: 9.4 (58)\n\nSo among these, the lowest score is 6.8 (44) by Hawthorn as the away team. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on the given data.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells. The claim refers to two main points: Hawthorn being the away team and their score. So I need to identify which columns and rows are relevant. The row index where Hawthorn is the away team is 1 (since it's zero-indexed). The relevant columns would be \"away team\" and \"away team score\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are: row_index=1, column_name=\"away team\" for identifying the team; and row_index=1, column_name=\"away team score\" to check their score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"essendon have the highest score as a home team in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"essendon\" is one of the teams mentioned in the table. Looking at the data, Essendon's home game is in row 1. The columns related to their performance as a home team would be their score and possibly other factors like venue or date, but for this claim, the key metric is their score.\n\nThe next part of the claim says they have the highest score as a home team. To verify this, I need to check all other home teams in the table and see if Essendon's score is higher than theirs.\n\nLooking at the table columns, the relevant data points are under \"home team\" and \"home team score\". So, for each row where the first column is the home team, I'll extract their scores.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Melbourne with a score of 11.14 (80). That's quite high.\n2. Row 1: Home team is Essendon with a score of 20.18 (138).\n3. Row 2: Collingwood, 11.13 (79).\n4. Row 3: Carlton, 8.11 (59).\n5. Row 4: South Melbourne, 7.9 (51).\n6. Row 5: Footscray, 8.6 (54).\n\nNow, I need to compare these scores. The claim is about Essendon having the highest as a home team, so their score should be higher than all others.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n- Essendon's score is 138.\n- Melbourne has 80.\n- Collingwood: 79.\n- Carlton:59.\n- South Melbourne:51.\n- Footscray:54.\n\nSo, Essendon's 138 is indeed the highest among all home teams. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the data provided.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other home teams in the table that might have a higher score not listed here. But from the given rows, these are all the home games for each team. Since Essendon's 138 is the highest, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Essendon has the highest score as a home team. By examining the \"home team score\" column, we find that Essendon's score (20.18 (138)) is indeed higher than all other home teams' scores in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcg venue have a smaller crowd than victoria park\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that the McGabbin (I think they meant Melbourne here) venue had fewer people attending than Victoria Park. So I need to find the crowd numbers for both these venues in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has several columns including \"home team,\" \"away team,\" their scores, the venue name, the crowd, and the date. The data rows have this information for different matches.\n\nI need to identify which rows and columns are relevant here. Let's start by finding the rows where either the home or away team is from Melbourne or Victoria Park. Wait, actually, the venues are what we're interested in: McGabbin (probably meant Melbourne) and Victoria Park.\n\nLooking at the first row of data:\n- Home team: melbourne\n- Venue: mcg\n- Crowd: 21744\n\nSecond row:\n- Away team: essendon vs hawthorn\n- Venue: windy hill\n- Crowd: 20500\n\nThird row:\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Venue: victoria park\n- Crowd: 31370\n\nFourth row:\n- Carlton vs Geelong, venue princes park, crowd 34945\n\nFifth row: South Melbourne vs St Kilda at lake oval with 23979 people.\n\nSixth row: Footscray vs Fitzroy at western oval with 16998 people.\n\nSo the relevant rows are the first (mcg) and third (victoria park). The other venues don't matter for this claim.\n\nNow, comparing their crowds:\n- McGabbin (mcg): 21744\n- Victoria Park: 31370\n\nThe claim says mcg has a smaller crowd than Victoria Park. So 21744 is indeed less than 31370. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns for crowd are always in the same position (column index 5). So I'll extract those specific cells from the rows where venue is mcg and victoria park.\n\nFor McGabbin:\n- Row 0, column \"crowd\"\n\nFor Victoria Park:\n- Row 2, column \"crowd\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 2 with their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we checked the crowd numbers for the McGabbin venue (mcg) and Victoria Park from the table. The crowd at mcg was 21,744, which is smaller than the 31,370 at Victoria Park. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns include \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". The data provided has multiple rows, each representing a match with details filled in.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Prince Park venue and the least crowd. So I should focus on finding all matches that took place at Prince Park. \n\nLooking through the table, I spot a row where the venue is listed as \"princes park\" (note: it's spelled without an 'i' here). The crowd for that game is 34,945. \n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the smallest number in the crowd column for games played on 24 April 1965. All other venues on that date have higher crowds: Melbourne had 21,744, Essendon 20,500, Collingwood 31,370, South Melbourne 23,979, Footscray 16,998. \n\nSince Prince Park's crowd is the lowest among these, the claim appears to be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Prince Park having the least crowd, I identified all relevant rows for games at Prince Park on April 24, 1965, and compared their crowd numbers with others on that date.\n\nThe relevant row is the fourth one, which shows a crowd of 34,945 at \"princes park\". Comparing this to other venues on the same day, it has the lowest attendance. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"hawthorn be the away team with the highest point ever record.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are \"hawthorn\" as the away team and that they have the highest point ever recorded.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a JSON structure with columns like \"home team,\" \"away team,\" etc., and several rows of data. Each row seems to represent a game or match, including details like the teams involved, their scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nSo, my first step is to identify which cells are relevant to verify this claim. The claim mentions \"hawthorn\" as the away team, so I need to find where in the table Hawthorn appears as an away team. Then, check their score against other away teams to see if they have the highest points.\n\nLooking at the \"away team\" column: let's go through each row.\n\nRow 0: away team is \"north melbourne\"\nRow 1: away team is \"hawthorn\" \u2192 this is relevant because it's Hawthorn as an away team.\nRow 2: away team is \"richmond\"\nRow 3: away team is \"geelong\"\nRow 4: away team is \"st kilda\"\nRow 5: away team is \"fitzroy\"\n\nSo, only row 1 has Hawthorn as the away team. Now, I need to check their score. The \"away team score\" for Hawthorn in this row is 6.8 (44). \n\nNext, I should compare this with other away teams' scores. Let's list all away team scores:\n\nRow 0: north melbourne - 10.12 (72)\nRow 1: hawthorn - 6.8 (44)\nRow 2: richmond - 9.10 (64)\nRow 3: geelong - 9.11 (65)\nRow 4: st kilda - 12.12 (84)\nRow 5: fitzroy - 9.4 (58)\n\nNow, to find the highest score among away teams:\n\nNorth melbourne: 72\nHawthorn: 44\nRichmond: 64\nGeelong: 65\nSt Kilda: 84\nFitzroy: 58\n\nThe highest here is St Kilda with 84 points. Hawthorn's 44 is lower than that. So, the claim that Hawthorn has the highest away team score ever isn't supported by this data.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"highest point ever record,\" so I need to make sure if this table represents all historical games up to the date shown or only a snapshot. The date in all rows is April 24, 1965. So, perhaps this is a specific set of games, and within that set, St Kilda has the highest away score.\n\nTherefore, Hawthorn isn't the away team with the highest score here.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that when Geelong was the away team, their score was lower compared to North Melbourne's home team score. So I need to find the scores for both Geelong and North Melbourne when they played against each other, specifically looking at their respective away and home performances.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a match between two teams with all these details filled out.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant rows where Geelong was the away team and North Melbourne was the home team. Let me go through each row one by one until I find the correct pair.\n\nRow 0: Home team is Melbourne, so not related.\nRow 1: Home team is Essendon, nope.\nRow 2: Home team is Collingwood, still not matching.\nRow 3: Home team is Carlton. Wait, is this correct? The claim is about Geelong as away and North Melbourne as home, but I'm here seeing Carlton as the home. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me double-check each row.\n\nWait, actually, let's see: looking at the \"away team\" column might help because we need to find when Geelong was away. So in Row 0, away team is North Melbourne? Wait no, Row 0's away team is North Melbourne, but the home team is Melbourne. That's a different match.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Home team: Melbourne\n- Away team: North Melbourne\n\nSo this is Melbourne playing against North Melbourne at the McG. So Geelong isn't involved here.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: Essendon\n- Away team: Hawthorn\n\nNot relevant either.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: Collingwood\n- Away team: Richmond\n\nNope.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home team: Carlton\n- Away team: Geelong\n\nAh, here we go. So this is the match where Geelong was away against Carlton at Princes Park with a crowd of 34,945 on April 24, 1965.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about North Melbourne as home, not Carlton. So I might have missed it. Let me keep going.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home team: South Melbourne\n- Away team: St Kilda\n\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home team: Footscray\n- Away team: Fitzroy\n\nNope.\n\nWait, but in Row 0, the away team is North Melbourne, and home is Melbourne. So I need to see if Geelong was ever the away team against North Melbourne as the home team. But looking through all rows:\n\nIn Row 3, Geelong is away against Carlton.\nRow 0: North Melbourne is away against Melbourne.\n\nSo, perhaps in this table, there's no match where Geelong was the away team against North Melbourne as the home team. Wait, that can't be right because the claim is about their matchup. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all rows again:\n\nLooking for when Geelong is away and North Melbourne is home.\n\nRow 0: Home is Melbourne, away is North Melbourne. So not our case.\n\nOther rows don't have either of these as away or home except Row 3 where Geelong is away against Carlton.\n\nSo, if the claim is about Geelong being away against North Melbourne, but in this table, they played against Carlton when Geelong was away. Therefore, there's no data here to support the claim because the specific match between Geelong (away) and North Melbourne (home) isn't present in this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me re-examine it: \"geelong get a lower score than north melbourne as an away team.\" So it's about when Geelong was away, their score compared to North Melbourne when they were home.\n\nLooking again at Row 3: Geelong scored 59 (8.11), and Carlton scored 65 (9.11). So Geelong's score is lower than Carlton's, but that's against Carlton as the home team, not North Melbourne.\n\nSo in this table, there's no match where both teams are Geelong (away) vs North Melbourne (home). Therefore, we can't verify whether Geelong's score was lower because such a match isn't present. Hence, the claim cannot be fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain a match where Geelong was the away team against North Melbourne as the home team.

Essendon's home team status.\n2. Their score as a home team.\n3. The season in question is 1977.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various games with details like home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd size, and date. Each row represents a game, so I need to check if Essendon was the home team in any of these games during the 1977 season and whether they had the highest score among all home teams that year.\n\nI notice that all the dates in the table are from April 1965, which is not 1977.

Therefore, there's no data in the provided table to check if Essendon had the highest home score in 1977.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to 1965, but the claim specifically says 1977, so I have to go with that. Since there are no games listed for Essendon as a home team in 1977, we can't verify their performance that season. \n\nSo, based on the table provided, there's no information supporting or contradicting the claim because the relevant data isn't present. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim cannot be fully supported by the given evidence.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if Essendon was a home team in 1977 and if they had the highest score that season. However, all games in the table are from April 24, 1965, not 1977. Thus, there's no data to support or refute the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look for Essendon as a home team in 1977.\n2. **Check Date and Season:** All entries are from 1965, not 1977.\n3. **Conclusion:** No relevant data exists to verify the claim, so it's false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, let me understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions \"mcg venue,\" so I should look for any rows where the venue is \"mcg.\" Looking at the data column under \"venue,\" I see that only the first row has \"mcg\" as the venue. So that's the relevant row, which is row index 0.\n\nNext, the claim says \"2cd most attendence.\" I think this refers to the crowd numbers. The term \"CD\" might be a typo for \"second\" or perhaps it's an abbreviation I'm not familiar with. Considering context, it likely means second highest attendance. So, I need to compare the crowd number at mcg with other venues to see if it's in the top two.\n\nLooking at all rows, the crowd numbers are as follows:\n\n- Row 0: 21744\n- Row 1: 20500\n- Row 2: 31370\n- Row 3: 34945\n- Row 4: 23979\n- Row 5: 16998\n\nThe highest attendance is at row 3 with 34,945. The second highest would be either row 0 or row 2. \n\nComparing mcg's attendance (21,744) to the next highest, which is row 2 with 31,370, mcg isn't in the top two. Therefore, it doesn't have the second most attendance.\n\nWait, that contradicts the claim. The claim says mcg has 2cd most attendence, meaning it's second. But according to the numbers, it's not even close. So the claim is FALSE because mcg's crowd isn't in the top two for attendance in that season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the McGladery venue (mcg) had the second highest attendance in the 1965 season. However, upon examining the table, the mcg venue has a crowd of 21,744, which is not among the top two attendances (34,945 and 31,370). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to data in the table. The claim has two main parts: \"geelong\" and \"north melbourne,\" both referred to as away teams, and their scores compared to each other.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The columns are: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nSo, I need to find rows where both Geelong and North Melbourne are away teams. That means in each row, the 'away team' column should have either \"geelong\" or \"north melbourne.\" Wait, actually, since the claim is about Geelong as an away team against North Melbourne as an away team, I might be misinterpreting something.\n\nWait, no. In a typical game, one team is home and the other is away. So in each row, there's a home team and an away team. So to find when Geelong was an away team against North Melbourne as the home team, or vice versa? But the claim says \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team.\" That means Geelong was the away team, and North Melbourne was the home team.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the table, for each game, one is home and one is away. So to check when Geelong was away against North Melbourne, I need to find a row where the away team is Geelong and the home team is North Melbourne.\n\nSo first, I'll look through the data rows:\n\nRow 0:\n- Home team: melbourne\n- Away team: north melbourne\n\nSo in this case, the away team is North Melbourne. That's not what we're looking for because the claim is about Geelong being the away team.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: essendon\n- Away team: hawthorn\n\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Away team: richmond\n\nNope.\n\nRow3:\n- Home team: carlton\n- Away team: geelong\n\nHere, the away team is Geelong. So this row could be relevant because it's when Geelong was away against Carlton. But we're looking for when Geelong was away against North Melbourne.\n\nRow4:\n- Home team: south melbourne\n- Away team: st kilda\n\nNo.\n\nRow5:\n- Home team: footscray\n- Away team: fitzroy\n\nNot relevant.\n\nWait, so in the given table, does any row have Geelong as the away team against North Melbourne as the home team? Let me check each row's away team:\n\nRows 0 to 5:\n\n0. north melbourne (away)\n1. hawthorn\n2. richmond\n3. geelong\n4. st kilda\n5. fitzroy\n\nSo none of the rows have Geelong as the away team against North Melbourne as the home team. Therefore, there's no data in the table where Geelong was the away team playing against North Melbourne.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I might have misread. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow0: melbourne (home), north melbourne (away)\nRow1: essendon (home), hawthorn (away)\nRow2: collingwood (home), richmond (away)\nRow3: carlton (home), geelong (away)\nRow4: south melbourne (home), st kilda (away)\nRow5: footscray (home), fitzroy (away)\n\nSo, in row0, the away team is North Melbourne. In row3, the away team is Geelong.\n\nTherefore, to check if Geelong as an away team has a higher score than North Melbourne when they are the home team, I need to see if there's any row where the away team is Geelong and the home team is North Melbourne. But looking at all rows, that doesn't happen.\n\nSo, in this table, there is no data where Geelong is the away team against North Melbourne as the home team. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified because there's no relevant data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team.\" So it's not about whether Geelong was always better, but specifically when they were away against North Melbourne. Since in the table, there's no such game where Geelong was away against North Melbourne, the statement is comparing apples and oranges because the necessary data isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to look at any row where either team is Geelong or North Melbourne as an away team, regardless of who they played. But that wouldn't make sense because the claim specifically mentions them as away teams against each other.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there's no relevant data in the table to support this claim because Geelong isn't listed as an away team against North Melbourne.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about comparing scores when Geelong was away against North Melbourne. However, upon reviewing the table, there are no rows where Geelong is the away team facing North Melbourne as the home team. Therefore, the necessary data to verify this claim is absent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
