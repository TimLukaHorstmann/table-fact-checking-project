    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, they play at the Mile High Stadium 4 more times than at the Kingdome.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see what information is available. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game during the season.\n\nI need to identify which games were played at Mile High Stadium and how many times they played there compared to the Kingdome. From the claim, it's comparing the number of games at Mile High to those at the Kingdome, so I'll focus on the \"game site\" column for each game.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Week 1: September 12 vs. San Diego Chargers at Mile High Stadium.\n2. Week 2: September 19 vs. San Francisco 49ers at Mile High Stadium.\n3. Week 10: November 21 vs. Seattle Seahawks at Mile High Stadium.\n4. Week 11: November 28 vs. San Diego Chargers at Jack Murphy Stadium.\n5. Week 12: December 5 vs. Atlanta Falcons at Mile High Stadium.\n6. Week 13: December 12 vs. Los Angeles Rams at Anaheim Stadium.\n7. Week 14: December 19 vs. Kansas City Chiefs at Mile High Stadium.\n8. Week 15: December 26 vs. Los Angeles Raiders at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n9. Week 16: January 2 vs. Seattle Seahawks at Kingdome.\n\nSo, let's count the games at each venue:\n\n- Mile High Stadium: Weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, and 14. That's a total of 5 games.\n- Kingdome: Only Week 16 against Seattle Seahawks. So that's 1 game.\n\nWait, but the claim says they play at Mile High Stadium \"4 more times than\" at the Kingdome. If Mile High is 5 and Kingdome is 1, then 5 - 1 = 4. That seems to support the claim. However, I should double-check if there are any other games at Kingdome.\n\nLooking back, only Week 16 is listed as being played at Kingdome. So yes, that's correct. Mile High had 5 games, Kingdome had 1.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided, the row indices go from 0 to 15 (since it's a 16-row data array). Let me count again:\n\nMile High Stadium:\n- Row 0: Week 1\n- Row 1: Week 2\n- Row 9: Week 10\n- Row 11: Week 12\n- Row 13: Week 14\n\nThat's five games (indices 0,1,9,11,13).\n\nKingdome:\n- Row 15: Week 16\n\nOnly one game.\n\nSo, the number of times they played at Mile High is 5, and at Kingdome once. So, 5 - 1 = 4 more times at Mile High than Kingdome. The claim says \"they play at the Mile High Stadium 4 more time[s] than at the Kingdome.\" Wait, \"time\" is singular, but the count is 4 more times, which makes sense because it's comparing plural counts.\n\nBut looking again, in the table, Week 16 is January 2, so it's part of the same season. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Broncos played at Mile High Stadium 4 more times than at Kingdome during the 1982 season. From the table, there were indeed 5 games at Mile High and 1 at Kingdome.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\nRelevant cells are those indicating games played at Mile High Stadium and Kingdome.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, Week 12 and Week 14 both played at Mile High Stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance. The data rows have information for each game.\n\nThe claim is about the 1982 season, specifically Weeks 12 and 14. So I need to check if those weeks exist in the table, what games were played on those weeks, where they were held, and whether both of those games were at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 0: Week 1, September 12 vs Chargers, result L 3-23, location Mile High Stadium. So that's Week 1.\n\nRow 1: Week 2, September 19 vs 49ers, W 24-21, same venue. Week 2.\n\nRows continue up to Row 16, which is Week 16, January 2 vs Seahawks, L 11-13 at Kingdome.\n\nWait, the weeks go from 1 to 16 in the table, but the claim is about Weeks 12 and 14 in the 1982 season. So I need to check if those weeks are present and their locations.\n\nLooking for Week 12: Let's see the rows:\n\n- Row 5 (index 5) is Week 12: date December 5 vs Falcons, L 27-34, location Mile High Stadium.\n\nSo that's Week 12 at Mile High.\n\nWeek 14 would be row 7 (index 7): Week 14, December 19 vs Chiefs, L 16-37, location Mile High Stadium.\n\nSo both Weeks 12 and 14 were played at Mile High Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE. Now I need to identify which cells in the table support this. For each of those weeks (12 and 14), their row indices are 5 and 7 respectively. The relevant columns for each would be 'week', 'date', 'opponent', etc., but since we only need to specify the relevant cells based on the claim, it's about their location.\n\nWait, no. The claim is specifically about the game sites. So the relevant column is 'game site' for both weeks 12 and 14. Their row indices are 5 and 7.\n\nSo I should extract those two cells: week 12 at index 5, 'game site' value Mile High Stadium; week 14 at index 7, same location.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Week 12: row_index=5, column_name='game site'\n\n- For Week 14: row_index=7, column_name='game site'\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE because both games were indeed at Mile High Stadium in their respective weeks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, the team lost 5 more times than they won.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. They're talking about a specific season, 1982, and comparing the number of losses to the number of wins. Specifically, they're saying the team lost 5 more games than they won. So, if the Broncos won W games and lost L games in that season, then L should equal W + 5 for this claim to be true.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with various columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The 'record' column seems relevant here because it shows the team's win-loss record after each game. For example, in row 0, the record is \"0 - 1\", which means they've lost one game. Row 1 has a record of \"1 - 1\", meaning they have one win and one loss. This pattern continues for each row.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the entire season. So I need to look at all the games listed in the table for the 1982 season and sum up their wins and losses. However, looking at the data, the 'week' column starts from week 1, but not all weeks are present. The earliest date is September 12 (week 1), and the last game is January 2 (week 16). So the table might include all games from week 1 to week 16 of the 1982 season.\n\nI need to count the total number of wins and losses in these games. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Lost, record becomes 0 - 1.\n- Week 2: Won, record becomes 1 - 1.\n- Week 10: Lost, record becomes 1 - 2.\n- Week 11: Lost, record becomes 1 - 3.\n- Week 12: Lost, record becomes 1 - 4.\n- Week 13: Won, record becomes 2 - 4.\n- Week 14: Lost, record becomes 2 - 5.\n- Week 15: Lost, record becomes 2 - 6.\n- Week 16: Lost, record becomes 2 - 7.\n\nWait a minute, that's only nine games listed in the table. But the Broncos played 16 games that season, so there are more games not included here. Hmm, maybe the table doesn't list all the games for the 1982 season. That could be an issue because if some games aren't listed, we can't accurately count the total wins and losses.\n\nAssuming the table includes all relevant games, let's tally up the wins and losses from what is provided. From the data:\n\nWins: In week 2 (1 win) and week 13 (another win). So total wins are 2.\n\nLosses: Week 1, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16. That's 7 losses.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the record in week 16 is 2 - 7, meaning they've lost 7 games and won 2 by then. So according to this data, total wins would be 2 and losses would be 7. The claim says they lost 5 more times than they won. Let's see: 7 losses vs 2 wins. 7 is (2 + 5), so yes, 7 is 5 more than 2.\n\nBut hold on, the table only shows up to week 16, and the season went into January, so maybe there are more games not listed here. For example, in the data provided, week 1 through week 16 are covered, but perhaps other weeks have additional wins or losses that aren't shown. However, the table doesn't include all games, so I can't rely on it for a complete season analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'record' column shows the cumulative record after each game, which would include all games up to that week. So in week 16, their record is 2 - 7, meaning they lost 7 and won 2 by then. If this data includes all 16 games, then yes, total wins are 2 and losses are 7.\n\nBut wait, the table shows only 9 rows, so it's only for specific weeks, but perhaps the 'record' is updated each week regardless of whether a game was played or not? That seems unlikely. Usually, the record would only be updated after playing a game. So if there are 16 games in the season, and the table includes all 16, then we can count from that.\n\nBut looking at the data, it starts at week 1 and goes up to week 16, but not every week is represented. For example, weeks 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, etc., are missing. So maybe the table doesn't list all games, only some key ones.\n\nThis makes it tricky because without knowing all the wins and losses, I can't accurately determine whether the team lost five more times than they won in the entire season. The claim is about the 1982 season as a whole, not just the games listed here.\n\nSo perhaps the table isn't complete, which means we can't verify the claim based on the data provided. Alternatively, maybe the 'record' column reflects the cumulative record after each game, regardless of the week number. So even if some weeks are missing, the total wins and losses could be inferred from the cumulative records.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 0: 0 - 1 (week 1)\nRow 1: 1 - 1 (week 2)\nRow 10: 1 - 2 (week 10)\nRow 11: 1 - 3 (week 11)\nRow 12: 1 - 4 (week 12)\nRow 13: 2 - 4 (week 13)\nRow 14: 2 - 5 (week 14)\nRow 15: 2 - 6 (week 15)\nRow 16: 2 - 7 (week 16)\n\nWait, actually, the rows are numbered from 0 to 16, but that doesn't align with the weeks. Maybe the 'record' is just listed in order of game played, regardless of the week.\n\nAlternatively, each row represents a week, so week 1 is first, week 2 second, etc., up to week 16 as the last entry.\n\nAssuming that, we have 16 games:\n\nWins: Week 2 and week 13 \u2192 2 wins.\nLosses: The rest are losses. Let's count them: weeks 1,10,11,12,14,15,16. That's 7 losses.\n\nSo total wins:2; total losses:7.\n\nThe claim is that they lost five more times than they won: 2 +5=7. Yes, that matches.\n\nBut wait, the last row is week 16 with a record of 2 -7, so total season record would be 2-7, meaning 7 losses and 2 wins.\n\nSo if we consider all games, from week1 to week16, they had 2 wins and 7 losses. Therefore, 7=2+5, which fits the claim that they lost five more times than they won.\n\nBut again, this depends on the table including all 16 games of the season. If it doesn't, then we can't rely on it to confirm the total record. Since the last game is week16, perhaps it's safe to assume these are all the wins and losses for the entire season.\n\nThus, based on the data provided, the team lost seven times and won two times, which means they lost five more games than they won (7-2=5). Therefore, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that the team ended the 1982 season with a total of 2 wins and 7 losses. This results in losing five more games than they won (7 - 2 = 5), which aligns with the given statement.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is supported by the data, as the team lost five more games than they won during the 1982 season.",

The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 1, 2 and 10 were played at the Mile High Stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I should look into the table's structure. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The data rows correspond to specific games during a season.\n\nNow, the claim is about the 1982 Denver Bronco season, specifically mentioning weeks 1, 2, and 10 being played at Mile High Stadium. To verify this, I need to check if there are any entries in the table for these weeks and whether the game site was Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a week of the season. The first few rows have week numbers starting from 1 onwards. For instance, row 0 is week 1, row 1 is week 2, then it skips to week 10 in row 9, and so on up to week 16.\n\nSo for week 1: row_index 0. Let's see the \"game site\" column. It says \"mile high stadium.\" That matches Mile High Stadium.\n\nWeek 2: row_index 1. The game site is also \"mile high stadium.\" So that's correct too.\n\nNow, week 10: Looking for week 10 in the table. The weeks listed are 1,2,10,11,12,...16. Week 10 is row_index 9. Checking that row, the game site is \"mile high stadium.\"\n\nWait a second, but looking at the claim again, it says week 10 was played at Mile High Stadium. But in the table, week 10 is indeed at Mile High Stadium. So all three weeks (1,2,10) were played there.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The table starts with week 1 on September 12 and then week 2 on September 19, which are early in the season. Then it skips to week 10 on November 21. So yes, those three weeks are present and all have Mile High Stadium as their game site.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Weeks 1, 2, and 10 of the 1982 season were played at Mile High Stadium.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, week 16 had the least amount in attendance of all 9 games.\" So, I need to check if week 16 indeed has the lowest attendance compared to all other weeks.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns include \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", \"game site\", \"record\", and \"attendance\". The data is provided for each game from week 1 to week 16. \n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions the 1982 season, but looking at the table's first few entries: week 1 is September 12, which would be early in the season. However, the table only goes up to week 16 of the same season. That seems a bit odd because typically, an NFL season has weeks up to week 17 or sometimes more, depending on the playoffs. So week 16 might not necessarily be the last game of the regular season, but in this case, it's part of the data provided.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to week 16 having the least attendance among all nine games. Wait, nine games? But looking at the table, there are multiple weeks beyond nine. The data goes up to week 16, so that's 16 weeks total. So perhaps the claim is a bit confusing. Maybe it means that in week 16 of the season, the attendance was the lowest compared to all other games played that week? Or maybe it's referring to all games in week 16? Hmm.\n\nWait, the table seems to list each game with its respective week, date, opponent, etc. So for each row, \"week\" is the specific week number of that game. The claim says that in week 16, attendance was the least among all nine games. But wait, there are only eight weeks before week 16 (weeks 1-8), but that doesn't make sense because it's saying nine games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is stating that within the 1982 season, during week 16, the attendance was the lowest compared to all other games played in that season, specifically looking at all nine games? That still doesn't quite add up because the table shows data for multiple weeks beyond just nine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that in week 16, the attendance figure is the smallest when comparing all the games from week 1 through week 16. So I need to check each game's attendance for weeks 1-16 and find which week had the lowest number.\n\nLooking at the \"attendance\" column:\n\nWeek 1: 73564\n\nWeek 2: 73899\n\nWeek 10: 73996\n\nWeek 11: 47629\n\nWait, hold on. The data provided in the table doesn't go up to week 16 for all columns. Let me check each row's week number and attendance:\n\nRow 0: Week 1, attendance 73564\n\nRow 1: Week 2, 73899\n\nRow 2: Week 10, 73996\n\nRow 3: Week 11, 47629\n\nRow 4: Week 12, 73984\n\nRow 5: Week 13, 48112\n\nRow 6: Week 14, 74192\n\nRow 7: Week 15, 44160\n\nRow 8: Week 16, attendance is missing? Wait no, the last row is week 16 with attendance 43145.\n\nWait, no. Let me list them correctly:\n\nRow 0: week 1, att 73564\n\nRow 1: week 2, 73899\n\nRow 2: week10,73996\n\nRow3: week11,47629\n\nRow4: week12,73984\n\nRow5: week13,48112\n\nRow6: week14,74192\n\nRow7: week15,44160\n\nRow8: week16,43145.\n\nWait, that's 9 data points, but weeks go from 1 to 16. So perhaps the table only includes games up to week 16, and some weeks have multiple games? Or maybe it's incomplete. But looking at the given data, each row corresponds to a specific week, with week numbers increasing from 1 to 16.\n\nSo for each week, we can compare attendance. The claim says that in week 16, the attendance was the least among all nine games. So I need to see if week16's attendance is lower than all other weeks listed here.\n\nLooking at week16: 43145\n\nCompare with others:\n\nweek1:73564\n\nweek2:73899\n\nweek10:73996\n\nweek11:47629\n\nWait, no, that's only up to week16. So the lowest attendance would be the smallest number in the attendance column.\n\nLooking at all \"attendance\" values:\n\n73564, 73899, 73996, 47629, 73984, 48112, 74192, 44160, 43145.\n\nWait, but these are spread across different weeks. So perhaps the claim is saying that in week16 of the season (which is part of all 9 games), it had the least attendance compared to other games in that same week? But I think that's not how it works because each game is a separate event, so \"all nine games\" might refer to all games played during the season. Wait, but the claim says \"during the 1982 denver bronco season, week16 have the least amount in attendance of all 9 game.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's a translation issue. Perhaps it means that in week16, among all the games that took place that week (week16), which could be multiple games, but looking at the table, each row is for a specific week, so perhaps in week16, there was only one game, and the attendance was 43145.\n\nBut the claim says \"of all 9 game,\" which might not make sense because the data doesn't show nine games being played in week16. Wait, looking back at the table, each row is a single game, so perhaps the table lists 16 games from weeks1 to week16. So the \"all 9 game\" part might be referring to all games in the season up to that point or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant \"all nine games played in week16,\" but each week only has one game listed here, so perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The claim is: \"You are tasked with proving whether in the 1982 season, during Week 16, the Denver Broncos had the lowest attendance among all nine games.\" So maybe they played nine games in week16, and we need to see if their attendance was the lowest.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row corresponds to a different week. So perhaps it's about comparing attendance within week16 to other weeks, but that doesn't make sense because each game is a separate event.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that in week16, they had fewer people attend their game compared to all other games (weeks) in the season, which would require checking if 43145 is the smallest number among all the attendance numbers listed.\n\nLooking at all attendance figures:\n\n73564\n\n73899\n\n73996\n\n47629\n\n73984\n\n48112\n\n74192\n\n44160\n\n43145.\n\nSo arranging them from lowest to highest: 47629, 43145, 44160, 48112, 53984? Wait no, let's list them all numerically:\n\nFrom the data:\n\nRow0:73564\n\nRow1:73899\n\nRow2:73996\n\nRow3:47629\n\nRow4:73984\n\nRow5:48112\n\nRow6:74192\n\nRow7:44160\n\nRow8:43145.\n\nSo ordered from lowest to highest attendance:\n\nRow3:47629\n\nRow8:43145\n\nRow7:44160\n\nRow5:48112\n\nRow4:73984\n\nRow1:73899\n\nRow2:73996\n\nRow6:74192\n\nRow0:73564.\n\nWait, 47629 is the lowest? No, wait 43145 is lower than 47629. So 43145 < 47629 < 44160?\n\nNo, 43145 is less than 47629, but what about 44160? 43145 is less than 44160 as well.\n\nWait:\n\n43145 (row8)\n\nThen row3:47629\n\nThen row7:44160 comes after row8? No, wait no:\n\nWait 43145 is less than 44160, which is in row7. So the order would be:\n\nRow8:43145\n\nRow7:44160\n\nRow3:47629\n\nRow5:48112\n\nRow4:73984\n\nRow1:73899\n\nRow2:73996\n\nRow6:74192\n\nRow0:73564.\n\nSo yes, 43145 is the lowest attendance among all weeks listed. So if the claim is that in week16, they had the lowest attendance compared to all other games played during the season, then it's true because 43145 is the smallest number.\n\nBut wait, the original claim says \"all nine game.\" Maybe there were only nine games in week16, but looking at the table, each row corresponds to a single game. So if all nine games refer to some grouping, perhaps the user meant that among all games played during the 1982 season, week16 had the lowest attendance.\n\nIn that case, since 43145 is indeed the smallest attendance figure in the entire season based on the given data, it would be true.\n\nBut wait, how many games were there? Each row is a game, so 16 games listed. So if all nine refers to something else, maybe they meant the first nine games or some other grouping. But without more context, I think it's safest to assume that week16 had the lowest attendance compared to all other games in the season.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be yes, because 43145 is the smallest attendance figure among all the listed weeks.\n</think>\n\nYes, according to the data provided, the Denver Broncos' game on Week 16 of the 1982 season had the lowest attendance with 43,145 fans attending. This was the smallest number compared to all other games listed in the season.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, during Week 16 of the 1982 season, the Denver Broncos had the lowest attendance with 43,145 fans present.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, the team lost 5 more times than they won in Dec.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. They're talking about the 1982 season for the Denver Broncos. So I need to check if in December (Dec) of that year, their losses were five more times than their wins.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The rows are games from different weeks, with each row representing a specific game.\n\nWait, but the claim is about December games in 1982. So I need to find any games that occurred in December 1982. Let me check the 'date' column for entries around that time.\n\nThe table has dates like September 12, 19, and then skipping ahead, November 21, 28, December 5, 12, 19, 26, and January 2. So the games in December would be week 12 on December 5, week 13 on December 12, week 14 on December 19, week 15 on December 26. Wait, but December has 31 days, so up to December 26 is still within December. Then the next game is January 2, which is in week 16.\n\nSo for December games in 1982, we have four games: weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nNow, I need to check the results of these games. The 'result' column shows wins (w) or losses (l), along with the score. So each game's result is either a win or a loss.\n\nLooking at each December game:\n\n- Week 12: They lost to Atlanta Falcons (l 27 - 34)\n- Week 13: They won against Los Angeles Rams (w 27 - 24)\n- Week 14: They lost to Kansas City Chiefs (l 16 - 37)\n- Week 15: They lost to Los Angeles Raiders (l 10 - 27)\n\nSo in December, the Broncos had two losses and one win. Wait, that's only three games in December? Let me recount. Week 12, 13, 14, 15: four games, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if all these games are indeed in December 1982. Yes, they are, as the dates are Dec 5, 12, 19, and 26.\n\nSo in those four games, they lost three times and won once. Wait, that's a total of three losses and one win in December. The claim says they lost five more times than they won. So if wins are 1 and losses are 3, the difference is 2 (3 - 1 = 2), not 5.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"lost 5 more time than they win in Dec.\" So is it referring to total losses minus total wins in December? If that's the case, with three losses and one win, the difference is two. So the claim is saying the difference is five, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's talking about games after a certain point, like in December they lost more than they won by five. But even then, three losses and one win don't add up to a difference of five.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check each game again:\n\nWeek 12: Loss\nWeek 13: Win\nWeek 14: Loss\nWeek 15: Loss\n\nSo that's three losses and one win in December. So wins =1, losses=3. The difference is 2 (losses - wins). So the claim says they lost five more times than they won, which would require a difference of +5 (losses - wins =5). But here it's only +2.\n\nSo the claim is false because in December 1982, the Broncos didn't lose five more games than they won; they lost three and won one, resulting in a two-game difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the data. Let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking at the table rows for December:\n\nRow 12 (week 12): result is l\nRow 13: result is w\nRow14: result is l\nRow15: result is l\n\nYes, that's three losses and one win.\n\nWait, but in week 16, they played on January 2. That's not part of December, so it doesn't count towards the claim.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is incorrect because the number of losses (3) minus wins (1) is 2, not 5. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the December games from the table:\n\n- **Week 12**: Lost\n- **Week 13**: Won\n- **Week 14**: Lost\n- **Week 15**: Lost\n\nThis results in a total of 3 losses and 1 win. The difference (losses - wins) is 2, not 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true based on the provided table. The claim states that they played at Mile High Stadium four more times than at Kingdome and two more times than at Anaheim Stadium.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find relevant information. Let me check the columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance. The key columns here are 'game site' and perhaps 'week', but since the claim is about counts of games at different stadiums, I need to focus on the 'game site' column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Week 1: Mile High Stadium\n2. Week 2: Mile High Stadium\n3. Week 10: Mile High Stadium\n4. Week 11: Jack Murphy Stadium (which is in San Diego, so maybe not relevant)\n5. Week 12: Mile High Stadium\n6. Week 13: Anaheim Stadium\n7. Week 14: Mile High Stadium\n8. Week 15: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\n9. Week 16: Kingdome\n\nWait, the claim is about the number of games at Mile High Stadium compared to Kingdome and Anaheim Stadium.\n\nCounting how many times they played at each:\n\n- Mile High Stadium: Weeks 1,2,10,12,14 \u2192 that's 5 games.\n- Kingdome: Week 16 \u2192 1 game.\n- Anaheim Stadium: Week 13 \u2192 1 game.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"4 more time than at Kingdome\" and \"2 more times than at Anaheim Stadium.\" So according to this count, Mile High has 5, which is 4 more than Kingdome (which has 1) and 4 more than Anaheim (also 1). But the claim specifies \"more time\" in comparison. However, the counts don't match because the numbers are small.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list each game:\n\nLooking at the table rows, each row is a week. So for Mile High Stadium, which rows have 'mile high stadium' as the site?\n\nRow 0: mile high\nRow 1: mile high\nRow 2: mile high\nRow 5: mile high\nRow 7: mile high\nSo that's weeks 1,2,10,12,14 \u2192 total of 5 games.\n\nAnaheim Stadium is only row 6 (week13).\n\nKingdome is row9 (week16).\n\nWait, so Mile High has 5 games. Kingdome has 1, Anaheim has 1.\n\nSo Mile High is 4 more than Kingdome and 4 more than Anaheim. The claim says \"4 more time\" than Kingdome and \"2 more times\" than Anaheim. So that's a discrepancy because according to the table, Mile High is only one more than both (since they have 5 vs 1 each). Wait, no: 5-1=4. So it's four more, not two.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me recheck:\n\nThe claim says \"during the 1982 season, they play at Mile High Stadium 4 more times than Kingdome and 2 more times than Anaheim.\"\n\nBut according to the table, Mile High is played 5 times, Kingdome once, Anaheim once.\n\nSo Mile High:5, Kingdome:1 \u2192 difference of 4. That's correct.\n\nMile High:5, Anaheim:1 \u2192 difference of 4, but the claim says it should be a difference of 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of games at each venue.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Mile High Stadium: rows 0,1,2,5,7 \u2192 total of 5 games.\n- Kingdome: row9 \u2192 1 game.\n- Anaheim Stadium: row6 \u2192 1 game.\n\nSo Mile High has more games than both. The claim says it's four more than Kingdome (correct) and two more than Anaheim (incorrect because the difference is four).\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the difference between Mile High and Anaheim is four, not two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's game site:\n\nRow0: mile high\nRow1: mile high\nRow2: mile high\nRow5: mile high\nRow7: mile high \u2192 that's five games.\n\nAnaheim is only row6: 1 game.\nKingdome is row9: 1 game.\n\nSo differences are correct for Kingdome but not for Anaheim. The claim says two more, but it's actually four more.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because while Mile High has four more games than Kingdome, it doesn't have only two more than Anaheim; it has four more than both.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during the 1982 season, the Denver Broncos played at Mile High Stadium four more times than Kingdome and two more times than Anaheim Stadium. \n\nBy examining the table:\n\n- **Mile High Stadium**: Played 5 times (weeks 1,2,10,12,14)\n- **Kingdome**: Played once (week16)\n- **Anaheim Stadium**: Played once (week13)\n\nThe difference between Mile High and Kingdome is indeed four games, which aligns with the claim. However, the difference between Mile High and Anaheim is also four games, not two as stated in the claim.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is incorrect because the number of games at Mile High Stadium compared to Anaheim Stadium does not match the assertion made.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, week 12, 13, and 14 were played at the Mile High Stadium.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The Broncos had a season in 1982, and specifically, weeks 12, 13, and 14 took place at Mile High Stadium. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from week 1 to week 16 for the 2021 season, which might be confusing because the claim refers to the 1982 season. Wait, that's a problem because the data in the table seems to be for a different year. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nBut regardless of the season discrepancy, I need to check if the games played during weeks 12, 13, and 14 were indeed at Mile High Stadium. So, I should look at each row corresponding to those weeks and see where they were held.\n\nLet me go through the table week by week:\n\n- Week 1: September 12 vs Chargers at Mile High Stadium (record 0-1)\n- Week 2: September 19 vs 49ers at Mile High Stadium (1-1)\n- Week 10: November 21 vs Seahawks at Mile High Stadium (1-2)\n- Week 11: November 28 vs Chargers at Jack Murphy Stadium (1-3)\n- Week 12: December 5 vs Falcons at Mile High Stadium (1-4)\n- Week 13: December 12 vs Rams at Anaheim Stadium (2-4)\n- Week 14: December 19 vs Chiefs at Mile High Stadium (2-5)\n\nWait, the claim is about weeks 12, 13, and 14. So let's check each of those weeks:\n\nWeek 12 game was against Falcons at Mile High Stadium \u2013 that's correct.\nWeek 13 game was against Rams at Anaheim Stadium \u2013 so not Mile High.\nWeek 14 game was against Chiefs again at Mile High Stadium.\n\nSo the claim says all three weeks (12, 13, 14) were played at Mile High. But in reality, week 13 wasn't. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the table might be for a different season, like 2021, which would make the claim about 1982 even more confusing because the data doesn't match the year. However, regardless of that, based on the given data, only weeks 12 and 14 were at Mile High, while week 13 was not.\n\nSo, since two out of the three weeks mentioned were indeed at Mile High Stadium, but one (week 13) wasn't, the claim as a whole is FALSE.

Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, the table's first game is week 1 on September 12, 2021, but the claim refers to 1982. So perhaps the table is a different context. Alternatively, maybe the user made an error in the table's data or the claim's year.\n\nAlternatively, if I ignore the season discrepancy and just check based on the table, since week 13 was at Anaheim Stadium, not Mile High, the claim that all three weeks were played there is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because only two of the three games mentioned took place at Mile High Stadium.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during the 1982 season, weeks 12, 13, and 14 were played at Mile High Stadium.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 1, 2 and 10 be played with the lowest attendance at the Mile High Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's talking about three specific weeks in the 1982 season: weeks 1, 2, and 10. For each of these weeks, it claims that their games had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns include week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The data starts from week 1 in September to week 16 in January. So I need to check for weeks 1, 2, and 10.\n\nLet me go through each of these weeks one by one.\n\nStarting with Week 1:\n- Week: 1\n- Date: September 12\n- Opponent: San Diego Chargers\n- Result: L 3 - 23\n- Game Site: Mile High Stadium\n- Attendance: 73,564\n\nSo, for Week 1, the attendance is 73,564.\n\nMoving to Week 2:\n- Week: 2\n- Date: September 19\n- Opponent: San Francisco 49ers\n- Result: W 24 -21\n- Game Site: Mile High Stadium\n- Attendance: 73,899\n\nSo Week 2 attendance is 73,899.\n\nNext, Week 10:\n- Week: 10\n- Date: November 21\n- Opponent: Seattle Seahawks\n- Result: L 10 -17\n- Game Site: Mile High Stadium\n- Attendance: 73,996\n\nWeek 10's attendance is 73,996.\n\nNow, I need to compare these attendances against each other and see if weeks 1, 2, and 10 indeed had the lowest. Since all three games were at Mile High Stadium, we can compare their attendance numbers directly.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n\nSo the attendances are increasing as the weeks go on. Week 1 has the lowest, followed by Week 2 and then Week 10.\n\nThe claim states that weeks 1, 2, and 10 all had the lowest attendance. But in reality, only Week 1 is the lowest among these. Weeks 2 and 10 have higher attendances than Week 1 but are lower compared to other weeks not mentioned here.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically says \"lowest attendance,\" which would mean each of those weeks had lower than others. However, within the data provided, it's clear that all three games were at Mile High Stadium, and among them, Week 10 has the highest attendance (73,996), which is actually higher than both Week 1 and 2.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"lowest,\" but in reality, the lowest would be Week 1. The other weeks have higher attendances. So the claim is incorrect because it states that all three weeks had the lowest, which isn't true\u2014only Week 1 did.\n\nSo, to verify, I need to see if each of these weeks (1,2,10) has lower attendance than others. But looking at the data, for example, in Week 14, the attendance is 74,192, which is higher than all three mentioned. Similarly, other weeks have even higher numbers, like Week 16 with 43,145, but that's actually lower than some others.\n\nWait, no, Week 16 has a lower attendance than Week 1. So the lowest overall attendance is in Week 16. Therefore, when comparing only weeks 1,2,10, their attendances are higher than Week 16 but lower compared to other weeks not mentioned here.\n\nBut the claim specifically refers to these three weeks as having the lowest. That's incorrect because they aren't; for example, Week 10 has a higher attendance than Week 1 and 2, so it can't be one of the lowest among them.\n\nWait, no\u2014within the data given, the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium is actually in Week 16 with 43,145. So none of the weeks mentioned in the claim are the lowest; only Week 16 is. Therefore, the claim that Weeks 1,2,10 have the lowest is FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider each week individually. The claim says each of those weeks had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium. So for each of those weeks (1,2,10), did their game have lower attendance than any other game in that season? Or does it mean among the games listed in the table?\n\nWait, the table may not include all games from the 1982 season. It starts from Week 1 to Week 16, but maybe there are more weeks missing. However, based on the data given, for each of these three weeks (1,2,10), their attendances are as follows:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n\nSo within the table's data, these are the lowest because other games have higher numbers. For example, Week 14 is 74,192 and Week 16 is 43,145 (lower than all), but since the claim refers to Mile High Stadium only, perhaps the comparison is within the games played at Mile High.\n\nLooking again:\n\nMile High Stadium games:\n\nWeek 1: 73,564\nWeek 2: 73,899\nWeek 10: 73,996\nWeek 11: 47,629 (at different stadium)\nWeek 12: 73,984 (Mile High)\nWeek 13: 48,112 (different)\nWeek 14: 74,192 (Mile High)\nWeek 15: 44,160 (different)\nWeek 16: 43,145 (different)\n\nWait no, Week 16 was at Kingdome, so Mile High Stadium games are only weeks 1,2,10,12,14.\n\nSo among these, the attendances are:\n\n- Week 1:73k\n- Week 2:73.9k\n- Week 10:73.996k (~74k)\n- Week 12: ~74k (same as Week 10?)\nWait no, let me check:\n\nWeek 12 attendance is 73,984.\n\nSo comparing all Mile High games in the table:\n\n1:73,564\n\n2:73,899\n\n10:73,996\n\n12:73,984\n\n14:74,192\n\nSo the lowest among these would be Week 1 with 73,564. Then Week 2 is next at 73,899, followed by Week 12 at 73,984, then Week 10 at 73,996, and finally Week 14 at 74,192.\n\nTherefore, Weeks 1,2,12 have lower attendances than 10 and 14.\n\nSo the claim that Weeks 1,2,10 had the lowest is incorrect because only Week 1 has the lowest; Weeks 2 and 10 have higher attendance numbers compared to each other and compared to some others. So within the Mile High games in the table, Week 1 is the lowest, followed by 2 and 12.\n\nThus, the claim that all three (Weeks 1,2,10) had the lowest is false because only Week 1 did.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect. Among the games at Mile High Stadium listed in the table, only Week 1 has the lowest attendance.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false; only Week 1 had the lowest attendance.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, week 16 had the least amount in attendance of 74192 in all 9 games.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand what data is available. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a specific game with details for that week.\n\nThe claim focuses on two main points:\n1. Week 16 had the least attendance.\n2. This attendance was 74,192 in all 9 games.\n\nI'll start by checking if there is a week 16 in the table. Scanning through the \"week\" column: 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Yes, week 16 exists as the last row in the data.\n\nNext, I'll verify the attendance number for week 16. Looking at the \"attendance\" column for week 16: It's 74,192. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says that this was the least amount in all 9 games. Wait a minute\u2014there are only 8 weeks listed in the table (weeks 1 through 16), but not all weeks might be present. However, the claim specifies \"all 9 game.\" That doesn't quite make sense because the season has 16 weeks, so 9 games being part of that.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpret it. Maybe the user meant to say that week 16 had the least attendance among all 9 games. But looking at the data, there are only 8 games listed in the table, not 9. Alternatively, maybe they meant that week 16 had the lowest attendance compared to other weeks.\n\nLooking at the \"attendance\" column values:\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 11: 47,629 (lower than others)\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 13: 48,112\n- Week 14: 74,192\n- Week 15: 44,160\n- Week 16: 43,145\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The user's claim says \"least amount in attendance of 74192.\" But looking at the data, week 14 has 74,192 and week 16 has 43,145. So the highest attendance is higher, but the lowest would be week 16 with 43,145.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I'm confused now. Let me list all attendances again:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 11: 47,629\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 13: 48,112\n- Week 14: 74,192\n- Week 15: 44,160\n- Week 16: 43,145\n\nSo the lowest attendance is week 16 at 43,145. However, the claim says that week 16 had 74,192 in attendance. That's not matching because week 14 actually has 74,192.\n\nWait a second, this suggests a conflict between the claim and the table. The claim states that week 16 had an attendance of 74,192, but according to the table, it's 43,145. Additionally, looking at the data, week 11 has the lowest attendance at 47,629 and then week 15 at 44,160, followed by week 16 at 43,145.\n\nSo if the claim says that week 16 had the least attendance of 74,192, that's incorrect because both weeks 14 and 16 have higher attendances than others, but week 16 doesn't reach 74k. Wait, no\u2014week 14 is 74,192, which is actually higher than other weeks.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRow 0: attendance 73,564\n\nRow 1: 73,899\n\nRow 2: 73,996\n\nRow 3: 47,629\n\nRow 4: 73,984\n\nRow 5: 48,112\n\nRow 6: 74,192\n\nRow 7: 44,160\n\nRow 8 (week 16): 43,145\n\nSo, the highest attendance is 74,192 in week 14. The lowest is 43,145 in week 16.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that during week 16, the least attendance was 74,192, which doesn't align with the data because that's the highest, not the lowest. Also, the actual attendance for week 16 is 43,145, not 74,192.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"least amount in attendance of 74192.\" That might be a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps they meant that week 16 had the least attendance compared to all other games in the season, which would make it TRUE because it's indeed the lowest with 43,145.\n\nBut looking at the claim again: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season , week 16 have the least amount in attendance of 74192 in all 9 game.\"\n\nSo, first part is correct if we're talking about the lowest. The second part says that this was 74,192. But from the data, week 14 has 74,192, not week 16.\n\nTherefore, there's a discrepancy here. The claim attributes an attendance of 74,192 to week 16, which is incorrect because it actually had 43,145, and another game (week 14) had 74,192.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because:\n- Week 16 does not have an attendance of 74,192; it's lower.\n- The highest attendance was in week 14 at 74,192.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on both counts: it misattributes the attendance to the wrong week and claims it's the least when it's actually one of the higher ones. Wait no, wait\u2014let me clarify:\n\nThe user wrote that in week 16, there was an attendance of 74192 which was the least. But according to the data, week 14 has 74,192, which is higher than others but not the lowest. The lowest is week 16 at 43k.\n\nSo if the claim says that week 16 had the least with 74k attendees, that's incorrect because it actually had lower attendance, and another game had 74k.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because:\n1. It incorrectly states that week 16 had an attendance of 74,192.\n2. It claims this was the least, but in reality, week 14 had a higher number, and week 16 had the lowest.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the user's intent. Maybe they meant to say that week 16 had the least attendance compared to all other games, which is TRUE because it has the lowest attendance. However, the number they provided (74k) is incorrect for week 16; that number applies to another week.\n\nSo in summary, the claim is FALSE because:\n- Week 16 did not have an attendance of 74192.\n- It actually had a lower attendance than other weeks.\n- The claim incorrectly attributes both the attendance number and the ranking to week 16.\n\nTherefore, the task is to explain that the claim is false based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made regarding the Denver Broncos' game in week 16 of the 1982 season is incorrect. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Attendance Figure**: The claim states that the attendance for week 16 was 74,192. However, according to the provided data, week 14 had an attendance of 74,192, not week 16.\n   \n2. **Least Attendance**: While it is true that week 16 had the lowest attendance among the games listed (43,145), the claim incorrectly attributes this number (74,192) to week 16.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is false because it misrepresents both the attendance figure and its ranking for week 16. Week 16 did not have an attendance of 74,192; instead, it had the lowest attendance with 43,145 attendees.",
