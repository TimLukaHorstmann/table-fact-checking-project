    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the team have been called the coquitlam adanacs throughout all 45 seasons since 1965.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each row in the data to see if the team name is consistently \"coquitlam adanacs\" from 1965 onwards. Looking at the table, the first relevant year is 1965 with 30 games, and the team name is listed as \"coquitlam adanacs.\" The next rows for 1966, 1967 also have the same team name. \n\nThen, in 1968, there's a change to \"portland adanacs,\" which is a different team name. So that row would be relevant because it shows a change, but for the claim, I need to check if they were always called coquitlam adanacs. Since they changed in 1968, that year is important.\n\nAfter 1968, starting from 1969 onwards up until 2009, the team name goes back to \"coquitlam adanacs.\" In 2010 and beyond, the data doesn't show any further changes, but since the claim mentions up to 45 seasons, I should check all rows up to that point.\n\nThe last row is the total, which shows 45 seasons. So from 1965 onwards for 45 seasons, most of the time they were called coquitlam adanacs except for 1968. However, the claim says \"throughout all 45 seasons,\" so I need to see if there's any season where the name changed within those 45 years.\n\nIn 1968, which is part of the 45-season span from 1965 onwards, they were called portland adanacs. So that would mean the team wasn't always called coquitlam adanacs during all 45 seasons. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe team's name changed in 1968 to \"portland adanacs,\" contradicting the claim of being consistently named \"coquitlam adanacs\" throughout all 45 seasons.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"Team Name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"1977 / 1978 / 1989 season have more than 26 points, less than 18 games, and exactly 13 losses.\" \n\nFirst, I'll analyze each part of the claim by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nStarting with 1977:\n\nLooking for rows where the season is 1977. Scanning through the data, there's only one row for 1977:\n- Season: 1977\n- Team name: coquitlam adanacs\n- Games: 24\n- Losses: 13\n- Points: 22\n\nSo, points are 22, which is less than 26. Games are 24, which is more than 18 (since the claim says \"less than 18\"). Wait, but 24 is not less than 18; it's actually greater. So this might already make the claim false because the games for 1977 don't meet the condition of being less than 18.\n\nBut let me check all three years to be thorough.\n\nNext, 1978:\n\nSeason: 1978\n- Games: 24\n- Losses: 13\n- Points: 21\n\nPoints are 21 (still less than 26). Games: 24 again. So again, games are more than 18, not meeting the condition of less than 18.\n\nLastly, 1989:\n\nSeason: 1989\nLooking for 1989 in the table:\nWait, I'm scanning through and don't immediately see a row with \"1989\" as the season. Let me check carefully.\n\nThe rows go from 1965 up to 2009. Looking at the list provided, I notice that after 1996 comes 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, etc., but there's no row for 1989 specifically. The closest might be 1988 or 1990, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, in the table provided, the last season listed before \"total\" is 2009. So I don't see a row for 1989. That means there's no data for 1989, so it can't meet any of the conditions.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- For 1977: Points are okay (22 <26), but games are 24 >18 \u2192 doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n- For 1978: Same issue with games being 24.\n- For 1989: No data available, so can't verify.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported. At least one of the years (1977 and 1978) doesn't meet the games condition, and 1989 isn't even in the table.\n\nSo, I'll check which cells are relevant.\n\nFor each year mentioned (1977, 1978, 1989), I need to find their rows. However, since 1989 isn't present, that row doesn't exist. For 1977 and 1978, they do have entries.\n\nI think the columns needed are 'Season', 'Games', 'Losses', and 'Points' for each relevant year. So, for each of those years, we need their respective cells.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- 1977: row_index where season is 1977\n- 1978: row index for 1978\n- 1989: no such row exists\n\nSo, in the table, I can find the indices by scanning through each row. For example, 1977 would be at a certain position, say index x, and 1978 at y.\n\nAssuming that 1977 is at row_index 32 (I'm not sure of exact numbering, but let's say), columns are 'Season', 'Games', 'Losses', 'Points'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor 1977:\n- season: 1977 \u2192 column index maybe 0 or another?\nWait, in the table provided, the first column is Season, then Team name, then Games, Losses, Points. Wait no, looking at the example instruction's JSON, for \"total\" it shows columns as 'row_index', 'column_name'. Wait, actually, the initial table structure is not provided in text but in a code block.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the given table structure.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe table has headers: Season, Team name, Games, Losses, Points. Then there's a total row.\n\nEach season is a row under these columns.\n\nSo for 1977, it would be in the 'Season' column, 'Games', 'Losses', and 'Points' columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor each of the three seasons, their respective rows and columns.\n\nBut since 1989 isn't present, only 1977 and 1978 have data. So I need to include those.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while 1977 and 1978 meet some conditions, they don't meet the games condition (24 >18), and 1989 isn't in the table. Relevant cells are for 1977, 1978, and non-existent 1989.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the coquitlam adanacs have made 1177 points over 45 seasons\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the team in question is \"coquitlam adanacs.\" Looking at the table, I see that all rows except one have this name. Wait, actually, looking closer, most entries are for \"coquitlam adanacs,\" but there's one row where the team name is \"portland adanacs\" in 1968. So that's a different team. The claim is specifically about \"coquitlam adanacs,\" so I should focus on their data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"1177 points over 45 seasons.\" So I need to check if there are 45 seasons where the coquitlam adanacs scored a total of 1177 points.\n\nLooking at the table, the last row is labeled as \"total\" with the values 45 seasons, 1094, 493, and 1177. This seems like a summary row for all the data provided. So the \"points\" column in this row is 1177.\n\nWait, but each season's points are given per row, so each entry in the \"points\" column represents one season. The total of these points across all seasons would be the sum of each team's points per season. However, the table only shows a single total for points as 1177, which is likely the aggregate over all 45 seasons.\n\nSo the claim says that over 45 seasons, they have made 1177 points in total. The \"total\" row shows that the points add up to 1177. Therefore, this seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Each season's points are listed in their respective rows. For example, in 1965, they scored 24 points, and so on. So the sum of all these individual season points should equal 1177, which is what the \"total\" row indicates.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if there are indeed 45 seasons where the total points for the coquitlam adanacs add up to 1177. The last row of the table shows a \"total\" of 45 seasons with points summing to 1177.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n1. The last row, which contains the total data.\n2. The column corresponding to \"points,\" specifically for the total.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the 1977 , 1978 and 1989 season each have less than 26 point, more than 18 game, and exactly 13 loss.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down each part of the claim and check if it holds true against the table.\n\nStarting with the years mentioned: 1977, 1978, and 1989. I need to locate these rows in the table. Looking at the \"season\" column:\n\n- 1977 is row index 13.\n- 1978 is row index 14.\n- 1989 isn't present in the table; the last season listed is 2009.\n\nSo, first issue: 1989 isn't in the table. But maybe it's a typo or I missed it. Scanning through the data, yes, 1989 isn't there. So that already affects part of the claim because one of the years isn't present.\n\nNext, for each relevant row (1977 and 1978), I need to check all three conditions: points <26, games >18, and losses =13.\n\nStarting with 1977:\n- Season: 1977\n- Games: 24\n- Losses: 13\n- Points: 22\n\nSo, points are 22, which is less than 26. That's good.\nGames: 24, which is more than 18? Wait, 24 is more than 18, yes. So that condition holds.\nLosses: Exactly 13, as given. So all three conditions for 1977 are met.\n\nNow 1978:\n- Season: 1978\n- Games: 24\n- Losses: 13\n- Points: 21\n\nPoints: 21 <26, yes.\nGames: 24 >18, yes.\nLosses: 13, exactly. So all conditions hold for 1978 as well.\n\nNow checking 1989:\nSince it's not in the table, I can assume that either the claim is incorrect about this season or perhaps it was included but missed in the data provided. Since it's not present, the third part of the claim fails because one of the required seasons isn't there.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"each have\" so all three need to satisfy the conditions. Since 1989 is missing, that makes the entire claim false because it refers to a season not in the table.\n\nHowever, maybe I should consider if 1989 was mistakenly left out or perhaps the data provided doesn't include every season up to 2009. If the table is supposed to cover all relevant seasons, then yes, 1989 is missing.\n\nTherefore, since 1989 isn't present, the claim can't be fully supported. However, I should check if any of the other two have issues:\n\n1977: All conditions met.\n1978: All conditions met.\nBut 1989 fails because it's not in the table.\n\nSo, the overall claim is partially true for two seasons but includes a third season that doesn't exist in the data. Since all three must satisfy the conditions, the presence of an incorrect or missing season makes the entire claim false.\n\nAdditionally, I should identify which cells are relevant. For 1977 and 1978, their row indices are 13 and 14. The columns needed for each are \"points\", \"games\", and \"losses\". So, the relevant cells would be these three columns for those two rows.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"less than 26 points\" which is a condition on points, so that's one column per row. Then \"more than 18 games\" which is another column. And \"exactly 13 loss,\" which is another column. So each relevant row has three cells: points, games, losses.\n\nThus, for 1977 and 1978, the relevant cells are:\n\n- 1977: row 13, columns points, games, losses.\n- 1978: row 14, same columns.\n- 1989: not present, so no cells to check here.\n\nSo in total, four relevant cells (two rows x three columns). But since 1989 isn't there, maybe we don't include it. However, the claim mentions all three seasons, so even though 1989 is missing, perhaps the user wants us to consider if it's present but incorrect.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should only check against the table. So since 1989 isn't in the table, it can't meet any conditions. Therefore, the answer must be FALSE because not all three seasons are present and meet the criteria.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: The claim says \"each have\" meaning each of those three seasons must satisfy the conditions. Since 1989 is missing, that's a failure. However, maybe I should also consider if the data for 1977 and 1978 is correct as part of the answer.\n\nYes, since two of them are correct but one isn't present, it makes the entire claim incorrect because not all seasons meet the criteria.\n\nSo to sum up:\n\n- Check each season in the claim.\n- For 1977: all conditions met. Relevant cells: points (22), games (24), losses (13).\n- For 1978: same, all conditions met.\n- For 1989: not present. So no relevant cells here.\n\nSince one of the seasons isn't in the table, the claim is incorrect. Therefore, answer is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would be for 1977 and 1978:\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"losses\"}\n]\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n]}",
