    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"minnesota have an attendance of 11921 at the target center\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Minnesota.\" Looking at the table, I see that the team column has entries like \"minnesota,\" \"utah,\" etc. So, Minnesota is one of the teams in the data. That's good because it narrows down which row to check.\n\nNext, the attendance part: the claim says 11,921 attendees at Target Center. I remember that each row in the table includes a location with an attendance number. For example, looking at the first row (game 35), the location is \"target center 11921\" and the score is \"l 108 - 115 (ot).\" The attendance here is listed as 10-25, but wait, that's under the record column? Hmm, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait no, let me check again. Each row has several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, etc., and then two more columns: \"location attendance\" and \"record.\" So for game 35, the location attendance is 11921. That matches the Target Center's attendance figure in the claim.\n\nSo, looking at each row where the team is Minnesota, I need to check if any of them have a location attendance of 11,921 at Target Center. From the table, let me go through each row:\n\n- Game 35: Team is \"minnesota,\" location is \"target center 11921.\" The record is 10 - 25, but the attendance here is 11,921.\n\nWait, the claim says 11,921 attendees. So in this first row, that's exactly what's listed for the location attendance. That seems to match perfectly.\n\nSo the relevant cell would be the \"location attendance\" column in game 35 (row index 0). Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a row where Minnesota played at Target Center with an attendance of 11,921.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as it matches the attendance data for Minnesota's game at Target Center.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
