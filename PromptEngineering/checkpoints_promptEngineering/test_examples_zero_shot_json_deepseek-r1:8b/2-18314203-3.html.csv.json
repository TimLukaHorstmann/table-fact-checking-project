    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Germany is true or false based on the given table. Let me first understand the claim: \"germany have 0 gold's , but 5 silver's.\" I think this means that in the table, Germany has 0 gold medals and 5 silver medals.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. The data is an array of arrays, each representing a country's performance.\n\nI should first locate Germany in the data. Let me go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 0: Brazil\nRow 1: United States\nRow 2: China\nRow 3: Australia\nRow 4: Netherlands\nRow 5: Estonia\nRow 6: Germany - Ah, here we are. So row index is 6.\nLooking at the columns for this row: gold is 0, silver is 5, bronze is 1, total is 6.\n\nSo, according to the table, Germany has 0 gold medals and 5 silver medals. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nNow, I need to check if all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells. The claim mentions both 0 gold and 5 silver, so I should include both columns for verification.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row index 6 for both \"gold\" and \"silver\" columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
