    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nSo, the claim says: \"At Kansas City Chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break this down into parts. The opponent should be the Kansas City Chiefs, it's week 14, and the attendance is 74524. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, for week 14, I need to find the corresponding row in the data.\n\nI'll go through the weeks one by one until I find week 14. Scanning the 'week' column:\n\n- Week 1: September 10\n- Week 2: September 23\n- Week 3: September 30\n- Week 4: October 7\n- Week 5: October 14\n- Week 6: October 21\n- Week 7: October 28\n- Week 8: November 5\n- Week 9: November 11\n- Week 10: November 18\n- Week 11: November 22\n- Week 12: December 2\n- Week 13: December 9\n- Week 14: December 16\n\nSo, week 14 is on December 16. Now, looking at the opponent for week 14.\n\nIn row 14 (since it's week 14), the opponent is listed as \"kansas city chiefs\". Wait, actually, in the data provided, the 14th row has week 14, date December 16, and opponent \"kansas city chiefs\". So that matches.\n\nNext, attendance. The 'attendance' column for week 14 shows 77778. But the claim states the attendance is 74524. That's different. \n\nSo, even though the opponent and the week number match, the attendance doesn't. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that in week 14, the opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs with an attendance of 74,524. However, the table shows for week 14, the attendance is 77,778, not matching the claimed figure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
