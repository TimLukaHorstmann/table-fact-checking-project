    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 Golden Globe\" is TRUE or FALSE by examining the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says that up until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 Golden Globes. So I need to check how many times black actresses have been awarded Golden Globes from the data provided in the table up until the year 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different win or nomination for an actress. The relevant columns seem to be \"year\", \"actor\" (which I assume is the name of the actress), and \"result\" (whether it's a win or a nomination). \n\nI need to focus on rows where:\n1. The year is less than or equal to 2012.\n2. The actor is a black woman.\n3. The result is a \"won\".\n\nSo, I'll go through each row up to the year 2012.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- 1960: Juanita Moore was nominated, not won. Dorothy Dandridge also nominated.\n- 1962: Claudia McNeil nominated.\n- 1968: Beah Richards nominated.\n- 1969: Abbey Lincoln nominated.\n- 1971: Lola Falana nominated.\n- 1973: Diana Ross has two entries. First, she was \"new star - actress\" and won; that's one win. Second entry same year, she was \"best actress - drama\", but only got a nomination. Cicely Tyson also was nominated in this year.\n- 1975: Diahann Carroll was nominated.\n- 1981: Irene Cara was nominated.\n- 1984: Jennifer Beals was nominated.\n- 1986: Oprah Winfrey was nominated, and Whoopi Goldberg was a \"best actress - drama\" nom.\n- 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won for best supporting actress. That's another win.\n- 1993: Whoopi Goldberg was nominated for \"best actress - musical or comedy\". Alfre Woodard also got a nom for supporting.\n- 1994: Angela Bassett won, that's another win.\n- 1997: Marianne Jean-Baptiste was nominated.\n- 1998: Pam Grier was nominated.\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won for supporting actress. That's another win. Also, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated.\n- 2010: Mo'nique won for supporting. Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for drama.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was nominated.\n- 2012: Viola Davis was nominated.\n\nNow, let's count the wins by black actresses up to 2012:\n\n1. Diana Ross in 1973 - one win.\n2. Whoopi Goldberg in 1991 - second win.\n3. Angela Bassett in 1994 - third win.\n4. Jennifer Hudson in 2007 - fourth win.\n5. Mo'nique in 2010 - fifth win.\n\nWait, that's five wins so far. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- In 1973: Diana Ross won once.\n- 1991: Whoopi Goldberg.\n- 1994: Angela Bassett.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson.\n- 2010: Mo'nique.\n\nThat's five total wins by black actresses until 2012. The claim says they have only won 7, so if it's actually 5, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some? Let me double-check each year.\n\nIn 1960-2012, checking each row:\n\n1960: Noms.\n1962: Noms.\n1968: Noms.\n1969: Noms.\n1971: Noms.\n1973: Diana Ross won once. No others in that year.\n1981: Noms.\n1984: Noms.\n1986: Noms.\n1991: Whoopi wins. That's one.\n1993: Noms.\n1994: Angela Bassett wins. Two.\n2002: Noms.\n2003: Noms.\n2007: Jennifer Hudson wins. Three.\n2010: Mo'nique wins. Four.\nWait, that's four, but earlier I thought it was five. Let me recount:\n\n1. Diana Ross (1973) - 1\n2. Whoopi Goldberg (1991) - 2\n3. Angela Bassett (1994) -3\n4. Jennifer Hudson (2007) -4\n5. Mo'nique (2010) -5\n\nWait, that's five wins up to 2012.\n\nSo the claim is that black actresses have only won 7 until 2012, but according to this, it's at least 5. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 48, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 52, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the most common golden globe for a black actress to win be for best support actress.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It suggests that among all the wins by Black actresses at the Golden Globes, the majority are in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various winners and their awards. Each row has details about the year, actor's name, award category, movie, and result (nominated or won). My task is to count how many times a Black actress won in each category and see which category they most commonly won.\n\nI should go through each row where the result is \"won\" and note if the actress is Black. Then, check what award category she won. I need to tally up the categories for Black actresses' wins.\n\nLet me start by identifying all rows where the 'result' is \"won\" and the 'actor' is Black.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. 1960: Juanita Moore - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated (not a win).\n2. 1960: Dorothy Dandridge - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n3. 1962: Claudia McNeil - Best Actress - Drama - Nominated.\n4. 1968: Beah Richards - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated.\n5. 1969: Abbey Lincoln - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated.\n6. 1971: Lola Falana - New Star - Actress - Nominated.\n7. 1973: Diana Ross - New Star - Actress - Won (Black actress, won in \"New Star - Actress\").\n8. 1973: Diana Ross again, but this time for Best Actress - Drama - Nominated.\n9. 1973: Cicely Tyson - Best Actress - Drama - Nominated.\n10. 1975: Diahann Carroll - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n11. 1981: Irene Cara - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n12. 1984: Jennifer Beals - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n13. 1986: Oprah Winfrey - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated.\n14. 1986: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Actress - Drama - Won (Black actress, won in \"Best Actress - Drama\").\n15. 1991: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Supporting Actress - Won (Black actress, won in \"Best Supporting Actress\").\n16. 1993: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n17. 1993: Alfre Woodard - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated.\n18. 1994: Angela Bassett - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Won (Black actress, won in \"Best Actress - Musical/Comedy\").\n19. 1997: Marianne Jean-Baptiste - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated.\n20. 1998: Pam Grier - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n21. 2002: Halle Berry - Best Actress - Drama - Nominated.\n22. 2003: Queen Latifah - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated.\n23. 2007: Jennifer Hudson - Best Supporting Actress - Won (Black actress, won in \"Best Supporting Actress\").\n24. 2007: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles - Best Actress - Musical/Comedy - Nominated.\n25. 2009: Viola Davis - Best Actress - Drama - Nominated.\n26. 2012: Viola Davis - Best Actress - Drama - Nominated.\n27. 2012: Octavia Spencer - Best Supporting Actress - Won (Black actress, won in \"Best Supporting Actress\").\n\nNow, count the number of times a Black actress won:\n\nLooking for 'result' = \"won\":\n\n- Diana Ross (1973): New Star - Actress\n- Whoopi Goldberg (1986): Best Actress - Drama\n- Whoopi Goldberg (1991): Best Supporting Actress\n- Angela Bassett (1994): Best Actress - Musical/Comedy\n- Jennifer Hudson (2007): Best Supporting Actress\n- Octavia Spencer (2012): Best Supporting Actress\n\nThat's 7 wins by Black actresses.\n\nNow, categorize these wins:\n\n- New Star - Actress: 1 (Diana Ross)\n- Best Actress - Drama: 1 (Whoopi Goldberg)\n- Best Supporting Actress: 3 (Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Hudson, Octavia Spencer)\n- Best Actress - Musical/Comedy: 1 (Angela Bassett)\n\nSo the categories are:\n\n- New Star - Actress: 1\n- Best Actress - Drama: 1\n- Best Supporting Actress: 3\n- Best Actress - Musical/Comedy: 1\n\nThe majority category here is Best Supporting Actress with 3 wins. The next highest is Best Actress - Drama and Musical/Comedy each with 1.\n\nSo, the most common award for Black actresses to win is indeed Best Supporting Actress. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the most common golden globe for a black actress to win be for best support actress\" is true, we analyzed the table and identified all instances where Black actresses won awards.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim given is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the longest drought between nomination have be 6 year , between 1962 - 68 and 1975 - 1981.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It seems to say that there was a period of six consecutive years where no one was nominated for an award, specifically from 1962 to 1968 and then again from 1975 to 1981. Wait, actually, looking at the wording again, it says \"between 1962 - 68\" which would be 1962 to 1968 inclusive, making that a 7-year period (from 1962 to 1968). Similarly, \"between 1975 - 1981\" would be 1975 to 1981, which is also a 7-year span. But the claim mentions a \"drought between nomination,\" so I need to check if there were any nominations in those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award nomination with details like year, actor, award category, movie, and result (nominated or won). So for each of these spans (1962-68 and 1975-1981), I need to see if there are any rows where the 'year' falls within those ranges and whether the 'result' is 'nominated.'\n\nLet me start by identifying all rows that fall between 1962 and 1968. Scanning through the data, in row 2 (index 2) the year is 1962, and it's a nomination for best actress - drama. So that's within 1962-68. Then, I need to check if there are any other rows from 1963 to 1967. Checking row indices: \n\nRow 0: 1960\nRow 1: 1960\nRow 2: 1962\nRow 3: 1968 (so that's the end of the first span)\nWait, so from 1962 to 1968, the data includes 1962 and 1968. So the period is 1962-1968 inclusive, which is 7 years.\n\nNow, let me check for any other rows in between. \n\nRow 4: 1968 (nominated)\nRow 5: 1971\nSo, only row 2 and row 4 fall within 1962-1968. Both have 'result' as 'nominated,' so no wins there. So from 1962 to 1968, there are two rows with nominations.\n\nNext, the second period is between 1975-1981. Let's find all rows where year is between 1975 and 1981 inclusive. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 14: 1991 (won)\n...\nWait, let me list them out properly. Starting from row index 0 to higher numbers.\n\nRows with years in 1975-1981:\nRow 9: 1981 (nominated)\nRow 10: 1986\nRow 11: 1986\nRow 12: 1991 (won)\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me count correctly. \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nThe years in order are: \n1960, 1960, 1962, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1973, 1975, 1981, 1986, etc.\n\nWait, I think I might be miscounting. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow index: 0 - 1960\n1 - 1960\n2 - 1962\n3 - 1968\n4 - 1969\n5 - 1971\n6 - 1973\n7 - 1973\n8 - 1975\n9 - 1981\n10 - 1986\n11 - 1986\n12 - 1991\n13 - 2012\n14 - 2012\n15 - 2012\n16 - 2012\n17 - 2012\n18 - 2012\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount the years correctly from the table:\n\nEach row's 'year' is as follows:\n\nRow 0: 1960\n1: 1960\n2: 1962\n3: 1968\n4: 1969\n5: 1971\n6: 1973\n7: 1973\n8: 1975\n9: 1981\n10: 1986\n11: 1986\n12: 1991\n13: 2012\n14: 2012\n15: 2012\n16: 2012\n17: 2012\n18: 2012\n\nSo the years from 1975 to 1981 are:\n\nRow 8: 1975 (nominated)\nRow 9: 1981 (nominated)\n\nSo between 1975 and 1981, there are two rows with 'result' as 'nominated.'\n\nNow, the claim says that the longest drought was six years. But if in each of those periods (1962-68 and 1975-81), there were at least some nominations, then the drought wasn't six years but shorter.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"drought between nomination.\" Maybe it's referring to a period with no nominations. So the claim is that between two points, there was a stretch of six consecutive years without any nominations. \n\nLooking back, from 1962-68: are there any other rows? Let me check again.\n\nFrom row 2 (1962) to row 3 (1968): only those two rows in between. So the period from 1962 to 1968 has some nominations, so no drought there. Similarly, 1975-1981 also have some nominations, so no drought. \n\nWait, but perhaps I need to check if between certain years, like from 1969-1974 or something else, there was a six-year stretch with no nominations.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions 1962-68 and 1975-81 as periods of drought. So according to the table, in both these spans, there are some nominations, so those aren't droughts. Therefore, the claim is false because there wasn't a six-year drought between 1962-68 or 1975-1981; each had at least one nomination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which periods are being considered. Perhaps the user meant the longest stretch where no actor was nominated in consecutive years. But from the data, it's clear that there were nominations every few years, so there wasn't a six-year stretch without any nominations.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that the longest gap between two consecutive nominations is six years. For example, from 1968 to 1975: that's seven years, but during that time, in 1971 and 1973, there were nominations (rows 5 and 6). So even if someone wasn't nominated in a particular year, others were. Therefore, it's not a six-year drought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about two specific periods: from 1962 to 1968 (inclusive) and from 1975 to 1981 (inclusive), stating that those are the longest six-year periods without any nominations. But in both cases, there were nominations during those years, so it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there wasn't a six-year drought between nominations as claimed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's asserting that Whoopi Goldberg is the only recipient of the Best Actress in Drama award and she won it specifically in 1986. So, my task is to check if this is accurate by looking through the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different year, an actor, the award category, the movie title, and whether they were nominated or won. The relevant columns here are \"year,\" \"actor,\" \"award,\" and \"result.\"\n\nI'll focus on the rows where the award is \"best actress - drama\" because the claim is about this specific category.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. 1960: Dorothy Dandridge won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n2. 1962: Claudia McNeil was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n3. 1968: Beah Richards was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n4. 1969: Abbey Lincoln was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n5. 1971: Lola Falana was nominated for New Star - Actress.\n6. 1973: Diana Ross won New Star - Actress and was also nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n7. 1973: Cicely Tyson was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n8. 1975: Diahann Carroll was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n9. 1981: Irene Cara was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n10. 1984: Jennifer Beals was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n11. 1986: Oprah Winfrey was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and Whoopi Goldberg won Best Actress - Drama.\n12. 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won Best Supporting Actress.\n13. 1993: Whoopi Goldberg was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy, and Alfre Woodard was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n14. 1994: Angela Bassett won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n15. 1997: Marianne Jean-Baptiste was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n16. 1998: Pam Grier was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n17. 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n18. 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n19. 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress, and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n20. 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n21. 2010: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress, and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n22. 2011: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n23. 2012: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Actress - Drama, and Octavia Spencer won Best Supporting Actress.\n\nFrom this, I see that Whoopi Goldberg has won the Best Actress - Drama award twice. Once in 1986 and again in 1991. The claim only mentions her winning in 1986, which is true, but it's incomplete because she also won another time.

So, I need to collect data starting from 2000 onwards until 2012.\n\nNext, for each relevant row (from 2000 to 2012), I'll check the 'actor' and 'award' columns. Specifically, I'm interested in whether a black actress was not nominated at all in that year. \n\nLooking through each relevant row:\n\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress, so she was nominated.\n- 2007: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress, so she was nominated.\n- 2010: Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was again nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n- 2012: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n- 2012: Octavia Spencer won Best Supporting Actress, so she was nominated.\n\nFrom this list, it seems that in each of the years from 2000 to 2012, there were black actresses who were either nominated or even won. None of these women had a year where they weren't nominated at all.\n\nWait, but I should check if any of them didn't have an award nomination in their respective years. For example, in 2007, both Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles were nominated. In 2010, Mo'Nique won, so she was definitely nominated. Similarly, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and others all had nominations.\n\nI don't see any year between 2000-2012 where a black actress wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe. Therefore, the claim that there were six such years is false because I only found instances of nominations or wins, not any years without nominations.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that from 2000 to 2012, there were six years where a black actress was not nominated for a Golden Globe. Upon examining each relevant row within this timeframe, all entries show that the listed black actresses either won or were nominated, indicating they were recognized in their respective award categories. Therefore, there are no instances of a year within the specified range where a black actress went without any nomination.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n\nAll rows from row_index 5 (2002) to row_index 18 (2012), focusing on all columns except 'result' as they show whether an award was won or nominated. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"until 2012 , black actor have only won 9 golden globe\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It claims that until 2012, black actors have only won 9 Golden Globes. So I need to check how many times black actors have won the award up to 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different achievement where an actor won or was nominated. The relevant columns for this claim are \"actor\" and \"result\". Specifically, we're interested in cases where the result is \"won\", because that's when they actually received the award.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to see if it involves a black actor winning a Golden Globe until 2012.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Row 0: Juanita Moore won \"best supporting actress\" for \"imitation of life\" in 1960. She's black. So that's one win.\n2. Row 1: Dorothy Dandridge was nominated for \"best actress - musical or comedy\", but she didn't win. Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: Claudia McNeil was nominated for \"best actress - drama\". Black, but only a nomination. Not a win.\n4. Row 3: Beah Richards won \"best supporting actress\" in 1968. Another black actor with a win. Total now 2.\n5. Row 4: Abbey Lincoln also won \"best supporting actress\" in 1969. That's another, making it 3.\n6. Rows 5-11: These are from 1971 to 1986. Looking at these:\n   - Lola Falana was nominated in 1971. Not a win.\n   - Diana Ross was both nominated (row 6) and won \"new star\" in 1973, but that's acting category? Wait, no\u2014looking at row 7, she was also nominated for \"best actress - drama\", so another nomination.\n   - Cicely Tyson was nominated in 1973. Not a win.\n   - Diahann Carroll, Irene Cara, Jennifer Beals: all nominations.\n   - Oprah Winfrey was only in 1986, but as supporting actress and got a nomination, not a win.\n   So from here, Diana Ross won in row 7: \"new star - actress\" category. That's another win for a black actor, making it 4.\n\nWait, no\u2014row 7 is Diana Ross winning \"new star - actress\". She was also in another row (row 8) as a nominee for \"best actress - drama\", so that adds one more win. So now total is 3 wins up to 1973? Let me recount:\n\n- Juanita Moore: 1960, Win\n- Beah Richards: 1968, Win\n- Abbey Lincoln: 1969, Win\n- Diana Ross (new star - actress): 1973, Win\n\nSo that's four by 1973.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 12: Whoopi Goldberg won in 1991 for \"best supporting actress\". That's fifth win.\nRow 14: She was also nominated in 1993 for \"best actress - musical or comedy\".\nRow 15: Alfre Woodard was nominated, not a win.\nRow 20: Angela Bassett won in 1994. Sixth win.\n\nRows after that up to 2012:\n- Row 25: Viola Davis was nominated in 2012.\n- Row 26: Octavia Spencer won \"best supporting actress\" in 2012. That's the seventh win for a black actor.\n\nSo by 2012, how many wins do we have? Let me list them:\n\n1. Juanita Moore - 1960\n2. Beah Richards - 1968\n3. Abbey Lincoln - 1969\n4. Diana Ross - 1973 (new star)\n5. Whoopi Goldberg - 1991\n6. Angela Bassett - 1994\n7. Octavia Spencer - 2012\n\nWait, that's seven wins up to and including 2012.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 9\". So if there are only 7 by 2012, then the claim is false because it claims only 9 but actually more have won before 2012? Wait, no\u2014up to 2012, I think we've found at least seven. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. For example, let's see each row where \"result\" is \"won\":\n\nRow 0: Juanita Moore\nRow 3: Beah Richards\nRow 4: Abbey Lincoln\nRow7: Diana Ross (new star)\nRow12: Whoopi Goldberg\nRow20: Angela Bassett\nRow26: Octavia Spencer\n\nThat's seven.\n\nBut wait, are there any others in the table up to 2012? Let me check each row beyond row 26.\n\nLooking at rows after 26:\n\nRows 27-33 are from 2011-2012. These include Halle Berry and Viola Davis being nominated but not winning.\n\nSo total wins by black actors until 2012: seven.\n\nThe claim says \"until 2012, black actor have only won 9 golden globe\". If it's seven, then the claim is false because they haven't only won nine\u2014they've already surpassed that number. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I might have missed some rows. Let me check again:\n\nRows up to 2012:\n\n- Row0: Juanita Moore - 1960 (win)\n- Row3: Beah Richards - 1968 (win)\n- Row4: Abbey Lincoln - 1969 (win)\n- Row7: Diana Ross - 1973 (win)\n- Row12: Whoopi Goldberg -1991 (win)\n- Row20: Angela Bassett -1994 (win)\n- Row26: Octavia Spencer -2012 (win)\n\nThat's seven. So the claim is wrong because it says only nine, but there are at least seven before 2012.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some in between? Let me go through each row:\n\nRow5: Lola Falana was nominated.\nRow6: Diana Ross was nominated again for \"best actress - drama\".\nRow7: She won \"new star\" category.\nRow8: Cicely Tyson nominated.\nRow9: Diahann Carroll nominated.\nRow10: Irene Cara nominated.\nRow11: Jennifer Beals nominated.\nRow12: Whoopi Goldberg won.\nRow13-19: Nominations only.\nRow20: Angela Bassett won.\nRows21-25: Nominations.\nRow26: Octavia Spencer won.\n\nSo yes, seven wins up to 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it says \"only 9\" but there are at least seven. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that until 2012, black actors have only won nine Golden Globes. However, upon reviewing the table, we find that black actors had already achieved seven wins by 2012. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"there be more than 2 drought spell span more than 6 year where black actoresses get no nomination.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it.\n\nFirst, I think the user might have meant something like \"there be more than two consecutive periods of over six years where Black actresses received no nominations.\" So, checking for multiple times when Black actresses were not nominated for certain categories.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about actors, their category, the movie, and whether they were nominated or won. The columns are year, actor, award, motion picture, result.\n\nI need to check if there are more than two periods of six consecutive years where Black actresses didn't get a nomination in any of those years. So, I should look for times when a Black actress was either not nominated or perhaps never got a nomination in a stretch of over six years.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table, most entries are individual years with specific nominations. For example, in 2010, Mo'nique won for best supporting actress, while Gabourey Sidibe was nominated but didn't win for best actress-drama. So, each row is an individual instance, not a span.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It might be referring to periods when Black actresses were not receiving any nominations in their respective categories. So, looking for consecutive years where no Black actress was nominated in specific award categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about times when multiple Black actresses from different movies or same movie didn't get nominations in a certain category within the same period of six years.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all instances where a Black actress was either not nominated or if she didn't win, but that might not be relevant. The claim is about no nomination, so it's when they didn't get a nomination in an award category.\n\nLooking through the table, I see many entries for Black actresses who were either nominated or won awards. For example:\n\n- In 1973, Diana Ross won Best Actress-Drama.\n- In 1994, Angela Bassett won for Best Actress-Musical/Comedy.\n- In 2010, Mo'nique won Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBut the claim is about when they didn't get a nomination. So, I need to find instances where Black actresses weren't nominated at all in an award category during a span longer than six years.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I don't see any instances where a Black actress didn't receive a nomination. Most of them were either nominated or won. For example:\n\n- In 1986, Oprah Winfrey was not winning but she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- Whoopi Goldberg was often nominated and sometimes won.\n\nWait, let me check each row to see if any Black actresses weren't even nominated in their respective award categories.\n\nLooking through the data, I don't find a single instance where a Black actress wasn't nominated. They were either \"nominated\" or \"won.\" So, for example:\n\n- In 2010, Mo'nique won, so she was nominated.\n- Gabourey Sidibe was nominated in 2010 as well.\n- Viola Davis was nominated in 2012.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is FALSE because there are no instances of Black actresses not getting a nomination. Therefore, there can't be more than two spans of over six years where this happened because it didn't happen at all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table doesn't show any entries where an actress was neither nominated nor won; they were either \"nominated\" or \"won.\" So, no instance of non-nomination exists. Therefore, the claim is based on a false premise because there are zero such instances.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that there are multiple spans of over six years where Black actresses received no nominations. However, upon examining the table, all entries show that these actresses were either nominated or won awards. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win best actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then analyze the table accordingly.\n\nFirst, the claim refers to the least common Golden Globe win in the category of Best Actress by a Black actress. It's important to note that \"least common\" implies that this situation doesn't often happen. So I'm looking for instances where a Black actress won Best Actress at the Golden Globes. If such instances are rare, the claim might be TRUE; if they are more common, it would be FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award win or nomination with details like year, actor, award category, movie, and result (won or nominated). The relevant columns for this analysis are \"year,\" \"actor,\" \"award,\" and \"result.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to identify any Black actresses who won Best Actress. Let's list them out:\n\n1. **1973: Diana Ross** - She won in the category of New Star - Actress. This isn't Best Actress, so it doesn't apply.\n2. **1984: Jennifer Beals** - Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n3. **1994: Angela Bassett** - Won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy. This is a win by a Black actress in the primary Best Actress category.\n4. **2010: Mo'Nique** - Won Best Supporting Actress, which isn't the main Best Actress category.\n5. **2007: Jennifer Hudson** - Won Best Supporting Actress, same as above.\n6. **2010: Gabourey Sidibe** - Nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n\nFrom this list, I see that Angela Bassett won Best Actress in 1994 and there might be others like Whoopi Goldberg who have been nominated but didn't win. However, the key point is whether a Black actress has won the primary Best Actress award, which Angela Bassett did. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because it's not as uncommon as implied.\n\nWait, actually, if at least one Black actress has won Best Actress (Angela Bassett), then the statement that \"the least common\" would imply it's rare, but since there is at least one instance, the claim is FALSE because it's not as rare as suggested.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win best actress\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table for instances where Black actresses won Best Actress awards. \n\n1. **Angela Bassett (1994)**: She won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy, making such wins at least possible.\n2. **Diana Ross (1973)**: She won New Star - Actress, which isn't the main category.\n\nSince there is at least one instance of a Black actress winning Best Actress, the claim that it's the \"least common\" is incorrect because it doesn't happen as rarely as suggested.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the award for best actress in comedy have only been won by whoopi goldberg in 1988.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It's making two main points: \n1. The award in question is specifically for \"best actress in comedy.\"\n2. Only Whoopi Goldberg has won this award, and she did so in 1988.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award win or nomination with details about the year, actor, award category, movie, and result (won or nominated). The columns are: year, actor, award, motion picture, result.\n\nI'll need to find rows where the award is \"best actress in comedy\" because that's a key part of the claim. Then, check if any other actors besides Whoopi Goldberg have won this award.\n\nStarting by filtering the table for the award category \"best actress - musical or comedy.\" Looking through each row:\n\n- 1960: Dorothy Dandridge - best actress - musical or comedy, nominated.\n- 1962: Claudia McNeil - best actress - drama, nominated.\n- 1968: Beah Richards - best supporting actress, nominated. Not relevant because it's not the main category in question.\n- 1969: Abbey Lincoln - best supporting actress, nominated.\n- 1971: Lola Falana - new star - actress, nominated.\n- 1973: Diana Ross won as \"new star - actress,\" and also nominated for \"best actress - drama.\"\n- 1975: Diahann Carroll - best actress - musical or comedy, nominated.\n- 1981: Irene Cara - best actress - musical or comedy, nominated.\n- 1984: Jennifer Beals - best actress - musical or comedy, nominated.\n- 1986: Oprah Winfrey - best supporting actress, nominated; Whoopi Goldberg won \"best actress - drama\" for The Color Purple.\n- 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won \"best supporting actress.\"\n- 1993: Whoopi Goldberg was nominated for \"best actress - musical or comedy\" (Sister Act).\n- 2002: Halle Berry - best actress - drama, nominated.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah - best supporting actress, nominated.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won as \"best supporting actress\"; Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for \"best actress - musical or comedy.\"\n- 2009: Viola Davis - best supporting actress, nominated.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won \"best supporting actress\"; Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for \"best actress - drama.\"\n- 2011: Halle Berry - best actress - drama, nominated.\n- 2012: Viola Davis - best actress - drama, nominated; Octavia Spencer won \"best supporting actress.\"\n\nFrom this, I see that Whoopi Goldberg has won in two categories: \n- In 1991, she won \"best supporting actress\" for \"Ghost.\"\n- In 1986, she was part of \"The Color Purple,\" winning \"best actress - drama.\"\n\nWait, the claim says she won \"best actress in comedy.\" Looking back, when was Whoopi Goldberg ever awarded \"best actress in comedy\"? From the table, I don't see her winning that category. She was nominated for it in 1993 (\"Sister Act\") but didn't win. \n\nAlso, checking other actors: \n- Marianne Williamson (not in the table), maybe? But from the table, I don't see any others besides possibly Diahann Carroll or Irene Cara, who were nominees but not winners.\n\nWait, no, Diahann Carroll was nominated in 1975 but didn't win. Irene Cara in 1981 was also a nominee. So perhaps the award hasn't been won by anyone else except Whoopi Goldberg in comedy? But from the table, she didn't win that category.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: The claim says \"best actress in comedy\" and \"only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988.\" From the table, I don't see an entry where Whoopi won \"best actress - musical or comedy\" in 1988. She was nominated for it in 1993 but didn't win. In 1986, she won \"best actress - drama.\"\n\nSo maybe the claim is incorrect because:\n1. The award category might not have been won by anyone else besides Whoopi, but based on the table, she didn't actually win it.\n2. She didn't win it in 1988; that seems like a made-up year.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to check if the claim is fully supported. So I need to see if any other actors won \"best actress - musical or comedy\" besides Whoopi.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- In row 1993, Whoopi was nominated but didn't win.\n- No one else in the table has won that category except maybe someone not listed here, like perhaps Marianne Williamson? But from the table, it's only up to Octavia Spencer in 2012. So within this data, no one else besides Whoopi has won \"best actress - musical or comedy.\" However, she didn't win it either; she was only nominated once.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"have only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988.\" But from the table, I don't see her winning that award at all. So perhaps the claim is false because she didn't actually win that category, and no one else did either. Or maybe the claim is incorrect because it's claiming she did win it when she didn't.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. The claim says the award for best actress in comedy has only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988. From the table:\n\n- The closest is in 1993 where she was nominated but not won.\n- No one else seems to have won it either.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is false because no one has won that award, including Whoopi Goldberg. Alternatively, if someone else had won it, then the claim would also be false.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see any row where an actor won \"best actress - musical or comedy.\" So maybe the claim is incorrect because the award hasn't been won by anyone yet, let alone only Whoopi.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" or something else, but as per the table and the claim's wording, it's \"best actress in comedy.\"\n\nWait, the column name for the award is \"award\", which in some rows is \"best supporting actress,\" others are \"best actress - drama,\" etc. So perhaps the exact category varies.\n\nIn that case, I need to check if any row has the award as \"best actress in comedy.\" From the table provided:\n\nLooking at each row's \"award\" column:\n\n- 1960: best actress - musical or comedy\n- 1962: best actress - drama\n- 1968: best supporting actress\n- 1969: best supporting actress\n- 1971: new star - actress\n- 1973: two entries, one for Diana Ross as \"new star - actress\" and another as \"best actress - drama\"\n- 1975: best actress - musical or comedy\n- 1981: best actress - musical or comedy\n- 1984: best actress - musical or comedy\n- 1986: two entries: Oprah as best supporting actress and Whoopi as best actress - drama\n- 1991: best supporting actress\n- 1993: best actress - musical or comedy (nomination for Whoopi)\n- 2007: best supporting actress and best actress - musical or comedy (Beyonc\u00e9 nominated)\n- Others are either best supporting or different categories.\n\nSo, the \"best actress in comedy\" would correspond to \"best actress - musical or comedy.\" Now, looking at that:\n\n- In 1960: Dorothy Dandridge was a nominee.\n- In 1975: Diahann Carroll was a nominee.\n- In 1981: Irene Cara was a nominee.\n- In 1984: Jennifer Beals was a nominee.\n- In 1993: Whoopi Goldberg was a nominee but not winner.\n- In 2007: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was a nominee.\n\nSo, from the table, no one has actually won \"best actress - musical or comedy.\" So the claim that this award has only been won by Whoopi is false because no one has won it yet. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if the user meant \"Best Supporting Actress,\" but as per the column, in 1960, it's best leading actress in musical/comedy, which might be a different award.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- The claim is that \"the award for best actress in comedy has only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988.\"\n- From the table provided, no one has actually won \"best actress - musical or comedy\" category.\n- Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it claims a victory where none exists.\n\nAdditionally, even if someone had won it, 1988 isn't reflected in any of the rows provided, which go up to 2012. So that part also doesn't check out.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the award for best actress in comedy has only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988\" is incorrect. Based on the provided data, no actor has won the \"best actress - musical or comedy\" category. Additionally, there is no record of Whoopi Goldberg winning this award in 1988; she was only nominated for it in 1993.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because no actor has won the \"best actress - musical or comedy\" award as per the provided data, and Whoopi Goldberg did not win this award in 1988.",

    "claim": "between 2001 and 2011 there be 5 year where a black actress be not nominate for any award",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"Between 2001 and 2011, there be 5 years where a black actress was not nominated for any award.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand the task. I have a JSON table with data about various actors, their awards, movies, and results. My job is to check between 2001-2011 if there are exactly five years where no black actress was nominated.\n\nI'll start by identifying all relevant rows that fall within this time frame. Looking at the \"year\" column, I need to find entries from 2001 to 2011 inclusive. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 18: 1997 (not in range)\n- Row 19: 1998\n- Row 20: 2002\n- Row 21: 2003\n- Row 22: 2007\n- Row 23: 2009\n- Row 24: 2010\n- Row 25: 2011\n- Row 26: 2012 (not in range)\nWait, but I think the rows are from 1960 up to 2012. So within 2001-2011, we have 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. That's six years: 2002,03,07,09,10,11.\n\nNow, for each of these rows (2002 to 2011), I need to check if any black actress was not nominated for an award in that year. If there are five such years where no black actresses were nominated, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: The claim says \"5 years where a black actress was NOT nominated.\" So, we need to count how many years between 2001-2011 had at least one black actress not getting any award. Or does it mean that in those five years, there were no black actresses nominated at all? I think it's the latter: five years where zero black actresses were nominated.\n\nSo for each of these six years (2002,03,07,09,10,11), I need to check how many black actresses were nominated. If a year has zero black actresses nominated, that counts towards our total.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n1. 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for \"Monster's Ball\" as Best Actress - Drama. So there's one black actress nominated in 2002. Therefore, this doesn't count as a year where no black actress was nominated.\n\n2. 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for \"Chicago.\" Again, at least one black actress was nominated. So not counted.\n\n3. 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress for \"Dreamgirls,\" and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated in the musical/comedy category. Two black actresses were recognized, so this year counts towards nominations but doesn't count as a non-nomination year.\n\n4. 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Doubt.\" So another year with at least one nomination.\n\n5. 2010: Mo'Nique won for Best Supporting Actress in \"Precious,\" and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated as Best Actress - Drama. Two black actresses here, so not counted.\n\n6. 2011: Halle Berry was nominated again for \"Frankie and Alice.\" So that's another year with a nomination.\n\nWait, but all these years (2002-2011) in the table have at least one black actress being nominated or winning an award. Therefore, there are zero years between 2001-2011 where no black actresses were nominated. That would mean the claim is FALSE because it claims there are five such years.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the data. Let me double-check each year:\n\n- 2002: Halle Berry (nominated)\n- 2003: Queen Latifah (nominated)\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n- 2009: Viola Davis\n- 2010: Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe\n- 2011: Halle Berry\n\nSo all six years have at least one black actress nominated or winning. Therefore, the claim that there are five years where no black actresses were nominated is FALSE because none of these years meet that criterion.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}, {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}, {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}, {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}, {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}]}",
