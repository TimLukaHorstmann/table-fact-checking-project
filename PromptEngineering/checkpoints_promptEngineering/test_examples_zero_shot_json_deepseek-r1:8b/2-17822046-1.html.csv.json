    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false and identify which cells are relevant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film.\" So, it's asserting that none of the Latvian submissions were nominated in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are:\n- year (ceremony)\n- film title used in nomination\n- original title\n- director\n- result\n\nThe data rows contain information about different films submitted by Latvia for various ceremonies. Each row has a 'result' which can be \"not nominated\" or \"tbd\" (to be determined).\n\nMy goal is to check each row's result column to see if any of them are \"nominated.\" If all results are either \"not nominated\" or \"tbd,\" then the claim holds true. Otherwise, it would be false.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **1992 (65th)**: Result is \"not nominated.\"\n2. **2008 (81st)**: Result is \"not nominated.\"\n3. **2010 (83rd)**: Result is \"not nominated.\"\n4. **2012 (85th)**: Result is \"not nominated.\"\n5. **2013 (86th)**: Result is \"tbd.\"\n\nWait, the last row's result is \"tbd.\" The term \"tbd\" usually means \"to be determined,\" which implies that as of now, it's not known if they were nominated or not. So technically, there isn't a definitive \"not nominated\" verdict here.\n\nHowever, since \"tbd\" doesn't indicate a nomination, and the claim is about \"none being nominated,\" the presence of \"tbd\" could be interpreted differently. But in the context of such claims, if a result isn't explicitly stated as \"nominated,\" it's safer to consider it as not supporting the claim.\n\nWait, actually, no. The claim says none were nominated. If a submission is still \"tbd,\" does that mean it hasn't been decided yet, but could be nominated? That would contradict the claim. Therefore, if any row doesn't have an explicit \"not nominated\" result, especially if it's still pending (\"tbd\"), the claim might not hold true.\n\nBut I need to clarify: is \"tbd\" equivalent to not being nominated? Or does it mean that the submission was considered for nomination but hasn't yet been decided? This is a bit ambiguous. However, in many contexts, \"tbd\" can imply that a decision has not yet been made, so it's still possible for it to be nominated.\n\nGiven that, since one of the rows has a result of \"tbd,\" which could mean they are still under consideration and might be nominated in the future, the claim that none have been nominated isn't entirely true. Therefore, the claim is false because there's an unresolved case where nomination is possible.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"none of the latvian submission be nominated.\" So if a submission is pending (\"tbd\"), it hasn't been confirmed as not nominated yet. Therefore, the statement could be incorrect because that particular submission might still end up being nominated.\n\nAlternatively, if \"tbd\" means they weren't nominated but the result just hasn't been updated yet, then it would support the claim. But I think more likely, \"tbd\" implies that a decision is pending, so the film could have been nominated but not yet confirmed or denied.\n\nSo, in this case, since one of the submissions has a \"tbd\" status, which suggests that they might have been considered for nomination, the claim that none were nominated isn't entirely accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: the \"result\" column is critical because it shows whether each submission was not nominated. However, since one of them is \"tbd,\" which might indicate a pending decision, I need to include all the \"result\" columns as they are directly related to verifying the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be all rows in the \"result\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check each row's 'result' for an explicit \"not nominated.\" The last row has \"tbd,\" indicating a pending decision. Since this could imply potential nomination, the claim that none were nominated is not fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submit 1 year after the other.\" So it's saying that these two films were submitted one year apart.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the film titles match \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" \n\nLet me scan each row:\n\n- Row 0: The film title is \"the child of man.\" Not matching.\n- Row 1: \"defenders of riga.\" No match.\n- Row 2: \"hong kong confidential.\" Nope.\n- Row 3: \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" That's one of them. So this row has that film, which was submitted in 2012 (85th ceremony).\n  \n- Row 4: The first entry is \"mother , i love you.\" That's the second film mentioned in the claim, submitted in 2013 (86th).\n\nNow, I need to check if these two films were indeed submitted one year apart. Let's see:\n\n- \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" was submitted in 2012.\n- \"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013.\n\nSo that's exactly a one-year difference.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"2 of the 5 films be directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\" Let me go through the table step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row and check who the director is for each film. The columns in the table are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. I'm interested in the director column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLooking at the first row, the director is \"j\u0101nis strei\u016bds.\" That name doesn't match J\u0101nis Nords, so this isn't relevant for our claim.\n\nSecond row: The director is \"aigars grauba.\" Again, not matching J\u0101nis Nords. So, no relevance here either.\n\nThird row: Director is \"m\u0101ris martinsons.\" Not the same as J\u0101nis Nords. Moving on.\n\nFourth row: Director is \"yevgeni pashkevich.\" Still different from J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nFifth row: Here we have the director listed as \"j\u0101nis nords.\" That's exactly who the claim refers to. So, this is one film directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are only two films directed by him. From the table, only one film in the fifth row is directed by J\u0101nis Nords. The fourth row's director is different, and the other rows don't match either. So, that means only one film out of five is directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nTherefore, the claim says two films are directed by him, but according to the table, it's actually only one. That makes the claim false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find where \"Defenders of Riga\" is mentioned. From the table's data, the second row (row_index 1) has the film title used in nomination as \"defenders of riga\". So that's relevant.\n\nNext, I need to check when it was submitted and if there was a previous submission for the same film more than a decade earlier. Looking at the table columns, I see \"year (ceremony)\" and \"original title\" might be useful here. The original title for row 1 is \"r\u016bgas sargi\", which is Latvian for \"Defenders of Riga\". \n\nNow, checking previous submissions: looking through all rows to see if any other film with an original title matching \"defenders of riga\" exists before 2008 (the year in question). Scanning each row's original title:\n\n- Row 0: cilv\u0115ka b\u0101rs \u2013 doesn't match.\n- Row 1: r\u016bgas sargi \u2013 matches, but that's the one in question.\n- Rows 2 and beyond don't seem to have a matching original title for \"defenders of riga\" before 2008.\n\nSo, there was no previous submission more than a decade earlier.

The data has five rows, each representing a submission. I'll go through each row to check for Latvian submissions.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Year: 1992 (65th)\n- Film title: \"the child of man\"\n- Original title: \"cilv\u0101rns\" [Latvian]\n- Director: J\u0101nis Streidz\n- Result: Not nominated\n\nSo, this is a Latvian submission, but it wasn't nominated.\n\nSecond row:\n- Year: 2008 (81st)\n- Film title: \"defenders of riga\"\n- Original title: \"R\u012bgas sargi\" [Latvian]\n- Director: Aigars Grauba\n- Result: Not nominated\n\nAnother Latvian submission that wasn't nominated.\n\nThird row:\n- Year: 2010 (83rd)\n- Film title: \"hong kong confidential\"\n- Original title: \"Amaya\" [Latvian]\n- Director: M\u0101ris Martinsons\n- Result: Not nominated\n\nThis is another Latvian submission, but again, not nominated.\n\nFourth row:\n- Year: 2012 (85th)\n- Film title: \"gulf stream under the iceberg\"\n- Original title: \"Golfa straume zem ledus kalna\" [Latvian]\n- Director: Yevgeni Pashkevich\n- Result: Not nominated\n\nAnother submission, not nominated.\n\nFifth row:\n- Year: 2013 (86th)\n- Film title: \"mother , i love you\"\n- Original title: \"Mamma , es tevi m\u016bblu\" [Latvian]\n- Director: J\u0101nis Nords\n- Result: TBD (To Be Determined)\n\nThis submission's result isn't known yet, so it's still pending.\n\nNow, the claim is about two submissions being nominated.

The data has five rows, each representing a film's details.\n\nThe claim is about directors, specifically Aigars Grauba. So, I should focus on the \"director\" column to see how many times his name appears.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Director is \"j\\u0101nis strei\\u010ds\".

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"mother , i love you and defender of riga be submitted 1 year after the other.\" That seems like it's talking about two films being submitted a year apart. So I need to check if these two films were indeed submitted a year apart in their submission years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a film entry with details like the ceremony year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. The columns are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nFirst, I need to find the entries for \"mother , i love you\" and \"defender of riga.\" \n\nStarting with \"defender of riga\": Scanning through the data, row 1 has the film title \"the child of man,\" row 2 is \"defenders of riga\". Wait, in the data array, the second row (index 1) is [\"2008 (81st)\", \"defenders of riga\", \"r\\u012bgas sargi\", \"aigars grauba\", \"not nominated\"]. So that's the film \"Defenders of Riga\" submitted in 2008.\n\nNext, looking for \"mother , i love you.\" The fifth row (index 4) is [\"2013 (86th)\", \"mother , i love you\", \"mammu , es tevi m\\u012blu\", \"j\\u0101nis nords\", \"tbd\"]. So that film was submitted in 2013.\n\nNow, the claim states they were submitted one year apart. Let's see: If \"Defenders of Riga\" was in 2008 and \"Mother , I Love You\" was in 2013, that's a five-year gap, not one year. Therefore, the claim seems false based on the years.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the titles and ensure I'm looking at the correct films.\n\nYes, row 1: \"defenders of riga\" submitted in 2008 (81st ceremony), row 4: \"mother , i love you\" submitted in 2013 (86th). The difference is five years. So the claim that they were submitted one year apart is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to find which cells are relevant. The claim mentions two films, so I need their respective rows and columns.\n\nFor \"defenders of riga,\" it's row index 1, column \"film title used in nomination.\" For \"mother , i love you,\" it's row index 4, same column. Additionally, the year (ceremony) is needed to check the time difference, so I should include those cells as well.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include entries for both films' titles and their years.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me first read and understand the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"5 Latvian films in 11 years be submitted for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film.\" \n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists films that were nominated for an award but didn't get it. Each row has details like the year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result which is \"not nominated.\"\n\nI need to check if there are 5 Latvian films from any 11 consecutive years submitted for the Best Foreign Language Film category, meaning they were nominated but not winning.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row to see how many Latvian films are listed. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. First row: \"the child of man\" \u2013 original title is \"cilv\u0101ka b\u016bris\". Director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. Result: Not nominated.\n2. Second row: \"Defenders of Riga\" \u2013 original title is \"R\u012bgas Sargi\". Director Aigars Grauba. Not nominated.\n3. Third row: \"Hong Kong Confidential\" \u2013 original title is \"Amaya\". Director M\u0101ris Martinsons. Not nominated.\n4. Fourth row: \"Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg\" \u2013 original title \"Golfa Straume zem ledus kalna\". Director Yevgeni Pashkevich. Not nominated.\n5. Fifth row: \"Mother, I Love You\" \u2013 original title \"Mamma, es tevi m\u016bblu\". Director J\u0101nis Nords. Result is TBD.\n\nWait, the fifth row's result is listed as \"tbd,\" which might mean it's still to be determined or not yet known, but in this context, probably not nominated since the others are \"not nominated.\" So maybe all five films were submitted and didn't get the award.\n\nNow, the claim is about 5 Latvian films over 11 years. The table has five entries, each from different years: 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. That's a span of more than 10 years (from 1992 to 2013 is 21 years). But the claim says \"in 11 years,\" so maybe it refers to any consecutive 11-year period.\n\nLooking at each film's year:\n\n- 1992\n- 2008: 16 years after 1992.\n- 2010, 2012, 2013: These are within a shorter span of about 3-4 years from 2010 onwards.\n\nWait, maybe the films were submitted in consecutive 11-year periods. For example, if we look at two sets of five films each, but I don't think that's the case here. The table has only five films, so it's possible they are spread out over more than 11 years.\n\nBut the claim says \"5 Latvian film in 11 year be submit.\" So perhaps within any 11-year period, there were 5 submissions from Latvia.\n\nLooking at the table, each film is listed with a different year. The earliest is 1992 and the latest is 2013. That's 21 years apart, which is way more than 11 years. Therefore, it's not possible that all five films were submitted within any 11-year span.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to having at least five submissions in the past 11 years, but from the table, only one film was submitted in 2010, another in 2012, and two more recently (assuming 2013 is recent). But the table doesn't have enough data beyond that. It only lists up to 2013.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about the total number of submissions in any 11-year period being five. So, looking at all the years in the table: 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013. If we group them into possible 11-year windows, do any window contain exactly five films? Let's see.\n\nFor example, let's take from 2003 to 2014 (12 years). In the table, we have 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. That's four films in an 11-year period (from 2008 to 2013 would be 6 years, but maybe a longer window). So that's not five.\n\nAnother possible window: 2002-2013 (12 years). Again, same as above, only five films but spread over more than 11 years. It doesn't fit into any single 11-year span having exactly five.\n\nSo the claim is likely false because the table shows five films submitted over a period longer than 11 years, not within an 11-year period.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists five Latvian films submitted for Academy Award consideration from 1992 to 2013. These are more than 11 consecutive years apart, so they cannot all fit within any single 11-year window.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
