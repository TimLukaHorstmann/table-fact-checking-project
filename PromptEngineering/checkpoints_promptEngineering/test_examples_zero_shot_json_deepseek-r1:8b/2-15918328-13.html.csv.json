    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"sonya tayeh be the jazz choreographer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Sonya Tayeh is a jazz choreographer.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table provided. The table has several columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row represents a different performance or coupling of dancers.\n\nI should focus on the \"choreographer (s)\" column because that's where the choreographers are listed. Let me go through each row to see if Sonya Tayeh is mentioned there.\n\nLooking at row 0: The choreographer is Jason Gilkison. That's not Sonya.\nRow 1: Choreographer is Sonja Tayeh. Wait, her name is spelled \"sonya tayeh\" in the data? Hmm, but the claim says \"Sonya Tayeh.\" I wonder if it's a typo or different spelling. Let me check the claim again\u2014it says \"sonya tayeh,\" which matches row 1 exactly. So that seems relevant.\n\nRow 2: Choreographer is Tyce Diorio.\nRow 3: Jason Gilkison again.\nRow 4: Tony Meredith and Melanie Lapatin assisting, so not Sonya.\nRow 5: Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo, nope.\n\nSo in row 1, the choreographer is Sonja Tayeh, which matches the claim's name. However, I should also check if there are any other instances of her being a jazz choreographer elsewhere because maybe she has multiple roles or this is a specific instance.\n\nLooking at the \"style\" column for row 1: It says \"jazz.\" So in that particular performance, Sonya Tayeh was the jazz choreographer. That directly supports the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim just states that she is a jazz choreographer without specifying which performance or context. But based on the table, there's at least one instance where she is listed as the choreographer for a jazz style. So that would make the claim TRUE because she did indeed serve in that role once.\n\nI should also consider if other rows might have her, but it seems she only appears once in the \"choreographer(s)\" column. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"choreographer (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"1 safe result be choreograph by jason gilkison to filet from le r\u00eave.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that there's one safe result choreographed by Jason Gilkison for \"Filet from Le R\u00eave.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. The data rows provide information about each dance performance.\n\nFirst, I'll need to look through the 'results' column to find a row where the result is \"safe.\" Then, check if the choreographer for that row is Jason Gilkison and the music is \"Filet from Le R\u00eave.\"\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\nRow 0: Results are \"kanemura eliminated\" \u2013 not safe.\nRow 1: Also \"kanemura eliminated\" \u2013 not safe.\nRow 2: Results are \"safe.\" So this is our potential candidate. Now, check choreographer and music.\n\nChoreographer for Row 2: Tyce Diorio, not Jason Gilkison. And the music is \"all by myself - celine dion,\" which isn't \"Filet from Le R\u00eave.\"\n\nRow 3: Results are \"safe.\" Choreographer here is Jason Gilkison. But what's the style and music? Style is \"paso doble\" and music is \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" Wait, that's exactly what we're looking for!\n\nSo in Row 3, the results are safe, choreographed by Jason Gilkison, with the dance being paso doble and the music as Filet from Le R\u00eave. That matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are Row 3's 'choreographer (s)' and 'results' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"choreographer (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"katee shean joshua allen dance the contemporary piece.\" I need to check each part of this against the table provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions three people: Kat\u00e9e Shean, Joshua Allen, and presumably they are dancing a contemporary piece. So the key elements here are their names, the style (contemporary), and that they danced it.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. The rows seem to represent different dance performances or perhaps different instances where these individuals participated.\n\nI'll need to look for rows where \"katee shean joshua allen\" appear in the 'couple' column because that's their full name as per the claim. From the data, I see that row 2 and row 3 have this couple. \n\nNow, let's check the style column for these rows. For row 2, the style is \"contemporary,\" which matches the claim. Row 3 has a style of \"paso doble,\" which doesn't match. So only row 2 is relevant for the style part.\n\nNext, the music column. The claim says they danced \"the contemporary piece.\" Looking at row 2's music, it's \"all by myself - celine dion.\" I'm not sure if this specific song title is enough to confirm the claim, but since the claim doesn't specify the song, just the style, maybe this isn't as critical. However, the key here is that they did a contemporary dance.\n\nThen, the choreographer column for row 2 is \"tyce diorio,\" which might not be necessary unless the claim mentions him, but it doesn't. So probably not relevant.\n\nFinally, the results column: row 2 shows \"safe,\" meaning they made it through, while row 3 says \"safe\" as well. The claim doesn't mention the result, so maybe this isn't needed either.\n\nSo, the main points to check are that in a row where their couple is listed, and in that row, the style is contemporary. That's found in row 2. Therefore, the cells at row 2, columns 'style' would be relevant.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"dance the contemporary piece.\" So maybe I also need to check if they actually danced it, not just that it's listed as a style. But looking at the table, row 2 has \"all by myself\" which is a song associated with a contemporary dance style. So perhaps this supports the claim.\n\nSo, relevant cells are row 2, columns 'style' because that's where the contemporary piece is mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"style\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"katee shean joshua allen dance to filet from le r\u00eave and be choreograph by tyce diorio.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check against the table. The key elements are:\n1. The dancers involved: Katee Shean Joshua Allen.\n2. The dance style: \"filet from le r\u00eave.\"\n3. The choreographer: Tyce Diorio.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row in the data corresponds to a specific performance or result.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows could potentially contain Katee Shean Joshua Allen as part of their \"couple\" cell. Scanning through each row:\n- Row 2: Couple is \"katee shean joshua allen.\"\n- Other rows have different couples, so only Row 2 is relevant for the dancers.\n\nNext, I'll check if \"filet from le r\u00eave\" appears in any column under the same couple. Looking at Row 2's style column: It says \"paso doble,\" not \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" So, this part doesn't match.\n\nSince the dance style doesn't match, I might think if there's another relevant row or column. However, since only Row 2 matches the couple and none have the specific dance style mentioned in the claim, it seems like the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a step. Maybe \"filet from le r\u00eave\" is under the \"music\" column? Let me check. In Row 4, which also has the same couple (\"katee shean joshua allen\"), the style is \"contemporary.\" So no match there either.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Katee Shean Joshua Allen danced to \"filet from le r\u00eave\" and were choreographed by Tyce Diorio isn't fully supported in any row. The only relevant row for the couple doesn't have the correct dance style or choreographer mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"couple\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Doesn't match.\n\nRow 1: same couple as row 0? Wait, no. The first entry in row 1 has \"courtney galiano mark kanemura\", so the couple there is different. So row 1's style is Jazz, music is \"the garden- mirah\". Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Couple is \"katee shean joshua allen\". Style is Contemporary, music is \"all by myself - celine dion\". Oh, that matches part of the claim. But wait, the style here is Contemporary, not Paso Doble.\n\nSo in row 2, they danced to All By Myself but in Contemporary style. So it doesn't match both parts of the claim.\n\nRow 3: Same couple as row 2? Yes, \"katee shean joshua allen\". Style is Paso Doble, music is \"filet from le r\u00e2ve\". Wait, that's a different song. So they danced to a different song in Paso Doble. So this doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 4: Couple is \"chelsie hightower stephen twitch boss\", so not relevant here.\n\nRow 5: Same couple as row 4, and style is Hip-Hop, music is \"control - vitamin string quartet\". Not matching.\n\nSo, in the table, the only time Katee Shean Joshua Allen danced to All By Myself was in row 2, but it was in Contemporary style. The claim says they danced in Paso Doble, which doesn't happen in this table. \n\nWait, in row 3, they have the same couple dancing Paso Doble but a different song. So the specific combination of all three elements (couple, song, style) only exists in row 2 with Contemporary instead of Paso Doble.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported as it doesn't match both style and song correctly for that couple.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Katee Shean Joshua Allen danced to \"All By Myself\" by Celine Dion in the Paso Doble style. Examining the table:\n\n- Row 2: The couple danced to \"All By Myself\" in Contemporary style, not Paso Doble.\n- No row shows them dancing to the same song and style as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"music\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"style\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"katee shean joshua aleen dance a jazz style and be safe.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts.

So perhaps that's a clue to look at those rows.\n\nIn row 2, their style is contemporary, not jazz. In row 3, it's paso doble. So neither of these are jazz. However, in the claim, the couple is \"katee shean joshua aleen,\" which seems like a typo for allen. So maybe I should look for rows where the couple is misspelled as \"aleen.\"\n\nBut looking at the data, there's no row with that exact couple name. The correct one is \"katee shean joshua allen\" in rows 2 and 3. Since neither of those have jazz style, perhaps the claim is trying to imply that Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced a jazz style and were safe.\n\nWait, but row 1 has the same couple as row 0, but different from the ones mentioned in the claim. So actually, the only time the correct couple dances jazz is in row 1, where they're dancing jazz but it's Courtney and Mark who are eliminated. Therefore, Katee Shean and Joshua Allen never danced jazz.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because their style wasn't jazz; it was contemporary and paso doble. Also, the results for them were safe, as in row 3, but they didn't dance jazz.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced a jazz style and were safe. However:\n\n- In rows 2 and 3, their styles are contemporary and paso doble, not jazz.\n- The results for row 3 (where they performed paso doble) indicate they were safe.\n\nSince neither instance involves jazz, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"style\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"results\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The fifth and sixth rows are about chelsie hightower.
