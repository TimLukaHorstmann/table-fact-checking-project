    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 161 inning for person that have 5088 run score.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's looking for a player who has exactly 161 innings and also scored exactly 5088 runs. So I need to check each row in the table to see if any player fits both these numbers.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are name, career, matches, innings, not out, runs scored, high score, 50s, 100s, average. The data is a list of players with their respective stats.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Ricky Ponting**: Innings = 364, Runs Scored = 13589. Doesn't match.\n2. **Adam Gilchrist**: Innings = 278, Runs = 9595. No.\n3. **Mark Waugh**: 236 innings, 8500 runs. Not matching.\n4. **Steve Waugh**: 288 innings, 7569 runs. Nope.\n5. **Michael Clarke**: 207 innings, 7375 runs. Doesn't fit.\n6. **Michael Bevan**: 196 innings, 6912 runs. No match.\n7. **Allan Border**: 252 innings, 6524 runs. Not this one.\n8. **Matthew Hayden**: 154 innings, 6131 runs. Doesn't work.\n9. **Dean Jones**: 161 innings, 6068 runs. Oh! Wait, the innings are exactly 161 here. But his runs scored is 6068, not 5088. So that's a mismatch.\n10. **David Boon**: 177 innings, 5964 runs. No match.\n11. **Michael Hussey**: 157 innings, 5442 runs. Not this one either.\n12. **Damien Martyn**: 182 innings, 5346 runs. Doesn't fit.\n13. **Andrew Symonds**: 161 innings, 5088 runs! Wait a minute, here's someone with exactly 161 innings and 5088 runs scored. So that matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Let me look at Andrew Symonds' row: yes, innings = 161, runs scored = 5088. That fits perfectly.\n\nSo, even though in another row (Dean Jones) there's a 161 inning but different runs, Andrew Symonds has both correct numbers. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because such a player exists.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"innings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"mark taylor have 113 match with 110 inning an average of 32.23\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three specific numbers: 113 matches, 110 innings, and an average of 32.23.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player's statistics. The columns are listed as name, career, matches, innings, not out, runs scored, high score, 50s, 100s, and average.\n\nSo, to verify this claim, I need to find Mark Taylor's row in the data section. Let me scan through each row until I find his name. Here it is: the ninth row (index 9) with the name \"mark taylor\".\n\nNow, checking the relevant columns for the claim. The matches column has the value 113, which matches the first part of the claim. Next, the innings column has 110, which aligns with the second part. Finally, the average column shows 32.23, matching the third part.\n\nSince all three numbers in the claim are correctly represented in Mark Taylor's data, the statement is supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"matches\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Andrew Symonds is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Andrew Symonds have the highest scored run total 5088 with less than 161 inning participation.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of this claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the key points:\n1. Highest scored run total of 5088.\n2. Less than 161 innings participated.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player's statistics. The columns relevant here are \"name\", \"runs scored\", and \"innings\". \n\nSo, I'll need to find Andrew Symonds' row in the data section. Let me scan through the names:\n\n- The list of players includes Adam Gilchrist, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Michael Clarke, Michael Bevan, Allan Border, Matthew Hayden, Dean Jones, David Boon, Michael Hussey, Damien Martyn, Andrew Symonds, Shane Watson, Geoff Marsh, Mark Taylor, Darren Lehmann.\n\nAndrew Symonds is the 12th entry. Now, looking at his data: [198, 161, 33, 5088, 156, ...]. \n\nSo, his \"runs scored\" is 5088 and \"innings\" is 161. Wait, but the claim says less than 161 innings. Hmm, so if his innings are exactly 161, that's not less than. That might be a problem.\n\nBut wait, let me check other players to see if anyone has higher runs scored than Symonds. For example, look at Michael Bevan: 6912 runs in 196 innings. That's higher than Symonds' 5088. Similarly, Adam Gilchrist has 9595 runs, which is way higher. So Symonds isn't the highest scorer. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false because he doesn't have the highest runs scored.\n\nHowever, the user instruction might be about whether the statement is true or false based on the table. Since Symonds isn't the highest, the claim would be false regardless of innings. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. Let's make sure I'm looking at the right ones. The \"runs scored\" column is correct. So Symonds has 5088, which is lower than others like Bevan (6912), Gilchrist (9595), etc. Therefore, his runs aren't the highest.\n\nAlso, regarding innings: the claim says less than 161. His innings are exactly 161, so he doesn't have less than that. So both conditions in the claim don't hold true for Symonds.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the claim is correct as stated. The user's instruction was to verify the claim based on the table. Since the claim states that Symonds has the highest runs scored with less than 161 innings, but he actually doesn't have the highest runs and his innings are exactly 161, not less than, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because both conditions in the claim aren't met by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Andrew Symonds has the highest scored runs with less than 161 innings. Checking the table, Symonds has 5088 runs and exactly 161 innings, not less. Additionally, other players like Michael Bevan have higher run totals, making Symonds' score not the highest. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"innings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the most run score be 13589 by ricky ponting\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"most run score,\" which likely refers to the highest number of runs scored by a player in their career. Then it specifies that this record is held by Ricky Ponting with 13589 runs. So I need to find out if Ricky Ponting indeed has the highest runs in his career according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns for each player's performance are \"name,\" \"career,\" and the numerical data provided which includes various stats. The column we're interested in is probably \"runs scored\" since that directly relates to the total runs a player has accumulated.\n\nLet me scan through each row of the data to find Ricky Ponting's entry. His name appears in the first row, so I should look at the corresponding \"runs scored\" value for that row.\n\nIn the first data row under the columns provided:\n- The first column is the player's name: \"ricky ponting\"\n- Then comes the career span: \"1995 - 2012\"\n- The third number is 374, but I think this might be a mistake because 374 doesn't seem to align with the runs scored. Wait, no\u2014let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the columns. Let's list out the columns as given:\n- name\n- career\n- matches\n- innings\n- not out\n- runs scored\n- high score\n- 50s\n- 100s\n- average\n\nSo for Ricky Ponting, the \"runs scored\" is the sixth number in his row. Let me check that again.\n\nFirst data row:\n[\n  \"ricky ponting\",\n  \"1995 - 2012\",\n  374,\n  364,\n  39,\n  13589,\n  164,\n  82,\n  29,\n  41.81\n]\n\nWait, the third number is 374, which might correspond to matches or innings bowled, not runs scored. Let me count the positions:\n\n1. name\n2. career\n3. matches\n4. innings\n5. not out\n6. runs scored\n7. high score\n8. 50s\n9. 100s\n10. average\n\nSo in the first row, the sixth element (index 5) is 13589. So Ricky Ponting's runs scored are 13,589.\n\nNow, to check if this is the most by him, but the claim says \"the most run score,\" which I think refers to being the highest in the table or at least the highest for him. Wait, perhaps it's implying that he has more runs than others, so we need to verify if any other player has higher runs.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data, let me check each player's \"runs scored\" column:\n\n- Ricky Ponting: 13589\n- Adam Gilchrist: 9595\n- Mark Waugh: 8500\n- Steve Waugh: 7569\n- Michael Clarke: 7375\n- Michael Bevan: 6912\n- Allan Border: 6524\n- Matthew Hayden: 6131\n- Dean Jones: 6068\n- David Boon: 5964\n- Michael Hussey: 5442\n- Damien Martyn: 5346\n- Andrew Symonds: 5088\n- Shane Watson: 4796\n- Geoff Marsh: 4357\n- Mark Taylor: 3514\n- Darren Lehmann: 3078\n\nSo Ricky Ponting's runs scored is the highest among all listed players at 13,589. Therefore, the claim that he has the most run score of 13,589 seems to be TRUE based on this table.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that the \"most run score\" refers specifically to him having the highest total, not just his own record. Since no other player in the table surpasses his total, it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we identified Ricky Ponting's runs scored as 13,589, which is the highest among all players listed in the table.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"}\n  ]\n}",

The columns are various stats like name, career, matches, innings, etc. So for each player, their data is listed under these columns.\n\nI need to find Mark Taylor in this table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the total number of runs scored be less than 13589\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking. It's about comparing the total runs scored by all the cricketers listed in the table and seeing if their combined runs are less than 13,589.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where in the table the runs scored are recorded. Looking at the \"columns\" section of the JSON, I see that there's a column named \"runs scored.\" That's probably the key piece of information needed here. So each row in the data array represents a cricketer and their corresponding stats.\n\nMy next step is to go through each row and extract the \"runs scored\" value. Once I have all those numbers, I'll sum them up to get the total runs across all players mentioned.\n\nLet me list out the \"runs scored\" for each player:\n\n1. Ricky Ponting: 13,589\n2. Adam Gilchrist: 9,595\n3. Mark Waugh: 8,500\n4. Steve Waugh: 7,569\n5. Michael Clarke: 7,375\n6. Michael Bevan: 6,912\n7. Allan Border: 6,524\n8. Matthew Hayden: 6,131\n9. Dean Jones: 6,068\n10. David Boon: 5,964\n11. Michael Hussey: 5,442\n12. Damien Martyn: 5,346\n13. Andrew Symonds: 5,088\n14. Shane Watson: 4,796\n15. Geoff Marsh: 4,357\n16. Mark Taylor: 3,514\n17. Darren Lehmann: 3,078\n\nNow I need to add these up. Let's do this step by step:\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Ricky Ponting: 13,589\nNext, Adam Gilchrist adds 9,595 \u2192 Total so far: 23,184\nMark Waugh adds 8,500 \u2192 Total: 31,684\nSteve Waugh adds 7,569 \u2192 Total: 39,253\nMichael Clarke adds 7,375 \u2192 Total: 46,628\nMichael Bevan adds 6,912 \u2192 Total: 53,540\nAllan Border adds 6,524 \u2192 Total: 60,064\nMatthew Hayden adds 6,131 \u2192 Total: 66,195\nDean Jones adds 6,068 \u2192 Total: 72,263\nDavid Boon adds 5,964 \u2192 Total: 78,227\nMichael Hussey adds 5,442 \u2192 Total: 83,669\nDamien Martyn adds 5,346 \u2192 Total: 89,015\nAndrew Symonds adds 5,088 \u2192 Total: 94,103\nShane Watson adds 4,796 \u2192 Total: 98,899\nGeoff Marsh adds 4,357 \u2192 Total: 103,256\nMark Taylor adds 3,514 \u2192 Total: 106,770\nDarren Lehmann adds 3,078 \u2192 Final total: 109,848\n\nNow, comparing the total runs (109,848) to the claim of being less than 13,589. Clearly, 109k is way more than 13k. So the claim is false.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. Each \"runs scored\" cell corresponds to the column at index 5 in the columns array. So each row has a \"row_index\" from 0 to 17 (since there are 18 players). Therefore, all rows have the \"runs scored\" column as column_name: \"runs scored\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include each row's index and the column name for \"runs scored\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyzed the total runs scored by all cricketers in the table. The combined total of 109,848 runs is significantly higher than 13,589, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that there's a match where the number of not outs is 44 and that this is the least among those with a career spanning from 1984 to 1995. So, I need to find in the table any entries that fall within the \"career\" column which lists years starting in 1984 and ending after 1995.\n\nLooking at the table's data, each row represents a player along with various statistics. The relevant columns for this claim are:\n1. Career (to check if it falls within 1984-1995)\n2. Not Out (to find instances where not out is 44)\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones fit the criteria.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **Rick Ponting**: Career is 1995-2012. That's outside the range, so skip.\n2. **Adam Gilchrist**: 1996-2008. Also after 1995, no.\n3. **Mark Waugh**: 1988-2002. Starts before 1984 but ends in 2002. Career spans into 1984, so it's relevant for the career column.\n4. **Steve Waugh**: 1986-2002. Similar to Mark Waugh, starts after 1984. Relevant.\n5. **Michael Clarke**: 2003-. Starts after 1995, no.\n6. **Michael Bevan**: 1994-2004. Career starts in 1994, which is before 1995 but ends later. So within the range for career?\nWait, the claim says \"1984 - 1995\", so career that starts in 1984 and ends after 1995? Or ends in 1995?\n\nLooking back at Michael Bevan's row: Career is 1994-2004. So from 1994 to 2004. That would include 1995, but does it start before 1995? Yes, in 1994. So perhaps it falls within the range if we consider career starting in 1984.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"1984 - 1995\", which I think refers to a timeframe from 1984 up to and including 1995. So players whose careers started in or before 1995? Or ended by 1995?\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- **Dean Jones**: Career is 1984-1994. Ends in 1994, so that's within 1984-1995.\n- **David Boon**: 1984-1995. Perfect match for career ending in 1995.\n- **Michael Hussey**: 2004-2012. After 1995, no.\n- **Damien Martyn**: 1992-2006. Career starts before 1995 and ends after, so relevant.\n- **Andrew Symonds**: 1998-2009. Starts in 1998, which is within the timeframe but started after 1984.\n- **Shane Watson**: 2002-. Started in 2002, relevant for career starting before 1995? Wait, no, because the claim says \"1984 - 1995\". So a player's career that started in 1984 and ended by 1995 would be from 1984 to 1995. But if it starts later but ends within 1995, is that included?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the exact rows:\n\nLooking for players with a career spanning at least part of 1984 to 1995.\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Mark Waugh**: 1988-2002 (starts in 1988)\n- **Steve Waugh**: 1986-2002\n- **Allan Border**: 1979-1994\n- **Dean Jones**: 1984-1994\n- **David Boon**: 1984-1995\n\nSo these are the players whose careers are within or overlap with the timeframe 1984-1995.\n\nNow, check for each of them if \"Not Out\" is 44. Let's look at their respective rows:\n\n1. Mark Waugh: Not Out isn't listed, so default to 0? Or maybe not provided. Since it's a statistic that might vary, I need to check if the value is explicitly 44.\n2. Steve Waugh: Same as above.\n3. Allan Border: Not Out is 44 in his row (see data).\n4. Dean Jones: Not Out is 44.\n5. David Boon: Not Out is 44.\n\nWait, looking at the table provided:\n\nLooking at each row's \"Not Out\" column:\n\n- For example, in the original problem statement, the user provided a table with columns like \"Name\", \"Career\", etc., and one of them is \"Not Out\". So let me think about which players have Not Out as 44.\n\nFrom the given rows:\n\n1. **Allan Border**: Career 1979-1994. Not Out: 44.\n2. **David Boon**: Career 1984-1995. Not Out: 44.\n\nSo both of these players are in the timeframe and have Not Out equal to 44.\n\nNow, the claim says \"185 be the least match for not out be 44\". So I think it's saying that in this group (players with careers overlapping 1984-1995), the minimum number of matches where Not Out is 44 is 185. But wait, looking at the data, perhaps the claim is misstated.\n\nWait, no: The user\u2019s instruction says \"the least match for not out be 44\". So maybe it's saying that the minimum number of matches where Not Out is 44 in this group is 185, but I don't see such a statistic in the table. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is miswritten and refers to the value of 44 being the least (i.e., minimum) for Not Out.\n\nBut wait, from the data, both Allan Border and David Boon have Not Out as 44. So there are multiple players with Not Out=44, meaning that 44 isn't the least\u2014it's one of several.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me parse it again: \"185 be the least match for not out be 44 in 1984 - 1995\".\n\nSo maybe it's saying that in the matches within the career timeframe 1984-1995, the number of matches where Not Out is 44 is 185, which is the minimum. But without more data on each player's exact matches and Not Out counts per match, I can't verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to the number of players with Not Out=44 being 185, but that doesn't make sense because looking at the table, only two players have Not Out=44 in their stats. So maybe the original intention was different.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is trying to say that within the timeframe, there are multiple matches where Not Out is 44, and among those, the least number of such matches per player is 185. But without more data, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct figure should be higher or lower. Alternatively, maybe the claim is that within this timeframe, at least one player has Not Out=44, making it true because both Allan Border and David Boon do.\n\nBut looking back, the user provided an example where the answer was TRUE because certain cells were relevant. So perhaps I need to check if there's a row where career is 1984-1995 and not out is 44.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- David Boon: Career 1984-1995, Not Out=44 \u2192 this cell is relevant.\n- Allan Border: Career 1979-1994, Not Out=44 \u2192 also relevant.\n\nSo both of these players are in the timeframe and have Not Out=44. Therefore, the claim's statement is correct because there are such matches.\n\nWait, but the original claim says \"185 be the least match...\", which might refer to a specific number of matches per player or overall. But given that the table only shows the total Not Out for each player, not per match, I can't confirm if 44 is achieved in any matches within that timeframe. However, since both players have Not Out=44 in their careers during that time, there are definitely instances where Not Out was 44.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exist players with careers spanning 1984-1995 who have a Not Out of 44.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Not Out\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Not Out\"}]}",
