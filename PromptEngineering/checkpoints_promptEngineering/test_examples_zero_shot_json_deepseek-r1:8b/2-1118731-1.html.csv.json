    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\" is true or false based on the provided table. First, let me understand what's being claimed here. The person is saying that for the year 1972, there's no information about the power in horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw). \n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: generation, years, engine, power, torque, and induction. So, each row corresponds to a specific model with details on these specs.\n\nI'll go through the rows one by one to find where \"1972\" appears. Scanning the data, in the first few rows, I notice that there's an entry for 1971 with a 455in cubic Oldsmobile V8 engine. The next row is also 1971-1973, same engine. Then there's a 1972 row: it says \"455in cubic oldsmobile v8\" and under power it's listed as \"n /a\". Hmm, \"n/a\" typically stands for not available or not applicable.\n\nSo, in the 1972 row, the power is marked as \"n /a\", which likely means there's no data provided about the power output in hp or kw. The claim states that the power isn't given in those units, which aligns with this \"n/a\" entry.\n\nWait, but I should check if any other rows for 1972 exist. Scanning further, I see a row for \"ii\", 1977-1978, and another for 1979-1980, but nothing specifically for 1972 except the one I found earlier. So, only that single 1972 entry exists.\n\nTherefore, based on this, the claim is correct. The power for 1972 isn't provided in hp or kw. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
