The claim is: \"in the 1987 - 88 season, newell 's old boy scored 55 points.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about the 1987-88 season, specifically looking for Newell's Old Boys' points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are team, average, points, played, and then the seasons \"1986 - 87\", \"1987 - 88\", etc. The data is a list of rows, each representing a different team.\n\nI need to find where Newell's Old Boys are in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that the second row (index 1) has the name \"newell 's old boys\". That's relevant because it matches the claim.\n\nNext, for the season 1987-88, which column is that? The columns after points are played, then \"1986 - 87\", so the next one would be \"1987 - 88\". So in each row, the data corresponds to: team, average, points, played, \"1986 - 87\", \"1987 - 88\".\n\nSo for Newell's Old Boys (row index 1), I need the value in the \"1987 - 88\" column. Looking at the data, the second row has a value of 55 in that column. So their points in 1987-88 were indeed 55.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. The relevant cells are row 1 and the \"points\" column for the season 1987-88, which is \"1987 - 88\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table provided is in JSON format with several columns and rows of data. The claim given is: \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31.\" \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the claim. It seems like it's saying that for a team, when their points are 107 and in the season 1987-88 they have 31 points, then their played games (probably 'played') is 114. So essentially, the claim is checking if there exists a row where points = 107, 1987-88 = 31, and played = 114.\n\nNow, I need to look through the table data to see if such a row exists. Let's break down each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Points**: The claim specifies points should be 107.\n2. **Season**: It mentions the 1987-88 season, which is one of the columns in the table under \"1986 - 87\", \"1987 - 88\", etc. So I need to look at the \"1987 - 88\" column.\n3. **Played Games**: The claim refers to played being 114, so that's another column to check.\n\nI should go through each row in the data and see if any team has points = 107, season 1987-88 = 31, and played = 114.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The columns are: team, average, points, played, 1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89.\n- I'll check each row for these three pieces of information.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: points=139, so no.\n- Row 1: points=136, nope.\n- Row 2: points=135, no.\n- Row 3: points=132, not 107.\n- Row 4: points=130, no.\n- Row 5: points=130 again, no.\n- Row 6: points=123, still no.\n- Row 7: points=122, nope.\n- Row 8: points=116, nope.\n- Row 9: points=115, not 107.\n- Row 10: points=111, getting closer but not there yet.\n- Row 11: points=110, still not 107.\n- Row 12: points=109, no.\n- Row 13: points=107. Oh, here we go! Let's check the other two columns.\n\nFor row 13:\n- team is \"ferro carril oeste\".\n- points = 107.\n- played = 107? Wait, no. The played column shows 107 for this row. But in the claim, it says when points are 107 and season 1987-88 is 31, then played should be 114.\n\nWait a minute. Let's check the other columns for row 13:\n- \"1986 - 87\": 44\n- \"1987 - 88\": 33\n- So, in this case, the 1987-88 points are 33, not 31 as per the claim.\n- Played is 107.\n\nSo, even though there's a row with points=107 and played=107, it doesn't match both conditions of the claim. The season 1987-88 points should be 31, but here it's 33.\n\nNext, I'll check if any other rows have points=107 and 1987-88=31.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n- Only row 13 has points=107. Its \"1987 - 88\" value is 33.\n- No other rows have points=107 except this one.\n\nTherefore, there's no team in the table that satisfies both points=107 and season 1987-88=31. Additionally, none of them have played=114 when those two conditions are met.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I missed any rows. Maybe I went too quickly through some rows.\n\nRow 13: points=107, played=107. No match for played=114.\nIs there another row with points=107? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The first few rows have points in the hundreds, then they drop down to around 130, then lower.\nOnly row 13 has points=107.\n\nSo, no other rows with points=107. Therefore, the claim is checking for a scenario that doesn't exist in the table.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE because there's no team meeting all three criteria: points=107, season 1987-88=31, and played=114.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a row where points are 107, the 1987-88 season has 31 points, and played is 114. After checking each row, none meet these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",
