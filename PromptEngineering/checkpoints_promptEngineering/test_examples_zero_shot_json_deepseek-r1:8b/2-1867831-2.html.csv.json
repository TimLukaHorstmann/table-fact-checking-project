    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the type code of sl 500 , sl 550 be cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure provided. The columns are model, years, type/code, power rpm, and torque rpm. The data has five rows, each representing different models and their details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"type / code\" for two models: sl 500 and sl 550. So I need to check those models in the table.\n\nLooking at row 1 (first row after headers), model is \"sl 350\". That's not relevant here because it's about sl 500 and sl 550.\n\nRow 2 has both \"sl 500 , sl 550\" as the model, which matches the claim. The type/code for this row is listed as \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\". That's exactly what the claim states, so that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should check all rows in case there are multiple entries for these models or any discrepancies. Row 3 is sl 55 amg, which is a different model. Rows 4 and 5 also don't have sl 500 or sl 550.\n\nSo the only relevant row is row 2, specifically looking at the \"type / code\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that the type/code for SL 500 and SL 550 is cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 (m273), as verified in row 2 of the table's data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"2006 - 2008 have a type / code of cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m272 )\". \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are model, years, type/code, power rpm, and torque rpm. The data has five rows, each representing different models from Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe claim mentions the years \"2006 - 2008\" and the type/code as \"cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m272 )\". I need to check if any row in the table matches both the years and the type/code specified.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. First row: Years are \"2006 - 2008\", which matches. The type/code is \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v6 ( m272 )\". That's an v6 engine, not v8, so doesn't match.\n2. Second row: Years also \"2006 - 2008\". Type/code is \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\". This is a v8 but the code is m273, not m272 as claimed.\n3. Third row: Years are \"2006 - 2008\". Type/code is \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 supercharged ( m113 )\". Again, it's a v8 but with a different engine code m113.\n4. Fourth row: Years are \"2006 - 2008\". Type/code is \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v12 biturbo ( m275 )\", so that's a v12, not v8.\n5. Fifth row: Years start in 2004 and continue, so it doesn't fit the claim's years exactly since the claim specifies up to 2008.\n\nSo none of the rows for \"2006 - 2008\" have both the correct years and type/code specified in the claim. The second row is close but has a different engine code (m273 vs m272). Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
