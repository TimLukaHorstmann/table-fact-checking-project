The claim says: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 28 be p13.6 million.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table structure. The table has columns like \"movies\", \"december 25\", \"december 26\", etc., and each row seems to represent a different movie or event.\n\nLooking at the data rows, each row starts with a movie title. The first row is \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\", so that's the one we're focusing on. I need to find the figure for December 28 for this movie.\n\nThe columns after \"movies\" are dates from December 25th to December 28th, followed by two totals. So, the first relevant column is \"december 28\". The value under \"ang tanging ina mo...\" for that column should be checked.\n\nLooking at the data row for \"ang tanging ina mo...\", the numbers are: p20 million, p18 million, p16.5 million, p13.6 million, and then two totals. So December 28 is the fourth number, which is p13.6 million.\n\nSince this matches exactly with the claim, it should be TRUE. The relevant cells would be row index 0 (since it's the first data row) and column \"december 28\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december 28\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 27 be p16.5 million.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure provided. The table has columns: movies, december 25, december 26, december 27, december 28, total of those days, and total 2-week gross.\n\nThe data rows each have values for these columns. So, each row represents a different movie, and each column corresponds to a specific date or total.\n\nI need to check if the claim refers correctly to the right row and column in the table. The claim mentions \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" on december 27 with p16.5 million.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 0: ang tanging ina mo is listed as p20 million on dec25, but the claim refers to dec27, so that's not it.\n- Row 1: dalaw, not relevant.\n- Row 2: father jejemon, no.\n- Row 3: rosario, no.\n- Row 4: RPG: Metanoia, no.\n- Row 5: Shake, Rattle & Roll Xii, no.\n- Row 6: si agimat..., no.\n\nWait, actually, the claim's movie is \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\", so I should check each row to see if it matches that title. \n\nLooking at each data row:\n\nRow 0: The first entry is \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\". So this must be the correct row for the movie in question.\n\nNow, checking the december 27 column for this row. In row 0, dec27 value is p16.5 million, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the figure for ang tanging ina mo on dec27 is indeed p16.5 million, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells. The movie is in row_index 0 (since it's the first data row), and the column is december 27. So the relevant_cells would be [ {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"december 27\"} ].\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 27 has a figure of p16.5 million.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december 27\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the movie rosario earn p3.2 million on december 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: movies, december 25, december 26, dec 27, dec28, total for those four days, and total 2-week gross. Each row represents a different movie.\n\nThe claim is about \"rosario\" earning p3.2 million on december 25. So I need to find the row corresponding to \"rosario\" and check what its value is under the \"december 25\" column.\n\nLooking at the data, there are five rows after the headers. The fourth row (index 3) corresponds to \"rosario\". In that row, the first cell is \"rosario\", then the amounts follow. So I need to look at the second element in this row because the columns start from movies as the first column, and december 25 is the second.\n\nWait, no: The columns are: movies, dec25, dec26, etc. So each sublist after the headers has seven elements. For \"rosario\", the second element (index 1) should be under dec25. Let me check that.\n\nIn the data, row index 3 (fourth row) is:\n\n[\n  \"rosario\",\n  \"p3.2 million\",\n  \"p2.5 million\",\n  \"p2.1 million\",\n  \"p1.4 million\",\n  \"p9 million\",\n  \"p16 million\"\n]\n\nSo the second element (column index 1) is indeed p3.2 million for december25.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"rosario earned p3.2 million on dec25\" is supported by the data in cell row_index=3 and column_name=\"december 25\".\n\nI should check if any other cells are relevant. The claim mentions earning on a specific date, so only the dec25 column is relevant here.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being row 3, column december25.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"december 25\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about a film is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the film for december 25 with a figure of p5.1 million total p15.3 million for the december 25 - 28 total.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand each component. The claim mentions a film on December 25 (so that's one specific date) and refers to two figures: P5.1 million and P15.3 million. \n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns:\n- movies\n- december 25\n- december 26\n- december 27\n- december 28\n- december 25 - 28 total\n- total 2 - week gross\n\nEach row in the data corresponds to a movie with its respective figures across these columns.\n\nSo, for the claim, I need to find if there's a film listed on December 25 that has a figure of P5.1 million and another figure for the total from Dec 25 to Dec 28 as P15.3 million.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the \"movies\" column because that's where each film is identified. The rows are:\n\n1. ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!')\n2. dalaw\n3. father jejemon\n4. rosario\n5. rpg : metanoia\n6. shake , rattle & roll xii\n7. si agimat at si enteng kabisote\n\nNow, the claim refers to \"the film for december 25,\" so I'm looking for a row where December 25 is listed as the movie's date or something similar? Wait, no\u2014the table's structure is that each row corresponds to a specific movie, and the columns are dates. So each row has the movie name in the first column, followed by figures for each subsequent date.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. The \"movies\" column lists the names of the films. The next four columns are the daily gross for Dec 25-28. Then there's a column for the total of those four days and another for the two-week (probably two weeks including these dates) gross.\n\nSo each row has:\n1. Movie name\n2. Dec 25\n3. Dec 26\n4. Dec 27\n5. Dec 28\n6. Total for Dec25-28\n7. Total 2-week gross\n\nGiven that, the claim is about a film (so looking at the movies column) on Dec 25 with a figure of P5.1 million and then the total from Dec25-28 as P15.3 million.\n\nSo first, I need to check if any row has Dec25's figure as P5.1 million. Then, in that same row, check if the total for Dec25-28 is P15.3 million.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: \n- Movies: ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!')\n- Dec25: p20 million\nSo Dec25 figure is 20M, not 5.1M. So this row doesn't match.\n\nRow 1:\n- Movie: dalaw\n- Dec25: p12.5 million\nNot matching 5.1M.\n\nRow2:\n- Movie: father jejemon\n- Dec25: p1.4 million\nNope.\n\nRow3:\n- Movie: rosario\n- Dec25: p3.2 million\nNo match.\n\nRow4:\n- Movie: rpg : metanoia\n- Dec25: p5.1 million\nAh, here we go. So in row 4, the Dec25 figure is exactly P5.1 million.\n\nNow, I need to check if the total for Dec25-28 (column \"december 25 - 28 total\") in this row is P15.3 million.\n\nLooking at row4's data:\n- The fifth column (Dec25-28 total) is p15.3 million.\nYes, that matches.\n\nAdditionally, checking the last column (\"total 2 - week gross\"), it says p27 million, which might be relevant if the claim refers to two-week totals, but the claim specifically mentions Dec25's figure and then the four-day total. So I think focusing on the \"december 25 -28 total\" is sufficient for this claim.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are met by row4 (rpg : metanoia). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are in row 4 under \"december 25 - 28 total.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"december 25 - 28 total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are movies, December 25, December 26, December 27, December 28, and two totals. Each row corresponds to a movie.\n\nI'm focusing on the claim about \"father jejemon\" earning P1.4 million on December 27. So I need to find the relevant data in the table.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- The first row is for \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\". Doesn't match.\n- Second row, \"dalaw\". No.\n- Third row: \"father jejemon\" \u2014 this matches the movie name we're looking for.\n- Fourth and fifth rows don't match.\n- Sixth row is another movie.\n\nSo the relevant row is row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed, so third in the list). Now, I need to check December 27. The columns are December 25, 26, 27, 28, etc. So December 27 would be the third column after the date columns.\n\nIn the \"father jejemon\" row, the data for each date is as follows:\n- Dec 25: P1.4 million\n- Dec 26: P1.2 million\n- Dec 27: P0.8 million\n- Dec 28: P0.6 million\n\nWait, so December 27 has P0.8 million, not P1.4 million as the claim states. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. The third data entry in row index 2 is for December 27? Wait no, let's see:\n\nLooking at the table, each row has six entries corresponding to the columns. So for \"father jejemon\", the first cell is \"p1.4 million\" which is December 25. Then next is Dec26: p1.2, then Dec27: p0.8, and so on.\n\nSo the claim says P1.4 million on Dec27. But according to the table, on Dec27, father jejemon earned P0.8 million, not P1.4 million. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me check again: the columns are movies, then dec25, dec26, dec27, dec28, then totals. So each row has data for each of these dates and totals.\n\nSo in \"father jejemon\" row:\n\n- Dec25: P1.4M\n- Dec26: P1.2M\n- Dec27: P0.8M\n- Dec28: P0.6M\n\nThus, on Dec27, they earned P0.8 million, not P1.4.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions \"rosario\" which should correspond to a row in the table, specifically looking for the figure on December 27. The figure mentioned is \"p18 million.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like \"movies,\" \"december 25,\" up to \"total 2 - week gross.\" Each row under these columns represents different movies or entities.\n\nNow, I need to find where \"rosario\" is listed in the data section. Scanning through each sub-array:\n\n1. The first sub-array starts with \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\", so that's not rosario.\n2. The second one begins with \"dalaw,\" again, not relevant.\n3. The third row starts with \"father jejemon\"\u2014nope.\n4. The fourth row starts with \"rosario.\" Here we go.\n\nSo, the fourth sub-array is for \"rosario.\" Now I need to find the figure on December 27. Looking at the columns: they are dates from dec 25 to dec 28 and then some totals. So each position in the sub-array corresponds to a specific date.\n\nLet me line them up:\n\n- The first element after \"rosario\" is p3.2 million for dec 25.\n- Next, p2.5 million for dec 26.\n- Then p2.1 million for dec 27.\nWait, but the claim says p18 million on dec 27.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in mapping. Let me double-check.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table data:\n\nThe fourth row is \"rosario,\" and the numbers are: p3.2 million, p2.5 million, p2.1 million, p1.4 million, p9 million, p16 million.\n\nSo each of these corresponds to dec 25, 26, 27, 28, then the totals. So for dec 27, it's p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\nWait, that doesn't match the claim at all. The claim says p18 million, but according to this, it's p2.1 million on dec 27.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table columns: the first five are dates from dec25 to dec28, then two totals. So each sub-array has six elements.\n\nSo for \"rosario,\" the fourth row is [p3.2, p2.5, p2.1, p1.4, p9, p16].\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Dec 25: p3.2M\n- Dec26: p2.5M\n- Dec27: p2.1M\n- Dec28: p1.4M\n\nSo the claim says \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27.\" But according to this, it's p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\nWait, that suggests the claim is FALSE because the actual figure for dec27 for rosario is p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which column corresponds to which date. Maybe the columns are ordered differently? Let me check the \"columns\" array again:\n\nColumns: [\"movies\", \"december 25\", \"december 26\", \"december 27\", \"december 28\", \"december 25 - 28 total\", \"total 2 - week gross\"]\n\nYes, so each sub-array in data corresponds to movies and then the five dates, followed by totals.\n\nSo for each movie, the first element is their name, followed by dec25, dec26, etc., then totals.\n\nTherefore, the fourth row's numbers are:\n\n- dec25: p3.2M\n- dec26: p2.5M\n- dec27: p2.1M\n- dec28: p1.4M\n- Totals: p9M and p16M.\n\nSo on December 27, \"rosario\" has a figure of p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states p18 million, but the actual figure is p2.1 million.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the columns? Let me check again.\n\nColumns are:\n\n0: movies\n1: dec25\n2: dec26\n3: dec27\n4: dec28\n5: total 25-28\n6: total 2-week gross\n\nSo for each row, index 1 is dec25, 2 is dec26, etc. So for \"rosario,\" which is the fourth row (index 3), the data points are:\n\ndata[3][0] = \"rosario\"\n\ndata[3][1] = p3.2M (dec25)\ndata[3][2] = p2.5M (dec26)\ndata[3][3] = p2.1M (dec27)\ndata[3][4] = p1.4M (dec28)\ndata[3][5] = p9M (total 25-28)\ndata[3][6] = p16M (total 2-week)\n\nSo, yes, on dec27, it's p2.1 million.\n\nThe claim says p18 million, which isn't present here at all. So the figure in the claim is incorrect; therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me check other rows to ensure that \"rosario\" is indeed in row 3.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows are:\n\n0: ang tanging...\n1: dalaw\n2: father jejemon\n3: rosario\n4: rpg : metanoia\n5: shake, rattle...\n6: si agimat...\n\nYes, so row index 3 is \"rosario.\"\n\nTherefore, the figure for dec27 is p2.1 million, not p18.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check where \"rosario\" is located and what figure it has on December 27. In the table, \"rosario\" is in row index 3 under the columns for dates. The figure for December 27 (column index 3) is p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the figure for \"rosario\" on December 27 is p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\n\\boxed{FALSE}",
