    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"real valladolid have score the most goal in the season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's claiming that Real Valladolid scored the most goals in their season, which I need to verify.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided. The columns relevant here are \"position,\" \"club,\" \"played,\" \"points,\" \"wins,\" \"draws,\" \"losses,\" \"goals for,\" \"goals against,\" and \"goal difference.\" Since the claim is about goals scored, the key column to focus on is \"goals for.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different club. I need to find Real Valladolid's data. Let me scan through the \"club\" column. \n\nIn row 4, the club is listed as \"real valladolid.\" That's the one we're interested in. Now, I'll check their \"goals for\" statistic. From the table, it's listed as 35. So they scored 35 goals.\n\nNow, to see if this is the highest, I need to compare this number with all other clubs' \"goals for\" columns. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Hercules CF: 44 goals\n2. Granada CF: 40 goals\n3. Algeciras CF: 42 goals\n4. Real Valladolid: 35 goals\n5. Levante UD: 34 goals\n6. CD Mestalla: 33 goals\n7. CF Calvo Sotelo: 36 goals\n8. CD Tenerife: 34 goals\n9. Rayo Vallecano: 31 goals\n10. Real Murcia: 29 goals\n11. Recreativo de Huelva: 29 goals\n12. C\u00e1diz CF: 27 goals\n13. CD Constancia: 26 goals\n14. Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta: 25 goals\n15. Melilla CF: 20 goals\n16. CD Badajoz: 16 goals\n\nNow, compiling the \"goals for\" numbers:\n- The highest is Hercules CF at 44, followed by Algeciras CF at 42, then Real Valladolid with 35.\n\nSo Real Valladolid does not have the most goals; Hercules CF and Algeciras CF scored more. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim about a football team called CD Mestalla. The claim says, \"CD Mestalla have 13 draw, 4 higher than the next highest number of draw.\" My task is to determine if this claim is true or false by checking the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Draws\" refer to the number of games that ended in a tie. The claim states that CD Mestalla have 13 draws, which is higher than the next highest number by 4. So I need to find out how many draws each team has and see if this specific statement holds true.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: position, club, played, points, wins, draws, losses, goals for, goals against, goal difference. The relevant column here is \"draws.\"\n\nI'll go through each row in the data to find the number of draws for CD Mestalla. \n\nThe first row is:\n[\n  1,\n  \"h\u00e9rcules cf\",\n  30,\n  39,\n  16,\n  7,\n  7,\n  44,\n  24,\n  \"+ 20\"\n]\n\nBut that's Hercules CF, not CD Mestalla.\n\nContinuing down the rows:\n\nLooking for \"cd mestalla.\" I see it in row 6:\n[\n  6,\n  \"cd mestalla\",\n  30,\n  33,\n  10,\n  13,\n  7,\n  45,\n  44,\n  \"+ 1\"\n]\n\nHere, the draws are listed as 13. So CD Mestalla has 13 draws.\n\nNow I need to check if this is indeed 4 higher than the next highest number of draws among other teams. That means I have to look at all other clubs in the table and find their draw counts, then see what's the next highest after CD Mestalla's 13.\n\nLet me list out the draw numbers for each team:\n\n1. Hercules CF: 7\n2. Granada CF: 5\n3. Algeciras CF: 7\n4. Real Valladolid: 9\n5. Levante UD: 8\n6. CD Mestalla: 13\n7. CF Calvo Sotelo: 6\n8. CD Tenerife: 6\n9. Rayo Vallecano: 7\n10. Real Murcia: 5\n11. Recreativo de Huelva: 7\n12. C\u00e1diz CF: 7\n13. CD Constancia: 6\n14. Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta: 3\n15. Melilla CF: 6\n16. CD Badajoz: 8\n\nSo after CD Mestalla with 13, the next highest is 8, which is shared by Levante UD and CD Badajoz.\n\nNow, the claim says that CD Mestalla's draw count (13) is 4 higher than the next highest number of draws. The next highest is 8. So 13 minus 8 equals 5, not 4. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the difference is 5, not 4.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check:\n\nCD Mestalla: 13\nNext highest: 8 (Levante UD and CD Badajoz)\n\nDifference is 13 - 8 = 5, which is more than 4 as stated in the claim. So the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" \n\nBut I also need to identify the relevant cells for verification. The relevant columns are \"draws\" and perhaps position or club name, but since we're only concerned with draws, the specific cell is where CD Mestalla's draws are listed. That's in row 6, column \"draws.\"\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be the cell at row 6 for \"draws.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"only 2 of the team win more than half the game they play.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. \"Only 2 of the team\" implies that exactly two teams have a win rate over 50%. Then, \"win more than half the games they play\" refers to the number of wins each team has relative to the total games played. Since all teams in the table have 30 games played, I think I can look at the \"wins\" column for each team.\n\nWait, each row represents a different team. So, for each team, I need to check if their number of wins is more than half of 30. Half of 30 is 15, so more than 15 wins would mean they've won more than half their games.\n\nLet me go through the \"wins\" column:\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\nRow 0: wins=16 (more than 15)\nRow 1: wins=16 (same as above)\nRow 2: wins=14\nRow 3: wins=13\nRow 4: wins=13\nRow 5: wins=10\nRow 6: wins=7\nRow 7: wins=6\nRow 8: wins=6\nRow 9: wins=12\nRow 10: wins=5\nRow 11: wins=7\nRow 12: wins=7\nRow 13: wins=3\nRow 14: wins=3\nRow 15: wins=6\nRow 16: wins=4\n\nNow, let's count how many teams have more than 15 wins. That would be 16 or higher.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Rows 0 and 1 have 16 wins each.\n- The rest are 14 or lower, which is not above 15.\n\nSo that means only two teams (rows 0 and 1) have more than half their games won. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because it's exactly two teams.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about how \"half\" is calculated. If a team plays 30 games, then half is 15. So any team with 16 wins has won more than half. Correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells are those where the \"wins\" column is >=16 because that's more than half. Therefore, rows 0 and 1 have the relevant data points.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check how many teams have won more than half of their games (i.e., more than 15 wins out of 30).

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate real valladolid in the table. Looking at the 'club' column, row 4 corresponds to \"real valladolid\". That's where their data is.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the highest amount of draws. In football statistics, 'draws' refer to the number of games that ended with a draw, i.e., both teams scored the same number of goals. So I need to find the 'draws' column for real valladolid and compare it against other clubs.\n\nFrom the table, each row has a 'draws' value. For real valladolid (row 4), their draws are 9. Now, I'll check if any other club has a higher number of draws.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n- Row 0: Hercules CF - 7 draws\n- Row 1: Granada CF - 5 draws\n- Row 2: Algeciras CF - 7 draws\n- Row 3: Real Valladolid - 9 draws\n- Row 4: Levante UD - 8 draws\n- Row 5: CD Mestalla - 13 draws\n- Row 6: CF Calvo Sotelo - 6 draws\n- Row 7: CD Tenerife - 6 draws\n- Row 8: Rayo Vallecano - 7 draws\n- Row 9: Real Murcia - 5 draws\n- Row 10: Recreativo de Huelva - 7 draws\n- Row 11: C\u00e1diz CF - 7 draws\n- Row 12: CD Constancia - 6 draws\n- Row 13: Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta - 3 draws\n- Row 14: Melilla CF - 6 draws\n- Row 15: CD Badajoz - 8 draws\n\nComparing these, the highest number of draws is 13 in row 5 (CD Mestalla).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"on average, it be more likely to win a game than to draw it\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll analyze the claim and figure out what data points from the table are relevant.\n\nThe claim talks about the likelihood of winning versus drawing games on average. So, I should look for data that relates to wins and draws per team. In the table, each row represents a club with their statistics. The relevant columns here would be \"wins\" and \"draws.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to find the \"wins\" and \"draws\" numbers. Each of these will help calculate an average likelihood of winning versus drawing.\n\nCalculating for each team:\n1. Hercules CF: 16 wins, 7 draws\n2. Granada CF: 16 wins, 5 draws\n3. Algeciras CF: 14 wins, 7 draws\n4. Real Valladolid: 13 wins, 9 draws\n5. Levante UD: 13 wins, 8 draws\n6. CD Mestalla: 10 wins, 13 draws\n7. CF Calvo Sotelo: 13 wins, 6 draws\n8. CD Tenerife: 13 wins, 6 draws\n9. Rayo Vallecano: 12 wins, 11 draws\n10. Real Murcia: 12 wins, 5 draws\n11. Recreativo de Huelva: 11 wins, 7 draws\n12. C\u00e1diz CF: 10 wins, 7 draws\n13. CD Constancia: 10 wins, 6 draws\n14. Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta: 11 wins, 3 draws\n15. Melilla CF: 7 wins, 6 draws\n16. CD Badajoz: 4 wins, 8 draws\n\nNow, for each team, I can compute the ratio of wins to total games (wins + draws). The higher this ratio, the more likely a team is to win on average.\n\nLet me calculate each:\n1. Hercules CF: 16/30 = ~0.533\n2. Granada CF: 16/35 \u2248 0.457\n3. Algeciras CF: 14/38 \u2248 0.368\n4. Real Valladolid: 13/37 \u2248 0.351\n5. Levante UD: 13/40 = 0.325\n6. CD Mestalla: 10/45 \u2248 0.222\n7. CF Calvo Sotelo: 13/38 \u2248 0.342\n8. CD Tenerife: 13/37 \u2248 0.351\n9. Rayo Vallecano: 12/39 \u2248 0.308\n10. Real Murcia: 12/35 \u2248 0.343\n11. Recreativo de Huelva: 11/36 \u2248 0.305\n12. C\u00e1diz CF: 10/37 \u2248 0.270\n13. CD Constancia: 10/38 \u2248 0.263\n14. Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta: 11/38 \u2248 0.289\n15. Melilla CF: 7/40 = 0.175\n16. CD Badajoz: 4/36 \u2248 0.111\n\nLooking at these ratios, some teams have a higher ratio than others. For example, Hercules CF has the highest at ~53%, while others like Granada and Algeciras are lower. The average across all teams would be the sum of all these win percentages divided by 16.\n\nCalculating total wins: Let's add them up.\n16 + 16 +14 +13 +13 +10 +13 +13 +12 +12 +11 +10 +10 +11 +7 +4 =\n\nAdding step by step:\n16+16=32\n32+14=46\n46+13=59\n59+13=72\n72+10=82\n82+13=95\n95+13=108\n108+12=120\n120+12=132\n132+11=143\n143+10=153\n153+10=163\n163+11=174\n174+7=181\n181+4=185\n\nTotal wins: 185\nEach team played 30 games, so total games = 16*30=480.\n\nSo average ratio is 185/480 \u2248 0.385 or 38.5%. \n\nNow, comparing this to the likelihood of a draw. The claim says it's more likely to win than to draw. So, for each team, I should also look at the ratio of draws to total games (draws + wins).\n\nLet me calculate that as well:\n1. Hercules CF: 7/30 \u22480.233\n2. Granada CF:5/35=0.142\n3. Algeciras CF:7/38\u22480.184\n4. Real Valladolid:9/37\u22480.243\n5. Levante UD:8/40=0.200\n6. CD Mestalla:13/45\u22480.289\n7. CF Calvo Sotelo:6/38\u22480.158\n8. CD Tenerife:6/37\u22480.162\n9. Rayo Vallecano:11/39\u22480.282\n10. Real Murcia:5/35=0.142\n11. Recreativo de Huelva:7/36\u22480.194\n12. C\u00e1diz CF:7/37\u22480.189\n13. CD Constancia:6/38\u22480.158\n14. Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta:3/38\u22480.079\n15. Melilla CF:6/40=0.150\n16. CD Badajoz:8/36\u22480.222\n\nCalculating the average draw ratio:\nAgain, total draws: Let's sum them up.\n7+5+7+9+8+13+6+6+11+5+7+7+6+3+6+8=\n\nAdding step by step:\n7+5=12\n12+7=19\n19+9=28\n28+8=36\n36+13=49\n49+6=55\n55+6=61\n61+11=72\n72+5=77\n77+7=84\n84+7=91\n91+6=97\n97+3=100\n100+6=106\n106+8=114\n\nTotal draws: 114\nSame total games: 480.\n\nAverage draw ratio is 114/480\u22480.237 or 23.7%.\n\nComparing the average win ratio (38.5%) to the average draw ratio (23.7%), on average, teams are more likely to win than to draw. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that the claim says \"on average,\" so if we take an overall average across all teams, wins are higher. But it's possible that some individual teams have a lower or higher likelihood.\n\nBut based solely on the data provided, since the average ratio of wins is higher than the average ratio of draws, the statement would hold true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on average, a team is more likely to win than to draw. By calculating the average win and draw ratios across all teams, we found that the average win rate (~38.5%) exceeds the average draw rate (~23.7%).

Looking at the 'club' column:\n\n- H\u00e9rcules CF is listed as row 1 (index 0).\n- Levante UD is listed as row 5 (index 4? Wait, let me count: rows are numbered from 0, so row indices go from 0 to 15.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data array:\n\nIt starts with row 0: H\u00e9rcules CF, then 1: Granada CF, up to row 16 as CD Badajoz. So H\u00e9rcules CF is index 0 and Levante UD is index 5? Wait no:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe first few rows are:\n- 0: Hercules CF\n- 1: Granada CF\n- 2: Algeciras CF\n- 3: Real Valladolid\n- 4: Levante UD\n\nWait, that can't be. The data array is from index 0 to 15 for H\u00e9rcules CF? Wait no, let me list them properly:\n\nRow 0: Hercules CF (index 0)\nRow 1: Granada CF (index 1)\n...\nRow 4: Levante UD (index 4)\nWait, but the data array has 17 rows (from 0 to 16), but the last row is CD Badajoz.\n\nWait no, looking at the data:\n\nIt's a list of arrays. Each sub-array represents a row. The first element in each sub-array is the position, which goes from 1 to 16 (since there are 17 rows). Wait, no: the columns include \"position\", and the values go up to 16. Wait, looking at the table:\n\nLooking at the columns, the first column is 'position', which seems to be a ranking or something, as it goes from 1 to 16.\n\nEach row in data corresponds to that position. So row 0 has position 1 (H\u00e9rcules CF), row 1 has position 2 (Granada CF), and so on until row 15 is position 16 (Melilla CF), and the last row, index 16, is CD Badajoz with position 17? Wait, no: looking at the data:\n\nThe first few rows are:\n[\n  [1, \"h\u00e9rcules cf\", ...],\n  [2, \"granada cf\", ...],\n  ...\n  [16, \"cd badajoz\", ...]\n]\n\nWait, so each sub-array in data represents a row, with the position being from 1 to 17? Because there are 17 sub-arrays (indices 0-16). So H\u00e9rcules CF is at index 0, position 1.\n\nLevante UD: looking through the 'club' column:\n\nAt what index is Levante UD? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the club names in order:\n\n0: h\u00e9rcules cf\n1: granada cf\n2: algeciras cf\n3: real valladolid\n4: levante ud\n5: cd mestalla\n6: cf calvo sotelo\n7: cd tenerife\n8: rayo vallecano\n9: real murcia\n10: recreativo de huelva\n11: c\u00e1diz cf\n12: cd constancia\n13: atl\u00e9tico ceuta\n14: melilla cf\n15: cd badajoz\n\nWait, so Levante UD is at index 4. So row_index 4.\n\nNow, the claim is about their goal difference being less than 15.\n\nLooking at the 'goal difference' column:\n\nFor H\u00e9rcules CF (row 0), goal difference is \"+20\". So that's +20, which is greater than 15.\n\nWait, but wait: the goal difference is expressed as a string. For example, for row 0: \"h\u00e9rcules cf\", goals for 44 and against 24, so goal difference is 44-24=+20. Similarly, for others:\n\nLet me extract the 'goal difference' values from each relevant row.\n\nH\u00e9rcules CF (row 0): \"+20\" \u2192 which is +20\nLevante UD (row 4): \"+20\" as well.\n\nSo both have a goal difference of +20, which is greater than 15. Therefore, their goal differences are not less than 15, but rather exactly +20 each.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"h\u00e9rcules cf and levante ud have a goal difference of less than 15\" is false because both have a goal difference of +20.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that H\u00e9rcules CF and Levante UD have a goal difference of less than 15 is false.

The claim is: \"cd mestalla have 5 more draw than cf calvo sotelo.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to identify which data points are relevant. The key terms here are \"cd mestalla,\" \"cf calvo sotelo,\" and \"draws.\" So I need to find the rows for these two clubs and check their number of draws.\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array, each row has various statistics. I'll search through each row to find where \"cd mestalla\" and \"cf calvo sotelo\" are located.\n\nFrom the table:\n- cd mestalla is in row 6 (since the rows start from index 0).\n- cf calvo sotelo is in row 7.\n\nNext, I need to locate the column for \"draws.\" The columns listed include \"draws,\" so that's the relevant column.\n\nNow, extract the number of draws:\n- For cd mestalla: looking at row 6, under \"draws,\" it's 13.\n- For cf calvo sotelo: looking at row 7, under \"draws,\" it's 6.\n\nThe claim states that cd mestella has 5 more draws than cf calvo sotelo. So I'll calculate the difference:\n13 (cd mestalla) - 6 (cf calvo sotelo) = 7.\n\nWait, the difference is 7, not 5. That means the claim isn't accurate.

The claim is: \"on average, the number of draw be higher than the number of win.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at what each term means in the context of the table.

So, I should focus on these two columns to check if draws are, on average, higher than wins.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a club with their respective stats for that season.

The columns involved are \"draws\" and \"wins\". Each row's draw and win values are in these columns. So all rows from 0 to 15 have data under both columns.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 team in the season remain undefeated\" is true based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"undefeated\" typically refers to a team that hasn't lost any matches, so their record would be wins only.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has multiple columns: position, club, played, points, wins, draws, losses, goals for, goals against, and goal difference. Since the claim is about undefeated teams, I'm particularly interested in the \"wins\" column because that directly reflects how many games a team has won without any losses.\n\nI should go through each row to check the number of wins per team. If there's only one team with 30 wins (assuming all other teams have at least one loss), then the claim holds true.\n\nStarting from row 0: Hercules CF has 16 wins. So they've lost some matches.\nRow 1: Granada CF has 5 wins\u2014definitely not undefeated.\nContinuing down, I notice that most teams have 10 or fewer wins. Only one team stands out with a higher number of wins. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Hercules CF - 16 wins\n- Row 1: Granada CF - 5\n- Row 2: Algeciras CF -7\n- Row3: Real Valladolid -9\n- Row4: Levante UD -13\n- Row5: CD Mestalla -10\n- Row6: CF Calvo Sotelo -6\n- Row7: CD Tenerife -6\n- Row8: Rayo Vallecano -12\n- Row9: Real Murcia -5\n- Row10: Recreativo Huelva -11\n- Row11: C\u00e1diz CF -7\n- Row12: CD Constancia -14\n- Row13: Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta -3\n- Row14: Melilla CF -6\n- Row15: CD Badajoz -4\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount each row correctly:\n\nLooking at the data again:\n\nRow 0:\nplayed:30, wins:16 \u2192 So they have 16 wins and thus 14 losses (since 30 total games). So not undefeated.\n\nRow1: Granada CF - wins:5, so definitely not.\n\nRow2: Algeciras CF -7 wins.\n\nRow3: Real Valladolid -9 wins.\n\nRow4: Levante UD -13.\n\nRow5: CD Mestalla -10.\n\nRow6: CF Calvo Sotelo -6.\n\nRow7: CD Tenerife -6.\n\nRow8: Rayo Vallecano -12.\n\nWait, no, in the table provided, the third column is \"played,\" then fourth is points, fifth is wins. So for row 0:\n\n1, Hercules CF, 30 (played), 39 (points), 16 (wins), etc.\n\nSo each team's number of wins is as per their row's 'wins' value.\n\nLooking through all rows, the highest number of wins is 16 in row 0 (Hercules CF). The next is 14 in row12: C\u00e1diz CF has 7 wins. Wait, no:\n\nWait, looking again, row numbers are from 0 to 15 because there are 16 teams.\n\nRow0: Hercules CF -16\n\nRow1: Granada CF -5\n\nRow2: Algeciras -7\n\nRow3: Real Valladolid -9\n\nRow4: Levante UD -13\n\nRow5: CD Mestalla -10\n\nRow6: Calvo Sotelo -6\n\nRow7: CD Tenerife -6\n\nRow8: Rayo Vallecano -12\n\nRow9: Real Murcia -5\n\nRow10: Recreativo Huelva -11\n\nRow11: C\u00e1diz CF -7\n\nRow12: CD Constancia -14\n\nRow13: Atl\u00e9tico Ceuta -3\n\nRow14: Melilla CF -6\n\nRow15: CD Badajoz -4\n\nWait, no. Wait the \"wins\" column for row0 is 16, which seems like a high number. Let me check each team's wins:\n\nHercules CF:16\n\nGranada:5\n\nAlgeciras:7\n\nReal Valladolid:9\n\nLevante UD:13\n\nCD Mestalla:10\n\nCalvo Sotelo:6\n\nTenerife:6\n\nRayo Vallecano:12\n\nReal Murcia:5\n\nRecreativo Huelva:11\n\nC\u00e1diz CF:7\n\nConstancia:14\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Ceuta:3\n\nMelilla CF:6\n\nCD Badajoz:4\n\nSo the highest number of wins is 16 by Hercules CF, and then 14 by C\u00e1diz CF. So only two teams have double-digit wins: Hercules with 16 and C\u00e1diz with 14.\n\nWait, that would mean at least two teams are undefeated if they have 30 wins? No, wait\u2014winning all their games would be 30 wins because they played 30 matches. But the highest wins here is 16 by Hercules. So no team has won all their games; the highest is 16.\n\nWait, this changes things. If none of the teams have 30 wins, that means no team is undefeated because each has at least one loss. Therefore, the claim \"only 1 team remain undefeated\" would be false because actually, no team is undefeated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misinterpreted the data. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at row0: Hercules CF, wins=16. So they lost 14 games.\n\nRow12: C\u00e1diz CF, wins=14. They lost 16 games.\n\nSo both have multiple losses. Therefore, no team is undefeated because all teams have at least one loss.\n\nThus, the claim that only one team remains undefeated is incorrect; actually, none are undefeated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the data. Let me check again for each row's wins:\n\nRow0:16\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:7\n\nRow3:9\n\nRow4:13\n\nRow5:10\n\nRow6:6\n\nRow7:6\n\nRow8:12\n\nRow9:5\n\nRow10:11\n\nRow11:7\n\nRow12:14\n\nRow13:3\n\nRow14:6\n\nRow15:4\n\nSo the highest is 16 by Hercules, and 14 by C\u00e1diz. Therefore, no team has won all their matches.\n\nThus, the claim that only one team remains undefeated is false because no teams are undefeated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"only 1 team in the season remain undefeated\" is false. After analyzing the table, it's clear that no team has won all their games (i.e., no team has 30 wins).
