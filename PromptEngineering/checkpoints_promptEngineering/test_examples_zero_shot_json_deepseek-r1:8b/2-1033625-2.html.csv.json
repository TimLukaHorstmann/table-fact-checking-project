    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false and identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"the score at the venue of praterstadion , vienna at the euro 1980 qualifier be 4 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any rows related to Praterstadion in Vienna during the Euro 1980 qualifiers.\n\nLooking at the data, I see multiple entries for Praterstadion, Vienna. Let me check each row:\n\n- The first relevant row is index 29: \"29 august 1979\", venue \"praterstadion , vienna\", score \"4 - 0\", result \"euro 1980 qualifier\". This seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there aren't any other rows. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nRow 29: August 29, 1979, Praterstadion, Vienna, score 4-0, Euro 1980 qualifier \u2013 yes, that's a direct match.\n\nIs there another row for Euro 1980 at Praterstadion, Vienna? Let me check if any other rows have the same competition and venue. The next possible is row 30: \"17 october 1979\", which is Hampden Park, Glasgow, not Praterstadion. Then, I see rows after that are for 1982 qualifiers and others.\n\nSo only row 29 matches the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by one relevant cell in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on april 30 1977 stadion lehen , salzburg have score of 1 - 0 / 2 - 0 / 0 - 3 / 4 - 0 / 6 - 0 / 8 - 0 for the 1978 world cup qualifier",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"On April 30, 1977, Stadion Lehen, Salzburg had scores of 1-0, 2-0, 0-3, 4-0, 6-0, and 8-0 for the 1978 World Cup Qualifier.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is saying. The date is April 30, 1977, the venue is Stadion Lehen in Salzburg, and they played multiple matches with various scores.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if there's any row that matches this exactly. The columns are: date, venue, score, result, competition. \n\nSo, my approach should be:\n1. Identify rows where the date is April 30, 1977.\n2. Check if the venue in those rows is Stadion Lehen, Salzburg.\n3. Look at the 'score' column to see if all the scores mentioned in the claim are present.\n\nLooking through each row in the table:\n\nI'll start by scanning for \"April 30, 1977.\" Scanning the date column... \n\nRow 23: April 30, 1977 - Stadion Lehen, Salzburg. This looks promising.\n\nNow, let's check the scores here. The score cell is empty or not? Wait, in the table, it seems that each row has a 'score' column but sometimes it might be blank or have multiple entries. Let me look at row 23 specifically.\n\nIn the table provided, row 23 (index starting from 0) corresponds to April 30, 1977, Stadion Lehen, Salzburg. The score cell here says \"2 - 0\". Hmm, but the claim mentions multiple scores like 1-0, 2-0, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each row in the table represents a different match on that date, so there might be multiple rows for April 30, 1977.\n\nLooking back, I see that the user's instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim mentions six different scores: 1-0, 2-0, 0-3, 4-0, 6-0, and 8-0.\n\nSo, I need to find rows where the date is April 30, 1977, venue is Stadion Lehen, Salzburg, and score matches any of these. But in the table, I only see row 23 as matching that date and venue, with a single score of 2 - 0.\n\nWait, perhaps each row can have multiple scores if it's for different teams or matches? Or maybe the claim is referencing all possible scores from that day. Alternatively, maybe there are multiple rows on April 30, 1977, but I think in the table, only one row matches that date and venue.\n\nSo, if only one score (2 - 0) is present, then the claim which lists six different scores can't be fully supported. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure there aren't more rows for that date and venue.\n\nLooking through each row, I see:\n\nRow 23: April 30, 1977 - Stadion Lehen, Salzburg - Score: 2 - 0.\n\nNo other rows have that exact date and venue. So only one score is present, but the claim lists multiple scores. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim provides six different scores for a single match date, but the table shows only one score for April 30, 1977, at Stadion Lehen, Salzburg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the score for march 24 1982 be 1 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim: it's about a match that happened on March 24, 1982, and the score being 1-1. My task is to check if this information exists in the provided table. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The columns are: date, venue, score, result, competition.\n\nSo, I need to find any rows where the date is March 24, 1982, and then check if the score in that row matches \"1 - 1\".\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to see if any match this criteria. \n\nStarting from the beginning of the data array:\n\n1. First row: March 27, 1974 \u2013 doesn't match.\n2. Second row: September 4, 1974 \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: September 28, 1974 \u2013 not matching.\n4. Fourth row: March 16, 1975 \u2013 no.\n5. Fifth row: September 24, 1975 \u2013 no.\n6. Sixth row: May 28, 1981 \u2013 close date but not March 24.\n7. Seventh row: June 17, 1981 \u2013 same as above.\n8. Eighth row: March 24, 1982 \u2013 wait, here we go.\n\nWait, the eighth row is:\n- Date: March 24, 1982\n- Venue: nPstadion, Budapest\n- Score: 1 - 0\n- Result: 1 - 0\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nSo, the score here is \"1 - 0\", not \"1 - 1\". Therefore, this doesn't support the claim.\n\nContinuing further to ensure I haven't missed any other rows:\n\n9. Ninth row: March 21, 1982 \u2013 no.\n10. Tenth row: June 21, 1982 \u2013 doesn't match.\n11. Eleventh row: June 21, 1982 \u2013 same as above.\n12. Twelfth row: August 30, 1978 \u2013 not relevant.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the eighth row is March 24, 1982. So that's the only row where the date matches. But in that row, the score is \"1 - 0\", which doesn't match the claim of \"1 - 1\".\n\nTherefore, there is no row in the table where the date is March 24, 1982, and the score is 1-1. The closest is a friendly match with a 1-0 score.\n\nSo, the claim is not supported by any data in the table. Hence, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
