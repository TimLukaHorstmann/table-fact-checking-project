    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"when new york be the opponent , the score be 111 - 106.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: the opponent and the score. \n\n1. **Opponent Check**: The claim specifies that the opponent is \"new york.\" So, I should look for any row in the table where the opponent's name is exactly \"new york.\"\n\n2. **Score Check**: Once I find such a row, I need to verify if the score column matches \"111 - 106.\"\n\nI'll go through each row of the data to see if there's an entry where the opponent is \"new york\" and the score is \"111 - 106.\" \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 7 (index 6) has the opponent as \"seattle\" with a score of \"142 - 113.\"\n- Row 18 (index 17) is for the opponent \"new york,\" and the score is \"111 - 106.\"\n\nWait, no. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at row by row:\n\nRow 0: opponent is san francisco, score 109 - 105.\n...\nRow 6: opponent seattle, score 142-113.\nRow 7: baltimore, score 99-102.\n...\nRow 17 (index 17): opponent new york, score 111-106.\n\nYes, that's correct. So there is a row where the opponent is \"new york\" and the score is exactly \"111 - 106.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all parts of it are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"Alexander Memorial Coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: the location and the score.\n\nStarting with the location: Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Looking at the table's columns, there's a column named \"location / attendance\". So that's where I need to look for this specific location. I should check each row under this column to see if any match \"Alexander Memorial Coliseum\".\n\nNext, the score part of the claim is 113 - 106. The table has a \"score\" column, so I need to find rows where the score exactly matches this number.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the data to check both conditions.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum and score is 109 - 105. So not our score.\nRow 1: same location but different opponent and score.\nRow 2: different location, can skip.\nRow 3: same location but different score (114-101). Opponent is San Diego, so maybe that's a game they won, but we're looking for 113-106.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 12: November 9 vs. San Francisco, score is 113 - 106. Location? Let me check the \"location / attendance\" column here. Row 12 has \"Alexander Memorial Coliseum\". So yes, this row matches both the location and the score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's a game at Alexander Memorial Coliseum with a score of 113-106.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need the row index where this occurs. Looking at the data array, it starts from 0. The relevant row is index 12 (since it's the 13th element, starting count from 0). So row_index is 12. Columns are \"score\" and \"location / attendance\". \n\nSo the relevant_cells will include two objects: one for \"score\" at row 12 and another for \"location / attendance\" also at row 12.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"new york be the opponent at the game with a score of 112 - 106\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main components: the opponent being \"new york\" and the score being \"112 - 106\". My task is to check if there's a game in the table where these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: game, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. The data rows contain information about each game, including who the opponent was, what the score was, etc.\n\nMy approach should be to go through each row in the data section of the table and check if any row matches both the opponent being \"new york\" and the score being exactly \"112 - 106\". If I find such a row, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nStarting with the first row: game 8 on November 1 against San Francisco. The score here is 109 - 105. Not matching.\n\nNext, game 9 on November 3 against Boston. Score is 103 - 123. Nope.\n\nGame 10 on November 6 vs Baltimore. Score 119 - 140. Still not a match.\n\nGame 11 on November 8 vs San Diego. The score is 114 - 101. Not our target.\n\nGame 12 on November 9 against San Francisco again, with a score of 113 - 106. Wait, the opponent here is San Francisco, not New York, so that's out.\n\nMoving on to game 13 on November 12 vs San Francisco once more, but the score is 108 - 123. Not matching.\n\nGame 14: November 13 against Seattle, score 142 - 113. Opponent is Seattle, not New York.\n\nGame 15: November 15 vs Philadelphia, score 115 - 116. No match.\n\nGame 16: November 16 vs Cincinnati, score 125 - 130. Opponent is Cincinnati.\n\nGame 17: November 19 vs Milwaukee, score 89 - 119. Opponent is Milwaukee.\n\nGame 18: November 20 against New York! The opponent here is New York, and the score is 111 - 106. Wait a minute, that's close to our claim's score of 112 - 106, but not exactly matching. So this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nGame 19: November 21 vs Detroit, score 129 - 121. Opponent is Detroit.\n\nGame 20: November 23 vs Chicago, score 114 - 96. Not our opponent or score.\n\nGame 21: November 24 vs Baltimore again, score 111 - 118. Opponent is Baltimore.\n\nGame 22: November 26 vs Baltimore, score 99 - 102. Same here.\n\nGame 23: November 27 vs Cincinnati, score 94 - 91. Opponent is Cincinnati.\n\nGame 24: November 30 vs Cincinnati again, score 126 - 109. Opponent remains Cincinnati.\n\nWait, so I've gone through all the rows, and none of them have both the opponent as \"new york\" and a score of exactly \"112 - 106\". The closest match was game 18 where the opponent is New York but the score is 111 - 106, which doesn't meet the exact score mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be FALSE because there's no row in the table that satisfies both conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"new york\" is the opponent with a score of 112-106, we check each row:\n\n- **Opponent Check**: Look for rows where the opponent is \"new york\".\n- **Score Check**: Verify if any such row has the exact score \"112 - 106\".\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, none match both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106\". This means I'm looking for a row in the table where both the location/attendance is \"alexander memorial coliseum\" and the score is exactly \"114 - 106\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: game, date, opponent, score, location / attendance, and record. The data rows start from index 0 to 24.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for the conditions.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- location/attendance: \"alexander memorial coliseum\"\n- score: \"109 - 105\" \u2192 not matching.\n\nRow 1:\n- location is same but score is \"103 - 123\" \u2192 nope.\n\nRow 2:\nLocation changes to \"baltimore civic center\", so skip. Score is \"119 - 140\".\n\nRow 3:\nLocation is back to \"alexander memorial coliseum\". Let's check the score: \"114 - 101\" \u2192 not matching.\n\nRow 4:\nSame location, but score is \"113 - 106\" \u2192 close, but not exactly what we need. Wait, no, it's different.\n\nWait, in row 3, the game number is 11, date November 8, opponent San Diego, score 114-101. So that's not matching.\n\nMoving on, row 4: same location again, score is \"113 - 106\". Hmm, so this seems close but let me make sure.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about a score of \"114 - 106\". So in row 4, it's \"113 - 106\" which doesn't match. So that's not the one.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 5: location changes to Oakland arena. Score \"108 - 123\".\n\nRow 6: Seattle, score \"142-113\".\n\nRow7: Philadelphia, \"115-116\".\n\nRow8: Cincinnati, \"125-130\".\n\nRow9: Milwaukee, \"89-119\".\n\nRow10: New York, \"111-106\". Wait, that's close. Score is \"111 - 106\" but location is Alexander. But the claim is looking for a score of exactly \"114 - 106\". So not this one.\n\nRow11: Detroit, \"129-121\".\n\nRow12: Chicago, \"114-96\". Location is Chicago stadium, so no.\n\nRow13: Baltimore, \"111-118\".\n\nRow14: same location as before. Score is \"99-102\".\n\nRow15: Cincinnati again, \"94-91\".\n\nRow16: Same location, score \"126-109\".\n\nRow17: Milwaukee again, but not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row where both conditions are met. Let me go back.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nI think the key is to find a game where location is Alexander and score is exactly 114-106.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nAt row 3 (game 11), location is Alexander, but score is 114-101.\n\nRow4 (game12): same location, score 113-106.\n\nThen, perhaps no other rows meet both conditions. So in the table, there's no game where the location is Alexander and the exact score is 114-106. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each row for a game played at \"alexander memorial coliseum\" with a score of \"114 - 106\". Upon reviewing all entries, no such row exists. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
