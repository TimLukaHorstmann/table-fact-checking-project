    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy together having 14 rebounds against Miami. So I need to check if in any game where these two players played against Miami, they both had the highest total rebounds for their team.\n\nLooking at the table structure: There's a columns array listing all the data points like game number, date, team, score, etc., and the data is an array of arrays. Each sub-array represents a game with various stats.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy were both part of the same game against Miami and whether their total rebounds were higher than any other player in that game.\n\nStarting from row 0: It's game 73, April 1 vs Detroit. The high rebounds are listed as Michael Bradley (14) and Jelani McCoy (14). But since it's against Detroit, not Miami, I can skip this one.\n\nNext, row 1 is game 74, April 2 vs Detroit again. High rebounds are Jerome Williams (16), so no Michael or Jelani here.\n\nRow 2 is game 75, April 4 vs San Antonio. The high rebounds are Michael Bradley (8) and others. No mention of Jelani here, so probably not the pair we're looking for.\n\nRow 3: Game 76, April 6 vs New Jersey. High rebounds are Voshon Lenard (21), etc., but again, not against Miami.\n\nRow 4 is game 77, April 8 vs Miami. This seems relevant. Let's see the high points: Alvin Williams has 16, Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy each have 8. Wait, that doesn't match the claim of 14 rebounds together. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at row 4, under \"high rebounds\": it says Michael Bradley , Jelani McCoy (14). Oh, so both together had 14? But in game 77 against Miami, their combined rebounds are 8 each? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait the data for game 77 is:\n[\n  77,\n  \"april 8\",\n  \"miami\",\n  \"l 83 - 89 (ot)\",\n  \"alvin williams (16)\",\n  \"michael bradley (8)\",\n  \"morris peterson (5)\",\n  \"american airlines arena 14365\",\n  \"24 - 53\"\n]\n\nSo in this game, Michael Bradley has 8 rebounds and Jelani McCoy isn't listed as a high rebounder. So their combined would be 8, not 14.\n\nWait maybe I'm misinterpreting the data structure. Let me check each row's \"high rebounds\" column carefully.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"voshon lenard (21), michael bradley , jelani mccoy (14)\". Wait, no, that's in game 73 against Detroit, so not relevant.\n\nIn game 74, the high rebounds are \"jerome williams (16)\", so no Michael or Jelani.\n\nGame 75: \"vince carter (17), michael bradley (8), others. So Michael has 8, but Jelani isn't listed here.\n\nGame 76: \"jelani mccoy (9), alvin williams (8). So Jelani has 9, Michael not mentioned.\n\nGame 77: \"alvin williams (16), michael bradley (8), morris peterson (5). So Michael has 8, but Jelani isn't listed as a high rebounder here. So their combined would be 8 if that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The \"high rebounds\" column lists all players with at least X rebounds, sorted from highest to lowest. So in game 73, it's Voshon Lenard (21), Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy each with 14, but maybe as a tie for second place.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each game's \"high rebounds\" is listed as the top performers. For example, in game 73, high rebounds are Voshon Lenard (21), then Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy both at 14.\n\nSo in that game, their total would be 14 each. But since it's against Detroit, not Miami.\n\nNow, looking for games where they play against Miami.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nGame 76: April 6 vs New Jersey. High rebounds: Voshon Lenard (21), Jelani McCoy (9). So Jelani has 9, Michael isn't listed here.\n\nGame 77: April 8 vs Miami. High rebounds: Alvin Williams (16), Michael Bradley (8), Morris Peterson (5). So Michael has 8, but Jelani isn't listed as having 14 here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each game again.\n\nLooking for games against Miami:\n\nGame 77 is the only one where they play against Miami. In that game, Michael Bradley has 8 rebounds, and Jelani McCoy isn't listed as a high rebounder\u2014only Alvin Williams with 16. So their combined would be 8, which is less than Alvin's 16.\n\nSo in this case, the claim says they have 14 rebounds against Miami. But in game 77, Michael has 8 and Jelani isn't listed as a high rebounder here, so it doesn't add up to 14. Therefore, there must be no such game where both have 14 rebounds against Miami.\n\nSo the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy together had 14 rebounds against Miami is false because in the only game they played against Miami (game 77), their combined rebounds were not 14. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify all games where both Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy play against Miami.\n2. Check each relevant game for their total rebounds.\n3. In game 77, Michael has 8 rebounds; Jelani isn't listed as a high rebounder there, so their combined is less than Alvin Williams' 16.\n\nConclusion: The claim is false because the highest combined rebounds by both players in any Miami game don't reach 14.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"type\": \"ClaimVerification\",\n    \"verificationResult\": \"False\"\n  }\n}\n```",
