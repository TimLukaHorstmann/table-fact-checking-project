The claim is: \"the venue that be use the most be goebel soccer complex.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Goebel Soccer Complex is the venue used most frequently in the table. So, my task is to check how many times each venue appears in the 'venue' column and see if Goebel Soccer Complex is indeed the most used.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note down the venues. \n\n1. The first row lists \"bosse field\" as the venue.\n2. Second row: \"goebel soccer complex.\"\n3. Third row: \"roberts municipal stadium.\"\n4. Fourth row: \"goebel soccer complex\" again.\n5. Fifth row: \"goebel soccer complex\" once more.\n6. Sixth row: \"reitz bowl.\"\n\nNow, I'll count the occurrences for each venue:\n\n- Goebel Soccer Complex appears in rows 2, 4, and 5. That's three times.\n- Bosse Field: Once (row 1).\n- Roberts Municipal Stadium: Once (row 3).\n- Reitz Bowl: Once (row 6).\n\nSo, Goebel Soccer Complex is used the most, appearing three times out of six rows.\n\nNext, I need to check if each occurrence is in the 'venue' column. Yes, all relevant data points are under \"venue.\"\n\nNow, mapping this back to the table's structure: the 'venue' column is at index 3 (0-based indexing), so row indexes for Goebel Soccer Complex are 1, 3, and 4.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column \"venue\"\n- Row 3, column \"venue\"\n- Row 4, column \"venue\"\n\nI should represent these as objects with row_index (using their actual indices) and column_name (\"venue\").\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 5 teams with no championship, and only 1 with a championship.\" \n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different team. The columns relevant here are \"team\", \"championships\". But in the data provided, under \"championships\" for all teams except one, it's listed as \"none\". Let me check each row.\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants: championships = none\n2. Evansville Vipers: championships = none\n3. Evansville Bluecats: championships = none\n4. Evansville Express: championships = none\n5. Tri-State Titans: championships = none\n6. Ohio River Bearcats: championships = gmfl title 2008\n\nSo, five teams have \"none\" as their championships, and one team (Ohio River Bearcats) has a championship. That seems to match the claim.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"championships\" column is where the info is for each team. So for all rows except row 5 (since row indices start at 0), the championships are none, and row 5 has one.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include all rows with \"none\" in championships to confirm there are five such teams. Wait, but the claim says there are five teams with no championship. So I need to check each of those five teams.\n\nWait, let me count: rows 0-4 (Evansville Crimson Giants, Vipers, Bluecats, Express, Tri-State Titans) all have none, that's five. And row 5 has one championship. So the claim is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all the teams except the last one in the \"championships\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me check each row's venue column.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. The first row has \"bosse field\" as the venue.\n2. The fifth row has \"reitz bowl.\"\n3. No other rows mention these two venues, so only these two are relevant.\n\nNow, I need to determine the time periods for events at both venues. For Bosse Field, it's associated with the Evansville Crimson Giants in 1921-1922. For Reitz Bowl, it's linked to the Ohio River Bearcats from 2008-2010.\n\nThe claim says that the event at Reitz Bowl happened after Bosse Field. Since Reitz Bowl's events were from 2008-2010 and Bosse Field's were in 1921-1922, clearly the Reitz Bowl events are later. So, the claim is true based on the data provided.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the table.

Let me start by understanding the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns provided in the table: team, sport, played, venue, championships. The claim specifically mentions something about the \"team\" column, so that's where I should focus my attention.\n\nNext, I need to check how many teams have \"evansville\" in their name. The claim states that exactly four teams do this. To verify this, I'll go through each row of the data and count the instances where the team name includes \"evansville\".\n\nLooking at the first row: team is \"evansville crimson giants\". That's one.\n\nSecond row: \"evansville vipers\" \u2013 that's two.\n\nThird row: \"evansville bluecats\" \u2013 three.\n\nFourth row: \"evansville express\" \u2013 four. So far, four teams with \"evansville\".\n\nFifth row: \"tri - state titans\" \u2013 doesn't have \"evansville\".\n\nSixth row: \"ohio river bearcats\" \u2013 also doesn't include \"evansville\". \n\nSo that's a total of four teams. But wait, I should double-check each name to make sure I'm not missing any.\n\nWait, let me list them again:\n\n1. evansville crimson giants\n2. evansville vipers\n3. evansville bluecats\n4. evansville express\n\nYes, that's four teams with \"evansville\" in their names. \n\nNow, checking if there are exactly four such teams in the table. The data has six rows, and indeed, only the first four have \"evansville\". The fifth and sixth don't. So the count is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly four teams have \"evansville\" in their names.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. Each of these four teams has a row with the team name containing \"evansville\", so I'll list those cells by their row indices and the column name, which is \"team\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells will be rows 0,1,2,3, each in the \"team\" column.\n\nThat should cover it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because exactly four teams have \"evansville\" in their names.

It's stating that Bosse Field is the most used venue among all listed venues in the table. So, my task is to check how many times each venue appears in the table and see if Bosse Field has the highest count.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: team, sport, played (which seems to be years), venue, championships. I'm only concerned with the 'venue' column for this claim.\n\nLet me go through each row's venue:\n\n1. Row 0: bosse field\n2. Row 1: goebel soccer complex\n3. Row 2: roberts municipal stadium\n4. Row 3: goebel soccer complex again\n5. Row 4: goebel soccer complex once more\n6.

That means the claim that \"Bosse Field is the most used venue\" is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The claim is about the venue being the 'most used.' Since Goebel Soccer Complex appears three times, which is more than Bosse Field's one time, the statement is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, regarding relevant cells, since the claim talks about Bosse Field being the most used, I need to check all rows where venue is bosse field.

But regardless, the relevant part is checking if they don't win any championships.\n\nLooking at their row, the \"championships\" column has \"gmfl title 2008.\" So they did win a championship in 2008.\n\nBut the claim says they are the only team that do not win any championship. However, since Ohio River Bearcats actually won a championship (\"gmfl title 2008\"), this would mean the claim is incorrect because there's at least one team (them) that does win a championship. \n\nWait, no\u2014the claim is saying they don't win any. But they do have a championship listed. So the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says \"do not win,\" meaning they never win any. But here they did. So the claim is wrong because it's claiming they are the only team without any, but they actually have one.\n\nWait again\u2014no, perhaps I misread. Maybe the table shows that the Ohio River Bearcats won a championship in 2008. Therefore, the claim that \"they do not win any\" is false. But hold on, the claim says \"be the only team to that do not win a championship.\" So the claim is saying no championships for them, but they did.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, which cells are relevant? The team name and the championships column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has team and championships. So to check if their championships are none or not, we need both columns.\n\nBut in the claim, it's about whether they don't win any. So looking at their \"championships\" cell: value is \"gmfl title 2008.\" Therefore, they do have a championship, which contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the row for Ohio River Bearcats and specifically the \"championships\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that the Ohio River Bearcats did not win any championships, we check their entry in the table.
