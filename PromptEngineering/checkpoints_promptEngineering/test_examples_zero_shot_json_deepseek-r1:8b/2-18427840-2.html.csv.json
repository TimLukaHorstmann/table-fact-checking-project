    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"takaichi hirayama finish the event in 1.25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It mentions Takaichi Hirayama and a time of \"1.25\". So, my goal is to find if there's an entry for him in the table with exactly that time in the 'time' column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns like res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location, etc. I'll scan through each row to find Takaichi Hirayama.\n\nI go down each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: The opponent is Donald Cerrone. Not him.\n- Row 1: Opponent is Evan Dunham. No match.\n- Row 2: Mark Bocek. Nope.\n- Continue until I reach Row 10: Here, the name is Takaichi Hirayama.\n\nNow, checking his 'time' column in that row. It says \"7:28\". Wait, that's not 1.25. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another entry for him. Let me go further:\n\n- Row 11: Johil de Oliveira. Not Hirayama.\n- Row 12: Mateus Trindade. No.\n- Row 13: Diogo Oliveira. No match.\n- Row 14: Jorge Britto. Opponent, not the fighter in question.\n- Row 15: Felipe Arinelli. Different name.\n- Row 16: Joao Paulo. Not Hirayama.\n- Row 17: Adriano Abu. Opponent.\n\nWait a minute, so in the table, Takaichi Hirayama is only listed once at row 10 with a time of \"7:28\". There's no entry where his time is exactly 1.25 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any rows or misread the times. Maybe there's another occurrence elsewhere.\n\nGoing through each row again:\n\n- All other rows either don't have Takaichi Hirayama or list him with different times. So it seems he only has a time of \"7:28\" in his event.\n\nThe claim says he finished the event in 1.25, which doesn't match any of his listed times. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gabriel veiga lose in the third round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where Gabriel Veiga's record is in the table. Looking at the 'data' array, I see multiple rows with different fighters. The name \"gabriel veiga\" appears in one row. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first few rows have names like Donald Cerrone, Evan Dunham, Mark Bocek, etc.\n- Then there's Anthony Njokuani, Kamal Shalorus, Gleison Tibau, George Sotiropoulos...\n- Continuing down, I spot \"gabriel veiga\" in row number 8 (since it's zero-indexed, so row index 9 if counting from 1). Let me confirm that: yes, row 8 is [\"win\", \"9 - 2\", \"gabriel veiga\", ...].\n\nSo Gabriel Veiga has a win there. Now, the claim is about him losing in the third round. I need to check two things: whether he lost at all and if his loss was in the third round.\n\nLooking at the 'result' column (which is the second element in each row). For each row, the second element indicates the outcome. For example, \"win\", \"loss\", etc.\n\nBut wait, actually, looking again, each row has elements like [\"win\", \"9 - 2\", \"gabriel veiga\", ...]. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again. Each row seems to be structured as [Result, Record, Fighter's Name, Event, Rounds, Location].\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is: Result (like Win/Loss), fighter's record before the fight, fighter's name, event, rounds, location.\n\nSo for Gabriel Veiga's row (row 9 if starting from 0): [\"win\", \"9 - 2\", \"gabriel veiga\", \"fury fc 5 - final conflict\", \"3\", \"5:00\", \"sao paulo , brazil\"]. Wait, so the third element is his name. Then the result is 'win', and he had a record of 9-2 before that fight.\n\nWait, but the claim is about him losing in the third round. So I need to see if he has any losses, and whether any of those losses were in round 3.\n\nLooking through all rows, I'm looking for a row where the fighter's name is \"gabriel veiga\" and the result is 'loss'. Let me scan again:\n\n- Row 0: Donald Cerrone - win\n- Row1: Evan Dunham - loss? No, wait, his result is 'win', as per the data. Wait no, each row has the fighter's name in the third position.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me look at a sample row: For example, row 0 is [\"win\", \"5 - 2\", \"johil de oliveira\", ...]. So the first element is result, second is record, third is fighter's name.\n\nSo for Gabriel Veiga, his row is in row index 9 (assuming he's the 10th entry), and that row is: [\"win\", \"9 - 2\", \"gabriel veiga\", \"fury fc 5 - final conflict\", \"3\", \"5:00\", \"sao paulo , brazil\"]. So result is 'win', record was 9-2, and he fought in round 3.\n\nWait, so that's a win. Now, I need to check if Gabriel Veiga lost any fights in the third round.\n\nLooking for rows where his name is \"gabriel veiga\" and result is 'loss'. But in the table provided, the only occurrence of his name is in row index 9, which shows a win. So he didn't lose that fight. Are there any other rows with his name?\n\nContinuing through the list:\n\n- Row 10: diogo oliveira - submission\n- Row11: jorge britto - loss\n- Row12: felipe arinelli - win\n- Row13: joao paulo - decision\n- Row14: adriano abu - loss\n\nNo, I don't see another row with \"gabriel veiga\" as the fighter. So he only has one recorded fight in the table, which was a win.\n\nTherefore, Gabriel Veiga did not lose any fights in the third round because he hasn't lost at all in the data provided. The claim that he lost in the third round is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the fighter's results. After reviewing the table, Gabriel Veiga only has one recorded fight which was a win, so he did not lose in the third round.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

My goal is to find a row that matches all these criteria: Adriano Abu won in the 3rd round of his first fight against someone from Juiz de Fora.\n\nI'll start by checking each row for the fighter's name \"adriano abu\". Scanning through the data, I see:\n\n- Row 18: loss at 0-1 against Adriano Ab\u00fa. So this is a loss, not a win.\n- Wait, actually, looking again, I might have misread that. Let me check row 18 more carefully.\n\nWait no, row 18 is:\n[\n  \"loss\",\n  \"0 - 1\",\n  \"adriano abu\",\n  ...\n]\nSo this is Adriano Ab\u00fa defeating someone else (the fighter's name isn't specified here, but the outcome is a loss for the other person). So in this row, Adriano Abu wins, but it's not clear if it's his first fight.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nI need to find a row where:\n- The fighter is \"adriano abu\".\n- He wins.\n- In the 3rd round (looking for column \"round\" or similar).\n- It's his first fight against someone from Juiz de Fora.\n\nFirst, I'll scan each row for \"adriano abu\".\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 0: ... no\nRow 1: ... no\n...\nWait, actually, let me look at row 18 (index starts at 0? Or is it zero-based or one-based?). Wait, in the given table, the first fight would be row 18 if counting from 0. Let's see:\n\nLooking for \"adriano abu\" as the fighter.\n\nI think I might have misread earlier. The claim mentions Adriano Abu winning his first Juiz de Fora fight. So looking at the rows, perhaps row 18 (if starting count from 0) or maybe another index.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n\nRow 0: ... (first one)\n...\nLooking for \"adriano abu\" as the fighter and a win.\n\nI think I might have misread earlier. Let me check each row's \"fighter\" column.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 18: The fighter is \"adriano abu\", outcome is loss.\n- Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing fighters and opponents.\n\nWait, in the table, for each row, the first cell after 'round' or similar might be the outcome, but perhaps it's better to look at the row where \"adriano abu\" is listed as the fighter.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: ... no\n...\nLooking at row 18 (assuming rows are 0-based):\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided by the user, there are 19 rows (from index 0 to 18). Let me look for any row where \"adriano abu\" is involved.\n\nLooking at row 18:\n\n[\n  \"loss\",\n  \"0 - 1\",\n  \"adriano abu\",\n  ...\n]\n\nSo here, the outcome is loss, which doesn't match the claim of a win. So this can't be it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting rows. Let me recount: from the given table, each entry is a separate row, so row indices are from 0 to 18 (19 rows total).\n\nLooking for \"adriano abu\" as the fighter:\n\n- Row 18: Adriano Ab\u00fa vs someone else, outcome loss.\n- Another row: looking for where Adriano Abu wins.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the opponents. Maybe in another row, Adriano Ab\u00fa is fighting and has won.\n\nLooking at row 17 (last but one):\n\n[\n  \"win\",\n  \"1 - 1\",\n  \"joao paulo\",\n  ...\n]\n\nNo, this is a win for Jo\u00e3o Paulo against Adriano Ab\u00fa? Or vice versa?\n\nWait, the 'opponent' might be in another column. Wait, perhaps I need to look at each row's details.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table structure isn't clear. Perhaps each row has the fighter, opponent, round, and other info.\n\nBut without knowing exactly which columns correspond to what, it's tricky.\n\nWait, looking back: the user provided a sample JSON where \"relevant_cells\" include row_index and column_name. So perhaps each row has multiple columns, like 'fighter', 'opponent', 'round', etc.\n\nAssuming that in each row, there is a column for the fighter's name, round number, event location, etc.\n\nSo to check the claim, I need to find a row where:\n\n- Fighter: Adriano Ab\u00fa\n- Outcome: Win\n- Round: 3rd (so round_number = 3)\n- Event: First Juiz de Fora fight\n\nWait, but the term \"first juiz de fora fight\" might be in an event column or location.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"juiz de fora\" is the opponent's name? Or the location of the fight?\n\nI think \"Juiz de Fora\" refers to a city or venue where the fight took place. So perhaps there's a column indicating the location.\n\nBut without knowing exactly which columns correspond to what, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table's rows include the following columns: fighter, opponent, round, outcome, etc.\n\nAssuming that:\n\nEach row has:\n- Fighter (adriano abu)\n- Opponent\n- Round number\n- Outcome (win/loss)\n- Maybe other info like scores\n\nSo looking for a row where:\n\n1. Fighter is Adriano Ab\u00fa.\n2. Outcome is Win.\n3. Round is 3rd round.\n4. The opponent's name or location includes \"Juiz de Fora\".\n\nWait, but the term \"first Juiz de Fora fight\" might be referring to the first time he fought in Juiz de Fora, which could be indicated by a column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"juiz de fora\" is the opponent's city, so the location column would have that.\n\nBut without knowing, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake earlier and there's no such row.\n\nGiven all this confusion, maybe there's no row matching the claim, meaning the answer is that the task is impossible or that such a fight doesn't exist in the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that \"first juiz de fora fight\" refers to the first time Adriano Ab\u00fa fought in Juiz de Fora, and perhaps the location column has that.\n\nSo to break it down:\n\n- Find rows where fighter is Adriano Ab\u00fa.\n- Check if any such row has outcome as Win.\n- Check if any such row's round is 3rd.\n- Check if the location is Juiz de Fora (or opponent's location is that).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Juiz de Fora\" refers to a particular event or series, which could be in another column.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps I should conclude that based on the data provided, there's no such row matching all criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that no such fight exists in the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying a specific fight involving Adriano Ab\u00fa where he wins in the third round during his first fight in Juiz de Fora. After carefully analyzing each row of the provided data, it's evident that no such record exists. Adriano Ab\u00fa is documented only as having lost to another fighter in what appears to be his initial encounter. Thus, the requested information cannot be found within the given data.\n\nAnswer: There is no such fight in the provided data.",

It mentions an opponent named Takaichi Hirayama, a time of 1:25, and a location in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, the relevant ones here are \"opponent,\" \"event,\" \"method,\" \"time,\" \"location,\" and \"record.\" The claim specifically refers to the opponent and their fight details, so I need to find the exact row where Takaichi Hirayama fought and check if it matches the claim.\n\nI'll scan each row for the opponent's name. In row 14 (row_index: 18) of the data, the opponent is listed as \"takaichi hirayama.\" That seems relevant because it matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I'll look at the event details. The column \"event\" in this row says \"tfmma - top fighter mma 2,\" which doesn't seem to match any specific event mentioned in the claim. However, the important parts are the opponent's name and their fight location.\n\nThe time column for this row is \"n / a,\" which stands for not applicable or not provided.

Scanning through the data, I see that there's a row where the opponent is Jorge Britto. Let me find that specific row.\n\nLooking at each entry:\n\n- The first few rows have opponents like Donald Cerrone, Evan Dunham, etc.\n- Then I spot a row where \"opponent\" is \"jorge britto\". That's row index 17 (since it starts from 0, the 18th row in the data array).\n\nNow, in that row, what is the method? The column for method says \"decision (split)\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"mateus trindade lose 4 - 2 in round 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then check against the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Mateus Trindade lost a fight where his score was 4-2, and this loss occurred in round 1.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any entries related to Mateus Trindade. The table has several rows, each representing a different fight event with various details like opponent, method of victory or loss, etc.\n\nI need to search for \"Mateus Trindade\" in the 'opponent' column because that's where his name appears as an opponent for other fighters. Alternatively, it might be under another column, but typically opponents are listed there. Wait, actually, looking at the table structure, each row represents a fight event, and the second element (after \"res\") is the fighter's record in the format \"X - Y\". The third element is the opponent.\n\nSo for example, in row 13: \"7 - 2\" is his record against Mauricio Souza. But I'm looking for when Mateus Trindade lost a fight with a score of 4-2 in round 1.\n\nI should check each row where the 'opponent' is someone else and see if any of those fights have a result of loss for Mateus Trindade, specifically with a score of 4-2 in round 1.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 13: Mateus Trindade vs. Danilo Cherman. Result was a win for Trindade with a submission (kimura). So this isn't a loss.\n\nRow 14: He fought Thiago Minu and won again via rear naked choke. Not a loss.\n\nRow 15: Johil de Oliveira defeated him, but that's another fighter's perspective, so in Trindade's record, he lost to Johil? Wait, no. Let me check the table structure again. Each row seems to represent a fight event, and \"res\" is the result for that fighter in that particular match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 'opponent' column lists who he fought against, but the outcome is shown in 'res'. So for example, in row 13: res is \"8 - 2\", so that's Trindade's record after that fight, and the opponent was Danilo Cherman. If res starts with a number greater than or equal to 1, it means he won. If less than 1, maybe he lost.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table: each row seems to be structured as [res, opponent, method, etc.] So for example, row 0: res is \"lose\", which might not be a number. Wait, actually, I think I need to re-examine how the data is presented.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0:\n\"res\": \"lose\",\nopponent: \"adriano abu\",\nmethod: \"decision (split)\",\netc.\n\nSo perhaps res isn't directly indicating the score but whether he won or lost. But in later rows, like row 13, it's \"8 - 2\", which seems to indicate his record after that fight. So maybe each row is a different fight, and 'res' shows his total record up to that point.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the numbers keep increasing. For example, the last few rows have res like \"0 - 1\" or \"2 - 1\", which suggests it's his overall record. So each row is a fight he had, and 'res' shows his current record after that fight.\n\nWait, but then in row 13: res is \"7 - 2\". Then row 14: res is \"6 - 2\", which would mean he lost a point. That can't be right because it's the same fighter. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the table is structured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a specific fight event, and the 'res' field indicates whether he won or lost that particular fight, not his overall record. But looking at row 0: res is \"lose\", opponent is \"adriano abu\". Then row 1: res is \"win\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine this differently. Maybe each row is a fight event, and 'res' indicates the result for that fighter in that match. So if res is \"lose\", it means he lost that particular fight, while \"win\" means he won.\n\nBut then, looking at rows 13 onwards:\n\nRow 13: res is \"7 - 2\" against Danilo Cherman. If res is his record after the fight, then it's 7-2, which suggests he won.\n\nWait, perhaps 'res' is showing his overall record up to that point. So row 0 might be an early fight where he lost, making his record 0-1, but in later rows, he's winning more fights, so his record increases.\n\nBut then, the claim is about him losing 4-2 in round 1. That would mean after one round (round 1), he had a score of 4-2 against someone, implying he lost that fight because it's a negative result. But in the table, I don't see any row where res is \"lose\" with a score of 4-2.\n\nWait, perhaps 'res' isn't directly showing the score but the result as win or loss. So if he lost, 'res' would be \"lose\", but then how does the score come into play? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row's res is his overall record after that fight, and the score 4-2 refers to a specific round within a match. For example, in some matches, fighters have multiple rounds, like in a best-of-five series or something.\n\nWait, but in mixed martial arts, most fights are decided in one round. So perhaps the 'res' field is not indicating the overall record but the outcome of that particular fight.\n\nLooking again: row 0: res \"lose\", opponent \"adriano abu\". So he lost that fight against Adriano Abu.\n\nRow 1: res \"win\", opponent someone else, and so on.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps each row is a separate fight, and 'res' indicates whether he won or lost that fight. Then, there would be no mention of scores here because in most cases, it's either a win or loss.\n\nBut the claim mentions a score of 4-2, which suggests it was a split decision or something similar where points are awarded to each fighter across multiple rounds.\n\nWait, maybe each fight has multiple rounds, and 'res' shows his total points from that fight. So in a five-round match, if he scored 4 points against an opponent and lost the majority, it would be shown as 4-2.\n\nBut I'm not sure how the table is structured. It seems like each row represents a single event or fight, with 'res' indicating the outcome (win/lose) and perhaps his score in that particular match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is structured such that the first number after 'res' is his score, and the second number is his opponent's score. For example:\n\nRow 0: res \"1-2\", meaning he scored 1 point against an opponent who scored 2 points, resulting in a loss for him.\n\nRow 1: res \"3-1\", meaning he won with 3 points to 1.\n\nBut looking at the data, row 0: res is \"lose\", which might correspond to scoring less than his opponent. If so, then maybe each 'res' entry includes both his score and his opponent's, separated by a hyphen.\n\nSo if that's the case, in row 0: he lost (since res is \"lose\") with a score of 1-2 against Adriano Abu. Then in another fight, say row 13: res would be \"8-2\", meaning he scored 8 points against Danilo Cherman and won.\n\nBut then, where does the 4-2 come from? If he lost a fight with a score of 4-2, that would mean he lost that particular match where he had 4 points to his opponent's 2. But in the table, I don't see any row where 'res' is \"lose\" and has a score of 4-2.\n\nWait, perhaps the scores are cumulative over multiple fights. So res \"7-2\" would mean that after several fights, he had 7 points in total and 2 losses. But then, it's not specific to a single fight.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to clarify how the 'res' field is structured. It seems like each row is a separate fight event, with 'res' indicating whether he won or lost that particular fight. If res starts with \"win\" or \"lose\", then perhaps the numbers after it represent something else, like his current record.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first number represents points earned in that fight, and the second number is the total number of wins/losses. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should look for any row where he lost a fight with a score indicating 4-2. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the claim refers to him losing with a score of 4-1 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table uses 'res' as his overall record, and each fight contributes points towards that record. So in row 0: he lost, making his record 0-1. In row 13: after defeating Danilo Cherman, his record is 7-2. So in between, he must have had multiple wins and losses.\n\nBut then, the claim refers to a specific instance where he lost with a score of 4-2, which would mean that at some point, his overall points were 4 and he lost, but I'm not sure how that works in this table structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each fight has multiple rounds, and 'res' shows the final score after all rounds. So if he had a fight with someone where he scored 4 points against 2 from his opponent, resulting in him losing that match, then res would be \"lose\" with scores 4-2.\n\nBut looking through the table, I don't see any row where 'res' starts with \"lose\" and has numbers after it. Most of the rows either have \"win\", \"lose\" without additional info or a score.\n\nWait, maybe in the table, 'res' is just \"win\" or \"lose\", and the scores are only mentioned when there's a draw, like 3-3 for a draw, but I don't see any such entries here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers after 'res' indicate something else, like his rank or opponent's rank, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nGiven that, maybe the claim is incorrect or based on incomplete information. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the table is structured.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, there isn't a clear instance where he lost with a score of 4-2. Therefore, it's likely that either the data is insufficient, or the claim has an error.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, it appears that there is no specific instance within the table where the fighter lost a match with a score of 4-2. The table structure seems to indicate individual fight outcomes without explicit score details. Therefore, the claim likely refers to incorrect or missing information in the dataset.\n\n**Answer:** There is insufficient evidence in the provided data to confirm that the fighter lost a match with a score of 4-2.",
