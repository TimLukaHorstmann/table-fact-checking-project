    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the game against iowa take place at memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for rows where the opponent is Iowa. Let's go through each row in the data.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is North Dakota State.\nRow 1: Opponent is Rison.\nRow 2: Opponent is Oklahoma A&M.\nRow 3: Opponent is Stanford.\nRow 4: Opponent is Iowa. Here we have a match.\nRow 5: Opponent is Wisconsin.\nRow 6: Opponent is Northwestern.\nRow 7: Opponent is Cornell (IA).\nRow 8: Opponent is Michigan.\nRow 9: Opponent is Ohio State.\n\nSo, the game against Iowa is in row index 4. Now, I need to check the \"site\" column for this row. The site listed is \"memorial stadium minneapolis , mn.\" \n\nThe claim also mentions that the game was at \"memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn.\" There's a slight difference: in the table, it's written as \"memorial stadium minneapolis , mn,\" without the comma after the stadium name. But generally, both formats are acceptable and likely referring to the same location.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in row 4 under the \"site\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the game against Iowa did take place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the game against Michigan take place at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for rows in the table where the opponent is Michigan. Let me scan through each row's \"opponent\" column.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is North Dakota State\n- Row 1: Opponent is Rison\n- Row 2: Opponent is Oklahoma A&M\n- Row 3: Opponent is Stanford\n- Row 4: Opponent is Iowa\n- Row 5: Opponent is Wisconsin\n- Row 6: Opponent is Northwestern\n- Row 7: Opponent is Cornell (IA)\n- Row 8: Opponent is Michigan\n\nOkay, so the game against Michigan is in row 8. Now, I need to check where this game took place. The \"site\" column for each row lists the venue.\n\nRow 8's site is \"michigan stadium ann arbor , mi\". Hmm, that's different from the claim which mentions Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis. So the location doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check if there are any other games against Michigan or if the opponent is correctly identified. Let me make sure row 8 is indeed Michigan. Yes, it says \"michigan\" as the opponent.\n\nSo, according to the table, when Michigan played, it was at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, MI, not Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis. Therefore, the claim's location doesn't match the actual site from the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any game against Michigan occurred at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis. \n\nFrom the table:\n- The opponent \"Michigan\" is only listed in row 8.\n- The site for this game is \"michigan stadium ann arbor , mi\".\n\nSince the claimed venue doesn't match, the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
