    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"after week 10, the result of the game play at soldier field be w 31 - 29.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"after week 10,\" so I'm looking for games that occurred in weeks after week 10. Wait, actually, let me check: the table lists weeks from 1 to 16, with game dates as far as December 17, 1978. So week 10 is a specific point in time.\n\nThe claim specifies \"the result of the game play at soldier field be w 31 - 29.\" I need to find a game that took place at Soldier Field after week 10 and had the result of W (win) 31-29.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week. The columns include \"week,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"result,\" \"game site,\" \"record,\" and \"attendance.\"\n\nI should look for any game where:\n1. Week is greater than 10, so starting from week 11 onwards.\n2. The \"game site\" is Soldier Field.\n3. The \"result\" is a win with the score of 31-29.\n\nLet me go through each row starting from week 11:\n\nWeek 11: vs Baltimore Colts at Kingdome. Result is L 14-17. Not a win and not at Soldier Field.\n\nWeek 12: vs Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. W 13-10, but not at Soldier Field.\n\nWeek 13: vs Oakland Raiders at Oakland - Alameda County Coliseum. W 17-16, but not at Soldier Field.\n\nWeek 14: vs Cleveland Browns at Kingdome. W 47-24, so this is a win, but the site is Kingdome, not Soldier Field.\n\nWeek 15: vs San Diego Chargers at San Diego Stadium. L 10-37, not relevant.\n\nWeek 16: vs Kansas City Chiefs at Kingdome. W 23-19, again at Kingdome.\n\nNone of these weeks after week 10 have a game at Soldier Field with the result of W 31-29.\n\nWait, I might be missing something. Let me check week 10's details to ensure there isn't an earlier occurrence. Week 10: vs Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, result is W 31-29. But since the claim says \"after week 10,\" that game would be before week 10, so it doesn't apply.\n\nTherefore, in the weeks after week 10 (weeks 11 to 16), there's no game at Soldier Field with a win and score of 31-29. So the claim seems to be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is specifically about the game result at Soldier Field being 31-29. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim mentions \"the result of the game play at soldier field be 31 - 29.\" So, it's talking about a specific game that took place at Soldier Field, and the score was 31-29 in favor of one team.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The data rows have each game's details. So, my task is to find which row corresponds to the game played at Soldier Field with a result of 31-29.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the table. Let me go through each one:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent San Diego Chargers, result l 20-24, site Kingdome.\n2. Week 2: Pittsburgh Steelers, result l 10-21, Three Rivers Stadium.\n3. Week 3: New York Jets, w 24-17, Shea Stadium.\n4. Week 4: Detroit Lions, w 28-16, Kingdome.\n5. Week 5: Denver Broncos, l 7-28, Mile High Stadium.\n6. Week 6: Minnesota Vikings, w 29-28, Kingdome.\n7. Week 7: Green Bay Packers, l 28-45, Milwaukee County Stadium.\n8. Week 8: Oakland Raiders, w 27-7, Kingdome.\n9. Week 9: Denver Broncos, l 17-20 OT, Kingdome.\n10. Week 10: Chicago Bears, w 31-29, Soldier Field.\n\nOh, here in week 10, the game was against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, and the result is w 31-29. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, I need to check if this row has all the relevant information. The 'result' column shows \"w 31 - 29,\" which is a win for whoever that team is. The game site is Soldier Field, which is mentioned in the claim. The opponent is Chicago Bears, but the claim doesn't specify the opponent, so maybe it's not necessary unless the claim requires knowing who won.\n\nWait, the claim is about the result being 31-29. So the key columns here are 'result' and 'game site.' Both of these should match the claim. The result is a win with the score 31-29, and the game was played at Soldier Field.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells in this row are:\n\n- Row index 10 (since weeks go from 1 to 16, so week 10 is the 10th row after zero-indexing, which might be tricky here. Wait, looking back, the table starts with week 1 as the first row, so week 10 would be the 10th element in the data array, which is index 9 if we start counting from 0. But wait, let me check:\n\nThe data array has 16 rows, each representing a week from 1 to 16. So week 1 is index 0, week 2 is index 1, and so on up to week 16 at index 15. Therefore, week 10 would be at index 9.\n\nWait no, the user provided the table as data starting with [1, \"september 3...\"], which I think corresponds to week 1. So each row is a week, with the first element being the week number. So for week 10, it's the 10th row, which would be index 9 in the array.\n\nBut when creating the relevant_cells, we need to use the row_index as per their position in the data array. So if the data starts at 0, then week 1 is index 0, week 2 index 1, etc., so week 10 is index 9.\n\nSo for each relevant cell:\n\n- Row index: 9 (since it's the 10th row in a zero-based array)\n- Column names: 'result' and 'game site'.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be two objects: one pointing to row 9, column 'result', and another to row 9, column 'game site'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches exactly with week 10's game at Soldier Field resulting in a win for the home team with the score 31-29. The relevant cells are the result and game site columns of that specific row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
