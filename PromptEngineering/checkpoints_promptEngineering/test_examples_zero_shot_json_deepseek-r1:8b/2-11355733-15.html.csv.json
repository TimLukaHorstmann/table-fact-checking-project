    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination. The claim is: \"denis menchov on the rabobank team score 40 uci point.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Subject**: Denis Menchov\n2. **Affiliation**: Rabobank team\n3. ** Achievement**: Scored 40 UCI points\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: cyclist, country, team, time, uci points. So, I need to find the row where the cyclist is Denis Menchov and check if his team is Rabobank.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Cyclist is Vladimir Karpets. Not Denis.\n- **Row 1**: Cyclist is Denis Menchov. Team is Rabobank. That's relevant because it matches both the cyclist and team in the claim.\n- **Row 2**: Michael Rogers, not Denis.\n- Row 3 onwards: None are Denis Menchov.\n\nNext, I need to check his UCI points. In row 1, under \"uci points\" column, it says \"40\". So that matches as well.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: only row 1 is relevant because it contains both cyclist and team details for Denis Menchov.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"uci points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"denis menchov score the most uci point of any cyclist from russia\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Denis Menchov in the table. Scanning through each row's first cell, which represents the cyclist's name, I find him in the second row (index 1). So row_index is 1 and column_name is \"cyclist\".\n\nNext, I need to check his UCI points. In that same row, under the \"uci points\" column, it says 40.\n\nNow, I have to verify if this is indeed the highest among all Russian cyclists in the table. Looking through each cyclist from Russia:\n\n1. Vladimir Karpets has 50 points.\n2. Denis Menchov has 40 points.\n3. Michael Rogers isn't Russian.\n4. Christophe Moreau isn't Russian.\n5. \u00d3scar Sevilla isn't Russian.\n6. Francisco Mancebo isn't Russian.\n7. John Gadret isn't Russian.\n8. Marcos Antonio Serrano isn't Russian.\n9. Laurens Ten Dam isn't Russian.\n10. Janez Brajkovi\u010d isn't Russian.\n\nWait, Vladimir Karpets is from Russia and has 50 UCI points, which is higher than Denis Menchov's 40. That means the claim that Denis Menchov has the most UCI points among Russian cyclists is FALSE because Karpets has more.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Vladimir Karpets has higher UCI points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cyclist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"uci points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"john gadret on the ag2r pr\u00e9voyance team score 15 uci point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see what information it provides:\n\n1. **John Gadret**: The claim mentions \"john gadret,\" so I should find his row in the table.\n2. **Team**: It says he's on the \"ag2r pr\u00e9voyance team.\" I need to check if this is correct based on the table.\n3. **UCI Points**: The claim states that he scored 15 UCI points. I'll verify this number against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part, locating John Gadret in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: \"vladimir karpets\"\n- Row 1: \"denis menchov\"\n- Row 2: \"michael rogers\"\n- Row 3: \"christophe moreau\"\n- Row 4: \"\\u00f3scar sevilla\"\n- Row 5: \"francisco mancebo\"\n- Row 6: \"john gadret\" \u2013 found him in row index 6.\n\nNext, checking his team. The claim says \"ag2r pr\u00e9voyance.\" Looking at row 6's 'team' column, it indeed lists \"ag2r pr\\u00e9voyance,\" which matches the claim. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, for the UCI points. The claim states he scored 15. In row 6, under 'uci points', the value is \"15.\" That's a match as well.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the answer should be TRUE. Now, I need to map which cells in the table support this conclusion.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 6 for john gadret\n- Column 'team' for ag2r pr\u00e9voyance\n- Column 'uci points' for 15\n\nSo, listing these as objects with row_index and column_name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"uci points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the team ag2r pr\u00e9voyance cumulatively have more point than caisse d'epargne.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There are five columns: cyclist, country, team, time, and uci points. The data has multiple rows, each representing a different cyclist.\n\nThe claim is about two teams: ag2r pr\u00e9voyance and caisse d'epargne. So, I need to find all cyclists from these two teams in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Cyclist is Vladimir Karpets, team is caisse d'epargne. That's one cyclist from caisse d'epargne.\n2. Second row: Denis Menchov, team rabobank. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Michael Rogers, team t-mobile. Not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Christophe Moreau, team ag2r pr\u00e9voyance. Now we have a cyclist from ag2r pr\u00e9voyance.\n5. Fifth row: \u00d3scar Sevilla, team relax - gam. Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: Francisco Mancebo, same team as above. Not relevant.\n7. Seventh row: John Gadret, team ag2r pr\u00e9voyance. Another cyclist from ag2r.\n8. Eighth row: Marcos Antonio Serrano, team karpin - galicia. Not relevant.\n9. Ninth row: Laurens ten Dam, team unibetcom. Not relevant.\n10. Tenth row: Janez Brajkovi\u010d, team discovery channel. Not relevant.\n\nSo, I have two cyclists from ag2r pr\u00e9voyance and one from caisse d'epargne in the table.\n\nWait, no, actually, only Christophe Moreau is listed under ag2r pr\u00e9voyance, right? Because looking back, row 4 is Christophe Moreau with team ag2r, so that's one cyclist. The fifth and sixth rows are for relax - gam, so not relevant to either team.\n\nWait, the claim is about \"the team ag2r pr\u00e9voyance cumulatively have more point than caisse d'epargne.\" So we need to sum up the uci points for all cyclists in ag2r and compare it to those in caisse d'epargne.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- For ag2r: Only Christophe Moreau has 30 points (row 4).\n- For caisse d'epargne: Only Vladimir Karpets has 50 points (row 1).\n\nSo, adding up, ag2r has 30 and caisse has 50. Therefore, the claim is false because caisse has more points.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: We need all rows where team is either ag2r pr\u00e9voyance or caisse d'epargne. That includes row 0 (caisse) and row 4 (ag2r). So the relevant_cells should be these two rows, noting which column it's in\u2014probably \"team\" and maybe \"uci points\"? Wait, no. The columns are cyclist, country, team, time, uci points.\n\nThe claim is about the team's cumulative points, so I think we need to check the \"team\" column for both teams, but also verify their points. So each relevant cell would be where either of these teams appear in the \"team\" column and their corresponding \"uci points\".\n\nBut looking at the example provided, they included only the columns that are directly related. In the sample, the relevant cells were two different rows, but maybe just the team column? Or perhaps the uci points as well.\n\nWait, the claim is about the cumulative points of the team, so I think we need to check each cyclist's \"uci points\" for those in ag2r and caisse. Therefore, each row where the team is either of them would be relevant, specifically their \"team\" and \"uci points\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the rows for these two teams, focusing on the \"team\" column to identify which cyclists belong to each team.\n\nBut the example given includes columns like Revenue and Employees, so perhaps in this case, we need to include both the team and uci points. Or maybe just the team, since it's about the team's total points.\n\nWait, let me re-read the instructions. It says: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" And for relevant_cells, list objects with row_index and column_name.\n\nSo I think we need to include all rows where the team is either ag2r pr\u00e9voyance or caisse d'epargne because those are the ones contributing to their teams' points. Each of these rows has a cyclist from each team, so we can track their uci points across multiple cyclists.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells would be:\n\n- For caisse d'epargne: row 0 (team and uci points)\n- For ag2r pr\u00e9voyance: row 4 (team and uci points), and also any other rows where team is ag2r. Wait, in the table provided, only row 4 has ag2r.\n\nSo relevant_cells would be:\n\n- row_index 0, column_name \"team\"\n- row_index 0, column_name \"uci points\"\n- row_index 4, column_name \"team\"\n- row_index 4, column_name \"uci points\"\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 0: team caisse d'epargne, uci 50\n\nRow 4: team ag2r pr\u00e9voyance, uci 30\n\nRows 5 and 6 have relax - gam, not relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 0's \"team\" and \"uci points\", and row 4's \"team\" and \"uci points\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because caisse has more points. The relevant cells are these four.\n\nWait, but in the example given, they included two columns: Revenue and Employees. So maybe for each relevant team, we include their corresponding rows' team and uci points.\n\nSo yes, the relevant_cells would be those.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"uci points\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"uci points\"}]}",
