    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"October 27, 1963 be the date of the game against Houston Oilers\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It's a JSON with columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The data rows each contain these five elements. So each row represents a game played on a specific date against a particular opponent, along with some other details.\n\nNow, the claim mentions October 27, 1963 as the date of a game against Houston Oilers. My task is to find if there's any row in the table that matches both the date and the opponent specified in the claim.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. The first row is week 1 on September 8, 1963, against Buffalo Bills.\n2. Week 2 on September 14 against Boston Patriots.\n3. Week 3 on September 29 against Kansas City Chiefs.\n4. Week 4 on October 6 against Denver Broncos.\n5. Week 5 on October 13 against New York Jets.\n6. Week 6 on October 20 against Kansas City Chiefs.\n7. Week 7 on October 27 against Oakland Raiders.\n8. Week 8 on November 2 against New York Jets.\n9. Week 9 on November 10 against Boston Patriots.\n10. Week 10 on November 17 against Buffalo Bills.\n11. Week 11 on December 1 against Houston Oilers.\n12. Week 12 on December 8 against Oakland Raiders.\n13. Week 13 on December 15 against Houston Oilers.\n14. Week 14 on December 22 against Denver Broncos.\n\nI'm scanning for the date October 27, which is mentioned in week 7 of the table. Looking at that row: it's against Oakland Raiders, not Houston Oilers. So that doesn't match the claim.\n\nNext, I check if there's any other game on October 27. From the data provided, only week 7 falls on that date, and it's against Oakland Raiders. There are no games listed after November, but the weeks go up to 14 in December. However, since all dates beyond November 2 are later than October 27, none of them will be relevant here.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any rows with the opponent Houston Oilers on that date. Looking through the opponents:\n\n- Houston Oilers appear in week 11 (December 1) and week 13 (December 15).\n\nSo there are games against Houston Oilers in December, but not in October. Therefore, the claim is specifically about a game on October 27 against Houston Oilers, which doesn't exist in the table.\n\nI should also consider if the week numbers or other data might affect this, but the key points are the date and opponent. Since both don't match for that specific claim, it must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies October 27, 1963 as the date against Houston Oilers. The table shows a game on that date against Oakland Raiders, not Houston Oilers. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
