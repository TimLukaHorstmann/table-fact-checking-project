    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Edgerrin James is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Edgerrin James be the number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are round, pick, overall, name, position, and college. The data rows represent different players with their respective draft information.\n\nI need to find Edgerrin James in the table. Looking at the \"name\" column, the first row is \"edgerrin james.\" So he's in row 0.\n\nNow, checking his draft stats: round is 1, pick is 4, overall is 4. That matches exactly what the claim says\u2014number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall.\n\nWait, but looking at the table data again, Edgerrin James has round 1, pick 4, and overall 4. So both conditions are correct. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Edgerrin James being the 4th pick in the first round and 4th overall, I'll check the relevant cells.\n\n1. **Name**: \"edgerrin james\" is found in row 0.\n2. **Round**: The value for this row is 1.\n3. **Pick**: The value is 4.\n4. **Overall**: The value is 4.\n\nSince all these numbers match the claim, it's true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
