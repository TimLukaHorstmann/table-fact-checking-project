    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"week 2 have more attendance than week 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should identify which weeks and their attendances are in question. The claim compares week 2 with week 1. Looking at the table, each row represents a different week of games. The 'week' column shows that the first week is week 1 on September 7th, and the second week is week 2 on September 14th. \n\nNext, I need to find the attendance figures for these two weeks. In the table, the 'attendance' column provides the number of people attending each game. For week 1, the attendance is 44773, and for week 2, it's 46460. \n\nComparing these two numbers: 46460 (week 2) is indeed higher than 44773 (week 1). Therefore, week 2 has a higher attendance than week 1.\n\nNow, considering the claim, since week 2's attendance is more than week 1's, the claim is TRUE. \n\nTo support this, I need to specify which cells are relevant. The 'row_index' refers to the index in the data array starting from 0. So, week 1 is at row 0 and week 2 is at row 1. The column for attendance is clearly \"attendance\".\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being row 0 and row 1 under the 'attendance' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is asking. It seems like it's stating that there are 16 weeks listed in the data provided. So, I should check how many entries there are in the \"week\" column of the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has a \"columns\" array which includes \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". The \"data\" array contains multiple rows, each representing a specific week with corresponding details.\n\nI'll go through each row to count the number of weeks. Starting from row 0 to row 15 (since arrays are zero-indexed), that's 16 entries in total. Each row has a \"week\" value ranging from 1 to 16 without any gaps or repeats.\n\nSo, the \"week\" column indeed lists all numbers from 1 through 16, each appearing exactly once.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says, \"the highest number of crowd attendance was on week 4.\" So first, I should understand what each part of this claim means.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, with corresponding details. My task is to check if week 4 indeed has the highest crowd attendance.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows are relevant. The claim mentions \"crowd attendance,\" so I should focus on the 'attendance' column. To find the highest, I need to compare all values in that column across all weeks.\n\nLet me go through each row's attendance number:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nNow, I'll list these numbers in order to see which week has the highest. Starting from the lowest:\n\n30936 (Week 13), 31500 approx? Wait, no, actually looking at the numbers again. Wait, maybe I should sort them.\n\nLet me write down all the attendance figures:\n\n44773, 46460, 59983, 80291, 47583, 46751, 44487, 56191, 52060, 46264, 46032, 47234, 30936, 65649, 42202, 51064.\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest seems to be 80291, which is Week 4. Next is 56191 (Week 8), then 52060 (Week 9), and so on.\n\nSo yes, Week 4 has the highest attendance. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'attendance' column is always relevant because it's directly related to the claim. Additionally, the week number in each row corresponds to the specific week being discussed. Since the claim refers to week 4, that cell (row_index:3, since indexing starts at 0) for the attendance is crucial.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. The 'attendance' value for Week 4 (row 3).\n2. All 'attendance' columns because we need to compare all values to confirm that Week 4 has the highest.\nWait, no\u2014the instruction says to identify which cells are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about whether Week 4 has the highest attendance, we need to check the attendance for each week but particularly focus on Week 4's attendance and ensure it's higher than all others.\n\nTherefore, the 'attendance' column in every row is relevant because without comparing them, you can't confirm which week has the highest. But according to the example given, it's about specifying which cells are used to verify the claim. So perhaps only the specific attendance cell for Week 4 and maybe all others because they might affect whether Week 4 is indeed the maximum.\n\nWait, but the instructions specify: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" So I need to make sure that Week 4's attendance is higher than any other week. Therefore, all cells in the 'attendance' column are relevant because each of them contributes to determining whether Week 4 is the highest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the 'attendance' column as a whole is relevant because we're comparing across weeks. So perhaps the 'attendance' column is the only relevant column, and all its cells need to be checked.\n\nBut looking at the example provided in the problem statement: The user's response included both the relevant_cells for each condition. In that case, if the claim was about something involving two columns, like revenue and employees, then they listed the cells from those columns.\n\nIn our case, the claim is solely based on attendance. So perhaps the only relevant cells are all the 'attendance' column entries because we need to check all of them to confirm that Week 4 has the highest number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the specific cell for Week 4 is relevant because it's the one being compared. But no, without knowing all the other attendances, you can't confirm if Week 4 is indeed the highest.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to include each cell in the 'attendance' column as relevant because they all contribute to verifying whether Week 4 has the highest attendance.\n\nBut wait, that would mean including 16 rows in the relevant_cells, which seems excessive. The example included two cells for two columns. So maybe for this claim, since it's about week 4 specifically, only the 'attendance' cell for Week 4 is relevant because it directly shows the number of attendees for that week.\n\nBut no, to verify if it's the highest, you need to compare all attendance numbers. Therefore, perhaps all cells in the 'attendance' column are relevant as they each represent a data point needed to determine the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about Week 4 having the highest, only the Week 4 cell and all other cells in case someone might question whether another week has higher. But I think according to the instructions, it's better to list all 'attendance' column cells as relevant because they are part of verifying the condition.\n\nBut wait, let me check: The user instruction says: \"You need to identify which specific data points or rows are used to verify the statement.\"\n\nSo for example, if you're saying that the price is higher than last year, you'd compare this year's price to all relevant data points from last year. Therefore, in this case, comparing Week 4's attendance to all other weeks' attendances.\n\nTherefore, perhaps only the 'attendance' cells for each week are relevant because each one contributes to determining whether Week 4 is indeed higher than all others.\n\nBut considering that the example included two columns (e.g., revenue and employees), their response listed cells from both. So in our case, since we're dealing with one column ('attendance'), perhaps only that column's cells are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be each row's attendance value because they all need to be considered when determining if Week 4 has the highest attendance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sufficient to list only the specific cell for Week 4 and all other 'attendance' cells. But I think in terms of instruction, you need to include all cells in the 'attendance' column as relevant because each one is a data point necessary for verifying that Week 4 has the highest attendance.\n\nBut perhaps another way: since the claim is about Week 4 being higher than any other week, it's sufficient to look at each week's attendance and compare against Week 4. So each 'attendance' cell is part of this comparison, meaning they are all relevant.\n\nHowever, in practice, including all 16 cells might be tedious but technically correct.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects only the 'attendance' column as a whole to be relevant because that's the criterion being evaluated. Therefore, maybe the relevant_cells include all rows for the attendance column.\n\nAlternatively, considering that Week 4 is at row index 3 (since counting starts from 0), the cell (3, \"Attendance\") would be the main one. But without checking others, you can't confirm if it's indeed the highest.\n\nIn conclusion, to verify the claim that Week 4 has the highest attendance, all 'attendance' cells are relevant because each provides a data point for comparison.\n</think>\n\nTo verify that Week 4 has the highest attendance compared to all other weeks, we need to examine the attendance figures across all weeks. The relevant data points are all the values in the 'Attendance' column, as each week's attendance is necessary to confirm that Week 4's attendance is indeed the highest.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement is true because Week 4 has the highest attendance among all weeks. To verify this, we compare all 'attendance' figures:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291 (highest)\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nThus, Week 4 has the highest attendance.\n\n**Relevant cells:** All cells in the 'Attendance' column (each week's attendance value).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which part of the claim relates to the data in the table. The claim mentions \"week 13,\" so I need to look at the row corresponding to week 13. In the table, each sub-array represents a week, starting from week 1 up to week 16. So week 13 is the 13th element in the data array.\n\nLooking at the columns provided: week, date, opponent, result, attendance. The relevant column here is \"attendance,\" as that's what the claim is about\u2014crowd attendance.\n\nNow, I need to check the attendance numbers for week 13 and compare it to other weeks. The data shows that in week 13, the attendance was 30936 people. \n\nI should list out all the attendances from the table to see which week has the least number. Let me go through each row:\n\nWeek 1: 44773\nWeek 2: 46460\nWeek 3: 59983\nWeek 4: 80291\nWeek 5: 47583\nWeek 6: 46751\nWeek 7: 44487\nWeek 8: 56191\nWeek 9: 52060\nWeek 10: 46264\nWeek 11: 46032\nWeek 12: 47234\nWeek 13: 30936\nWeek 14: 65649\nWeek 15: 42202\nWeek 16: 51064\n\nNow, I need to find which week has the lowest attendance. Let me arrange these numbers in order:\n\n30936 (Week 13), 31694? Wait, no, looking again. No, let's just list them out sorted:\n\n30936, 36032 (Wait, wait, actually, the lowest I see is Week 13 at 30936. Looking through all attendances: Week 13 has 30k, others have higher numbers except maybe some like Week 11 at 46k and Week 10 at 46k as well. Wait, but 30936 seems to be the smallest.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWeek 13: 30936\n\nOthers are higher, for example, Week 7 is 44487, which is higher than 30k. So yes, 30936 is indeed the lowest attendance in the table.\n\nSo the claim says that \"week 13 have the least number of crowd attend.\" Since week 13 has the lowest attendance compared to all other weeks listed, this should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The columns involved are \"week\" and \"attendance.\" So for week 13, both row index (which is 12 in the data array because it's zero-indexed) and the column names.\n\nWait, wait, let me check: in the table, each sub-array corresponds to a week starting from 1. So week 1 is index 0, week 2 is index 1, ..., week 13 is index 12. Therefore, row_index is 12 for week 13.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- For \"week\": column name \"week\" at row_index 12.\n- For \"attendance\": column name \"attendance\" at row_index 12.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both of these columns from that specific row.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example provided in the instructions, the relevant cells are objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" So for week 13, row index is 12 (since it's the 13th element, starting from 0), so row_index=12. The columns to include are \"week\" and \"attendance.\"\n\nSo, in the JSON response, I should have two objects: one with row_index 12 and column_name \"week,\" and another with row_index 12 and column_name \"attendance.\"\n\nWait, but wait again: the claim is about week 13 having the least attendance. So to verify that, we need to check the attendance number for week 13 against others. So in terms of data points, it's not just week 13's attendance; we also need all other attendances to confirm that week 13 is indeed the lowest.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I only need to identify which cells are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about whether week 13 has the least attendance, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The \"week\" column for week 13 (to confirm it's week 13).\n2. The \"attendance\" column for week 13 (to get the number of attendees).\n\nI don't need to compare against other weeks because that would be part of analyzing the data, but in terms of identifying which cells are relevant to check the claim, it's about knowing which week we're talking about and its attendance.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both \"week\" and \"attendance\" for row 12 (since row indices start at 0).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- answer is \"TRUE\"\n- relevant_cells are:\n  - {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  - {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as week 13 has the lowest attendance.

I'll look at their respective attendance numbers in the table.\n\nLooking through the columns, the relevant column for attendance is \"attendance\". Each row corresponds to a specific week, starting from week 1 up to week 16. So, for week 9, I need to find the row where week is 9 and get the attendance number.

Wait, no, in the JSON, the first element is row 0, which corresponds to week 1. So week 9 is at row index 8. Let me check: the first entry is week 1 (row 0), so week n would be at row n-1. Therefore, week 9 is at row 8 and week 10 is at row 9.\n\nLooking at the data:\nWeek 9 (row 8) has an attendance of 52060.\nWeek 10 (row 9) has an attendance of 46264.\n\nThe claim says that week 9 has 5796 more attendees than week 10.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest number of crowd attendance in week 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The data spans from week 1 to week 16, each with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"crowd attend[ance]\" in week 7. So, my first thought is to find the row corresponding to week 7 and check its attendance value. \n\nLooking through the rows, I can see that week 7 is the seventh entry in the data array. The date for week 7 is \"october 19 , 1980\", and the opponent is \"cincinnati bengals\". The result is a loss with a score of \"l 14 - 0\", and the attendance figure is 44487.\n\nNow, to confirm if this is the highest attendance in week 7, I need to check all other weeks' attendances for comparison. However, since the claim only mentions week 7, I should focus on whether week 7's attendance is indeed the highest among that specific week's data points.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, each row represents a different week, so week 7 has only one game. Therefore, it's the only attendance figure for week 7. The claim says it's the highest number of crowd attend in week 7, but since there's only one game that week, its attendance is automatically the highest by default.\n\nBut I might be misinterpreting the instruction. Perhaps the user meant to compare across weeks and see if week 7 has the maximum total attendance overall. However, the claim doesn't specify that it's the highest across all weeks, just for week 7. So within week 7, there's only one game, making its attendance the highest trivially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to compare week 7's attendance with previous or subsequent weeks. For thoroughness, I should check if any other week has a higher attendance than week 7.\n\nLooking at the attendance numbers:\n\nWeek 1: 44773\nWeek 2: 46460\nWeek 3: 59983\nWeek 4: 80291\nWeek 5: 47583\nWeek 6: 46751\nWeek 7: 44487\nWeek 8: 56191\nWeek 9: 52060\nWeek10:46264\nWeek11:46032\nWeek12:47234\nWeek13:30936\nWeek14:65649\nWeek15:42202\nWeek16:51064\n\nFrom this, I can see that week 4 has the highest attendance at 80291. Therefore, if the claim is about the overall highest attendance, it's FALSE because week 7 doesn't have the maximum. However, if the claim is only referring to week 7, then since there's only one game that week, it's technically TRUE because it's the only one.\n\nBut the claim says \"the highest number of crowd attend be in week 7\". It doesn't specify whether it's the overall highest or just within that week. Since each week has its own attendance, the term \"highest\" without qualification might refer to within that week, making it TRUE because it's the only game that week.\n\nAlternatively, if \"highest\" is meant across all weeks, then it's FALSE because other weeks have higher attendances. But based on how claims are usually interpreted, especially in contexts like sports, when someone refers to a week having the highest attendance, they're likely referring to within that particular week. Since there's only one game in week 7, its attendance is the highest for that week.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer should be TRUE because week 7's attendance is the highest for that specific week.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It\u2019s stating that in week 13, there was the highest attendance among all weeks listed in the table. So I need to check the attendance numbers for each week and see if week 13 has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week. The columns are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". To verify the claim, I'm particularly interested in the \"week\" and \"attendance\" columns.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows that correspond to week 13. From the table data, week 13 is the 13th row (index 12 if we start counting from zero). Let me double-check that:\n\nRow 0: Week 1\n...\nRow 12: Week 13\n\nYes, so row index 12 corresponds to week 13.\n\nNow, I need to extract the attendance value for week 13. Looking at row 12, the \"attendance\" is 30936. That's a specific number.\n\nNext, I should compare this attendance number with all other weeks to see if it's the highest. Let me list out all the attendances:\n\nWeek 1: 44773\nWeek 2: 46460\nWeek 3: 59983\nWeek 4: 80291\nWeek 5: 47583\nWeek 6: 46751\nWeek 7: 44487\nWeek 8: 56191\nWeek 9: 52060\nWeek 10: 46264\nWeek 11: 46032\nWeek 12: 47234\nWeek 13: 30936\nWeek 14: 65649\nWeek 15: 42202\nWeek 16: 51064\n\nNow, I'll go through each attendance number and see which is the highest. Let's list them out in order from highest to lowest:\n\nWeek 4: 80291\nWeek 3: 59983\nWeek 8: 56191\nWeek 9: 52060\nWeek 14: 65649\nWait, hold on. Week 14 has an attendance of 65649, which is higher than week 4's 80291? No, wait, 80291 is actually higher than 65649 because 80k is more than 65k. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, I think I might have made a mistake in ordering. Let me list all attendances:\n\nWeek 1: ~44k\nWeek 2: ~46k\nWeek 3: ~59k\nWeek 4: ~80k\nWeek 5: ~47k\nWeek 6: ~46k\nWeek 7: ~44k\nWeek 8: ~56k\nWeek 9: ~52k\nWeek 10: ~46k\nWeek 11: ~46k\nWeek 12: ~47k\nWeek 13: ~30k\nWeek 14: ~65k\nWait, no, week 4 is 80291, which is the highest. Then comes week 3 at 59983, then week 8 at 56191, week 9 at 52060, week 14 at 65649? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 65649 is less than 80k.\n\nWait no, I think I misread week 14's attendance. Looking back, row 13 (index 13) is week 14 with an attendance of 65649, and row 12 (index 12) is week 13 at 30936. So the highest attendance is week 4 at 80291.\n\nWait, no, wait: let me re-examine each week's attendance:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291 (highest so far)\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191 (second highest after week 4)\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649 (this is higher than week 3 and 8, but still less than week 4)\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nSo the highest attendance is week 4 with 80291.\n\nTherefore, week 13 does not have the most crowd attendance; it's much lower. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is FALSE because, based on the table, week 4 has the highest attendance of 80,291, which is more than week 13's attendance of 30,936.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table is in JSON format and has information about football games over weeks, including the date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim says: \"week 8 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10.\" Hmm, let me break this down. I need to check if the attendance for week 8 is exactly 5796 higher than week 10.\n\nFirst, I should find the relevant data points in the table. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, for each week mentioned in the claim (week 8 and week 10), I need to extract their respective attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll go through each row to locate weeks 8 and 10. Let's see:\n\n- Week 1: September 7 vs Atlanta Falcons, attendance 44773\n- Week 2: September 14 vs Philadelphia Eagles, 46460\n- Week 3: September 21 vs Chicago Bears, 59983\n- Week 4: September 28 vs Detroit Lions, 80291\n- Week 5: October 5 vs Pittsburgh Steelers, 47583\n- Week 6: October 12 vs Chicago Bears, 46751\n- Week 7: October 19 vs Cincinnati Bengals, 44487\n- Week 8: October 26 vs Green Bay Packers, 56191\n- Week 9: November 2 vs Washington Redskins, 52060\n- Week 10: November 9 vs Detroit Lions, 46264\n\nWait, I'm looking for weeks 8 and 10. So, week 8 has an attendance of 56,191. Week 10 is 46,264.\n\nNow, the claim says that week 8 has 5,796 more attendees than week 10. To check this, I need to calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n\nCalculating: 56,191 (week 8) - 46,264 (week 10) = let's see. Subtracting 46,264 from 56,191:\n\n56,191 minus 40,000 is 16,191. Then subtract 6,264 more: 16,191 - 6,264.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me do it step by step:\n\n46,264 + 5,796 = 52,060? Wait no, because week 8 has higher attendance, so the difference should be positive. So 56,191 minus 46,264 is indeed 9,927. Because 46,264 + 9,927 equals 56,191.\n\nWait, wait, that's not right. Let me compute it properly:\n\n56,191\n-46,264\n________\nSubtracting: \n\nStarting from the units place:\n1 -4: Can't do that, borrow.\n11 -4=7 (tens place)\n9 becomes 8 after borrowing.\n8 -6=2\n5 becomes 4 after borrowing.\n4 -4=0\nNow, subtract the remaining 5 (ten-thousands place): 50,000 -40,000=10,000. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to do it this way:\n\n46,264 + X =56,191\n\nX = 56,191 -46,264.\n\nLet me subtract step by step:\n\n46,264\n+ (56,191 -46,264)\n= ?\n\nCompute 56,191 minus 46,264:\n\nSubtracting each digit from right to left:\n\n1-4: Can't do. Borrow, so 11-4=7.\n8 becomes 7 after borrowing.\nTens place: 7 (after borrow) -6. Again, can't do, borrow. So 17-6=11.\nHundreds place: 5 becomes 4 after borrowing.\nThousands place: 4 -4=0.\nTen-thousands place: 50,000 -40,000=10,000.\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should line them up:\n\n56,191\n-46,264\n--------\nLet me write it as:\n\n  56191\n-46264\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n1 -4: Can't do, borrow. So 11-4=7.\nTens place: 8 (since we borrowed) becomes 7 after borrowing from hundreds place. Then 7-6=1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\n56,191 minus 46,264 is equal to?\n\nWell, 56,191 -40,000 =16,191.\n\nThen subtract 6,264 more: 16,191 -6,264.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n16,191\n-6,264\n--------\nSubtract step by step:\n1 (units) -4: borrow, so 11-4=7. Units digit is 7.\nTens place: 9 becomes 8 after borrowing from hundreds place.\n8 -6=2.\nHundreds place: 1 (after borrowing) minus 2? Can't do, so need to borrow again.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just calculate it numerically:\n\n56,191\n-46,264 = ?\n\nCompute 56,191 -46,264:\n\nSubtract 40,000 from both: 16,191 -6,264 =9,927.\n\nSo the difference between week8 and week10 is 9,927 attendees more in week8.\n\nBut the claim says that week8 has only 5,796 more. So it's incorrect. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in transcribing the numbers.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\nWeek 8: October26 vs Green Bay Packers, attendance 56,191.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWeek10: November9 vs Detroit Lions, attendance46,264. Correct.\n\nSo difference is 9,927, not 5,796.\n\nTherefore, the claim made is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe user's claim that Week 8 has 5,796 more attendees than Week 10 is incorrect. The actual difference is 9,927 more attendees in Week 8 compared to Week 10.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is incorrect. Week 8 had 9,927 more attendees than Week 10, not 5,796.",
