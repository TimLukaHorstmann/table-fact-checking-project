    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"xu huaiwen play in the women 's single from 2003 to 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Xu Huaiwen played in the women's singles category from the years 2003 through 2006. So, I need to check if there are any entries in the table for Xu Huaiwen during those specific years under the \"women 's singles\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: year, men 's singles, women 's singles, men 's doubles, women 's doubles, and mixed doubles. The data is provided in rows, each corresponding to a particular year.\n\nI need to go through each relevant row for the years 2003 to 2006 and check if Xu Huaiwen appears under the \"women 's singles\" column.\n\nStarting with 2003: In row 12 (since the table starts at index 0), the data is:\n- men's singles: Micha\u0142 \u0141ogosz Robert Mateusiak\n- women's singles: Xu Huaiwen\n\nSo, yes, Xu Huaiwen is present in 2003 for women's singles.\n\nNext, 2004: Row 13. Women's singles here are also Xu Huaiwen, so that's another year.\n\nMoving on to 2005: Row 14. Again, women's singles feature Xu Huaiwen.\n\nThen, 2006: Row 15. Here, the women's singles entry is again Xu Huaiwen.\n\nWait a minute, but looking closely at row indices, each year's data starts from index 0 as follows:\n\n- 1988: index 0\n- 1989: index 1\n- ...\n- 2003: index 12 (since 2003 - 1988 = 15 years, so starting from 0, it would be row 12)\n- Similarly, 2004 is index 13, 2005 is 14, and 2006 is 15.\n\nSo, for each of these rows (12 to 15), I need to check the \"women 's singles\" column.\n\nIn row 12 (2003): women's singles is Xu Huaiwen \u2192 relevant.\nRow 13 (2004): same.\nRow 14 (2005): same.\nRow 15 (2006): same.\n\nSo, Xu Huaiwen appears in the women's singles from 2003 to 2006 inclusive. That means the claim is TRUE because she played in those years in that category.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not missing any other cells. The claim also mentions \"play\", which might imply participation, but since the data shows her name under the women's singles column for each of those years, it confirms her participation.\n\nI don't see any reason to doubt this. So, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Xu Huaiwen played in the women 's singles from 2003 to 2006, we examine the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. For each year (2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006), check the \"women 's singles\" column.\n2. In each of these years (rows 12-15), Xu Huaiwen is listed under women's singles.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke playing together in the women's doubles for two consecutive years is true based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should look at the columns of the table. The relevant columns here are \"year,\" \"women 's singles,\" and \"women 's doubles.\" So, any information about Helle Nielsen or Marie Roepke would likely be in these columns.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to see if their names appear in the women's doubles column for consecutive years. \n\nLooking at the rows one by one:\n\n- 1988: No mention of either name.\n- 1989: Not seeing them here either.\n- 1998: Helle isn't listed; Marie is not present in this row as far as I can tell.\n- 1999: No, their names aren't here.\n- 2000: Helle appears twice but in different columns. In the women's doubles, it says \"claudia vogelgsang xu huaiwen.\" So Helle isn't playing doubles here.\n- 2001: Neither name is present.\n- 2002: Again, no.\n- 2003: Not seeing them in the doubles column.\n- 2004: In the women's doubles, it's \"kamila augustyn nadie\\u017cda kostiuczyk\" and Britta Andersen. So Marie isn't here either.\n- 2005: The women's doubles is \"vladislav druzhchenko johanna persson.\" No match.\n- 2006: In the women's doubles, it's \"jiang yanmei li yujia,\" so no.\n- 2007: The names are \"wang yihan\" and others, not Helle or Marie.\n- 2008: The doubles pair is \"diju valiyaveetil jwala gutta.\" No match.\n- 2009: In the women's doubles, it's \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" Oh, wait! Here they are together in 2009. So that's one year.\n- 2010: The doubles are listed differently; not seeing them here.\n- 2011: Their names aren't present.\n- 2012: No match.\n- 2013: Doubles pair is different.\n\nSo, Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke only played together in the women's doubles in 2009. Since they didn't play consecutively for two years (only once), the claim that they played together for two years in a row is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking at row_index 7 (since rows start from 0, but 2009 would be row 8?), wait no: let me recount. The table starts with 1988 as row 0 and goes up. So 2009 would be row 19 (because 2008 is row 18, 2009 is 19). In that row, the women's doubles column has \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row 19 under the \"women 's doubles\" column and any other year if they played together again. But since they only have one occurrence, I think only that cell is relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke only played together once in 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this decision. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Michael S\u00f8gaard play in the men 's double with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp.\" So, I need to check if Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in the men's doubles category.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for year, men's singles, women's singles, etc. The data rows represent each year from 1988 onwards, listing the names of players in each category.\n\nI should focus on the \"men 's doubles\" column because that's where Michael S\u00f8gaard might be playing with others. I'll need to look through each row (year) and check if there's an entry for Michael S\u00f8gaard in that column, along with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp.\n\nLet me go through the table rows one by one:\n\n- 1988: No Michael S\u00f8gaard listed.\n- 1989: No mention of Michael S\u00f8gaard here either.\n- 1998: No Michael S\u00f8gaard in men's doubles. The name listed is \"michael keck christian mohr.\" Wait, that might be a different Michael Keck. Need to see if it's the same as Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 1999: No Michael S\u00f8gaard here either.\n- 2000: In row 2000, men's doubles have \"michael s\ufffdgaard joachim fischer nielsen.\" So that's one pair, Michael S\u00f8gaard and Joachim Fischer Nielsen. But is Michael Lamp mentioned here? The third name in the row is \"claudia vogelgsang xu huaiwen,\" which doesn't include Michael Lamp.\n- 2001: Men's doubles have \"michael s\ufffdgaard michael lamp.\" So Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with Michael Lamp, but is Joachim Fischer Nielsen listed here? No, it's Michael Keck and others. Wait, the third name in this row is \"michael s\ufffdgaard michael lamp,\" so maybe that's a different pairing.\n- 2002: No Michael S\u00f8gaard here.\n- 2003: No mention of Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2004: Men's doubles have \"kasper \ufffddum\" and others, not Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2005: No Michael S\u00f8gaard in this row either.\n- 2006: No Michael S\u00f8gaard listed.\n- 2007: The men's doubles here don't include Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2008: Men's doubles have \"mathias boe carsten mogensen,\" not Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2009: Not seeing Michael S\u00f8gaard in this row.\n- 2010: No Michael S\u00f8gaard listed.\n- 2011: No mention of him here.\n- 2012: Doesn't list Michael S\u00f8gaard either.\n- 2013: Ends with \"michael fuchs birgit michels,\" which isn't him.\n\nFrom this, it looks like Michael S\u00f8gaard was paired with Joachim Fischer Nielsen in 2000 and with Michael Lamp in 2001. But the claim says he plays with both of them in the men's doubles at the same time. That doesn't seem to be the case; each year they are paired with different partners.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because Michael S\u00f8gaard hasn't been paired with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in any single year. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones where Michael S\u00f8gaard is listed with each of his partners separately.\n\nIn row 2000, he's paired with Joachim Fischer Nielsen, so that's men's doubles for 2000. In row 2001, he's with Michael Lamp in men's doubles. So these are the cells that show Michael S\u00f8gaard playing with each partner individually, not both at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include these two instances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2000, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2001, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says, \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 2 time in the women 's single.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"play 2 time\" likely refers to playing twice, perhaps as a participant or winner in the women's singles event over two years.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for year, men's singles, women's singles, etc. So, I need to look into the rows and see if both katrin schmidt and pi hongyan appear in the women's singles column twice.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's women's singles entry:\n\n- Row 0: \"katrin schmidt\"\n- Row 1: \"katrin schmidt\" again\n- Rows beyond that don't have her, so she appears at least twice. But I need to see if both players appear two times each in their respective years.\n\nNext, looking for pi hongyan in the women's singles column:\n\n- Scanning through the rows:\n  - Row 2: \"karolina ericsson\"\n  - Row 3: \"zheng yaqiong\"\n  - Row 5: \"pi hongyan\" first appearance\n  - Row 8: \"li xuerui\"\n  - Row 11: \"juliane schenk\"\n  - Row 12: \"nichaon jindapon\"\n  - Wait, I need to check each row one by one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each row systematically:\n\nRow 0 (1988): women's singles is katrin schmidt.\nRow 1 (1989): same person again. So she has two entries here, but it's the same person, so does that count as two times? Or does \"both\" refer to different people?\n\nWait, the claim says both katrin schmidt and pi hongyan play two times. So I need each of them appearing twice.\n\nkatrin schmidt appears in 1988 and 1989. So she has at least two entries.\n\npi hongyan: let's see:\n\nLooking through rows, the first occurrence is row 5 (2001), women's singles: \"pi hongyan\". Then again, does she appear elsewhere?\n\nRow 12: nope. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, in row 0: 1988\nRow 1: 1989\n...\nRow 5: 2001, women's singles is \"pi hongyan\" \u2013 that's one.\nThen, looking for another occurrence of pi hongyan:\n\nLooking through the rows beyond 2001:\n- Row 7 (2003): xu huaiwen\n- Row 8 (2004): xu huaiwen again\n- Row 9 (2005): li xuerui\n- Row 10 (2010): li xuerui again?\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 12: 2013, women's singles is \"nichaon jindapon\"\n\nHmm, I don't see pi hongyan appearing more than once. So she only appears once in the table.\n\nTherefore, katrin schmidt has two entries (1988 and 1989), but pi hongyan only has one entry (2001). Therefore, the claim is not fully supported because pi hongyan doesn't have two entries.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row where pi hongyan appears again. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRows 0-19:\n\nRow 0: katrin\nRow1: katrin\nRow2: karolina\nRow3: zheng yaqiong\nRow4: mads conrad-petersen (no)\nRow5: pi hongyan \u2013 first time\nRow6: juliane schenk\nRow7: xu huaiwen\nRow8: xu huaiwen\nRow9: li xuerui\nRow10: zhang nan zhao\nRow11: li xuerui again?\nWait, row 10 is 2010, women's singles: zhang nan zhao. Row 11 (2011): li xuerui.\n\nSo li xuerui appears twice as well, but that's a different player.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow12: nichaon jindapon\nRow13: chou tien-chen\nRow14: juliane schenk again?\nWait, row 6 is 2012, women's singles: juliane schenk. Row13 (2012): nope, row12 is 2013.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the years. Let me list all rows with their years and women's singles:\n\nRow0 (1988): katrin\nRow1 (1989): katrin\nRow2 (1990): karolina\nRow3 (1991): zheng yaqiong\nRow4 (1992): mads conrad-petersen\nRow5 (1993): pi hongyan\nRow6 (1994): juliane schenk\nRow7 (1995): xu huaiwen\nRow8 (1996): xu huaiwen\nRow9 (1997): li xuerui\nRow10 (1998): zhang nan zhao\nRow11 (1999): li xuerui\nRow12 (2000): ?\nWait, the table provided has rows up to 2013. Let me list all rows:\n\nActually, looking back, the table has rows from 0 (1988) up to row19 (2013). So:\n\nLooking for pi hongyan beyond row5: \n\nRows after 5 (1993):\n\nRow6: juliane\nRow7: xu huaiwen\nRow8: xu huaiwen\nRow9: li xuerui\nRow10: zhang nan zhao\nRow11: li xuerui\nRow12: ?\nWait, row12 is 2012, women's singles: juliane schenk.\n\nSo pi hongyan only appears once in row5 (1993). Therefore, she doesn't have two entries. So the claim that both play twice in women's single is incorrect because pi hongyan only plays once.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the mixed double.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions three people: katrin schmidt, markus keck, and chen jin. They are supposed to be playing together in the mixed doubles category.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"year,\" \"men's singles,\" \"women's singles,\" etc., including \"mixed doubles.\" The data rows have multiple entries for each year from 1988 onwards.\n\nI need to check if katrin schmidt is involved with markus keck and chen jin in mixed doubles. So I should look at the \"mixed doubles\" column across all years to see who was playing together around that time.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- 1988: The mixed doubles pair is \"markus keck katrin schmidt.\" That's exactly two of the names mentioned. But wait, the claim says \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin,\" but in 1988, it's only markus keck and katrin schmidt.\n\n- 1989: The mixed doubles are \"chen jin katrin schmidt.\" So here, katrin is paired with chen jin. But where's markus? He isn't listed here. This seems conflicting because the claim says both markus and chen were playing with her.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check other years to see if she plays with both in any year.\n\n1998: Mixed doubles is \"michael keck nicol pitro.\" No katrin or chen here.\n\n2000: She's paired with erica van den heuvel. Not markus or chen.\n\n2001: Chris bruil and lotte bruil - jonathans, no relevant names.\n\n2002: Dicky palyama and xu huaiwen. Not our trio.\n\n2003: Frederik bergstr\u00f6m and johanna persson.

No.\n\n2012: Anders Kristiansen and Julie Houmann. No.\n\n2013: Michael Fuchs and Birgit Michels. No.\n\nSo, in 1988, katrin is with markus keck. In 1989, she's with chen jin. But in the same year? Wait, can a person be paired with two different partners in the same year? Probably not. So perhaps the claim is mixing different years.\n\nWait, the claim says \"play with both,\" which implies that in the same context or event. So if katrin played mixed doubles with markus keck and separately with chen jin in different years, then she didn't play with both at the same time. Therefore, the claim might be false because they weren't partners simultaneously.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check each year again:\n\nIn 1988, mixed doubles: markus keck and katrin schmidt.\n\nIn 1989, mixed doubles: chen jin and katrin schmidt.\n\nSo in two consecutive years, she was with different partners. Therefore, it's not possible for her to have played with both in the same context.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no single year where she plays with both markus keck and chen jin simultaneously.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"xu huaiwen play in the women 's single from 2003 to 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Xu Huaiwen participated in women's singles competitions from the years 2003 through 2009. So, I need to check if there are any entries for Xu Huaiwen in the women's singles column during those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has a \"columns\" array and a \"data\" array. The columns relevant here are \"year\", \"men 's singles\", \"women 's singles\", etc. The data is a list of lists where each sublist corresponds to a year and contains the names for each category.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to the years 2003 to 2009. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 2003: In this row, under \"women 's singles\", I see \"xu huaiwen\". So that's one relevant cell.\n- 2004: Again, \"xu huaiwen\" is listed in the women's singles column.\n- 2005: Same as above, Xu Huaiwen is present.\n- 2006: She appears again here.\n- 2007: Xu Huaiwen is in the women's singles for this year.\n- 2008: She is included in this row too.\n- 2009: Now, looking at 2009's row, I don't see \"xu huaiwen\" under the women's singles column. Instead, I see \"juliane schenk\" there.\n\nSo from 2003 to 2006 and 2007, 2008, it looks like she played in the women's singles. But 2009 doesn't have her name. Therefore, she didn't participate every single year up to 2009. The claim says \"from 2003 to 2009,\" which suggests participation each year in that period.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are any other years beyond 2006 where she's present. Let me recount:\n\n- 2003: Yes\n- 2004: Yes\n- 2005: Yes\n- 2006: Yes\n- 2007: Yes\n- 2008: Yes\n- 2009: No\n\nSo, in total, from 2003 to 2008 she played, but not in 2009. The claim includes 2009 as part of the period. So that would make the statement FALSE because she didn't play in 2009.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is saying she played in the singles from 2003 to 2009 inclusive. Since she isn't there in 2009, it's not TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim was just that she played during those years (not necessarily every year), but given the phrasing \"from 2003 to 2009,\" it implies participation each year. So yes, her absence in 2009 makes the claim FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be all rows from 2003 to 2008 for women's singles where she is listed. Let me list them:\n\n- Row index 13 (since the first row is 0, then 1, etc., up to 19 for 2013). Wait, no, looking at the data array, each sublist corresponds to a year starting from 2003 as row 0?\n\nWait, actually, in the table, I think the first entry is for 2003. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array, it starts with 2003 as the first element (row index 0), then 2004 (index 1), and so on up to 2013 as row index 19.\n\nSo for each year from 2003 to 2008, I need to check if Xu Huaiwen is in women's singles.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Row 13: 2003\n- Row 14: 2004\n- Row 15: 2005\n- Row 16: 2006\n- Row 17: 2007\n- Row 18: 2008\n\nIn each of these rows, the women's singles column has \"xu huaiwen\".\n\nThen in 2009 (row 19), she isn't listed.\n\nSo the relevant cells are from row index 13 to 18 for the women's singles column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women 's double 3 year in a row.\" So, the key points here are:\n\n1. Helle Nielsen\n2. Marie Roepke\n3. They play together in women's doubles.\n4. This happens three consecutive years.\n\nI'll need to check the table for each of these elements.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, men 's singles, women 's singles, men 's doubles, women 's doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nThe data is a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a year and contains names in each category. \n\nI'll start by identifying rows where Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke appear together in the women's doubles column.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row to see if both their names are present in the \"women 's doubles\" column for the same year.\n\nLooking at the years:\n\n- 1988: No Helle or Marie\n- 1989: No\n- 1998: No\n- 1999: No\n- 2000: Helle isn't here, but Marie appears in women's singles? Wait no, let me check each column.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go row by row:\n\nRow 3 (year 1998): women's doubles has \"erica van den heuvel judith meulendijks\" \u2014 not them.\n\nRow 4 (1999): women's doubles is \"britta andersen lene mork\" \u2014 no.\n\nRow 5 (2000): women's doubles is \"claudia vogelgsang xu huaiwen\" \u2014 Helle isn't here, but Marie? No, in year 2000, the women's singles has xu huaiwen. Wait, I'm confusing columns.\n\nWait, each row has six entries: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nSo for each row, I need to check if both Helle and Marie are in the women's doubles cell.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0 (1988): women's doubles is \"katrin schmidt nicole baldewein\" \u2014 no.\n\nRow1 (1989): women's doubles is \"birgitta lehnert monica halim\" \u2014 no.\n\nRow2 (1998): as above, no.\n\nRow3 (1999): no.\n\nRow4 (2000): women's doubles is \"claudia vogelgsang xu huaiwen\" \u2014 neither Helle nor Marie. Wait, in 2000, year=2000: the women's singles has xu huaiwen, but that's a different column.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each row for the presence of \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" in any column.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about them playing together in women's doubles, so we need to see if both are listed as partners in the women's doubles column for the same year.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 8 (2012): The last rows. Let me list all rows with their years and columns.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to go step by step:\n\n- Year 2000: Looking at the data, row 4 is year=2000. The women's doubles column has \"claudia vogelgsang xu huaiwen\" \u2014 no Helle or Marie there.\n\nYear 2012: row 12 has year=2012. Let me see:\n\nIn row 12, the columns are:\n\n- men's singles: \"chou tien - chen\"\n- women's singles: \"juliane schenk\"\n- men's doubles: \"ingo kindervater johannes schoettler\"\n- women's doubles: \"wang rong zhang zhibo\"\n- mixed doubles: \"anders kristiansen julie houmann\"\n\nNo Helle or Marie here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should look for both names together in any row's women's doubles column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about three consecutive years, so they must appear in the women's doubles column for three different years in a row.\n\nSo, first, find any year where both are listed as partners in women's doubles.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nLet me check from 2000 onwards since Helle and Marie might be more recent players.\n\nRow 8 (year=2012): No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not looking at the right rows. Let me count the rows correctly.\n\nThe table has 14 rows, from index 0 to 13.\n\nLooking for \"helle nielsen\" and \"marie roepke\" in any row's women's doubles column.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n- Row 3 (1999): women's doubles: \"britta andersen lene mork\" \u2014 no.\n- Row4 (2000): women's doubles: \"claudia vogelgsang xu huaiwen\" \u2014 no.\n- Row5 (2000): No, same as above.\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about Helle and Marie playing together in women's doubles for three consecutive years. So I need to find a trio of years where both are listed as partners in women's doubles each year.\n\nBut from scanning the table, it seems that neither Helle nor Marie appear together in the same row's women's doubles column.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a row. Let me check row 12 again:\n\nRow12 (2012): women's doubles: \"wang rong zhang zhibo\" \u2014 no.\n\nRow13 (2013): women's doubles is \"eefje muskens selena piek\" \u2014 no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not looking in the right columns. Maybe they are in mixed doubles?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Helle and Marie are in the same row but different columns, but that wouldn't mean they play together unless it's women's doubles.\n\nWait, let me check if any row has both Helle and Marie in the women's doubles column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 8 (2012): No.\n\nRow7 (2011): women's doubles: \"chan peng soon goh liu ying\" \u2014 no.\n\nRow6 (2010? Wait, the years aren't explicit. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, the table has 14 rows, from index 0 to 13, corresponding to years 1988 up to 2013.\n\nLooking for a row where women's doubles is \"helle nielsen marie roepke\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's split into two names in one cell. For example, if the cell contains \"Helle Nielsen Marie Roepke\", that would be the pair.\n\nSo I need to check each row's women's doubles column for this exact pairing.\n\nLooking through:\n\nRow 0: no\n\nRow1: no\n\n...\n\nRow7 (2011): No.\n\nRow8 (2012): No.\n\nRow9 (2013? Wait, rows go from 1988 (row0) up. Let me list them properly:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the years. The table's rows are as follows:\n\nEach sublist corresponds to a year, starting with 1988 in row0, then 1989 in row1, and so on until 2013 in row13.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nRow0: 1988\n\nRow1: 1989\n\n...\n\nRow12: 2012\n\nRow13: 2013\n\nNow, looking for \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" as a pair in women's doubles column across any of these rows.\n\nI need to check each row:\n\nRow0 (1988): women's doubles: \"unknown\"\n\nNo.\n\n...\n\nLooking through, perhaps the only way is to conclude that there is no such pairing in the table, meaning the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps Helle and Marie are playing together in multiple years, but not necessarily all three consecutive.\n\nBut the question states they are playing together for three consecutive years, so I need to check if any trio of consecutive years have both listed as women's doubles partners.\n\nFrom my analysis, it seems there is no such trio, so the answer would be that they did not play together for three consecutive years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe in 2010, 2011, and 2012, but looking at those rows:\n\nRow7: year=2011\n\nwomen's doubles: \"chan peng soon goh liu ying\" \u2014 no.\n\nRow8 (2012): No.\n\nRow9 (2013): No.\n\nSo even if they played together in a single year, it's not three consecutive.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me check row10:\n\nRow10: 2014? Wait, no, up to row13 is 2013.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Helle and Marie are playing together in mixed doubles, but that doesn't count for the claim about women's doubles.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the table provided, there is no evidence of Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke playing together in the women's doubles category for three consecutive years. Therefore, the answer would be that they did not play together for three consecutive years.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining whether Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke played together in the women's doubles category for three consecutive years based on a provided table of their match data. \n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understand the Data Structure:** The table consists of 14 rows, each representing a year from 1988 (row0) to 2013 (row13). Each row includes information about matches in men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column:** Focus on the \"women's doubles\" column to find any pairing of Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke.\n\n3. **Search Through Rows:** Examine each row's \"women's doubles\" entry for the specific duo.\n\n4. **Check for Consecutive Years:** If found, verify if they appeared in three consecutive years.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- Upon reviewing each row, there is no instance where Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke are listed as partners in the women's doubles category.\n  \n- Even if they were partners in a single year, the data does not indicate their participation in three consecutive years.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis concludes that Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke did not play together in the women's doubles category for three consecutive years based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** They did not play together for three consecutive years.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"michael s\u00f8gaard play in the men 's double with both sanave thomas and maneepong jongjit.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked here. The table provided has several columns: year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 1988 to 2013, and each cell contains the name of a player or pair in that category for that year.\n\nSo, I need to check if Michael S\u00f8gaard ever played men's doubles with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit. That means I have to look into the \"men's doubles\" column across different years.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll go through each row (year) in the \"men's doubles\" column:\n\n- 1988: markus keck robert neumann\n- 1989: stefan frey robert neumann\n- 1998: michael keck christian mohr\n- 1999: quinten van dalm dennis lens\n- 2000: michael s\u00f8gaard joachim fischer nielsen\n- 2001: michael s\u00f8gaard michael lamp\n- 2002: simon archer flandy limpele\n- 2003: micha\u0142 ogosz robert mateusiak\n- 2004: simon archer anthony clark\n- 2005: tony gunawan halim haryanto\n- 2006: micha\u0142 ogosz robert mateusiak\n- 2007: mathias boe carsten mogensen\n- 2008: mathias boe carsten mogensen\n- 2009: rupesh kumar sanave thomas\n- 2010: mathias boe carsten mogensen\n- 2011: bodin isara maneepong jongjit\n- 2012: ingo kindervater johannes schoettler\n- 2013: mads conrad - petersen mads pieler kolding\n\nFrom this list, I notice that in the year 2009, Sanave Thomas appears in the men's doubles column as \"rupesh kumar sanave thomas.\" However, Michael S\u00f8gaard is not listed alongside him in that row. So, it seems like they didn't play together in 2009.\n\nThen, looking for Maneepong Jongjit, I see he appears in the year 2011 with \"bodin isara maneepong jongjit,\" but again, Michael S\u00f8gaard isn't paired with him there. \n\nWait, maybe I should look more closely. Is there any row where both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit are present as partners alongside Michael S\u00f8gaard in the men's doubles? Let me scan each year:\n\n- 2009: Sanave Thomas is there, but not Michael.\n- 2011: Maneepong Jongjit is there with Bodin Isara, no Michael.\n\nI don't see a row where all three are paired together. Therefore, it seems that Michael S\u00f8gaard hasn't played men's doubles with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit at the same time in any given year based on this table.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check if Michael was ever partnered with Sanave Thomas, regardless of Maneepong, and vice versa. If so, maybe that counts? However, the claim specifically says \"with both,\" meaning they were partners together in doubles, which would require all three to be listed as a pair in one row.\n\nSince there's no such row where Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Michael S\u00f8gaard played men's doubles with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit, we need to check the \"men's doubles\" column for any year where all three are listed as partners. \n\n- **2009**: Sanave Thomas is present without Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- **2011**: Maneepong Jongjit is present with Bodin Isara, not Michael.\n\nNo row lists Michael S\u00f8gaard alongside both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit in men's doubles. Thus, the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2011, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 4 time in the women 's single.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being claimed here. It seems like it's saying that both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Honyan have played four times in women's singles. So, my task is to look through the table and check if these two names appear in the \"women 's singles\" column a total of four times each.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for year, men's singles, women's singles, etc. The data rows list different players for each event per year. So, I should focus on the \"women 's singles\" column to find how many times each player appears.\n\nStarting with Katrin Schmidt: I'll go through each row in the \"women 's singles\" column and count her occurrences.\n\n- 1988: katrin schmidt - that's one.\n- 1989: katrin schmidt - two.\n- 1998: not listed.\n- 1999: not listed.\n- 2000: not listed.\n- 2001: not listed.\n- 2002: not listed.\n- 2003: xu huaiwen, so no.\n- 2004: not listed.\n- 2005: xu huaiwen again, so Katrin isn't here.\n- 2006: not listed.\n- 2007: not listed.\n- 2008: not listed.\n- 2009: juliane schenk, so Katrin isn't here.\n- 2010: not listed.\n- 2011: not listed.\n- 2012: not listed.\n- 2013: not listed.\n\nWait, that only gives me two appearances for Katrin Schmidt in women's singles. The claim says four times, so maybe I missed some rows? Let me double-check. Hmm, from the data provided, she's only in 1988 and 1989. So that's two times. Unless there are more years beyond 2013, but the table stops at 2013. So Katrin Schmidt appears twice.\n\nNow checking Pi Honyan: I'll look through each row again in \"women 's singles.\"\n\n- 2002: pi hongyan - one.\n- 2007: not listed.\n- 2011: pi hongyan - two.\n- 2012: not listed.\n- 2013: not listed.\n\nWait, that's only two times as well. So both players have two appearances each in women's singles according to the table provided.\n\nBut the claim says four times for each. Since both of them only appear twice, the claim must be false. Therefore, I need to check which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones where \"katrin schmidt\" and \"pi hongyan\" are listed in the \"women 's singles\" column.\n\nFor Katrin Schmidt: she's at row 0 (1988) and row 1 (1989). For Pi Honyan: rows 5 (2002) and 10 (2011). Wait, let me check the row indices properly. Looking back, each row corresponds to a year:\n\nRow 0: 1988\nRow 1: 1989\n...\nRow 5: 1994? Or maybe it's better to list all rows with their indices.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out the years and their respective row indices. Let me count the rows starting from 0.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows 0-2: 1988, 1989, 1990\nThen up to row 12 for 2013.\n\nBut specifically for \"women 's singles\":\n\nRow 0: 1988 - katrin schmidt\nRow 1: 1989 - katrin schmidt\nRow 5: 2002 - pi hongyan\nRow 10: 2007? Wait, no. Let me check the data again.\n\nWait, the table lists each row as a year and then players for each category. So I think each row is a single year, so:\n\nFor example, row 0 is 1988, with men's singles as \"paul hancock\", women's singles as \"katrin schmidt\".\n\nSimilarly, row 1 is 1989: men's singles \"ian bruce\", women's singles \"katrin schmidt\".\n\nRow 2: 1990: men's singles \"mark lawson\", women's singles \"sarah edwards\".\n\nContinuing this way, so row indices go up to 13 (2013).\n\nSo, for Katrin Schmidt in women's singles:\n\n- Row 0: 1988\n- Row 1: 1989\n\nThat's two entries.\n\nFor Pi Honyan:\n\nLooking through the \"women 's singles\" column:\n\nRow 5: 2002 - pi hongyan\nRow 10: 2011 - pi hongyan\n\nSo that's two entries as well.\n\nTherefore, each appears twice in women's singles. The claim says four times each, which is incorrect. So the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: we need to list all row indices where either player is in the women's singles column.\n\nFor Katrin Schmidt: rows 0 and 1.\nFor Pi Honyan: rows 5 and 10.\n\nSo the relevant_cells list will include these four entries with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Honyan appear only twice in the women's singles, not four times. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Honyan have played four times in women's singles.\n2. **Locate Relevant Data:** Check the \"women 's singles\" column for each player's appearances.\n3. **Count Appearances:**\n   - Katrin Schmidt: 1988 (row 0), 1989 (row 1) \u2192 2 appearances.\n   - Pi Honyan: 2002 (row 5), 2011 (row 10) \u2192 2 appearances.\n4. **Conclusion:** Both players have only two appearances, not four.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Katrin Schmidt in rows 0 and 1.\n- Pi Honyan in rows 5 and 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and provide relevant cells that support this decision. The claim is: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions two players: katrin schmidt and markus keck, as well as chen jin. The context is men's doubles, which I think means they are pairing up in a men's doubles match.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for each year from 1988 to 2013. Each row represents a specific year, and within that year, there are five categories: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The data in each cell seems to list the names of players associated with each category for that year.\n\nSo, I need to find if katrin schmidt and markus keck were playing together in men's doubles, possibly alongside chen jin as a partner or opponent? Wait, no, the claim says \"play with both,\" which might mean they are partners. Or does it mean they play against each other? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should interpret \"play with\" as being teammates. So, katrin schmidt is paired with markus keck in men's doubles, and also with chen jin. But that doesn't quite make sense because a doubles pair consists of two players. Maybe the claim is saying that she plays with both, meaning she partners with markus keck and possibly another player like chen jin? Or perhaps it's implying that she played with both in different contexts.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if for any given year, katrin schmidt is listed in men's doubles alongside markus keck and chen jin. But looking at the table data, each row has five entries: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nSo, for each year, I need to check if 'katrin schmidt' is present in the men's doubles column and if 'markus keck chen jin' are also there. But wait, the names seem to be structured differently. For example, in 1988, the men's doubles entry is \"markus keck robert neumann,\" which might mean two players: markus keck and robert neumann.\n\nWait, but the data seems to list multiple players sometimes with additional names, perhaps indicating partners or co-players. So each cell in 'men's doubles' lists all the players involved in that category for that year.\n\nSo, if katrin schmidt is listed in men's doubles for a particular year, and markus keck is also in men's doubles for the same year, then they might be playing together. But does the claim say she plays with both markus keck and chen jin? That would require all three to be in men's doubles together, which isn't possible because a doubles match has two players per team.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" So perhaps she partners with markus keck and also with chen jin, but that would imply three people playing together, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, maybe the claim is saying she plays against them or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue, and the intended meaning is that katrin schmidt played with markus keck in men's doubles, possibly alongside chen jin as another player, but again, that would require three people.\n\nWait, let me re-read the claim: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" It might be a translation error. Maybe it means she plays against both of them individually, or perhaps she partners with one and also plays against the other. But I think more likely, it's saying that she played with both markus keck and chen jin, which would require all three to be in the same doubles match, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"both\" is used differently. Maybe she partners with markus keck, and also plays against chen jin. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for instances where katrin schmidt is in men's doubles and see if markus keck is also there for the same year. If so, then they are playing together as a pair. Let me go through each row of the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1988: men's doubles is \"markus keck robert neumann\" \u2014 so markus keck and robert neumann.\n- 1989: men's doubles is \"robert neumann werner horn\" \u2014 no katrin here.\n- 1990: \"werner horn thomas leitke\" \u2014 no.\n- 1991: \"thomas leitke michael schulz\" \u2014 no.\n- 1992: \"michael schulz andreas thomsen\" \u2014 no.\n- 1993: \"andreas thomsen stephan wunderlich\" \u2014 no.\n- 1994: \"stephan wunderlich markus keck\" \u2014 here, both markus keck and katrin? Wait, no, the women's singles for 1994 is \"katrin schmidt,\" but men's doubles are \"stephan wunderlich markus keck.\" So that would mean markus keck is playing with stephan wunderlich in men's doubles. But where is katrin?\n\nWait, let me check each year:\n\nLooking at 1988: women's singles has \"katrin schmidt,\" but men's doubles are markus keck and robert neumann.\n\nIn 1994: women's singles have \"katrin schmidt.\" Men's doubles have stephan wunderlich and markus keck. So in this year, markus is playing with stephan, not katrin. So maybe she didn't play with him in that year.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at another year where she is in men's doubles. Let me check each row.\n\nWait, the women's singles column has katrin schmidt in 1988, then in 1994 again, but I don't see her in any other years as a singles player. But does she appear in mixed doubles?\n\nLooking for 'katrin schmidt' across all columns:\n\nIn 1988: women's singles and maybe mixed doubles? Let me check:\n\n1988:\n- men's singles\n- women's singles: katrin\n- men's doubles: markus keck, robert neumann\n- women's doubles: \"sylvia seckendorff karin gerstenacker\"\n- mixed doubles: not listed here, but perhaps elsewhere.\n\nWait, in 1988, under mixed doubles, it says \"hans-peter gniwe thomas bartsch\" \u2014 no katrin.\n\nIn 1994:\n- women's singles: katrin\n- men's doubles: stephan wunderlich and markus keck\n- other columns don't list her except singles.\n\nWait, maybe she didn't play in men's doubles with markus keck at all. So perhaps the claim is FALSE because there is no evidence of her playing with him in men's doubles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each row represents a year and lists five categories. For example, in 1994, women's singles have katrin, men's doubles have markus keck and stephan wunderlich. So she didn't play with markus in men's doubles that year.\n\nIn other years, like 1988, the men's doubles are markus and robert, so again, no katrin there.\n\nWait, perhaps she is only listed in women's singles, not in mixed or men's. So if the claim is about her playing with markus in men's doubles, then it would be FALSE because I don't see any such pairing.\n\nBut let me check another approach: perhaps in a year where katrin is in women's doubles and markus is in men's, but that wouldn't make them play together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she played mixed doubles with him. Let me look for \"katrin schmidt\" in mixed doubles:\n\nLooking through the table, I see in 1988, mixed doubles: hans-peter gniwe and thomas bartsch.\n\nIn 1994, no mention of her in mixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if she is ever paired with markus keck in any doubles category.\n\nFrom what I can see:\n\n- 1988: women's singles and other categories without markus in men's doubles.\n- 1994: women's singles again, but men's doubles with stephan wunderlich.\n\nSo no instance where katrin is in men's doubles paired with markus keck. Therefore, the claim that she plays with both (implying a duo) of markus and chen jin in men's double would be incorrect because there is no such pairing.\n\nWait, but I don't see any mention of chen jin in the table either. Maybe it's a name from another context or a typo. Alternatively, perhaps \"chen\" refers to someone else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that she plays with markus keck and some other player named chen in men's doubles, but I don't see any such pairing in the data provided.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, there is no evidence that katrin schmidt played in men's doubles with markus keck. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double\" is **FALSE**. There is no evidence in the provided data to suggest that katrin schmidt participated in men's doubles alongside markus keck or any player named chen. Each year examined shows her involvement in women's singles but not in men's doubles with markus keck, and no mention of a player named chen is found in the context of men's doubles. Therefore, the claim lacks support from the data provided.\n\nAnswer: FALSE",
