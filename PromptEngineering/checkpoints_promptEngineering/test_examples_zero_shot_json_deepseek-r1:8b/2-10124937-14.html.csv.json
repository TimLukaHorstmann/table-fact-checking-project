    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"when marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are:\n- team 1\n- agg\n- team 2\n- 1st leg\n- 2nd leg\n\nEach row represents a match between two teams, with their aggregate (agg) score and scores from both legs.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"when marseille be the first team\" and refers to the first leg's score being 3 - 1. So I need to look for rows where team 1 is Marseille and check if the first leg score matches 3-1.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - team 1: anderlecht\n   - agg: 2 - 6\n   - So, not relevant since team 1 isn't Marseille.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - team 1: rangers\n   - Not relevant.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - team 1: bolton wanderers\n   - No.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - team 1: bayer leverkusen\n   - No.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - team 1: benfica\n   - No.\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - team 1: fiorentina\n   - No.\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - team 1: tottenham hotspur\n   - No.\n\n8. **Row 7**:\n   - team 1: marseille\n   - Here, team 1 is Marseille.\n   - Now check the first leg score. In this row, the first leg score is \"3 - 1\".\n   - So yes, it matches.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other rows where team 1 is Marseille. From the table, there's only one row with Marseille as team 1. So that's the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when Marseille is the first team, their first leg score is 3-1. In the table, the row where team 1 is Marseille (row_index:7) shows a first leg score of \"3 - 1.\" This fully supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are [\"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", \"2nd leg\"]. So each row represents a match between two teams, with their aggregate score (agg), first leg score, and second leg score.\n\nNow, I need to find the relevant rows where \"team 1\" or \"team 2\" is \"bolton wanderers.\" Looking at the data:\n\nRow 0: team 1 is anderlecht\nRow 1: team 1 is rangers\nRow 2: team 1 is bolton wanderers. So this row is relevant because the claim mentions \"the bolton wanderer\" as one of the teams.\n\nSo, for row_index 2, I need to check columns \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\". The data in that row is [\"bolton wanderers\", \"1 - 2\", \"sporting cp\", \"1 - 1\", \"0 - 1\"]. \n\nWait, no. Let me look again: the second element is \"1 - 2\" which is under \"agg\"? No, wait, columns are in order: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, 2nd leg. So for row 2:\n\n- team 1: bolton wanderers\n- agg: 1 - 2 (I think this might be their aggregate score)\n- team 2: sporting cp\n- 1st leg: 1 - 1\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 1\n\nSo, the claim is about the first and second leg scores for bolton wanderers. But in row 2, \"bolton wanderers\" is team 1, so their first leg score is 1 - 1, and second leg is 0 - 1.\n\nWait, but the claim says that both the 1st leg and 2nd leg scores are the same for bolton wanderers. So I need to check if the first leg score equals the second leg score in their match.\n\nIn row 2: first leg is 1 - 1, second leg is 0 - 1. Are these two scores equal? No, they're not. Because 1-1 is different from 0-1. The aggregate might be 1-2, but that's the overall score, not each leg.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\" So for bolton wanderers, their first leg score should equal their second leg score.\n\nIn this row, team 1 is bolton wanderers. Their first leg score is 1 - 1, and second leg is 0 - 1. Those are not the same. Therefore, the claim would be false because the scores aren't equal in both legs for bolton wanderers.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me check again: the columns are team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, 2nd leg. So for row 2:\n\nteam1: bolton wanderers\nagg: 1 - 2 (maybe this is their total)\nteam2: sporting cp\n1st leg: 1 - 1\n2nd leg: 0 - 1\n\nSo the first leg score is 1-1, and second leg is 0-1. So for team1 (bolton), their first leg is 1-1, second leg is 0-1. These are not equal. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look at team2's perspective? But no, the claim specifies \"for the bolton wanderer,\" so it should be based on their own scores, regardless of who they played against.\n\nTherefore, since their first and second leg scores are not equal, the claim is false. So answer is FALSE, with the relevant cells being row 2, columns 3 (1st leg) and 4 (2nd leg).\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the table for matches involving \"bolton wanderers.\" In row 2, their first leg score was \"1 - 1\" and the second leg was \"0 - 1,\" which are not equal. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
