    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that episode number 10 is titled \"Reflection.\" So I need to check if there's an episode with both the number 10 and the title \"Reflection.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, the data is a list of lists where each sublist represents an episode with various attributes like no in series, no in season, title, etc. The columns are: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original airdate, and tv broadcast.\n\nI need to find the row where \"no in series\" is 10 and see what the title is. Alternatively, if I can't find a row with no in series as 10, maybe it's in the no in season column? Wait, but the claim mentions \"episode number,\" which probably refers to the overall episode number across the series, so likely it's referring to \"no in series.\"\n\nSo first, I should look through each row to see if any have \"no in series\" equal to 10. Then check the title for that row.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nThe rows are from 27 up to 51 for no in series, which seems a bit high, but let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 0: no=27, title=turtles in space , part1...\nRow1:29, turtles in space part3\nRow2:30, turtles in space part4\nRow3:31, turtles in space part5\nRow4:32, secret origins part1\nRow5:33, secret origins part2\nRow6:34, secret origins part3\nRow7:35, the ultimate ninja\nRow8:36, reflections\nWait, here we go. Row8 has no=36 and title=reflections.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about episode number 10 being titled \"reflection.\" So if I'm looking for episode number 10, but in the table, the lowest no in series is 27. That doesn't make sense. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant \"no in season\" as 10? Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo and they mean no in series=10. But looking at the table, no in series starts from 27, so an episode number of 10 doesn't exist in this dataset.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is false because there's no episode with no in series=10, let alone titled Reflection.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Maybe the term \"episode number\" refers not to no in series, but maybe the order within a season? But that would typically be referred to as \"no in season,\" which is another column here.\n\nLooking back at the table, each row has both \"no in series\" and \"no in season.\" For example, row8: no=36 (series), no in season is probably 10 or something else?\n\nWait, let me check the data more carefully. Let's see:\n\nRow 0:\nno=27 (series)\nno in season: Looking at the TV broadcast column, it's s02e01, so season 2, episode1.\n\nSimilarly, row8: no=36 (series), TV broadcast is s02e20, which would be season 2, episode20.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if no in series starts at 27 and goes up to 51, it's more than two seasons. Wait, perhaps the \"no in season\" refers to the order within a season, not across all series.\n\nSo, for example, s02e01 is season2, episode1, so no in season would be 1. So if an episode has no=36 (series) and no=10 (season), that might correspond to it being the 10th episode of season2.\n\nBut the claim says \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection.\" If the episode is referred as no in series=10, but in the table, there's no such row. So if someone refers to an episode as number10, but in this context, that would correspond to s02e01 (no=27) which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"episode number\" here is referring to within a season, so no in season=10. Let me check the data for any row where \"no in season\" is 10 and title is Reflection.\n\nWait, looking at each row:\n\nRow0: no=27 (series), TV broadcast s02e01 \u2192 no in season1\nRow1:29, s02e02\u2192no2\n...\nLooking through all rows, I don't see any with \"no in season\" as 10. The highest in the first season is no=20, then moves to second season.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that \"episode number\" refers to within a season. So for example, if an episode is the 10th of its season and titled Reflection.\n\nSo I need to check if any row has \"no in season\" as 10 and title=Reflection.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow0: s02e01 \u2192 no1\n...\nRow8: s02e20 \u2192 no20\n\nWait, that's not possible because the second season doesn't go up to no20; perhaps I miscounted. Let me see the data more accurately.\n\nEach row's TV broadcast is in format s02eXX. So for example:\n\ns02e01: no=27 (series), no=1 (season)\ns02e02: 29,2\n...\nLooking at the last few rows:\n\nRow44: s02e21 \u2192 no=47, no=21\nRow45: s02e22\u2192no48,no22\nRow46: s02e23\u2192no49,no23\nRow47: s02e24\u2192no50,no24\nRow48: s02e25\u2192no51,no25\n\nSo in the second season, the episodes go up to no=25.\n\nWait, but earlier rows:\n\nRow0:27,s02e01 \u2192no1\n...\nRow8:36,s02e20\u2192no20\nRow9:37,s02e21?\nNo, wait row8 is s02e20? Wait, let me check the data again.\n\nLooking at the given data:\n\nEach sublist represents an episode with:\n\n- no in series (int)\n- no in season (probably not explicitly listed, but implied by TV broadcast)\n\nFor example, the first few rows:\n\nRow0: 27, \"turtles...\", \"s02e01\" \u2192 so s02e01 implies no=1 in season2.\n\nSimilarly, row8 has no=36, and TV broadcast is \"s02e20\", which would be no=20 in season2.\n\nSo if the claim is that episode number10 is Reflection, it's referring to no in season=10. So I need to check if any row has \"no in season\" as 10 and title=Reflection.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nI don't see any with TV broadcast s02e10 (which would be no=10 in season2). The closest is s02e20, which is no=20.\n\nSo there's no such episode where no in season=10. Therefore, the claim is false because no such episode exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"episode number\" refers to globally across all series, but that doesn't make much sense as they are different series.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: The claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that there's an episode numbered 10 titled \"Reflection\" does not hold true based on the provided data. \n\n**Answer:** There is no such episode in the dataset; therefore, the statement is false.",
