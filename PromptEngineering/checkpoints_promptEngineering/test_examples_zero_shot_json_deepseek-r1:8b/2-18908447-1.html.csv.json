    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"jim obradovich pick after round 2 but before pick 183 , play tight end position\". So, breaking this down:\n\n1. Jim Obradovich is a player.\n2. He was picked after round 2 and before pick 183.\n3. His position is tight end.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns that support or contradict this claim.\n\nThe table has these columns: round, pick, player, position, school. The data rows are:\n\nRow 0: round=2, pick=27, player=al simpson, position=guard, school=colorado state\nRow 1: round=3, pick=62, player=danny buggs, position=wide receiver, school=west virginia\nRow 2: round=4, pick=79, player=robert giblin, position=defensive back, school=houston\nRow 3: round=7, pick=158, player=jim obradovich, position=tight end, school=usc\nRow 4: round=8, pick=183, player=john tate, position=linebacker, school=jackson state\n\nNow, looking for Jim Obradovich. He's in row 3. His round is 7 and pick is 158.\n\nThe claim says he was picked after round 2 but before pick 183. Let me check:\n\n- After round 2: Round 2 is the third column in the data? Wait no, wait, the columns are round, pick, player, position, school. So each row has these values. So Round numbers go from 2 to 8 as per the data.\n\nSo Jim was picked in round 7. That's after round 2 (which is earlier). Then, before pick 183: Pick numbers are up to 183 in the last row. Since Jim's pick is 158, which is less than 183, that fits.\n\nNow, position is tight end. In the table, Jim's position is listed as \"tight end\", so that matches.\n\nSo all parts of the claim check out with the data: he was picked after round 2 (round 7), before pick 183 (pick 158), and plays tight end.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table. Jim Obradovich's row has a pick number (158) after round 2, before pick 183, and his position is tight end.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false by checking against the table provided. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim: \"jim obradovich pick before round 2 but pick 183 , play tight end position.\" So, there are a few parts here that need to be verified.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are round, pick, player, position, and school. The data rows have specific values. My goal is to find where Jim Obradovich is located because the claim mentions him specifically.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's player column to see if \"jim obradovich\" is there. \n\nRow 0: Player is \"al simpson\" \u2013 not him.\nRow 1: \"danny buggs\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"robert giblin\" \u2013 still not.\nRow 3: Here it is, the player is \"jim obradovich.\" So, he's in row index 3.\n\nNow, let's check the claim parts against this row. The claim says two things about him: his pick number and position.\n\nFirst part: \"pick before round 2.\" In the table, each row has a 'round' value. Row 3 has a round of 7. So, was he picked before round 2? Well, if round 2 is when picks happen, but Jim was picked in round 7, which is much later. So this part might not be accurate.\n\nSecond part: \"pick 183.\" Looking at the 'pick' column for row 3, it's 158. That doesn't match 183. \n\nThird part: His position is listed as \"tight end\" in the data, so that matches.\n\nBut the first two parts don't align with the table data. The claim says he was picked before round 2 (which isn't correct since he's in round 7), and his pick number is 183, which also doesn't match because it's 158. However, his position does check out as tight end.\n\nSo, even though one part of the claim is correct, the other parts aren't. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, I'll compare each aspect mentioned:\n\n1. **Player Check**: Jim Obradovich is indeed in row 3.\n2. **Round and Pick Check**: The round for his pick is 7, not before round 2. His pick number is 158, not 183.\n3. **Position Check**: His position is \"tight end,\" which matches.\n\nSince the claim's statements about the round and pick don't align with the data, the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
