    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what each part means. I'm looking for two main things: whether UWA's performance indicators are better than Durham University's and if UWA was established later but still outperforms.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that both universities are listed with their members, country, year established, and their world rankings from three different sources (wur, arwu, qs) for 2013. \n\nStarting with the establishment year: \n- UWA was established in 1911.\n- Durham University was established in 1832.\n\nSo yes, UWA was indeed established later than Durham, which supports the claim's point about the late date of establishment.\n\nNext, I need to compare their world rankings. The columns relevant here are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". I'll look at each ranking source for both universities.\n\nFor WUR (World University Rankings):\n- UWA's rank is listed as \"168th\".\n- Durham's rank is \"80th\".\nSo, according to WUR, Durham ranks higher than UWA.\n\nFor ARWU:\n- UWA's rank is \"113th\".\n- Durham's rank is \"151 - 200th\". Hmm, this might need clarification. Wait, the data shows for Durham it's \"201 - 300th\" under \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back: No, wait, in the table, the second entry (Durham) has \"151 - 200th\" under \"world rank by wur , 2013\" and \"90th\" under \"world rank by arwu , 2013\". So for ARWU, UWA is ranked 113th and Durham is 90th. So here, Durham ranks higher than UWA.\n\nFor QS:\n- UWA's rank is \"134th\".\n- Durham's rank is \"189th\".\nSo here, UWA ranks higher than Durham.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The claim states that despite UWA being established later, it does better overall than Durham. To verify this, I need to see if UWA's performance across the rankings is generally better than Durham's. However, looking at each ranking:\n\n- WUR: Durham > UWA\n- ARWU: Durham > UWA\n- QS: UWA > Durham\n\nSo in two out of three rankings, Durham does better, and in one (QS), UWA does better. This means that overall, it's not consistent across all metrics. The claim says \"do better overall,\" which implies that across all relevant measures, UWA is better. Since this isn't the case\u2014Durham performs better in two metrics\u2014the statement might be considered FALSE.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the claim refers to any specific rankings or an aggregate. The term \"overall\" suggests a composite view. However, since the table only provides individual rankings for each source, it's unclear whether the claim is referring to each individually or a combined rank. If it's the latter, we'd have to sum them up, but without exact numbers, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, if \"overall\" refers to each specific ranking, then UWA isn't consistently better across all rankings. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because overall performance isn't universally better.\n\nBut wait, maybe the relevant cells are just about whether the establishment date is later and their QS rank. If the claim focuses on the fact that despite being established later, UWA's QS rank is better than Durham, but I'm not sure if that makes \"overall\" performance better.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because \"overall\" could be interpreted differently. The table shows specific rankings, so perhaps the claim's truthfulness depends on whether it's referring to all three or just one. Since two of them have Durham higher, the overall statement might not hold as TRUE because in some areas, UWA isn't better.\n\nAlternatively, if the user considers only QS rank, then maybe it's partially true, but not entirely. So I think the answer is FALSE because overall, considering all rankings, UWA doesn't outperform Durham across all metrics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that despite being established later, UWA performs better than Durham in terms of world rankings. Upon examining each ranking metric (WUR, ARWU, QS), it's clear that while UWA may perform better in one metric (QS), it doesn't consistently outperform Durham across all three. Therefore, the claim is deemed FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"It may come as a surprise, but Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: members, country, year established, and three world rank columns for 2013: wur, arwu, qs. Each row represents a different university with its corresponding data.\n\nThe claim is comparing Dartmouth College to the University of T\u00fcbingen. So I need to locate these two universities in the table. \n\nStarting with Dartmouth College: Scanning through the 'members' column, I see \"dartmouth college\" as the first entry (row index 0). That's clear.\n\nNext, the University of T\u00fcbingen is listed as \"university of t\u00fcbingen\" in row index 4. So now, I need to compare their rankings.\n\nThe relevant columns for ranking are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". Wait, that first column seems a bit off. It says \"wur\" but the hyphen is after it, so maybe it's a typo or misformatting? Let me check the original table again.\n\nLooking back, the columns are: \"members\", \"country\", \"year established\", \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". Hmm, that first column after 'year established' has an odd name. It seems like maybe it's supposed to be \"world rank by wur\" but the hyphenation is causing issues. Alternatively, perhaps it's a formatting error where the description got cut off.\n\nBut regardless of the exact wording, I think the key here is that the three columns are rankings for different metrics: wur, arwu, and qs, all from 2013. So each university has three ranking values.\n\nThe claim is about Dartmouth College ranking higher than T\u00fcbingen. So we need to check their 2013 rankings in these three categories to see if this holds true across any of them or all of them.\n\nLooking at Dartmouth's data: row index 0, so the columns are:\n\n- members: dartmouth college\n- country: usa\n- year established: 1769\n- world rank by wur, 2013: \"126th\"\n- world rank by arwu, 2013: \"151 - 200th\"\n- world rank by qs, 2013: \"113th\"\n\nFor the University of T\u00fcbingen (row index 4):\n\n- members: university of t\u00fcbingen\n- country: germany\n- year established: 1477\n- world rank by wur, 2013: \"201 - 225th\"\n- world rank by arwu, 2013: \"151 - 200th\"\n- world rank by qs, 2013: \"144th\"\n\nNow, the claim is that Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen. So I need to compare each ranking metric.\n\nStarting with wur: Dartmouth is ranked 126th, and T\u00fcbingen is ranked 201-225th. Since 126 is less than 201, Dartmouth's rank is higher in wur. So in this category, the claim holds.\n\nNext, arwu: Dartmouth is 151-200th, same as T\u00fcbingen (they both have 151-200th). So they are tied here; it's not that one is higher than the other. So this metric doesn't help us determine a higher rank for Dartmouth.\n\nLastly, qs: Dartmouth is ranked 113th, and T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, 113 is less than 144, so Dartmouth ranks higher in qs as well.\n\nSo putting it all together, in two of the three ranking metrics (wur and qs), Dartmouth is higher. In arwu, they are tied. So overall, can we say that Dartmouth's rankings are higher than T\u00fcbingen? Or does the tie matter?\n\nThe claim says \"ranks higher,\" which might imply higher in all categories or at least in some significant metric. Since two of three metrics show Dartmouth higher and one is a tie, it could be considered that overall, Dartmouth ranks higher, even if in one category they are equal.\n\nWait, but sometimes ranking systems consider ties as equal, so maybe the arwu being tied doesn't make Dartmouth's rank higher in all aspects. However, the other two metrics show clear higher rankings. So depending on the interpretation, the claim could be considered TRUE because in at least two of the three metrics, Dartmouth is ranked higher.\n\nBut I should check if there are any nuances. The table might have specific definitions for each ranking metric. For example, wur might be a different ranking system than arwu or qs. So perhaps each metric has its own criteria, and a higher rank could mean better in that particular metric.\n\nIn this case, since Dartmouth is ranked higher in two metrics, it's reasonable to say that overall, their performance is better across these rankings compared to T\u00fcbingen. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two ranking metrics where Dartmouth College has a higher rank than the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"overall , durham university have the best rank , ie , 80th , in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions that Durham University has the best rank overall, specifically referencing a world rank by the WUR (World Universities Rankings) in 2013. The number given is 80th.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with various details. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"country,\" \"year established,\" and the specific ranking column mentioned: \"world rank by - wur , 2013.\" \n\nSince the claim is about Durham University's rank in WUR 2013, I need to locate their entry in the table. Scanning through the data rows:\n\n1. The first row is Dartmouth College.\n2. Second row is Durham University.\n\nSo, Durham University is at row_index 1. Now, checking their \"world rank by - wur , 2013\" column, which is the fourth column in each row. For row_index 1, that value is \"80th.\"\n\nThis directly matches the claim's assertion of an 80th rank.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" Hmm, wait a minute. I think there might be a typo here because the table lists \"queens university,\" not \"queen university.\" So maybe the user meant \"Queens University\" instead of \"Queen University.\" That could be important for checking the data.\n\nLooking at the table, under the \"country\" column, Queens University is in Canada, and Dartmouth College is from the USA. The claim seems to compare their rankings across three categories: wur, arwu, and qs, all from 2013.\n\nSo, I need to look at how both universities perform in these three areas. The relevant columns are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013,\" \"world rank by arwu , 2013,\" and \"world rank by qs , 2013.\" These probably correspond to their world university rankings in those specific rankings.\n\nLet me find Dartmouth College's data first. It's in row index 0. Their rankings are: 126th, 151-200th, and 113th for the three columns respectively. So, wur is 126th, arwu is 151-200, qs is 113th.\n\nNow, Queens University (assuming it's the one from Canada) is in row index 2. Their rankings are: 226-250th, 201-300th, and 189th for the same three columns. So wur is 226-250, arwu is 201-300, qs is 189.\n\nThe claim says that Queens University has not done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories. So I need to check each category: is Queens' ranking worse than Dartmouth's? \n\nLooking at the first category (wur): Dartmouth is 126th, while Queens is 226-250. 226-250 is a lower rank numerically, meaning worse performance. So in wur, Queens did not do as well.\n\nSecond category (aruw): Dartmouth is 151-200, Queens is 201-300. Again, 201-300 is higher numerically, so worse than Dartmouth's 151-200. So Queens didn't do as well here either.\n\nThird category (qs): Dartmouth is 113th, Queens is 189th. 189 is a worse rank, so again, Queens did not perform as well.\n\nSo in all three categories, Queens has a lower (worse) ranking than Dartmouth. Therefore, the claim that \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category\" would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if the claim was referring to the correct universities. The table has \"queens university,\" and the claim mentions \"queen university,\" which might be a typo. If it's supposed to refer to Queens University, then yes, the analysis holds. But if it's about another university with \"Queen\" in the name, that could change things. However, based on the given data, I think it refers to Queens University as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all three ranking columns for both universities.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table. Queens University (Canada) has lower rankings than Dartmouth College across all three categories: wur, arwu, and qs. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dartmouth college have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: members (which are the names of the universities), country, year established, and three world rankings for 2013 from different organizations\u2014wur, arwu, and qs. So each row represents a university with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is comparing two universities: Dartmouth College and the University of T\u00fcbingen. I need to find out their rankings in the three metrics mentioned (wur, arwu, qs) for 2013 and see if Dartmouth's highest rank was ever higher than T\u00fcbingen's.\n\nLooking at the table, Dartmouth College is in row index 0, and the University of T\u00fcbingen is in row index 4. \n\nFor Dartmouth:\n- wur rank: \"126th\"\n- arwu rank: \"151 - 200th\"\n- qs rank: \"113th\"\n\nFor T\u00fcbingen:\n- wur rank: \"201 - 225th\"\n- arwu rank: \"151 - 200th\"\n- qs rank: \"144th\"\n\nNow, I need to compare their rankings. The claim states that Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen in any of these metrics.\n\nLet's check each metric:\n\n1. **wur (World University Rankings by the wur):**\n   - Dartmouth is 126th.\n   - T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th, which is lower than 200th. So in this category, Dartmouth ranks higher.\n\n2. **aruw (Academic Ranking of World Universities by arwu):**\n   - Both are ranked between 151-200th. So they're tied here; no difference.\n\n3. **qs (QS University Rankings):**\n   - Dartmouth is 113th.\n   - T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, Dartmouth ranks higher here.\n\nSo in all three metrics, Dartmouth's rank is either higher or equal to T\u00fcbingen. The claim says that Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. Wait, but according to the data, Dartmouth did rank higher in wur and qs. So the statement would be FALSE because Dartmouth did rank higher.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The claim is \"Dartmouth College have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen.\" So the claim is asserting that Dartmouth's ranking was not higher than T\u00fcbingen in any metric. But from the data, Dartmouth's wur and qs ranks are better (higher) than T\u00fcbingen's. Therefore, the claim is false because Dartmouth did rank higher.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about how the rankings work. Lower numbers mean higher rankings, right? So 126th is better than 201-225th. Yes, so Dartmouth's wur is 126th, which is higher (better) than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225th. Similarly, qs is 113th vs 144th, both better for Dartmouth.\n\nSo the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher is false because in two metrics, they did rank higher.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Dartmouth College had higher rankings than the University of T\u00fcbingen in the wur and qs metrics. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Durham University (UK): wur 80th, arwu 201-300th, qs 90th.\n3. Queens University (Canada): wur 226-250th, arwu 201-300th, qs 189th.\n4. University of Otago (New Zealand): wur 226-250th, arwu 201-300th, qs 155th.\n5. University of Western Australia (Australia): wur 168th, arwu 91st, qs 134th.\n\nNow, comparing T\u00fcbingen's rankings to others:\n- wur: T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th, while Dartmouth is 126th, which is higher; Durham is 80th, higher; others have lower or similar ranges.\n- arwu: T\u00fcbingen is 151-200th, same as Dartmouth and Queens. Others like Durham and Otago are in 201-300th range; Western Australia is 91st.\nWait, no, wait: arwu for T\u00fcbingen is 151-200th? Wait no, looking back at the table:\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the columns. The third column after \"year established\" is \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\". Hmm, maybe that's a typo or formatting issue. Let me check.\n\nThe columns are:\n1. members\n2. country\n3. year established\n4. world rank by the - wur , 2013\n5. world rank by arwu , 2013\n6. world rank by qs , 2013\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense with the data. For example, the first row has \"126th\" in the fourth column, which would be wur 2013, then \"151 - 200th\" as fifth (arwu), and \"113th\" as sixth (qs). So each cell in a row corresponds to one of those rankings.\n\nSo for T\u00fcbingen, the columns are:\n- members: university of t\u00fcbingen\n- country: germany\n- year established: 1477\n- world rank by the - wur , 2013: \"201 - 225th\"\n- world rank by arwu , 2013: \"151 - 200th\"\n- world rank by qs , 2013: \"144th\"\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the columns. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row has six elements:\n1. members (university name)\n2. country\n3. year established\n4. world rank by wur in 2013\n5. world rank by arwu in 2013\n6. world rank by qs in 2013\n\nSo for T\u00fcbingen, the fourth column is \"201 - 225th\" (wur), fifth is \"151 - 200th\" (arwu), sixth is \"144th\" (qs).\n\nNow, comparing each ranking:\n\nLooking at wur rankings:\n- Dartmouth: 126th\n- Durham:80th\n- Queens:226-250\n- Otago:226-250\n- Western Australia:168th\n\nT\u00fcbingen's wur rank is 201-225. So compared to others, that's lower than Dartmouth (126), Durham (80), and Western Australia (168). It's higher than Queens and Otago (226-250) which are also in the same range as T\u00fcbingen.\n\nNow arwu rankings:\n- Dartmouth:151-200\n- Durham:201-300\n- Queens:201-300\n- Otago:201-300\n- Western Australia:91st\n\nT\u00fcbingen's arwu is 151-200, which is the same as Dartmouth. So T\u00fcbingen and Dartmouth are in the same range here.\n\nQs rankings:\n- Dartmouth:113th\n- Durham:90th\n- Queens:189th\n- Otago:155th\n- Western Australia:134th\n\nT\u00fcbingen's qs rank is 144th. So comparing to others, that's higher than Queens (189), lower than Otago (155), but higher than Dartmouth and Durham? Wait no:\n\nWait, the actual qs ranks are:\n- Dartmouth:113\n- Durham:90\n- Queens:189\n- Otago:155\n- Western Australia:134\n\nT\u00fcbingen is at 144. So comparing to others, it's lower than Western Australia (134), same as none? Wait no, 144 is higher than 134 but lower than others like Queens (189) and Dartmouth (113).\n\nWait, no, lower rank means worse position. So a lower number is better. For example, 90th is better than 144th.\n\nSo T\u00fcbingen's qs rank is 144th, which is better than Queens' 189th but worse than Western Australia's 134th and Dartmouth's 113th, and much worse than Durham's 90th.\n\nNow, the claim says that University of T\u00fcbingen has not done as well as the other universities. So looking at their rankings:\n\nIn wur: lower (worse) than several others.\narwu: same as Dartmouth.\nqs: higher (better) than Queens but worse than some.\n\nSo overall, T\u00fcbingen's performance is mixed. They have one ranking better (same as Dartmouth in arwu), one worse (wur), and qs is in between.\n\nBut the claim says they haven't done as well as others, which would mean their rankings are lower (worse) across the board.\n\nHowever, since in arwu they tie with Dartmouth, it's not universally worse. So perhaps the claim is based on wur and qs?\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that T\u00fcbingen's worst performance is in wur, where they rank lower than several others.\n\nBut to assess whether they haven't done as well as others, we need to see if their overall performance is below average compared to all others.\n\nLooking at each ranking:\n\n- wur: 201-225. The higher the number, worse the rank (since it's likely a numerical ranking). So lower numbers are better.\nBut wait, the data shows \"126th\" etc., so a lower number is better because it's a higher position. So 80th is better than 126th.\n\nSo T\u00fcbingen wur is 201-225: worse than several others (Dartmouth at 126, Durham at 80, Western Australia at 168). Better than Queens and Otago who are in the same range.\n\narwu:151-200. Same as Dartmouth's range, but worse than others like Durham, Queens, Otago, Western Australia.\n\nqs:144th. Worse than several (Durham at 90, Western Australia at134), better than Queens (189) and same as none else.\n\nSo in terms of worst-case scenario for T\u00fcbingen, their wur is the lowest, followed by arwu same as Dartmouth, qs worse than some.\n\nBut overall, they are not consistently the lowest across all rankings. They tie with Dartmouth in one ranking and are better in none except qs.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"T\u00fcbingen has not done as well as others\" might be considered true if considering wur and arwu where they are lower than many others, but in qs, they're higher than some.\n\nBut perhaps the main point is their wur rank being lower than several, which could indicate they haven't performed as well as those with lower wur ranks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is based on overall average or composite ranking. If we take each ranking and assign points for better performance (lower number), then T\u00fcbingen might have a higher score than others in some areas but worse in others.\n\nBut perhaps the user's task is to compare T\u00fcbingen's rankings against others, noting where they are lower (worse) or higher (better).\n\nIn conclusion, T\u00fcbingen has mixed performance compared to others. They are better in arwu and qs compared to some, but worse in wur compared to several.\n\nSo the statement that \"they have not done as well as others\" might be true considering their wur rank is lower than many, even if they tie or do better in other rankings.\n</think>\n\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen's performance across the three ranking systems (wur, arwu, qs) compared to other universities shows a mixed result. While their arwu and qs ranks are comparable or better than some institutions, their wur rank is lower than several others, indicating they have not performed as well in terms of world university rankings by the wur metric. \n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen has not done as well as other institutions specifically in the wur ranking, though they perform competitively in arwu and qs rankings.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Durham University is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Durham university have the second - best rank, ie, 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing with all the terms. I think they're referring to the World University Rankings (WUR) for 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a university with various details. The columns related to rankings are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013,\" \"world rank by arwu , 2013,\" and \"world rank by qs , 2013.\" I'm not exactly sure what ARWU and QS stand for, but WUR probably stands for World University Rankings.\n\nSo, focusing on the first column in the table which lists the universities. The claim is specifically about Durham University, so I need to find the row where \"durham university\" is listed.\n\nChecking the data rows:\n- Row 1: dartmouth college\n- Row 2: durham university\n- So that's row index 1 (since it's zero-based or one-based? Wait, in programming, indexes are usually zero-based. Let me check the example provided. In the sample JSON, the relevant_cells have row_index starting from 0. So for row 1, the row index would be 1.\n\nNow, looking at the columns:\n- The fourth column is \"world rank by the - wur , 2013.\" I think this is where we need to check their ranking in WUR 2013.\n- The fifth column is \"world rank by arwu , 2013,\" and sixth for QS. But since the claim mentions WUR, only the fourth column is relevant.\n\nIn row index 1 (Durham University), the value under the fourth column is \"80th.\" So that's exactly what the claim states: they have the second-best rank, which is 80th in WUR 2013.\n\nWait, but the term \"second-best\" might be a bit tricky. If \"80th\" is their rank, then it depends on how many universities are ranked above them. If 80th means they're the second best, that would imply only one university is higher than them, which isn't necessarily the case unless specified. But in this context, the claim says \"second-best,\" so maybe there's an implied first place.\n\nHowever, based purely on the table data, Durham University's WUR 2013 rank is listed as \"80th.\" The claim refers to it as \"the second - best rank, ie, 80th,\" which might be a way of saying their overall position is 80th. So, regardless of whether it's technically first or second, the data supports that their ranking in WUR 2013 is 80th.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category.\"\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure. The columns are members (which seem to be the names of universities), country, year established, world rank by - wur 2013, world rank by arwu 2013, and world rank by qs 2013. The data rows have each university's details.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: it mentions \"queen university of canada\" which I think is a typo because in the table, there's a row for \"queens university.\" So maybe the claim should be about Queens University instead. That might affect how we compare them to Dartmouth College.\n\nThe claim says Queens University of Canada has done better than Dartmouth College in all three categories. The three categories here are the world rankings by wur, arwu, and qs from 2013. \n\nI need to check each category for both universities. Let's start with Dartmouth College (row 0). Their rankings are: wur=126th, arwu=151-200th, qs=113th.\n\nQueens University is in row 2. Looking at their rankings: wur=226-250th, arwu=201-300th, qs=189th.\n\nNow, comparing each category:\n\n1. **wur**: Dartmouth is 126th, Queens is 226-250th. So, Dartmouth is higher.\n2. **aruw**: Dartmouth is 151-200th, Queens is 201-300th. Again, Dartmouth is higher.\n3. **qs**: Dartmouth is 113th, Queens is 189th. Dartmouth is higher here as well.\n\nSince the claim says that Queens did better than Dartmouth in all three, but in reality, Dartmouth has higher ranks (better positions) in all categories compared to Queens, the claim must be false. Therefore, I should answer \"FALSE.\"\n\nNext, identifying relevant cells: the columns needed are the world rank by wur, arwu, and qs for both Queen's University of Canada and Dartmouth College. Looking at their rows:\n\n- Dartmouth is row 0.\n- Queens is row 2.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be for row 0 (Dartmouth) in 'world rank by - wur , 2013' and 'world rank by arwu , 2013', as well as row 2 (Queens) in the same columns. Wait, but the claim refers to Queens doing better, so perhaps I need to check their rankings against Dartmouth's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up. The claim is that Queens has done better than Dartmouth in all three categories. So for each category, I should compare Queens' rank with Dartmouth's. \n\nSo, for each of the three columns:\n\n- world rank by wur 2013: Dartmouth=126th, Queens=226-250. So in this column, Dartmouth is higher.\n- arwu 2013: Dartmouth=151-200, Queens=201-300. Again, Dartmouth higher.\n- qs 2013: Dartmouth=113, Queens=189. Same here.\n\nSo Queens is lower (worse) in all three categories compared to Dartmouth. Hence the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because Queens didn't do better than Dartmouth in any category; rather, Dartmouth performed better.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by - wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by - wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better in all ranking than durham university despite its late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) doing better in all rankings than Durham University despite its later establishment is true or false. Let me start by breaking down the claim and then cross-referencing it with the given table.\n\nFirst, let's identify what each part of the claim is saying. The claim has two main parts: 1) UWA does better in all rankings compared to Durham University, and 2) despite UWA being established later than Durham.\n\nLooking at the data table provided, I see that it includes information on several universities, including both UWA and Durham. Each row represents a different university with details like their name, country, year established, and three ranking columns from different sources: wur, arwu, and qs, all for 2013.\n\nMy first step is to locate the relevant data points for both universities in the table. \n\nFor Durham University:\n- I need to find its row in the data array. Scanning through, I see that Durham is the second entry (index 1). Its details are:\n  - Name: durham university\n  - Country: uk\n  - Year established: 1832\n  - Rankings: \n    - wur: \"80th\"\n    - arwu: \"201 - 300th\"\n    - qs: \"90th\"\n\nFor the University of Western Australia (UWA):\n- It's the sixth entry in the data array (index 5). Its details are:\n  - Name: university of western australia\n  - Country: australia\n  - Year established: 1911\n  - Rankings:\n    - wur: \"168th\"\n    - arwu: \"134th\" (Wait, no, looking back, it's actually \"134th\"? Wait, no, let me check the table again. The user provided the table as:\n\nLooking at the data array:\n- For UWA: [ ..., \"university of western australia\", ... , 1911, \"168th\", \"91st\", \"134th\" ]\nWait, so wur is 168th, arwu is 134th? Wait no, let me check. The columns are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\".\n\nSo for UWA:\n- wur: 168th\n- arwu: 134th (Wait, no, looking at the table as provided, the third entry is QS, not ARWU. Wait no, let me recheck.\n\nIn the data array:\n\nFor UWA's row:\n[\n  \"university of western australia\",\n  \"australia\",\n  1911,\n  \"168th\",   // wur\n  \"91st\",    // arwu? Or is it QS?\nWait, looking at the columns again: The fourth column is \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", fifth is \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", sixth is \"world rank by qs , 2013\".\n\nSo for UWA:\n- Column4 (wur): 168th\n- Column5 (aruw): 91st?\nWait, no. Let me check the exact data.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n[\n  [\n    \"dartmouth college\",\n    \"usa\",\n    1769,\n    \"126th\",\n    \"151 - 200th\",\n    \"113th\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"durham university\",\n    \"uk\",\n    1832,\n    \"80th\",\n    \"201 - 300th\",\n    \"90th\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"queens university\",\n    \"canada\",\n    1841,\n    \"226 - 250th\",\n    \"201 - 300th\",\n    \"189th\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"university of otago\",\n    \"new zealand\",\n    1869,\n    \"226 - 250th\",\n    \"201 - 300th\",\n    \"155th\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"university of t\u00fcbingen\",\n    \"germany\",\n    1477,\n    \"201 - 225th\",\n    \"151 - 200th\",\n    \"144th\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"university of western australia\",\n    \"australia\",\n    1911,\n    \"168th\",\n    \"91st\",   // arwu? Or QS?\n    \"134th\"   // QS?\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, so for UWA, the columns are:\n\nColumn4: 168th (wur)\nColumn5: 91st (aruw or qs?)\nColumn6: 134th (qs)\n\nLooking at Durham's row:\n- Column4: 80th (wur)\n- Column5: 201 - 300th (aruw)\n- Column6: 90th (QS)\n\nWait, so for UWA:\n- wur rank is 168th\n- arwu rank is 91st? Or is it QS?\nNo, wait the columns are:\n\ncolumns[3] = \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" -> column4 in data is wur.\n\ncolumns[4] = \"world rank by arwu , 2013\" -> column5 in data is arwu.\n\ncolumns[5] = \"world rank by qs , 2013\" -> column6 in data is QS.\n\nSo for UWA:\n\n- wur: 168th\n- arwu: 91st?\nWait no, looking at the data array for UWA's row:\nThe fourth element (index 3) is 168th, which is columns[3] = \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n\nThen the fifth element (index4): \"91st\" corresponds to arwu.\n\nAnd sixth element (index5): \"134th\" corresponds to QS.\n\nWait, no, let's double-check:\n\nThe data row for UWA is:\n[\n  \"university of western australia\",\n  \"australia\",\n  1911,\n  \"168th\",   // columns[3] = wur\n  \"91st\",    // columns[4] = arwu\n  \"134th\"   // columns[5] = qs\n]\n\nSo, for UWA:\n\n- wur rank: 168th (columns[3])\n- arwu rank: 91st (columns[4])\n- qs rank: 134th (columns[5])\n\nAnd for Durham:\n\n- wur rank:80th (columns[3])\n- arwu rank:201 - 300th (columns[4])\n- qs rank:90th (columns[5])\n\nNow, the claim is that UWA does better in all rankings than Durham despite being established later.\n\nFirst, let's check the year of establishment. \n\nDurham was established in 1832, while UWA in 1911. So yes, UWA was established later.\n\nNext, we need to compare their rankings across all three metrics: wur, arwu, qs.\n\nFor each ranking metric, we'll see if UWA is better (has a lower numerical value) than Durham.\n\nStarting with wur:\n\n- UWA: 168th\n- Durham:80th\n\nHere, UWA's rank is higher than Durham's. So in this category, UWA is not better.\n\nNext, arwu:\n\nWait, for arwu, UWA has 91st and Durham has \"201 - 300th\" (which is a range). \n\nIn ranking terms, lower numerical value means better position. So:\n\n- UWA: 91st\n- Durham:201-300th\n\nHere, 91st is better than being in the 200s. So in arwu, UWA is better.\n\nLastly, qs:\n\nUWA:134th\nDurham:90th\n\nAgain, lower numerical value is better. So:\n\n- UWA:134th\n- Durham:90th\n\nHere, Durham's QS rank is better (lower number) than UWA's. So in this metric, UWA is worse.\n\nSo summarizing the rankings across metrics:\n\n1. wur: UWA worse\n2. arwu: UWA better\n3. qs: UWA worse\n\nNow, the claim says \"does better in all rankings\". Since in two out of three metrics, UWA is worse, and only one metric (aruw) it's better, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"does better in all rankings\". Maybe the user meant that UWA does better than Durham across all metrics. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no, because in two metrics (wur and qs), UWA is worse, while in one metric (aruw) it's better. So overall, across all three, it's not better in all rankings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that UWA does better than Durham in each of their respective rankings without considering absolute positions. But no, that wouldn't make much sense either because you can compare them directly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect; UWA does not do better than Durham in all rankings.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to evaluate whether the University of Western Australia (UWA) outperforms Durham University across all three ranking metrics: World University Rankings (wur), Academic Ranking by Subject (aruw), and QS World University Rankings. \n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. **World University Rankings (wur):**\n   - UWA: 168th\n   - Durham: 80th\n   - Conclusion: UWA is ranked lower, meaning Durham performs better.\n\n2. **Academic Ranking by Subject (aruw):**\n   - UWA: 91st\n   - Durham: 201-300th range\n   - Conclusion: UWA is ranked higher, performing better than Durham in this category.\n\n3. **QS World University Rankings:**\n   - UWA: 134th\n   - Durham: 90th\n   - Conclusion: UWA is ranked lower; Durham performs better here as well.\n\n**Final Assessment:** UWA does not outperform Durham across all three ranking metrics. While it does better in one (aruw), it lags behind in the other two (wur and QS). Therefore, the claim that UWA \"does better in all rankings\" is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: The University of Western Australia does not outperform Durham University across all three ranking metrics.",

Each row represents a university with its details.\n\nThe claim is about the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany having the worst rank in every single ranking. So I need to check their rankings in all three metrics provided: wur, arwu, and qs.\n\nLooking at the data rows, the University of T\u00fcbingen is in row index 4 (since it's the fifth entry, but indexing starts from 0). Let me confirm that: yes, it's the fifth element in the data array, so row_index would be 4.\n\nNow, looking at their rankings:\n- \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\": This seems a bit odd. The column name is written as \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\". Maybe there's a typo or formatting issue here. Perhaps it's supposed to be \"world rank by wur\" or another acronym. But looking at other columns, they have \"wur\", \"aruw\", etc., so I think this might be a mistake in formatting. However, the data for this cell is \"144th\". So I'll proceed with that.\n\n- \"world rank by arwu , 2013\": The data here is \"151 - 200th\".\n\n- \"world rank by qs , 2013\": The data here is \"134th\".\n\nWait, but the claim says they have the worst in every single ranking. For each of these rankings, I need to see if their position indicates the worst. Usually, lower rankings mean worse performance, so higher numerical values (like 126th) would be worse than lower ones like 80th or 90th.\n\nBut let's look at T\u00fcbingen's positions:\n- wur: 144th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 134th\n\nNow, the claim says they have the worst in every ranking. So I need to check if their rankings are the lowest (highest numerical value) in each category.\n\nLooking at the other universities:\n\nFor wur:\n- Dartmouth College is 126th\n- Durham University is 80th\n- Queens University is 113th\n- University of Otago is 226 - 250th\n- University of Western Australia is 168th\n\nWait, T\u00fcbingen's wur rank is 144th. So among the other universities, Dartmouth is 126 (best), then others like Durham at 80, Queens at 113, Otago in the lower range, and Western Australia at 168. So T\u00fcbingen's 144th isn't the worst; for example, Western Australia is ranked higher numerically as 168th which is worse than 144th.\n\nWait, no: in rankings, lower numbers are better. So 80th is better than 126th, and so on. Therefore, the worst rank would be the highest number. So T\u00fcbingen's wur ranking of 144th is not the worst because Western Australia has 168th, which is worse.\n\nSimilarly, for arwu: T\u00fcbingen is ranked 151-200th. Other universities have lower ranks. For example, Queens is 201-300th, which is worse, but T\u00fcbingen's rank is better than that. Wait, no: 151-200 is better than 201-300. So in arwu, T\u00fcbingen is ranked higher (better) than Queens.\n\nFor qs ranking, T\u00fcbingen is 134th. Other universities like Western Australia are 91st, which is much better, and Otago is 155th, which is worse than T\u00fcbingen's 134th.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"worst in every single ranking.\" So I need to check each of the three rankings. If in any of them they are not the worst (i.e., their rank isn't higher than all others), then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at each ranking:\n\n1. wur: T\u00fcbingen 144th, others have worse ranks like Western Australia at 168th and Otago at 226-250. So in this ranking, they are not the worst.\n\n2. arwu: T\u00fcbingen 151-200, Queens is 201-300, so T\u00fcbingen's rank is better than Queens', but compared to others like Dartmouth (which isn't specified here). Wait, Dartmouth has a wur rank of 126th but their arwu and qs ranks aren't provided. Hmm, maybe I should only consider the given data.\n\nIn the table, for arwu, T\u00fcbingen is 151-200. Other universities in the list have arwu rankings as well: Queens is 201-300, Otago is 226-250, Western Australia isn't listed here, but since T\u00fcbingen's rank is better than Queens and Otago, they are not the worst.\n\n3. qs ranking: T\u00fcbingen 134th. Western Australia has 91st, which is better, so again, T\u00fcbingen is not the worst in this category.\n\nTherefore, T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst in any of the three rankings. So the claim that they are the worst in every single ranking is false.\n</think>\n\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen's rankings (144th for wur, 151-200th for arwu, and 134th for qs) do not place them as the worst in any category among the listed universities. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
