    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"During season 1991, West Indies be the holder at the end of the series and the host England be 5 and have the result of series drawn.\"\n\nI should look for the relevant data in the table. The table has a lot of columns, so I need to identify which ones are important here.\n\nLet's see, the season in question is 1991. Looking at the \"series\" column, I find row 14: \"1991\". So that's our starting point. Now, let me check each part of the claim against the corresponding cells.\n\nThe first part is about the holder at the end of the series. In the table, there's a column called \"holder at the end of the series.\" For row 14, this cell is \"west indies\" according to the data provided: [\"1991\", \"-\", \"-\", 5, 2, 2, 1, \"series drawn\", \"west indies\"]. Wait, actually, looking again, in row 14, the holder is listed as \"west indies\". So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the host. The host for each series seems to be under the \"host\" column. Row 14 says the host is \"england.\" The claim mentions that the host is England and has a certain number of tests. But wait, the host's data in row 14 is just listed as \"england,\" but what about the number of tests? Let me check the \"tests\" column for row 14. The value there is 5. So yes, the host (England) conducted 5 tests.\n\nThe claim also mentions that the result was a series drawn. Looking at the \"series result\" column in row 14, it says \"series drawn.\" So that's correct too.\n\nPutting it all together: For season 1991, West Indies are the holders, England hosted with 5 tests, and the series result was a draw. All these points match the table data.\n\nSo I think the claim is TRUE. Now, to identify the relevant cells, I need to list which columns were checked. The relevant columns for this claim would be:\n\n1. \"holder at the end of the series\" (row 14)\n2. \"host\" (row 14)\n3. \"series result\" (row 14)\n4. \"tests\" (row 14)\n\nSo I'll include these as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"series result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
