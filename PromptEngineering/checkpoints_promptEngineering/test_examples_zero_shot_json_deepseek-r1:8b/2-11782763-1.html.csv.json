    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"William Adelin be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that William Adelin was the sole individual who became heir solely because of his birth. So, I'm looking for information in the table about William Adelin becoming heir due to being born.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", \"became heir\", \"reason\", \"ceased to be heir\", and \"monarch\". The data rows provide different people who were heirs under various circumstances.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row to see if William Adelin is mentioned as an heir. Scanning the first column (\"heir\"), I notice that in row 5, the heir is \"William adelin\". So, this seems relevant because it's directly about him being an heir.\n\nNext, looking at the \"became heir\" column for this row, which is row index 5, the value is \"1103\". This means William Adelin became heir in 1103. The reason given is \"born\", so that aligns with the claim's statement of becoming heir due to birth.\n\nI should check if there are any other entries where someone else also became heir due to birth. Let me scan through the other rows. In row 0, Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 because his father became king. That seems to be a different reason than just being born. \n\nRow 2 mentions Robert Curthose again as heir presumptive in 1087, with the reason \"by agreement\". Row 3 talks about Henry Beauclerc becoming heir in 1088 due to a rebellion, so that's another different reason.\n\nRows 4 and 5 mention succession issues but don't reference William Adelin. Row 6 is about Empress Matilda, who became heiress presumptive because her brother died.\n\nSo, from this analysis, it looks like only William Adelin in row 5 became heir specifically due to birth, as stated by the claim. There are no other entries where someone else became heir solely because of their birth. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"William Adelin be the only 1 who became heir due to birth,\" we analyze the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - **Heir**: William adelin\n  - **Became Heir**: 1103\n  - **Reason**: born\n\nThis row shows that William Adelin became heir solely due to his birth. No other heirs are documented as becoming heir due to birth, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this conclusion.\n\nThe claim is: \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns of the table to understand what each column represents. The columns are:\n\n1. heir\n2. status\n3. relationship to monarch\n4. became heir\n5. reason\n6. ceased to be heir\n7. monarch\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into parts.\n\n1. Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088.\n2. He became heir a year after Robert Curthose.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- The first relevant row is where Henry Beauclerc becomes heir. Scanning through the rows:\n   - Row 3: \"henry beauclerc\" as heir, status \"heir presumptive\", relationship \"younger brother\", became heir in 1088, reason \"by agreement\". This seems to match the first part of the claim.\n\n- Now, checking if Robert Curthose was an heir before Henry. The second relevant row is where Robert Curthose becomes heir:\n   - Row 0: \"robert curthose\" as heir, became heir in 1066. So he became heir in 1066, and Henry became heir in 1088, which is indeed a year after (1088 - 1066 = 22 years apart). However, the claim says \"a year after,\" implying an immediate succession. But according to the table, Robert Curthose was heir presumptive from 1066 onwards until he was succeeded by others.\n\nWait, but in row 0, Robert became heir in 1066, and then in row 2, another entry for Robert as heir presumptive with became heir in 1087. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rows. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Robert Curthose becomes heir in 1066.\nRow 1: All columns are about succession unclear from 1077-1087, related to William I.\nRow 2: Henry Beauclerc's entry is here, becoming heir in 1088. So the claim says Henry became heir in 1088, a year after Robert Curthose.\n\nBut when did Robert Curthose become heir? From row 0, he became heir in 1066. Then, row 2 shows another entry for Robert as heir presumptive, with became heir in 1087, and then Henry in 1088.\n\nWait, so maybe the claim is that Henry became heir in 1088, a year after Robert Curthose (who became heir in 1087). So 1088 is the next year after 1087. That fits the claim's wording.\n\nBut looking back at row 0: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066. Then, in row 2, he becomes heir again in 1087? Or is row 2 a different entry?\n\nWait, no. The rows are individual entries. So row 0 is about Robert becoming heir in 1066. Then, row 2 is Henry becoming heir in 1088.\n\nBut the claim says \"a year after robert curthose,\" which would imply that Robert was still alive and the immediate predecessor. But according to the table, Robert became heir in 1066, then Henry in 1088. So the time between is over 22 years, not a year. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me check each row's data:\n\nRow 0:\n- heir: robert curthose\n- became heir: 1066\n\nRow 2:\n- heir: henry beauclerc\n- became heir: 1088\n\nSo Robert became heir in 1066, Henry in 1088. That's 22 years later, not a year after.\n\nWait, but looking at row 3, it's about Henry becoming heir in 1088 as well. Hmm, perhaps the table has multiple entries for the same person? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Each row is an individual claim about someone becoming heir. So Robert Curthose became heir in 1066, and then Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088. Therefore, the claim that Henry became heir a year after Robert is incorrect because it's not just one year after; it's over two decades.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088, specifically \"a year after robert curthose.\" Examining the table, Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 (row 0), and Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088 (row 3). The time between these two events is 22 years, not a single year. Thus, the claim's assertion of an immediate succession is incorrect.\n\n**Answer: \"FALSE\"**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only 2 heirs have son as their relationship to monarch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that only two heirs had a son as their relationship to the monarch. So, I need to check each heir in the table and see if their \"relationship to monarch\" is \"son\". Then, count how many such entries there are.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns for this claim would be \"heir\" and \"relationship to monarch.\" The other columns like \"became heir,\" \"reason,\" etc., probably aren't needed here because the claim is only about the type of relationship (son) each heir had with the monarch.\n\nNow, let's go through each row in the data section of the table:\n\n1. First row:\n   - Heir: Robert Curthose\n   - Relationship to Monarch: son\n   So, this counts as 1.\n\n2. Second row:\n   - All entries for \"relationship to monarch\" are \"succession unclear...\". Since it's not specifically a son, I don't count this. So, no addition here.\n\n3. Third row:\n   - Heir: Robert Curthose again\n   - Relationship to Monarch: elder brother. That's not a son, so no count.\n\n4. Fourth row:\n   - Heir: Henry Beauclerc\n   - Relationship to Monarch: younger brother. Not a son, so no count.\n\n5. Fifth row:\n   - Heir: William Adelin\n   - Relationship to Monarch: only son. That's another son, so total now is 2.\n\n6. Sixth row:\n   - Heir: Empress Matilda\n   - Relationship to Monarch: only child. Wait, is \"only child\" considered a son? Well, she's female, and her relationship is as the heir with the monarch (Henry I). But since she's an heir too, her being his only child might not be specifically a son. So, this doesn't count as a son. Therefore, no addition.\n\nSo, from the above, only two heirs have \"son\" as their relationship to the monarch: Robert Curthose and William Adelin.\n\nBut wait, I notice that in the first row, it's Robert Curthose with William I as the monarch, and he became heir in 1066. Then later, Robert is again listed with William II, but his relationship is now \"elder brother.\" So, same person, different relationships.\n\nIn the fifth row, William Adelin is the only son of Henry I, and he's the heir apparent. He becomes heir in 1103 but dies in 1120 before succeeding, so that's another case where the heir (William Adelin) has a son relationship with the monarch (Henry I).\n\nWait, no\u2014Hold on: The claim says \"only 2 heirs have son as their relationship to monarch.\" So, we're counting the number of heirs who are sons. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row is about an heir. For each heir, check if their relationship is \"son.\"\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose is a son.\n- Row 1: Heir's relationship is unclear, not a son.\n- Row 2: Robert again, but now as brother, not son.\n- Row 3: Henry Beauclerc as brother, not son.\n- Row 4: Succession unclear; not relevant.\n- Row 5: William Adelin as only son.\n- Row 6: Empress Matilda is a daughter (only child), so not a son.\n\nWait, but in row 0 and row 5, we have two different heirs who are sons. So that's two. But let me check all rows again:\n\nRow 0: Robert Curthose as son \u2192 count =1\n\nRow 1: Not son\n\nRow 2: Brother \u2192 no\n\nRow3: Brother\u2192no\n\nRow4: unclear\u2192no\n\nRow5: William Adelin as only son\u2192count=2\n\nRow6: Daughter\u2192no\n\nSo, total of two heirs who are sons. Therefore, the claim says \"only 2 heirs have son as their relationship to monarch.\" That would make it TRUE.\n\nBut wait, another thought: The claim is about \"heirs\" having a son as their relationship. So, perhaps it's referring to the heir being someone whose title is related to sonship. But in this table, each row represents an heir with certain details, including their relationship to the monarch they inherited from.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all heirs and their relationships:\n\n1. Robert Curthose: son (William I)\n\n2. Succession unclear: not applicable\n\n3. Robert Curthose again: brother (William II)\n\n4. Henry Beauclerc: brother (William II)\n\n5. Succession unclear: Henry I's heir?\n\n6. William Adelin: only son (Henry I)\n\n7. Empress Matilda: only child (Henry I)\n\nSo, in rows 0 and 5, we have two heirs who are sons of their respective monarchs.\n\nWait, but row 5 is William Adelin as the heir to Henry I, whose relationship is \"only son.\" So that's a third case? Wait no\u2014Wait, let me list all the 'heir' entries:\n\nLooking at each row, the first element in data is the heir. So, the heirs are:\n\n0: Robert Curthose\n\n1: succession unclear... but it's a row about William I's succession issues.\n\n2: Robert Curthose again as elder brother (William II)\n\n3: Henry Beauclerc as younger brother (William II)\n\n4: Succession unclear for Henry I\n\n5: William Adelin as only son (Henry I)\n\n6: Empress Matilda as heiress presumptive (Henry I)\n\nSo, from this list:\n\n- Robert Curthose is a son in the first row.\n\n- William Adelin is a son in the fifth row.\n\nThat's two heirs who are sons.\n\nWait, but in row 6, Empress Matilda is the heir and her relationship is \"heiress presumptive.\" She's only child, not a son. So she doesn't count as a son, only as a daughter or heiress.\n\nTherefore, the total number of heirs who have \"son\" as their relationship to the monarch is two: Robert Curthose and William Adelin.\n\nThus, the claim says \"only 2 heirs have son as their relationship.\" Therefore, it's TRUE.\n\nWait, but another angle: The first row's Robert Curthose's relationship is as a son (heir) of William I. The fifth row's William Adelin's relationship is as a son of Henry I. So that's two different contexts\u2014different monarchs, same title.\n\nThus, the count is accurate at two.\n\nBut wait, could there be more? Let me check all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose \u2192 son (William I)\n\n- Row1: unclear\n\n- Row2: Robert as brother (William II)\n\n- Row3: Henry as brother (William II)\n\n- Row4: unclear (Henry I's succession)\n\n- Row5: William Adelin \u2192 son (Henry I)\n\n- Row6: Empress Matilda\u2192daughter/heiress (Henry I)\n\nSo, only two heirs have \"son\" as their relationship.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that only two heirs have a \"son\" as their relationship to the monarch is supported by the analysis. \n\n**Answer:** The statement is TRUE.",

The claim is: \"henry beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 august 1100, followed by william adelin 20 years later.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, and monarch.\n\nI'm looking for two specific pieces of information:\n1. When Henry Beauclerc ceased to be heir.\n2. Whether William Adelin became heir 20 years after that.\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll scan each row for \"henry beauclerc\" in the 'heir' column. I find him in the fourth row (index 3). The 'ceased to be heir' column for this row has \"2 august 1100.\" So that's the date Henry stopped being heir.\n\nNext, I need to check if William Adelin took over as heir 20 years later. The relevant row would be where the 'monarch' is Henry I and the 'heir' is William Adelin. Looking at rows, William Adelin is in row 5 (index 5), with a 'ceased to be heir' date of November 25, 1120, but that's his own ceasing, not becoming. Wait, no\u2014actually, he became heir in 1103 and then ceased in 1120. So the time between Henry Beauclerc's cessation (1100) and William Adelin's succession isn't exactly 20 years. It should be from 1100 to 1103, which is a 3-year gap. Wait, no\u2014the claim says William followed after 20 years. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The row for William Adelin (row 5) shows he became heir in 1103, so the time between August 2, 1100, and his becoming heir is about two and a half years. That's not 20 years. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a 20-year gap, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be where Henry Beauclerc is the heir and has a 'ceased to be heir' date, as well as William Adelin becoming heir.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not fully supported. The time between Henry Beauclerc ceasing in 1100 and William Adelin succeeding is around two years, not 20.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, and monarch. The claim mentions \"henry beauclerc\" becoming heir due to birth, so I should focus on the rows where this person is involved as an heir.\n\nLooking at the data, row 3 has \"henry beauclerc\" as the heir with status \"heir presumptive,\" relationship \"younger brother,\" became heir in 1088, reason \"robert 's rebellion,\" and ceased to be heir on 2 August 1100. So this directly relates to Henry becoming heir.\n\nRow 4 mentions succession unclear from 1100-1103, but it's under the column \"heir\" as \"succession unclear...\" so maybe not relevant unless someone was considered heir due to birth here. However, row 5 has William Adelin as heir apparent and only son, becoming heir in 1103, with reason \"born,\" and he died in 1120. That's another case of an heir becoming due to birth.\n\nRow 6 involves Matilda, who is the heiress presumptive, only child, became heir in 1127 after her brother died in 1135. So she also became heir due to birth as she was the only child.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the only 1,\" but in the table, there are at least three people: Henry Beauclerc, William Adelin, and Matilda. Each of them became heir either through birth or due to others dying without issue. So the claim that Henry is the only one isn't accurate because others also became heirs due to birth.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.

The claim is: \"Robert Curthose be the heir 2 times, in 1066 and 1087.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's saying that Robert Curthose was named as heir twice, specifically in 1066 and 1087. So I need to look through the table to find any instances where Robert Curthose is listed as an heir with those years.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"heir,\" \"status,\" \"relationship to monarch,\" \"became heir,\" \"reason,\" \"ceased to be heir,\" and \"monarch.\" Each row represents a different event or period, with data filled in these columns.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: The heir is Robert Curthose. Status is \"heir presumptive.\" Relationship is \"son\" of William I. Became heir in 1066. Reason is his father becoming king. Cessated in 1077. Monarch is William I. So here, Robert was named as heir in 1066.\n\nRow 1: Heir is \"succession unclear,\" which probably means there wasn't a clear heir during that time. Not relevant to Robert Curthose.\n\nRow 2: Heir is Robert Curthose again. Status is \"heir presumptive.\" Relationship is \"elder brother\" of William II. Became heir in 1087, by agreement. Cessated in 1088. Monarch is William II. So here, Robert was named as heir in 1087.\n\nRow 3: Heir is Henry Beauclerc. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Heir unclear again.\n\nRow 5: Heir is William Adelin.\n\nRow 6: Heir is Empress Matilda.\n\nSo from the first and second rows, Robert Curthose was indeed named as heir in both 1066 and 1087. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nNow, about the relevant cells: The columns to check are \"heir,\" \"became heir,\" \"ceased to be heir,\" and possibly others like \"monarch\" if needed.\n\nFor each occurrence of Robert Curthose being heir:\n\n- Row 0: Heir is in column 0.\n- Became heir in 1066 is column 3.\n- Monarch is William I, column 6.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, column \"heir.\"\n- Row 0, column \"became heir\" (value 1066).\n- Row 0, column \"monarch.\"\n\nSimilarly for row 2:\n- Heir in column 0.\n- Became heir in 1087 is column 3.\n- Monarch is William II.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows 0 and 2, columns \"heir,\" \"became heir\" (with their respective years), and \"monarch.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"monarch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"monarch\"}\n]}",

Looking at the table's columns, the relevant ones seem to be \"heir,\" \"relationship to monarch,\" and maybe \"status\" or \"became heir.\" But wait, let me make sure I'm focusing on the right columns.\n\nThe \"columns\" list includes:\n- heir\n- status\n- relationship to monarch\n- became heir\n- reason\n- ceased to be heir\n- monarch\n\nSo for each heir, I need to look at their \"relationship to monarch.\" The claim is specifically about daughters.

Sixth row: Empress Matilda is the heir, and her relationship is \"heiress presumptive.\" Her status as an heiress typically includes being female, but does that count as a daughter? The claim specifically mentions daughters, so I need to check if any of these are explicitly listed as daughters.\n\nWait, looking at the sixth row again: it says \"only child,\" and her relationship is \"heiress presumptive.\" So she's the only child, which could mean she's the daughter. But in this case, the relationship is stated as \"heiress presumptive\" rather than \"daughter.\"\n\nNow, let me see if any other rows mention daughters explicitly. The last row isn't filled out because it's about Henry I, and the heirs are William Adelin and Matilda, both of whom don't have their relationships listed as daughter.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each heir:\n\n- Robert Curthose: son\n- Succession unclear: no info\n- Robert again: brother\n- Henry Beauclerc: brother\n- William Adelin: son\n- Matilda: heiress\n\nNone of them explicitly mention being a daughter. So does that mean the claim is false? Because none of the heirs have \"daughter\" as their relationship to monarch.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The term \"heiress presumptive\" could imply that she's a female heir, which would make her a daughter if she's an only child. But in the table, it says \"only child,\" not specifically daughter. So without explicitly saying \"daughter,\" we can't assume.\n\nSo, in the entire table, I don't see any heirs with \"daughter\" as their relationship to the monarch. Therefore, the claim that only three heirs have daughters is false because there are zero heirs listed as having a daughter relationship.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check each heir's \"relationship to monarch\" column for mentions of \"daughter.\"\n\n1. **First row**: Robert Curthose \u2192 \"son\"\n2. **Second row**: \"succession unclear...\" (no daughter)\n3. **Third row**: Robert Curthose \u2192 \"elder brother\"\n4. **Fourth row**: Henry Beauclerc \u2192 \"younger brother\"\n5. **Fifth row**: William Adelin \u2192 \"only son\"\n6. **Sixth row**: Empress Matilda \u2192 \"heiress presumptive\" (no explicit daughter)\n\nNone of the heirs have their relationship listed as \"daughter.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim says: \"robert curthose became heir in 1094, a year after empress matilda.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table for mentions of Robert Curthose. From the columns, I see 'heir', 'became heir', etc., so those are relevant. \n\nIn the data, Robert Curthose appears in row 0 and row 2.\n\nLooking at row 0: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066. So his becoming heir was in 1066, not 1094. That doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 2: He is mentioned as heir presumptive in 1087 and became heir in 1088. Again, these are before 1094.\n\nNow checking for Empress Matilda. She's mentioned in row 5. Her becoming heir was on November 25, 1120, but she became heiress presumptive earlier, in 1127. The claim refers to her as \"a year after,\" so perhaps implying she became heir the next year? Wait, no\u2014the claim is about Robert becoming heir in 1094, a year after Matilda.\n\nWait, looking at the table, when did Matilda become heiress presumptive? In row 5: she was declared heiress presumptive on November 25, 1120, and then it's mentioned again as \"heiress presumptive\" with the same date. The reason is \"brother died\" on December 1, 1135. So she became heiress presumptive in 1120, but Robert Curthose was already dead by then.\n\nBut the claim is about Robert becoming heir in 1094, a year after Matilda. However, from the table, Robert became heir in 1088, and Matilda became heiress presumptive in 1120. So there's a significant gap, more than a year, between their respective events. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim says Robert became heir in 1094, which is after Matilda. But according to the table, Robert was already heir in 1088, and Matilda became heiress presumptive much later, in 1120. So Robert becoming heir in 1094 wouldn't be a year after Matilda.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: The claim says \"a year after empress matilda.\" So does it mean that Robert's becoming heir was the next year after Matilda's event? Or is it referring to something else?\n\nIn the table, when did Matilda become heiress presumptive? It's in row 5. She was proclaimed as such on November 25, 1120, and her brother died on December 1, 1135. So she became heiress presumptive in 1120.\n\nSo if Robert became heir in 1094, that would be way before Matilda's time. But according to the table, Robert was heir in 1088, so 1094 isn't his becoming year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states Robert became heir in 1094 when he actually did so earlier.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells:\n\nLooking for any rows where Robert Curthose and Matilda are mentioned.\n\nRobert Curthose is in row 0 (became heir in 1066), row 2 (became heir in 1088). So columns: 'heir', 'became heir'.\n\nMatilda is in row 5. Columns: 'heiress presumptive', 'reason' about her brother's death.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0, column 'became heir'\n- Row 2, column 'became heir'\n- Row 5, columns 'heiress presumptive' and 'reason'\n\nI need to list all these in relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"heiress presumptive\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"william adelin cease to be heir on 5 august 1119, follow by empress matilda 21 year later.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like \"heir,\" \"status,\" \"relationship to monarch,\" etc., and rows of data. My goal is to find relevant cells that can verify the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions William Adelin ceasing to be heir on August 5, 1119. Then, Empress Matilda takes over 21 years later. So I need to check if these events are recorded in the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The first row (row_index=0) is about Robert Curthose. Not relevant.\n- Second row seems to be about succession uncertainty under William I. Doesn't mention William Adelin or Empress Matilda.\n- Third row talks about Robert Curthose again, becoming heir in 1087. Still not relevant.\n- Fourth row is about Henry Beauclerc, becoming heir in 1088. Not relevant.\n- Fifth row discusses succession unclear until 1103 under Henry I. Not our focus.\n- Sixth row: William Adelin is the heir apparent with status \"heir apparent.\" He became heir in 1103 and ceased on November 25, 1120. Wait, but the claim says he ceases in August 1119. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I need to check if there's another row.\n- Seventh row is about Empress Matilda, who was the heiress presumptive and became heir upon her brother's death in 1135. The claim says she becomes heir after William Adelin, but according to this row, she becomes heir after her brother died in 1135.\n\nWait, let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking at row_index=5: \"william adelin\" is listed as the heir apparent with relationship to monarch as \"only son.\" The 'became heir' column has \"1103,\" and 'ceased to be heir' on \"25 november 1120.\" So William Adelin was heir from 1103 until he died in 1120.\n\nThen, row_index=6: Empress Matilda became heiress presumptive with 'relationship to monarch' as \"only child.\" Her 'ceased to be heir' is listed as \"1 december 1135 (22 december 1135).\" So she took over after her brother (Henry I) died in 1135, not immediately after William Adelin.\n\nNow, the claim says William Adelin ceases in August 1119, and Matilda follows 21 years later. From the table, William Adelin was heir until 1120, so he didn't cease in 1119. Also, Empress Matilda became heiress presumptive before her brother died in 1135, which is more than 21 years after William Adelin's death (he died in 1120). So the timeline doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, looking for any row that mentions William Adelin ceasing in August 1119. There isn't one. The only entry for him is in row 5, ceasing in November 1120.\n\nSo the claim has two inaccuracies: the date of William Adelin's cessation and the timing between his departure and Empress Matilda's assumption.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about William Adelin ceasing to be heir in August 1119 and Empress Matilda taking over 21 years later is incorrect based on the table. The data shows William Adelin was heir until his death in November 1120, and Empress Matilda became heiress presumptive after her brother's death in December 1135, which doesn't align with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"robert curthose be the heir twice, in 1082 and 1094.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It's a JSON table with columns like \"heir,\" \"status,\" etc., and rows that provide information about different heirs over time. Each row has data about a specific person being an heir, their relationship to the monarch, when they became heir, why, when they ceased, and the name of the monarch.\n\nThe claim is saying Robert Curthose was the heir twice: once in 1082 and again in 1094. So I need to check if there are two instances where Robert Curthose is listed as an heir around those years.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n1. First row (index 0): Heir is Robert Curthose, became heir in 1066, so that's before 1082.\n2. Second row: All entries are \"succession unclear\" and dates from 1077-1087. No Robert here.\n3. Third row (index 2): Heir is Robert Curthose again, became heir in 1087. So this is a second time he was heir, but the claim says 1094. Wait, but his becoming heir was in 1087, and then when did he cease? The next data point shows Robert Curthose ceased being heir in 1088, as per the third row's \"ceased to be heir\" date of 1088. So he was heir from 1086 (since became in 1066, but wait no\u2014wait, first row says he became in 1066? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, first row: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 and his status is \"heir presumptive.\" Then in the third row, same person, Robert, became heir in 1087. So that's two times: 1066 and 1087. But the claim says he was heir twice in 1082 and 1094.\n\nSo perhaps I need to check if Robert Curthose is an heir again after 1088 or something else. Let me look at the data more carefully.\n\nRow 0:\n- Heir: Robert Curthose\n- Became: 1066\n- Monarch: William I\n\nRow 2:\n- Heir: Robert Curthose\n- Became: 1087\n- Monarch: William II\n\nSo he was heir in 1066 and 1087. The claim mentions 1082 and 1094, which are not in these dates.\n\nWait, but perhaps the second time he was heir, maybe in a different monarch's reign? Let me check other rows.\n\nRow 3: Henry Beauclerc is heir from 1088, so after Robert Curthose. No Robert there.\n\nRow 5: William Adelin is heir in 1103, but that's later than the claim.\n\nRow 6: Empress Matilda is heir in 1120, even later.\n\nSo in the table, Robert Curthose was heir twice: once under William I and again under William II. But not in 1082 or 1094 as per the claim.\n\nWait, let me see if there's any row where he became heir again after 1087. The next relevant row is row 3, but that's Henry Beauclerc. Then row 5: William Adelin, and row 6: Matilda. So Robert doesn't become heir again in the table beyond 1087.\n\nSo the claim says he was heir twice: in 1082 and 1094. But according to the table, he was heir in 1066 (row 0) and 1087 (row 2). The second instance is 1087, not 1082 or 1094. Therefore, the claim's dates don't match the actual data.\n\nAdditionally, looking at row 3: Robert Curthose isn't mentioned again after 1088 when he ceased being heir in 1088. So no, there's no third time, but also the two times are not as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because the dates don't align with the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Robert Curthose was heir twice, specifically in 1082 and 1094. However, checking the table shows he was heir in 1066 and 1087 under different monarchs but not during those years as claimed.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: The \"heir\" column is key.\n2. **Review each row**: Look for Robert Curthose's entries.\n3. **Check becoming and ceasing dates**: \n   - Row 0: Became heir in 1066, ceased not explicitly stated.\n   - Row 2: Became heir in 1087, ceased in 1088.\n4. **Conclusion**: No entry matches the claim of being heir in 1082 or 1094.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
