    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two key pieces: \n1. The viewers count must be more than 12.42 million.\n2. The row where the rating/share is exactly \"3.2 / 8\".\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find the one that matches the second condition\u2014the rating/share of 3.2/8.\n\nLet me check each entry in the 'rating / share (18 - 49)' column:\n\n- Row 0: 2.6 / 7\n- Row 1: 2.6 / 6\n- Row 2: 3.0 / 8 \u2192 This is close but not exactly 3.2/8.\n- Row 3: 3.1 / 8\n- Row 4: 3.1 / 8\n- Row 5: 3.2 / 8 \u2192 Found it here.\n- Row 6: 3.8 / 10\n- Row 7: 2.9 / 8\n- Rows 8, 9: n/a\n- Row 10: 2.0 / 7\n- Row 11: n/a\n- Row 12: n/a\n\nSo the only row where rating/share is exactly \"3.2 / 8\" is row index 5.\n\nNow, I need to check what the viewers count is for this row. Looking at column 'viewers (millions)', which is the fourth column in each data array.\n\nRow 5: Viewers = 12.42 million.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 12.42 million.\" So is 12.42 more than itself? No, it's equal. Therefore, the viewers count is not greater than 12.42 million; it's exactly 12.42 million.\n\nSo, the claim is false because there isn't a viewers count exceeding 12.42 million for that specific row. The relevant cells are row 5 and column 'viewers (millions)'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there is more than 12.42 million viewers for an entry with rating/share of 3.2/8. Upon checking the table, only one entry matches this rating/share at row index 5, with exactly 12.42 million viewers. Since it's not more than 12.42 million, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}",
