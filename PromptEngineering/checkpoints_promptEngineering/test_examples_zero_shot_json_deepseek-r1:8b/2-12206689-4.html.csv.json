    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the highest attendance was 54092\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions the 2004 Texas Ranger season and refers to the highest attendance being 54,092. Looking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. The data rows list various games, their dates, opponents, scores, losses (with pitcher details), and attendances.\n\nMy task is to find if there's a game where the attendance was 54,092. So I'll need to go through each row of the table and check the \"attendance\" column for that specific number.\n\nStarting from the first data row:\n- June 1: 17,136\n- June 2: 18,098\n- June 4: 49,372\n- June 5: 51,910\nWait, 51,910 is close to 54,092 but not exactly that number. Let me continue checking.\n\nLooking further down:\n- June 10 has two entries, one with \"n/a\" which probably means the game wasn't played, and another with 27,219.\n- Other dates: June 11 has 32,962; June 12: 42,173; June 13: 41,087; June 15: 36,501; June 16: 39,114; June 17: 40,383; June 18: 20,506; June 19: 31,021; June 20: 23,643; June 22: 32,364; June 23: 30,418; June 24: 26,266; June 25: 46,088; June 26: 40,131; June 27: 43,328; June 28: 28,253; June 29: 34,844; and June 30: 32,754.\n\nNone of these attendance figures match 54,092. The closest is June 5 with 51,910, but that's not the exact number mentioned in the claim.\n\nI also notice that there are entries for June 10 where one game has \"n/a\" for attendance. Maybe that indicates an unknown or missing data point, so it doesn't contribute to the highest figure. Therefore, based on this analysis, the highest attendance doesn't reach 54,092 as claimed.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because there's no row in the table where the attendance was exactly 54,092.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check each game's attendance against the number mentioned (54,092). After reviewing all rows, none of the attendances match this figure. \n\nThe relevant cells are those that list attendance numbers close to 54k but not exactly 54,092.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in the 2004 texas ranger season the highest score by a single team be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions the 2004 Texas Ranger season and refers to the highest score by a single team being 12. So, I need to check if there's any game where a team scored 12 runs in that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list games from June 1 to June 30, with various opponents, scores, loss details, and attendance. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"date\", \"opponent\", \"score\", and perhaps \"attendance\" but maybe not necessary here. However, since we're looking for a score of 12 by a single team, I need to focus on the \"score\" column.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the table to see if any game has a score of 12- something or something -12, indicating one team scored 12 runs. Let's check each row:\n\n1. June 1: Indians vs Yankees. Scores are 6-5 and 7-6. No 12s.\n2. June 4: Yankees vs White. Score is 7-6. No 12s.\n3. June 5: Yankees vs White again? Wait, the opponent is Yankees on June 5? Wait no, looking back, June 4 is against \"white (2 -1)\", and June 5 is also Yankees, but the first game on June 5 has a score of 8-1. No 12s.\n4. June 6: Yankees vs Red Sox? Score is 2-1. No.\n5. June 7: Pirates vs Indians. Score is 6-5. No.\n6. June 9 and 10 are postponed, so no games there.\n7. June 10 has two entries for Pirates. One score is 9-7 and another is 10-4. No 12s.\n8. June 11: Cardinals vs Indians? Score is 12-7. Oh, wait, that's one team scoring 12 runs! So the opponent, which is \"cardinals\", scored 12, and the other team scored 7.\n9. Then June 12: Cardinals again, score is 7-2. No.\n10. June 13: Score is 3-2. No.\n11. June 15: Red Sox vs Indians? 5-4. No.\n12. June 16: 7-4. No.\n13. June 17: 4-3. No.\n14. June 18: Marlins vs Reds? 8-1. No.\n15. June 19: 7-6. No.\n16. June 20: 4-2. No.\n17. June 22: Mariners vs Reds? Score is 10-2. Oh, Mariners scored 10, not 12.\n18. June 23: 6-3. No.\n19. June 24: 9-7. No.\n20. June 25: Astros vs Indians? 3-1. No.\n21. June 26: 8-7. No.\n22. June 27: 1-0. No.\n23. June 28: Mariners vs Astros? 8-5. No.\n24. June 29: 4-3. No.\n25. June 30: 9-6. No.\n\nFrom this, I see that on June 11, the score was 12-7 for the Cardinals against the opponent listed as \"indians\" (probably). So, that's a team scoring 12 runs in a single game during the season.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"the highest score by a single team be 12.\" Now, I need to check if this is indeed the highest. Looking through all the scores, none of them exceed 12. The next highest is 10 (Mariners on June 22). So yes, 12 was the highest in that season.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data, so it should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the Texas Ranger season is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in the 2004 texas ranger season 9 game have an attendance of over 40000.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. **Season**: 2004 Texas Rangers.\n2. **Game number**: 9th game.\n3. **Attendance**: Over 40,000.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it seems to list games with dates, opponents, scores, loss details, and attendance numbers. Each row in the data array corresponds to a specific date, which I can use to find the relevant information.\n\nI need to identify the 9th game in the 2004 season that fits the criteria of having over 40,000 attendees. The table's \"date\" column doesn't have years, so I'll assume it's for 2004 based on the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row and see if there's a game where attendance is over 40,000 and check if it's the 9th game.\n\nI can start by listing the games in order to find the 9th one. The dates provided are from June 1 to June 30, which likely covers multiple weeks but only part of the season, so maybe the 9th game is within this timeframe.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- **Row 0**: June 1 vs Indians, attendance 17136.\n- **Row 1**: June 2 vs Indians, attendance 18098.\n- **Row 2**: June 4 vs Yankees, 49372.\n- **Row 3**: June 5 vs Yankees, 51910.\n- **Row 4**: June 6 vs Yankees, 54092.\n- **Row 5**: June 7 vs Pirates, 25286.\n- **Row 6 and 7**: Postponed games, so they aren't counted as attended.\n- **Row 8**: June 10 vs Pirates, attendance \"n / a\" and another entry for the same date with attendance 27219. Wait, two entries on June 10? That seems odd. Maybe it's a home and away game or a doubleheader. The second row (row 9) has June 11 Cardinals with attendance 32962.\n- Continuing: Row 10 is June 12, etc.\n\nI notice that the first nine games are from June 1 to June 10. Wait, let me count:\n\nRow 0: 1\nRow 1: 2\nRow 2:3\nRow3:4\nRow4:5\nRow5:6\nRow6:7 (postponed)\nRow7:8 (postponed)\nRow8:9 (June10 vs Pirates with attendance 27219). So the 9th game is June10, pirates, attendance 27219.\n\nBut wait, in row 8, it's listed as two entries for June 10. Maybe they are separate games on that day. So perhaps the 9th and 10th games are both on June10.\n\nLooking at the attendance: The first entry (row8) has \"n / a\", which probably means not available or maybe it's a different game. The second entry (row9) is also June10 vs Pirates with 27219, but that might be a different game. Or perhaps they're combined into one day.\n\nIf the 9th game is the one on June10 with attendance 27,219, which is under 40k, then the claim is false because it's over 40k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the rows. Let me recount from row0:\n\nRow0:1\nRow1:2\nRow2:3\nRow3:4\nRow4:5\nRow5:6\nRow6:7 (postponed)\nRow7:8 (postponed)\nRow8:9 (June10 vs Pirates, attendance 27219)\nRow9: June11, so that's game10.\n\nSo game9 is June10 with 27,219 attendees. That's under 40k, so the claim is false.\n\nWait, but in row4: June6 vs Yankees, attendance54092, which is over 40k. So maybe the 5th game (June6) had over 40k. But the claim says \"9 game,\" not the 5th or any other number. Therefore, the 9th game doesn't meet the attendance criteria.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the 9th game's attendance is 27,219, which is less than 40,000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 2004 Texas Ranger season's 9th game, there was an attendance over 40,000. By examining the table, the 9th game on June 10 had 27,219 attendees, which does not meet the threshold. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"In the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the lowest attendance was 17136.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. Each row represents a game played by the Texas Rangers with these details.\n\nI need to find the attendance figures for each game in the 2004 season and determine if there's any game where attendance was lower than 17136. If yes, then the claim is false because it states that the lowest was exactly 17136. However, if all attendances are equal to or above this number, with none being lower, then the claim might be true.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 17136 attendees\n- Row 1: 18098\n- Row 2: 49372\n- Row 3: 51910\n- Row 4: 54092\n- Row 5: 25286\n- Rows 6 and 7 are postponed, so no attendance there.\n- Row 8: n/a (maybe not applicable)\n- Row 9: 27219\n- Row 10: 32962\n- Row 11: 42173\n- Row 12: 41087\n- Row 13: 36501\n- Row 14: 39114\n- Row 15: 40383\n- Rows 16,17,18,19,20: all above 17000\n- Rows 21,22,23,24,25,26,27: above 17000\n- Rows 28,29,30: same.\n\nWait, row 0 is June 1 with attendance 17136. Then other rows have higher numbers except for row 5 which is 25286, which is still higher than 17136. So the lowest attendance in the season is 17136 as per the claim.\n\nBut wait, in row 8 and 9, both are on June 10 with two entries: one n/a and another with 27219. If row 8's attendance is missing, maybe it was lower? But the data shows \"n / a\", which probably means that game didn't occur or wasn't played, so perhaps no attendance recorded. However, since the claim is about the season, we need to check all games.\n\nWait, in June 10, there are two entries for pirates: one with score 9-7 and loss by Meadows (2-2), attendance n/a, and another game same day with 10-4 and Fogg's loss, attendance 27219. So if the first entry is \"n / a\", that might imply that game didn't happen or wasn't attended. But the second one is 27219, which is higher than 17136.\n\nSo all other games have higher attendances except for June 1, which is exactly 17136. Therefore, the lowest attendance was indeed 17136 on June 1. So the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance in the 2004 Texas Ranger season was 17,136. By examining each game's attendance in the provided table, we find that this figure corresponds to June 1. All other games had higher attendances, confirming that 17,136 was indeed the lowest.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** We need to focus on the \"attendance\" column as it directly relates to the claim.\n2. **Scan Each Row for Attendance Data:** Check each row's attendance value to find the minimum.\n3. **Analyze the Data:** The lowest attendance found is 17,136 on June 1.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since no lower attendance was recorded, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the claim statement. The claim says: \"In the 2004 Texas Ranger season, on only one occasion do both sides fail to score.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of the table are relevant here. Let's break down the claim. It mentions the Texas Rangers season in 2004. Looking at the table headers, I see columns like date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. The key terms from the claim are \"both sides fail to score,\" so I need to find when both teams scored zero runs or failed to score.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. June 1: Indians vs Rangers, score 6-5. Both teams scored, so no.\n2. June 2: Indians 5-3. Both scored, nope.\n3. June 4: Yankees 7-6. Both scored.\n4. June 5: Yankees 8-1. Both scored.\n5. June 6: Yankees 2-1. Both scored.\n6. June 7: Pirates 6-5. Both scored.\n7. June 8 & 9: Postponed. Hmm, these are not games, so they don't count towards the season's game outcomes.\n8. June 10 has two entries. The first is Pirates 9-7 and another with score 10-4. Both have runs, so no failure to score here.\n9. June 11: Cardinals 12-7. Both scored.\n10. June 12: Cardinals 7-2. Both scored.\n11. June 13: Cardinals 3-2. Both scored.\n12. June 15: Reds 5-4. Both scored.\n13. June 16: Reds 7-4. Both scored.\n14. June 17: Reds 4-3. Both scored.\n15. June 18: Marlins 8-1. Both scored.\n16. June 19: Marlins 7-6. Both scored.\n17. June 20: Marlins 4-2. Both scored.\n18. June 22: Mariners 10-2. Both scored.\n19. June 23: Mariners 6-3. Both scored.\n20. June 24: Mariners 9-7. Both scored.\n21. June 25: Astros 3-1. Both scored.\n22. June 26: Astros 8-7. Both scored.\n23. June 27: Astros 1-0. Both scored? Wait, score is 1-0. So one team scored 1 run, the other scored none. That means only one side failed to score. So this doesn't count as both failing.\n24. June 28: Mariners 8-5. Both scored.\n25. June 29: Mariners 4-3. Both scored.\n26. June 30: Mariners 9-6. Both scored.\n\nWait, so looking through all these, I don't see any game where both teams failed to score (i.e., both have 0 runs). All games result in at least one team scoring except perhaps the postponed games, but those are not actual games. So the claim says that on only one occasion both sides fail to score. But from the table, there's no such instance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a game where both teams scored 0 runs. Scanning each row again: every game has at least one run except the Astros vs Mariners on June 27, which is 1-0, so only one side failed, not both. So yes, there are zero games where both teams didn't score.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, both teams failed to score on only one occasion. However, after reviewing each game, no instance exists where both teams scored zero runs. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the highest attendance was 27219.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column in the table represents. The columns are: date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. So, for each game, we have details about who they played, the score of the game, whether it was a loss or not (and if so, by whom), and the number of people who attended.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the highest attendance in the 2004 season being 27219. So I need to find out which row corresponds to that attendance figure and check whether it's indeed the highest across all games listed.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. June 1 vs Indians: Attendance 17136\n2. June 2 vs Indians: 18098\n3. June 4 vs Yankees: 49372\n4. June 5 vs Yankees: 51910\n5. June 6 vs Yankees: 54092\n6. June 7 vs Pirates: 25286\n7. June 8: Postponed\n8. June 9: Postponed\n9. June 10 vs Pirates: First game has 27219, second game same day has 27219 as well? Wait, no, looking closer:\n   - June 10 has two entries. The first one is \"pirates\", score 9-7, loss by Meadows (2-2), attendance n/a. Hmm, that's confusing. Then the next entry is also June 10 vs Pirates but a different score and different loss with attendance 27219. Wait, so for June 10, there are two games? That doesn't make sense because each row is a single game, right?\n\nWait no, looking at the table again, I see that on June 10, there are two separate rows: one where date is June 10 and opponent is Pirates with score 9-7, attendance n/a, but then another entry for June 10 with same date, same opponent, different score (10-4) and loss by Fogg, with attendance 27219. That seems odd. Is it possible that on the same day, there were two games? Or maybe a typo in the table.\n\nWait, no, looking closer, each row is a separate game. So for June 10, first entry has n/a for attendance and the second entry has 27219. But also, June 10 is only one date, so perhaps it's a doubleheader or something. Anyway, moving on.\n\nContinuing through the list:\n\n- June 11 vs Cardinals: 32962\n- June 12 vs Cardinals: 42173\n- June 13 vs Cardinals: 41087\n- June 15 vs Reds: 36501\n- June 16 vs Reds: 39114\n- June 17 vs Reds: 40383\n- June 18 vs Marlins: 20506\n- June 19 vs Marlins: 31021\n- June 20 vs Marlins: 23643\n- June 22 vs Mariners: 32364\n- June 23 vs Mariners: 30418\n- June 24 vs Mariners: 26266\n- June 25 vs Astros: 46088\n- June 26 vs Astros: 40131\n- June 27 vs Astros: 43328\n- June 28 vs Mariners: 28253\n- June 29 vs Mariners: 34844\n- June 30 vs Mariners: 32754\n\nSo the attendances are:\n\nLooking for the highest one. Let's list all attendance numbers:\n\n17136, 18098, 49372, 51910, 54092, 25286, 27219 (x2), 32962, 42173, 41087, 36501, 39114, 40383, 20506, 31021, 23643, 32364, 30418, 26266, 46088, 40131, 43328, 28253, 34844, 32754.\n\nLooking for the highest number. Let's see:\n\n54092 is higher than all except maybe others. Wait, no, 54092 seems to be the highest? Then why does the claim say 27219 is the highest?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the attendances. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at June 10: first entry has attendance n/a, second has 27219.\n\nOther games have higher numbers: 54092 on June 6, which is much higher than 27219.\n\nSo if the highest attendance was 54092, then the claim that the highest was 27219 would be false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row again for attendances:\n\n- June 1: 17136\n- June 2: 18098\n- June 4: 49372\n- June 5: 51910\n- June 6: 54092\n- June 7: 25286\n- June 10 (first): n/a\n- June 10 (second):27219\n- June 11:32962\n- June 12:42173\n- June 13:41087\n- June 15:36501\n- June 16:39114\n- June 17:40383\n- June 18:20506\n- June 19:31021\n- June 20:23643\n- June 22:32364\n- June 23:30418\n- June 24:26266\n- June 25:46088\n- June 26:40131\n- June 27:43328\n- June 28:28253\n- June 29:34844\n- June 30:32754\n\nSo the highest attendance is indeed 54092 on June 6 against Yankees.\n\nThen why does the table have 27219? It's lower than that. So the claim is incorrect because the actual highest was 54092, not 27219.\n</think>\n\nThe highest attendance recorded in the table for the 2004 Texas Ranger season is actually 54,092 on June 6 against the Yankees. Therefore, the claim that the highest attendance was 27,219 is FALSE.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in the 2004 texas ranger season the highest score by a single team be 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions the Texas Rangers' 2004 season, so I'm looking for data related to that year in the table. The highest score by a single team being 10 means that there was at least one game where one team scored 10 runs or points, and this is the maximum such score by any team during the season.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list games from June 1 to June 30. Wait, but Texas Rangers are a baseball team, right? So in their schedule, they play against various opponents each day. The \"date\" column goes from \"june 1\" to \"june 30,\" which suggests that these are the dates of games played by the Rangers.\n\nThe columns relevant here are \"opponent,\" \"score,\" and perhaps others like \"loss\" and \"attendance.\" But for this claim, the main focus is on the scores. The claim is about a team scoring 10 runs in a game, so I need to find any game where a team scored 10 or more runs.\n\nNow, let's look through each row of the table. Each row represents a game with its date, opponent, score, loss details, and attendance. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. June 1 vs Indians: Score is 6-5. No team scored 10.\n2. June 2 vs Indians: 5-3. Again, no 10s.\n3. June 4 vs Yankees: 7-6. Nope.\n4. June 5 vs Yankees: 8-1. Yankees won 8-1. So here, the Yankees scored 8 runs. That's not 10 yet.\n5. June 6 vs Yankees: 2-1. Not enough.\n6. June 7 vs Pirates: 6-5. No.\n7. June 8: Postponed. Irrelevant.\n8. June 9: Postponed.\n9. June 10 vs Pirates: Two games listed. First, a 9-7 win for Rangers. The second game is 10-4, which seems like the Pirates scored 10 runs? Wait, no\u2014the score is \"10 - 4,\" so that's the opponent (Pirates) scoring 10 runs against the Rangers. So in this game, the Pirates reached 10 runs.\n\nThat's one instance where a team scored 10 runs. Let me note that down as relevant.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the games to see if any other teams scored higher than 10:\n\n10. June 11 vs Cardinals: 12-7. So 12 runs by the Rangers here, but no opponent reaching 10.\n11. June 12 vs Cardinals: 7-2. Only 7 runs by Cardinals.\n12. June 13 vs Cardinals: 3-2. Not enough.\n13. June 15 vs Reds: 5-4. Nope.\n14. June 16 vs Reds: 7-4. Reds scored 4, Rangers 7.\n15. June 17 vs Reds: 4-3. No.\n16. June 18 vs Marlins: 8-1. Marlins scored 8.\n17. June 19 vs Marlins: 8-5. Marlins scored 8 again.\n18. June 28 vs Mariners: 8-5. Mariners scored 5.\n19. June 29 vs Mariners: 4-3. No.\n20. June 30 vs Mariners: 9-6. Mariners scored 6.\n\nWait, I also need to check if any game beyond the Texas Rangers' perspective might have teams scoring higher than 10. For example, in Game 10 on June 10, the Pirates scored 10 runs. Is there a game where a team scored more than 10?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- June 5: Yankees scored 8.\n- June 10 (second game): Pirates scored 10.\n- No other games show a score beyond that.\n\nSo the highest single-game score by any team in the Texas Rangers' schedule is 10, achieved by the Pirates. The claim says \"the highest score by a single team be 10.\" Since a team did indeed score 10 runs in a game, and no higher than that, it seems the claim is supported.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if 10 is indeed the maximum across all games. From the table, I don't see any game where a team scored more than 10. So yes, 10 is the highest single-game score by a single team in this season.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those indicating that the Pirates scored 10 runs against the Texas Rangers on June 10, which is the highest score by a single team in the season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, 9 game never have an attendance of over 40,000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. First, let me understand what's being asked.\n\nThe claim is about the attendance figures during the 2004 Texas Ranger season for specific games. The table seems to list various games with their dates, opponents, scores, loss details, and attendance numbers. My task is to go through each game in the table and check if any of them had an attendance over 40,000. If there's even one such game, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"9 game never have an attendance of over 40000.\" I think this might be a translation issue because the original problem mentions a table with multiple games, so maybe it refers to any game in that season. So, I need to look through each row to see if there's a game with attendance over 40,000.\n\nLet me go through each entry one by one:\n\n1. June 1: Indians, score 6-5, loss info, attendance 17136. That's under 40k.\n2. June 2: Indians, attendance 18098. Still under.\n3. June 4: Yankees, attendance 49372. Hmm, that's over 40k (49k).\n4. June 5: Yankees, 51910. Over.\n5. June 6: Yankees, 54092. Over.\n6. June 7: Pirates, 25286. Under.\n7-8: Postponed games, so attendance is also postponed, not relevant here.\n9. June 10 (first entry): Pirates, two entries here? Wait, the table has two rows for June 10. Let me check:\n   - First: Attendance \"n / a\" which probably means not available or not applicable.\n   - Second: Pirates, attendance 27219. Under.\n10. June 11: Cardinals, 32962. Over.\n11. June 12: Cardinals, 42173. Over.\n12. June 13: Cardinals, 41087. Over.\n13. June 15: Reds, 36501. Over.\n14. June 16: Reds, 39114. Over.\n15. June 17: Reds, 40383. Over.\n16. June 18: Marlins, 20506. Under.\n17. June 19: Marlins, 31021. Over.\n18. June 20: Marlins, 23643. Under.\n19. June 22: Mariners, 32364. Over.\n20. June 23: Mariners, 30418. Over.\n21. June 24: Mariners, 26266. Under.\n22. June 25: Astros, 46088. Over.\n23. June 26: Astros, 40131. Over.\n24. June 27: Astros, attendance 43328. Over.\n25. June 28: Mariners, 28253. Under.\n26. June 29: Mariners, 34844. Over.\n27. June 30: Mariners, 32754. Under.\n\nSo, looking at each of these, I can see multiple games with attendances over 40k. For example, June 4, 5, 6 all have attendance over 40k. Even the first entry on June 10, while having \"n/a\", the second entry has 27k which is under. But other entries like June 11 (32k), June 12 (42k), etc., are over.\n\nTherefore, there were games in the 2004 Texas Ranger season with attendance exceeding 40,000. So the claim that \"9 game never have an attendance of over 40000\" is false because at least several games had higher attendances.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each game's attendance for being over 40,000. Multiple entries like June 4 (49k), June 5 (52k), and others exceed this threshold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions. The claim is: \"in the 2004 texas ranger season the lowest attendance be 54092.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n- It's about the 2004 Texas Ranger season.\n- The lowest attendance in that season was 54,092.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list different games with various details like date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. My task is to check if there's a game where the attendance was exactly 54,092 and whether this is indeed the lowest attendance for the season.\n\nI notice that each row in the table represents a game on a specific date against an opponent, along with other details including attendance numbers. I'll need to go through each row and look for any with attendance \"54092.\"\n\nLet me scan through the data:\n\n- The first few rows have attendances like 17,136; 18,098; 49,372; 51,910; 54,092... Wait, here's a row with attendance \"54092.\" That's one game where attendance was 54,092. \n\nBut I also need to confirm if this is the lowest. The next rows have higher numbers like around 50k or more. Let me check:\n\n- June 10: two entries; first has n/a which might mean unknown, but the second has 27,219.\n- June 11: 32,962\n- June 12: 42,173\n- June 13: 41,087\n- June 15: 36,501\n- June 16: 39,114\n- June 17: 40,383\n- Then higher numbers like 20k, 30k, etc.\n\nSo the lowest attendance in the season seems to be 54,092. There's no row with a lower number than that. The next closest is around 36k, which is still higher than 54k. Wait, actually, no\u2014wait: 54,092 is higher than some of these numbers? No, wait, 54,092 is higher than 40k but lower than others like 42k or 50k. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking again: the row with \"54092\" is on June 6 against the Yankees. Then there are other rows like June 15 with 36k and June 16 with 39k. Wait, no\u201436k is lower than 54k? No, wait: 36,501 is less than 54,092. So that would mean that attendance on June 15 was even lower at 36,501.\n\nWait, so if the claim says that the lowest attendance was 54,092, but there's a game with 36,501, which is lower, then the claim is FALSE because the actual lowest was lower than 54,092. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me list out all the attendances:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- June 1: 17,136\n- June 2: 18,098\n- June 4: 49,372\n- June 5: 51,910\n- June 6: 54,092\n- June 7: 25,286\n- June 8-9: postponed, so no attendance data\n- June 10: 27,219 and another with n/a (maybe not relevant)\n- June 11: 32,962\n- June 12: 42,173\n- June 13: 41,087\n- June 15: 36,501\n- June 16: 39,114\n- June 17: 40,383\n- June 28: n/a (postponed)\n- June 29: 34,844\n- June 30: 32,754\n\nSo from this list, the lowest attendance is actually 32,754 on June 30. But wait, no\u2014wait, 32k is lower than 36k? No, 32,754 is less than 36,501. So that's even lower.\n\nWait, but there's also a game on June 10 with 27,219, which is lower than 32k. So the lowest attendance would be the smallest number in this list. Let me check again:\n\n- The numbers are: 17k, 18k, 49k, 51k, 54k, 25k, n/a, 27k, 32k, 42k, 41k, 36k, 39k, 40k, n/a, 34k, 32k.\n\nThe smallest number here is 17k on June 1. But wait, no\u2014wait: the first row is June 1 with 17,136; then June 2 at 18,098; then June 4 at 49,372; and so on.\n\nWait, but then June 7 has 25,286, which is higher than 17k. Then June 10 has 27,219, which is lower than 32k but higher than 17k.\n\nSo the lowest attendance in the table is 17,136 on June 1. But that's for the Texas Rangers? Wait, no\u2014the opponents are listed as \"Opponent\" but it's not clear if all these games are Texas Rangers home games or away games. Because if some of these attendances are from away games, then the home game attendance might be different.\n\nWait, the table doesn't specify whether these are home games or away games. So perhaps I need to only consider the home games' attendances. But the problem is that I don't know which ones are home games. Alternatively, if all these rows represent Texas Rangers games, then the lowest attendance would be 17k.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial thought because the claim is about the 2004 season's lowest attendance being 54,092. So perhaps the table only includes home games? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify:\n\n- The claim is about the Texas Rangers' 2004 season.\n- The lowest attendance in that season was 54,092.\n\nLooking at the attendances listed, the smallest number is 17k on June 1, but if that's a home game, then yes, it's lower than 54k. But perhaps that's an away game or maybe not relevant because Texas Rangers might have higher attendance in their home games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only includes home games. Let me check if there are multiple entries for each date or opponent. Wait, no\u2014it seems like each row is a different game with varying attendances.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The user provided a table that's presumably from the Texas Rangers 2004 season, listing games with details including attendance. So regardless of home or away, the lowest attendance in the entire season is needed.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- June 1: 17k\n- June 2: 18k\n- June 10: 27k\n- June 11:32k\n- June 12:42k\n- June 13:41k\n- June 15:36k\n- June 16:39k\n- June 17:40k\n- June 28: n/a (maybe canceled)\n- June 29:34k\n- June 30:32k\n\nSo the lowest attendance in the entire season is 17,136 on June 1. But that's lower than 54,092. Therefore, the claim that the lowest was 54,092 would be FALSE because there was a game with even lower attendance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting and the table only includes home games, so maybe the lowest home attendance is 36k on June 15. But without knowing for sure, I have to assume all attendances are considered.\n\nTherefore, since there's an attendance of 17k, which is lower than 54k, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim that the lowest attendance in the 2004 Texas Rangers season was 54,092 is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the provided table. The lowest attendance recorded is 17,136 on June 1, which is lower than 54,092. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is \\boxed{FALSE}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in the 2004 texas ranger season on only 1 occasion both side score.\" So, I think this means that during the 2004 Texas Rangers season, there was only one game where both teams scored. Or maybe it's saying that in all games, both sides scored only once? Wait, no, probably meaning only one game where both teams scored runs or something similar.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. The columns are date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions \"both side score,\" which in baseball terms likely refers to the total runs scored by both teams. So, I need to check if there was only one game where both teams scored runs, or maybe that in all games, both sides scored on only one occasion. Hmm, perhaps it's about how many games had both teams scoring.\n\nWait, but the way the claim is phrased: \"on only 1 occasion both side score.\" It could mean that across the season, there was only one game where both teams scored runs. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that in each game, both sides scored only once? That doesn't quite make sense because in a game, both teams usually have multiple scores\u2014like runs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the claim is stating that during the 2004 season, there was only one game where both teams scored runs, meaning maybe a tie or something. Or perhaps it's referring to something else like attendance being low on only one occasion? No, probably not.\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"in the 2004 texas ranger season on only 1 occasion both side score.\" So, it might be that there was only one game where both teams scored runs, meaning all other games had a team winning, perhaps with a certain score differential. Or maybe it's referring to attendance being low in only one instance.\n\nBut looking at the table, I see entries like \"score\" which is something like \"6 - 5\", so that represents the team's score and the opponent's score. So, each game has both teams scoring. Wait, but if every game has both sides scoring, then perhaps the claim is misleading because it says \"on only 1 occasion.\" That might mean that in all games, both sides scored only once, which isn't correct because in a game, both teams can have multiple runs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to something else. Perhaps the term \"score\" in the context of attendance? No, attendance is the number of people attending, so it's \"17136\" etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me check:\n\nColumns are:\n- date\n- opponent\n- score\n- loss\n- attendance\n\nSo, \"score\" seems to be the game's result, like runs scored by each team.\n\nThe claim is about both sides scoring on only one occasion, so maybe it's referring to only one game where both teams scored runs. But looking at the table, every game has a score for both teams, except when the game is postponed or n/a (like June 10th has two entries, probably because it was rescheduled).\n\nWait, in the data, some rows have the same date but different opponents and scores. For example, June 30th has one entry, while June 10th has two entries with different opponents.\n\nBut going back to the claim: \"on only 1 occasion both side score.\" If it's referring to games where both teams scored runs, then since every game in the table has a score for both teams (like \"6 - 5\", etc.), except when it's a loss (maybe meaning one team didn't score?), but actually, even losses have scores because it's the opponent's score.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about attendance being low on only one occasion. Because the column \"attendance\" shows numbers like 17136, which seems high. Maybe in the 2004 season, attendance was usually high except for one game where it was lower. But the claim mentions both sides scoring, not attendance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to the score being tied on only one occasion. That is, in all games during the season, the scores were never tied except once. So I need to check if there's only one game where both teams had the same score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"score\" which is something like \"6 - 5\". So for example, if Team A scored 6 runs and Opponent scored 5, that's not a tie. But if any row shows a score where both sides have the same number, like \"5 - 5\", then that's a tie.\n\nI need to scan through all the scores in the table and count how many times it was a tie (i.e., the first number equals the second). If there is only one occurrence of a tie, then the claim would be TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: score \"6 - 5\" \u2192 not tied.\nRow 1: \"7 - 6\" \u2192 no.\nRow 2: \"10 - 8\" \u2192 no.\nRow 3: \"9 - 4\" \u2192 no.\nRow 4: \"11 - 9\" \u2192 no.\nRow 5: \"12 - 5\" \u2192 no.\nRow 6: \"10 - 7\" \u2192 no.\nRow 7: \"14 - 13\" \u2192 no.\nRow 8: \"9 - 3\" \u2192 no.\nRow 9: \"6 - 5\" \u2192 no.\nRow 10: \"12 - 11\" \u2192 no.\nRow 11: \"9 - 8\" \u2192 no.\nRow 12: \"4 - 1\" \u2192 no.\nRow 13: \"7 - 2\" \u2192 no.\nRow 14: \"3 - 0\" \u2192 no.\nRow 15: \"5 - 3\" \u2192 no.\nRow 16: \"7 - 6\" \u2192 no.\nRow 17: \"9 - 4\" \u2192 no.\nRow 18: \"8 - 3\" \u2192 no.\nRow 19: \"10 - 8\" \u2192 no.\nRow 20: \"11 - 5\" \u2192 no.\nRow 21: \"9 - 6\" \u2192 no.\nRow 22: \"12 - 7\" \u2192 no.\nRow 23: \"5 - 3\" \u2192 no.\nRow 24: \"10 - 8\" \u2192 no.\nRow 25: \"4 - 1\" \u2192 no.\nRow 26: \"9 - 6\" \u2192 no.\nRow 27: \"14 - 13\" \u2192 no.\nRow 28: \"5 - 3\" \u2192 no.\nRow 29: \"9 - 8\" \u2192 no.\nRow 30: \"11 - 10\" \u2192 no.\n\nWait, none of the scores are tied (e.g., x - x). So if that's the case, then the claim saying there was only one occasion where both sides scored is incorrect because actually, it didn't happen at all. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"both side score\" refers to both teams having a non-zero score. But in baseball, every game has both teams scoring unless it's a mercy rule or something. But in this table, even losses have scores for both teams, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about attendance being low on only one occasion. Let me check the \"attendance\" column:\n\nLooking at each row's \"attendance\":\n- 17136\n- 17481\n- 18289\n- 16500\n- 17821\n- 17682\n- 18509\n- 16950\n- 17304\n- 18176\n- 17500\n- 17900\n- 17000\n- 17700\n- 17400\n- 17294\n- 18320\n- 16800\n- 17826\n- 18443\n- 17121\n- 18250\n- 16723\n- 18092\n- 17367\n- 18529\n- 17741\n- 17930\n- 17291\n\nLooking for the lowest value: The smallest is 16723, then 16800, 16950, 17000, etc. But it's hard to tell if there was only one game with low attendance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the number of games where both teams scored runs. But in baseball, every game has both teams scoring unless one team wins by a large margin and the other doesn't score. However, here all entries have scores for both teams.\n\nWait, perhaps \"both side\" refers to the total attendance being split between home and away? That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about something else entirely, but based on the initial analysis of tied scores, there are none. So if the claim is that both sides scored in only one game, which didn't happen, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure because my understanding might be off. Alternatively, perhaps the term \"both side\" refers to something else, like both starting lineups had players from both sides, but that seems unrelated.\n\nGiven that none of the scores are tied, and thus there was no game where both teams scored the same number of runs, the claim would be incorrect. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there were no games where both teams scored the same number of runs.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",
