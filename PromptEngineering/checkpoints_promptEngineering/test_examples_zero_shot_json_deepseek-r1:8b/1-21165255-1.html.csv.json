    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various columns and data rows. The claim I need to verify is: \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a number (19) associated with the season of an episode identified by the production code 4300062. So, I should look into the table to find where 4300062 appears and then check its corresponding \"no in season\" value.\n\nLooking at the data rows, each row has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, production code, and us viewers (millions). I need to scan through these to find the row where production code is 4300062.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Production code is 4300045 \u2013 not matching.\n2. Row 1: 4300046 \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: 4300047 \u2013 no.\n4. Row 3: 4300048 \u2013 still not.\n5. Row 4: 4300049 \u2013 nope.\n6. Row 5: 4300051 \u2013 no.\n7. Row 6: 4300050 \u2013 not matching.\n8. Row 7: 4300052 \u2013 no.\n9. Row 8: 4300053 \u2013 nope.\n10. Row 9: 4300054 \u2013 not matching.\n11. Row 10: 4300055 \u2013 nope.\n12. Row 11: 4300056 \u2013 no.\n13. Row 12: 4300057 \u2013 nope.\n14. Row 13: 4300058 \u2013 still not.\n15. Row 14: 4300059 \u2013 nope.\n16. Row 15: 4300060 \u2013 no.\n17. Row 16: 4300061 \u2013 nope.\n18. Row 17: 4300062 \u2013 Ah, here we go. This is the row where production code is 4300062.\n\nNow, in this row, let's look at the \"no in season\" column. From the data, it shows that for this row, the \"no in season\" is 19. So, the number in season for 4300062 is indeed 19.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the row where production code is 4300062 and the \"no in season\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cell confirms that the \"no in season\" for production code 4300062 is 19.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
