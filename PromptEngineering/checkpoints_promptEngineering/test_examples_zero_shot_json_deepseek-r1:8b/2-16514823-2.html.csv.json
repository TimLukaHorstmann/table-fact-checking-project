    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim states: \"g\u00f6teborg be match up with ullevi as an opponent on september 19th 2015.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. **Entity**: G\u00f6teborg (the home team)\n2. **Opponent**: Ullevi\n3. **Date**: September 19th, 2015\n\nLooking at the table's columns: date, venue, opponents, score, comp, attendance. The relevant columns for this claim are \"date\" and \"opponents.\"\n\nNext, I'll search through each row to find any matches where:\n- The \"opponents\" column is \"Ullevi.\"\n- The \"date\" matches September 19th, 2015.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\nRow 0: Date is April 11, 2005. Opponents are Haken. Not relevant.\n...\nContinuing this process, I check every row until I find a match where opponents are Ullevi and the date is September 19th, 2015.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- In the data provided, the dates go up to October 23rd, but none of them mention September 19th specifically.\n- The closest matches for \"g\u00f6teborg\" as the home team might be in later dates, but I don't see an exact match with Ullevi on that specific date.\n\nWait, let me check row index 12:\n- Date: 2005 - 09 - 19\n- Venue: ullevi\n- Opponents: g\\u00f6teborg (which is G\u00f6teborg)\n\nAh, here it is! On September 19th, 2005, the match was against G\u00f6teborg at Ullevi. So the claim refers to a date in 2015, but this entry is from 2005. That means the claim's date doesn't match any entry where G\u00f6teborg faced Ullevi.\n\nAdditionally, checking for September 19, 2015 in the table: There are no entries beyond October 23, 2005, so it's not present.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table supporting the claim as stated. The dates don't align, and the specific September 19th, 2015, doesn't appear in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
