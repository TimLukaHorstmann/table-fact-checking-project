The claim is that Mark Ward and Rodney Rowe have the same position.\n\nFirst, I should locate both players in the table.

Scanning further down, I find \"rodney rowe\" in row 18. His position is also \"fw\".\n\nSo both Mark Ward and Rodney Rowe are midfielders (mf). Wait, no, Mark Ward's position is listed as \"fw\", which stands for forward. Let me double-check that. \n\nIn the table, each player has a \"name\" column, followed by their \"position\". For Mark Ward, in row 18: \n[\n  ...\n  \"mark ward\",\n  \"fw\",\n  ...\n]\nAnd Rodney Rowe is in row 14:\n[\n  ...\n  \"rodney rowe\",\n  \"fw\",\n  ...\n]\nSo both have the same position of \"fw\" (forward).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Rodney Rowe has more goals than Pat Scully\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the table contains.\n\nLooking at the columns, they include various statistics like name, position, league apps and goals, FA Cup apps and goals, League Cup apps and goals, and total apps and goals. My main focus here is on the \"league goals\" and \"total goals\" for both Rodney Rowe and Pat Scully because the claim is about their goals.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Rodney Rowe in the table. I see his row is number 13 (since it's zero-indexed, but wait, actually looking at the data array, each sub-array represents a player, so Rodney is at index 13. Wait no, let me count properly: starting from index 0 as the first player, so yes, index 13 would be the 14th player, which is Rodney Rowe.\n\nIn Rodney's row, under \"league goals,\" it says 1. The total goals column shows 2.\n\nNext, I need to find Pat Scully. His row is number 25 in the data array (since each sub-array is a player, so index 25 is Pat). Looking at his stats: league goals are 1 and total goals are 1 as well.\n\nSo comparing the two:\n\nRodney Rowe has 1 league goal and 2 total goals.\nPat Scully has 1 league goal and 1 total goal.\n\nTherefore, Rodney's total goals (2) are more than Pat's (1). But wait, the claim is about \"more goals,\" so it depends on whether they're comparing total or just league. Since the claim doesn't specify which, but usually, when talking about a player's goals without qualification, it refers to total.\n\nSo Rodney has 2 total goals vs. Pat's 1. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells for these two players. For Rodney, his row index is 13 (since he's the 14th entry but starting from 0). The columns are \"league_goals\" and \"total_goals.\" Wait, no, looking at the data structure, each player has a sub-array where the columns correspond to the keys in the main table. So I need to map the column names correctly.\n\nWait, the main table's columns are: name, position, league apps, league goals, FA Cup apps, FA Cup goals, League Cup apps, League Cup goals, total apps, total goals.\n\nSo for each player, their data is an array where index 2 is league goals (apparently not, because in the first example, the revenue and employees are at indices 0 and 1. Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that for each player, their stats include \"league_goals\" and \"total_goals.\"\n\nSo in the JSON data, each player's stats are an object with properties like name, position, league_apps, league_goals, etc.\n\nTherefore, to find Rodney's total goals, I look at his 'total_goals' value, which is 2. Pat Scully's total_goals is 1.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Rodney:\n- row_index: 13 (since it's zero-indexed)\n- columns: \"league_goals\" and \"total_goals\"\n\nWait no, actually in the data structure provided, each player is a dictionary with specific keys. So the relevant columns would be \"total_goals\" for both players.\n\nSo for each player:\n\nRodney:\nrow_index: 13\ncolumns: [\"total_goals\"]\n\nPat Scully:\nrow_index: 25\ncolumns: [\"total_goals\"]\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they have for example Revenue and Employees as column names. So perhaps I need to refer to the keys in the JSON data structure.\n\nLooking back at how the table is structured, each player's stats are an object with keys like \"name\", \"position\", \"league_apps\", \"league_goals\", etc., up to \"total_goals\".\n\nSo for Rodney, his total goals are under 'total_goals'. Similarly for Pat Scully.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nRodney: row 13 (index), column_name \"total_goals\"\n\nPat: row 25 (index), column_name \"total_goals\"\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's comparing their goals. So both players have different league goals and total goals.\n\nWait, actually, let me check again. The claim is that Rodney has more goals than Pat. If we're talking about total goals, yes, 2 vs 1. But if it were just league goals, it would be 1 vs 1, which is equal. So the relevant columns are both players' total_goals.\n\nTherefore, I need to include both their row indices and column names where the total goals are located.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by comparing Rodney Rowe's and Pat Scully's total goals in the table. Rodney has more total goals (2) than Pat (1). \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players:** Locate Rodney Rowes and Pat Scully in the data array.\n   - Rodney is at index 13.\n   - Pat is at index 25.\n\n2. **Extract Goal Data:**\n   - Rodney's total goals: 2\n   - Pat's total goals: 1\n\n3. **Compare Goals:** Since 2 > 1, the claim holds true.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells:** Both players' 'total_goals' columns are relevant as they directly show their goal counts compared.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is supported by the data, making it TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total_goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"total_goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Andy Turner score more total goal than Pat Scully.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. \"Andy Turner\" and \"Pat Scully\" are names of people in the table, so I need to locate their rows. Then, the claim is about \"scoring more total goals,\" which probably refers to the \"total goals\" column. So essentially, it's saying that Andy Turner's total goals are higher than Pat Scully's.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns include things like name, position, league apps, league goals, FA Cup apps, FA Cup goals, League Cup apps, League Cup goals, and then \"total apps\" and \"total goals.\" So for each person, their \"total goals\" is the last number before the total apps.\n\nI need to find Andy Turner's row first.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"lee sinnott be a fw and simon trevitt be a df\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"Lee Sinnott be a fw\" translates to checking if Lee Sinnott's position is 'fw' (forward). Similarly, \"simon trevitt be a df\" means Simon Trevitt's position should be 'df' (defender/forward, depending on how it's abbreviated).\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with their respective stats. The columns relevant here are \"name\", \"position\", and possibly others like \"league goals\" but for this claim, only position matters.\n\nI need to find Lee Sinnott in the table and check his position. Let me scan through the data rows:\n\n- Row 0: simon baldry, mf\n- Row 1: andy booth, fw\n- Row 2: kenny brown, df\n- Row 3: darren bullock, mf\n- Row 4: simon collins, df\n- Row 5: tom cowan, df\n- Row 6: gary crosby, mf\n- Row 7: paul dalton, mf\n- Row 8: iain dunn, fw\n- Row 9: lee duxbury, mf\n- Row 10: jon dyson, df\n- Row 11: rob edwards, mf\n- Row 12: steve francis, gk\n- Row 13: kevin gray, df\n- Row 14: steve jenkins, df\n- Row 15: ronnie jepson, fw\n- Row 16: richard logan, mf\n- Row 17: paul reid, mf\n- Row 18: rodney rowe, fw\n- Row 19: pat scully, df\n- Row 20: lee sinnott, df\n- Row 21: ben thornley, mf\n- Row 22: simon trevitt, df\n- Row 23: andy turner, mf\n- Row 24: mark ward, fw\n- Row 25: jon whitney, df\n\nWait, I see Lee Sinnott at row_index 20. His position is 'df', which stands for defender or forward? In football terms, 'df' might be an abbreviation, but typically, in many contexts, it's either a typo or refers to defender. However, sometimes 'FW' is used for forward, and 'DF' could stand for defender.\n\nBut the claim says Lee Sinnott should be a fw (forward). If his position is 'df', that would mean he's not a forward but perhaps a defender. So that part of the claim might be false.\n\nNext, Simon Trevitt is at row_index 22 with a position of 'df'. Again, if 'df' stands for defender and the claim says he should be a 'df' (defender), then this part would be correct. But wait, the claim says \"simon trevitt be a df\", which might align if 'df' is intended to mean defender.\n\nHowever, there's an inconsistency because Lee Sinnott is listed as 'df', but the claim states he should be 'fw'. So his position doesn't match the claim. On the other hand, Simon Trevitt's position does match 'df' if that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nBut wait, in football terminology, 'FW' is a forward, and sometimes positions like 'DF' are used as an abbreviation, but it's less common. It might be a typo for 'Defender'. So if 'df' is meant to denote defender, then Lee Sinnott being 'df' wouldn't make him a forward.\n\nTherefore, the claim has an error in specifying Lee Sinnott's position, while Simon Trevitt's position aligns with what the claim states (assuming 'df' is defender). But since the first part of the claim is incorrect, the overall statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that Lee Sinnott should be a forward ('fw') and Simon Trevitt should be a defender ('df'). Upon checking the table:\n\n- Lee Sinnott's position is 'df', not 'fw'.\n- Simon Trevitt's position is also 'df'.\n\nSince Lee Sinnott's position does not match the claim, the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
