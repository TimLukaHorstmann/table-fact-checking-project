    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 2012 , the oakland raiders lose to the kansas city chief at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15 - 0\". I need to check each part of this claim against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, date, winner, result, loser, and location. The data includes multiple games from 2010 to 2013 between the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the claim mentions the year 2012. So I should look for any rows in the table where the \"year\" column is 2012.\n\nIn the data, there are two entries for 2012:\n1. October 28, 2012: Oakland Raiders won with a score of 26 - 16.\n2. December 16, 2012: Oakland Raiders won again with a score of 15 - 0.\n\nWait, both games in 2012 were won by the Raiders. The claim says that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs in 2012 at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0. But according to the table, on December 16, 2012, the Raiders actually won against the Chiefs, not lost.\n\nSo, there's no game in 2012 where the Raiders lost to the Chiefs. That already contradicts the claim. Therefore, I can say that the relevant cells would be the row for December 16, 2012, because that's where the Raiders won, but it's important to note that they didn't lose.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if there are any other rows in 2012 that show a loss for the Raiders. From the table, only two games in 2012 are listed, both of which are wins for the Raiders. So, the claim is definitely false because it states that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs in 2012 with a 15-0 score, but according to the table, they won with that exact score.\n\nSo, even though there's a game on December 16, 2012, where the Raiders scored 15-0, it was against the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, but as a win. Therefore, the claim's assertion of a loss is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\". The relevant cells would be the row and column for that specific game to show that it was a Raiders' victory.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I examined each relevant cell in the table for the year 2012. The only game listed in 2012 where the Raiders scored 15-0 against the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium was a win, not a loss. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
