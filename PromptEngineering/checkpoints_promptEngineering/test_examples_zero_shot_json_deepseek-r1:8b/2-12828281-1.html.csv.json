    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the row that corresponds to December 6, 1964. Let me scan each row's date. Row 0 is September 13, 1964; row1: September19; row2: Sept27; row3: Oct3; row4:Oct10; row5:Oct16; row6:Oct25; row7:Nov1; row8:Nov8; row9:Nov15; row10:Nov22; row11:Nov29; row12:Dec6. Oh, there it is\u2014row 13? Wait no, Dec6 is row13? Let me count again. The first data row is index 0, so Dec6 would be row13? No, wait the table starts at week1 and each row increments by one. So December 6 is in row13 because weeks go from 1 to 14, right?\n\nWait, no\u2014the 'week' column goes up to 14. Let me check: the data has 14 rows, with week numbers from 1 to 14. So row12 would be November29, which is week12? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Each sub-array in data represents a game, starting with week1 on September13, then week2 on Sept19, etc., so week13 would be the 13th element in data.\n\nWait no\u2014each row corresponds to a specific week, with week numbers as per the 'week' column. So row0 is week1 (Sept13), row1 is week2 (Sept19), and so on up to row13 being week14? No, wait the weeks go from 1 to 14 in the table, but the data has 14 entries, which would be week1 through week14.\n\nSo December6 is in row13 because it's the 14th game. Let me confirm: the data array has 14 elements\u2014so index0 is week1, index1 week2,... index13 is week14. So December6 is week14.\n\nNow, the claim says \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13.\" So, if week14 (Dec6) is considered to be \"after\" week13, then that's true because week14 comes after week13.\n\nWait, but does \"after\" mean in terms of timing or in terms of sequence? In the context of weeks, week14 would logically come after week13. So yes, Dec6 is after week13.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because December6 is week14, which is indeed after week13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on December 6, 1964, occurred after week 13. By checking the table, we find this game is week 14, which naturally follows week 13. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game play on december 6 , 1964 be during week 13",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be during week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The data rows have each week's game details. My goal is to find the row where the date is December 6, 1964, and check what week that corresponds to, then see if it matches week 13.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row has the date \"december 6 , 1964\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: September 13, 1964\n- Row 1: September 19, 1964\n- Row 2: September 27, 1964\n- ...\n- Continuing this until I reach December.\n\nWait, the table goes up to week 14 on December 20, 1964. So December 6 is somewhere in between weeks 13 and 14. Let me look for \"december 6 , 1964\" in the date column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: September 13\n- ...\n- Week 12: November 29, 1964\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964? Let me check. Yes, week 13 is December 6, 1964.\n\nWait no, let me count again. The weeks go up to 14. So week 1 is September 13, then week 2 is September 19, etc., each subsequent week's date getting closer to December. Let me list them out:\n\nWeek 13: December 6, 1964\nWeek 14: December 20, 1964\n\nSo the claim is that on December 6, 1964 (week 13), there was a game. The table shows that week 13 is indeed on December 6, so the game did take place during week 13.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The row for week 13 has the opponent as \"buffalo bills\" and result as \"w 16 - 13\". So yes, it's correct. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the game on December 6, 1964, was indeed during week 13.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to find which columns are relevant. The claim mentions the date and the week, so the relevant columns would be \"date\" and \"week\". So their row indices are important.\n\nLooking at the table, the date for December 6 is in row 13 (since it's week 13). Wait no: the rows start from index 0 as week 1. So week 13 is row 12 if I'm counting correctly? Wait no, let me count:\n\nRow 0: week 1\nRow 1: week 2\n...\nEach week increments by one, so week 13 would be row 12 (since 0-based indexing). But wait, the date for week 13 is in row 12. So row_index is 12 for both \"date\" and \"week\" columns.\n\nSo relevant cells are where the row is 12 (for week) and also 12 for date. Alternatively, perhaps I should check which columns: week and date. So the columns are \"week\" and \"date\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For \"week\": find the cell where row_index is 12.\n- For \"date\": same row, so row_index 12.\n\nSo each of these columns in that specific row is relevant to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game played on December 2, 1963 was week 15\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game with specific details. My task is to check if there's a game on December 2, 1963, and whether its week number was 15.\n\nSo, the claim mentions a game date of December 2, 1963. I need to find out which row corresponds to that date in the data section. Let me go through each row to see when the dates occur.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- ... and so on up to week 14: December 6, 1964\n\nWait a minute, I notice that all the dates in the table are in 1964. The claim refers to December 2, 1963, which is before the first date listed (September 13, 1964). So, does that mean there's no game on December 2, 1963? If that's the case, then the claim can't be true because such a game doesn't exist in the table.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row increments the week number from 1 to 14, with dates ranging from September to December 1964. There's no mention of a game in 1963 in the table.\n\nTherefore, since the claim refers to a game that didn't happen (as per the given data), the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
