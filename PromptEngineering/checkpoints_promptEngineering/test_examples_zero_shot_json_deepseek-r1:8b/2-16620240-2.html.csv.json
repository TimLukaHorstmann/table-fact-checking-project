    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"On date 2004 - 07 - 02 the venue be idrottsparken and djurg\u00e5rden scorer be sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\" \n\nSo, I need to verify two things here:\n1. On that specific date (July 2, 2004), was the venue Idrottsparken?\n2. Were the scorers for Djurg\u00e5rden that day Sj\u00f6lund and Johansson?\n\nLooking at the table provided, let's first check if there's a match on that date. The 'date' column has entries like \"2004 - 07 - 02\". So yes, row index 2 (since arrays are zero-indexed) has that date.\n\nNow, for the venue: In the same row (row index 2), the 'venue' column says \"stadion\", not Idrottsparken. That's different from what the claim states, so that already seems like a discrepancy. But maybe I made a mistake\u2014let me double-check the columns in row 2.\n\nWait, no, the third entry is indeed \"stadion\" under the 'venue' column for that date. So the venue doesn't match the claim.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other part of the claim: the scorers. In that same row, under 'djurg\u00e5rden scorers', it lists \"arneng , makondele , den ouden\". Sj\u00f6lund and Johansson aren't mentioned here. So both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since the venue is not Idrottsparken and the scorers don't include Sj\u00f6lund and Johansson, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two inaccuracies: the venue was \"stadion\", not \"idrottsparken\", and the scorers were different from what's stated. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"djurg\\u00e5rden scorers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
