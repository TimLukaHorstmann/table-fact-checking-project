    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"the warrington town team be in the 4th position with 45 goal against.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure provided. The columns are position, team, played, drawn, lost, goals for, goals against, goal difference, and points. The data has multiple rows, each representing a different team's performance.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the team's position in the league (4th) and the number of goals against. So I need to find Warrington Town in the table and check these two aspects.\n\nLooking through the 'team' column, I see that Warrington Town is listed as row 4. Now, for each row, the columns relevant here are position and goals against. \n\nFrom row 4 (Warrington Town), the position is 4th, which matches the claim. The goals against column has a value of 45. Wait, but in the table, it's written as \"45\" in that cell. So that also matches.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the relevant cells. The claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
