    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two songs: \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire.\" It's stating that \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has a higher points value compared to \"croire.\" So I need to check how many points each of these songs received according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: draw, language, artist, song, place, and points. My goal is to find the rows where the song is either \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" or \"croire\" because those are the two songs in question.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one until I find these songs.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Song: \"\\u00fe\\u00fa og \\u00feeir (s\\u00f3krates)\" \u2013 not either of them.\nRow 1: \"stad i ljus\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"nauravat silm\\u00e4t muistetaan\" \u2013 no.\nRow 3: \"go\" \u2013 no.\nRow 4: \"sufi\" \u2013 no.\nRow 5: \"la d\\u00e9cada prodigiosa\" and \"la chica que yo quiero (made in spain)\" \u2013 still not our songs.\nRow 6: \"shangri - la\" \u2013 no.\nRow 7: \"ben adam (\\u05d1\\u05df \\u05d0\\u05d3\\u05dd)\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 8: \"ne partez pas sans moi\" \u2013 no.\nRow 9: \"take him home\" \u2013 no.\nRow 10: \"lied f\\u00fcr einen freund\" \u2013 no.\nRow 11: \"lisa mona lisa\" \u2013 wait, that's the same as \"Lisa Mona Lisa,\" which I think is \"croire\"? No, actually, \"croire\" in French means \"believe.\" So maybe it's a different song. Wait, row 12 has \"lisa mona lisa,\" but row 11: \"lied f\\u00fcr einen freund\" by \"maxi & chris garden.\" Not our songs.\n\nRow 13: \"ka' du se hva' jeg sa'\" \u2013 no.\nRow 14: \"clown (\\u03ba\\u03bb\\u03cc\\u03bf\\u03c5\\u03bd)\" \u2013 that's \"Clown\" in Greek, so not our songs.\nRow 15: \"for v\\u00e5r jord\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 16: \"laissez briller le soleil\" \u2013 no.\nRow 17: \"croire\" by \"lara fabian.\" Okay, found it. So this is the song \"croire\" with points value 4.\n\nContinuing to check for \"vivo (ti scrivo).\" Let's go further.\n\nRow 18: \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" by \"luca barbarossa.\" There we go. The points for this song are 12.\n\nSo now, comparing the two:\n- \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has 12 points.\n- \"croire\" has 4 points.\n\nThe claim is that \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire,\" which is true because 12 > 4. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. Also, I need to identify the relevant cells: the row where \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" is found and the row where \"croire\" is found.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n- \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" is in row 18.\n- \"croire\" is in row 17.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include both of these rows for their respective columns, which is the column named \"points.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has a higher points value than \"croire.\" The relevant cells are those where each song's points are listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
