    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Bronco game in 1975 was at the San Diego Stadium\" is TRUE or FALSE using the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim carefully. It mentions \"lowest attendance for a Denver Bronco game in 1975\" and specifies that this low attendance occurred at San Diego Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The rows represent games played from week 1 to week 14.\n\nWait, but the claim is about a game in 1975. However, looking at the data, all the dates provided are in September and October, specifically starting from September 21 to December 20. None of these dates fall in 1975 because they're likely in the early '90s or later based on typical naming conventions for stadiums and opponents. For example, Mile High Stadium became prominent in the mid-90s when the Broncos moved there after playing at old Denver Stadium.\n\nSo, if all the games listed are after 1990s, then a game in 1975 wouldn't be reflected here. That suggests that either there's no data about 1975 games in this table, or perhaps the data is misrepresented.\n\nAdditionally, the claim refers to San Diego Stadium as the location. Looking through the data, one of the games is at San Diego Stadium: week 9 (November 16) against the San Diego Chargers. But that game was in November 2014, not 1975.\n\nSo, there's no data in this table for a 1975 game, let alone at San Diego Stadium. The lowest attendance would be impossible to determine because such games aren't listed here, and the claim is making an assertion about a year (1975) that doesn't align with any data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco never have more than 2 win in a row.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the Denver Broncos in 1975 and their performance regarding consecutive wins, specifically that they never had more than two wins in a row during that season.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list the games from week 1 to week 14 for 1975. Each row has details like the opponent, date, result, game site, record, and attendance. The 'week' column probably indicates the week number of the game, which aligns with the claim's mention of 1975, so I can assume that this is indeed the 1975 season.\n\nThe key part here is to check how many consecutive wins the Broncos had in any stretch of games during that season. The claim states they never had more than two in a row, so I need to see if there was any sequence where they won three or more games consecutively.\n\nI'll go through each game result:\n\n1. Week 1: Win (1-0)\n2. Week 2: Win (2-0)\n3. Week 3: Loss\n4. Week 4: Loss\n5. Week 5: Win (3-2)\n6. Week 6: Loss (3-3)\n7. Week 7: Loss (3-4)\n8. Week 8: Loss (3-5)\n9. Week 9: Win (4-5)\n10. Week 10: Loss (4-6)\n11. Week 11: Win (5-6)\n12. Week 12: Loss (5-7)\n13. Week 13: Win (6-7)\n14. Week 14: Loss (6-8)\n\nNow, let's look for consecutive wins:\n\n- Weeks 1 and 2 are both wins, so that's two in a row.\n- After week 5, the record is 3-2. So weeks 5 was a win, but what happened before? Week 4 was a loss, so it breaks any streak there.\n- Similarly, after week 11, which is a win (5-6), the next week (12) is a loss, so no three in a row.\n- The last win is week 13, followed by a loss in week 14.\n\nLooking for any point where they won three games in a row. From the results above, after each win, there's usually a loss or the season ends. There doesn't seem to be any sequence of three wins in a row because after every two wins, there's a loss or a game where they didn't win.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me list out all the wins and see if any three happen in a row:\n\nWins occur at weeks 1,2,5,9,11,13.\n\nBetween week 1-2: two consecutive wins.\nThen week 3 is a loss, breaking the streak.\n\nWeek 5: win after a loss (week 4).\nWeeks 5 and 6: week 6 is a loss.\n\nWeek 9: win after a series of losses. Week 10 is a loss.\n\nWeek 11: win, then week 12 is a loss.\n\nWeek 13: win, followed by week 14's loss.\n\nSo, in all cases, there are at most two consecutive wins before a loss or the season ending. Therefore, the claim holds true because they never had three or more wins in a row.\n\nBut wait, the table goes up to week 14, which is December 20, so it's the entire season. I don't see any point where three wins happen consecutively. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those that show each win and loss, ensuring no sequence of three wins occurs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 21.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about 1975. Looking at the table, all the dates seem to be from September 21 to December 20. None of them have a year mentioned, so I need to check if this is for the 1975 season or not. However, without the year in the table, it's unclear. Maybe the team was playing during that time, but perhaps the data doesn't include all seasons.\n\nNext, I need to find any game where the Broncos lost and scored points. The 'result' column shows either a win (w) or loss (l), followed by the score. For example, in row 1, they lost 37-33, so their score was 33. In row 3, they lost 14-38, scoring 14. \n\nI need to check each loss to see if any of them scored exactly 21 points in a loss. Looking through all the losses:\n\nRow 0: loss, score 33\nRow 2: loss, score 14\nRow 4: loss, score 9\nRow 5: loss, score 16\nRow 6: loss, score 13\nRow 7: loss, score 17\nRow 8: loss, score 16\nRow 10: loss, score 21\n\nWait, row 10 shows a loss with the Broncos scoring 21 points. So in that game, they lost but scored 21 points. That would support the claim.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that this game was indeed in 1975. The table doesn't specify the year for each game. If all these games are from 1975, then yes. But if not, maybe the claim is incorrect because it's not during 1975.\n\nHowever, the user didn't provide any context about the years of the data. So without knowing that the relevant loss happened in 1975, I can't confirm the claim as true. Maybe the Broncos scored 21 points in a loss in 1975, but if this particular game was not in 1975, then it's false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user assumes all games are from 1975 since it's not specified otherwise. But the claim is about 1975 specifically, so we need to ensure that the data supports a loss in 1975 where they scored 21 points.\n\nSince the table doesn't specify the year for each game, I can't be certain if any of these losses happened in 1975. Therefore, there's no way to confirm that the Broncos had such a performance in 1975 based solely on this data. \n\nWait, but maybe the user wants me to consider that all games are from 1975 since it's not specified otherwise. If that's the case, then the existence of a game where they lost with 21 points would make the claim true. However, I should be cautious because without knowing the year, I can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data is from 1975, and row 10 is the one in question. So if that row is indeed from 1975, then it's TRUE. Otherwise, if none of the losses in 1975 had them scoring 21 points, then it's FALSE.\n\nBut since the table doesn't specify the years, I can't be sure. Therefore, based on the given information, there is a game where they lost with 21 points, but whether that was in 1975 isn't clear. So maybe the claim is false because we don't have data supporting it within 1975.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"in 1975,\" so I need to check if any of their losses that year had them scoring 21 points. Since the table doesn't specify years, perhaps all these games are from 1975, and then row 10 would support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is incomplete or only includes a subset of the 1975 season. Without more info, it's hard to say for sure. But based on the given data, there is at least one loss where they scored 21 points (row 10). If that game was in 1975, then TRUE; if not, then FALSE.\n\nSince I don't have the year for each game, I can't confirm whether it's from 1975 or another year. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because we can't verify that such a loss occurred in 1975.\n\nWait, but the user said to check each condition against the table. So maybe the key is to find any row where they lost and scored 21 points, regardless of the date. Since there's at least one such row (row 10), then the claim could be TRUE if that game was in 1975. But without knowing, it's uncertain.\n\nI think I need to point out that while a loss with 21 points exists in the data, it's not specified whether it was in 1975, so the claim can't be confirmed as true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Denver Broncos lost a game while scoring 21 points cannot be definitively confirmed as true or false based solely on the provided data. While there is evidence of a loss where they scored exactly 21 points (as seen in row 10), the year of this specific game is not specified in the table. Therefore, without additional information indicating that this particular loss occurred in 1975, we cannot conclusively verify the claim.\n\nAnswer: The claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"in 1975 , the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It says that in 1975, the Denver Broncos went into overtime only once. So, I'm looking for evidence of this specific occurrence in the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The 'week' column seems to indicate the week number of the game. Since the claim is about 1975, I should check if there are games from that year in the table.\n\nWait a minute, the table provided starts with games from \"september 21\" up to \"december 20.\" If all the dates are in September, October, November, and December, then none of them would be in 1975. The earliest week is Week 1 on September 21, which I believe would fall in 1975 if that's the start of their season.\n\nSo, the Broncos played multiple games starting from September to December 1975. Let me check each row for any game in 1975 where they went into overtime only once.\n\nLooking at the 'result' column: some results have \"w\" (win), \"l\" (loss), and one has \"l 13 -14\". I need to see if there's a game marked as overtime. In football, a game goes into overtime if the score is tied after regulation time, leading to an extra period.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: Broncos won in regulation.\n- Week 2: Another win in regulation.\n- Week 3: Lost in regulation.\n- Week 4: Tied but lost in regulation? Wait, \"l 9 -20\" seems like a straight loss. No overtime mentioned here.\n- Week 5: Won in regulation.\n- Week 6: Lost in regulation.\n- Week 7: Lost in regulation.\n- Week 8: Lost in regulation.\n- Week 9: Won in regulation.\n- Week 10: Lost in regulation.\n- Week 11: The result is \"w 13 -10 (ot)\", which indicates an overtime win. So, this game was decided in overtime.\n- Week 12: Lost in regulation.\n- Week 13: Won in regulation.\n- Week 14: Lost in regulation.\n\nSo, from the table, there's only one game that went into overtime, which is Week 11 against the San Diego Chargers. That would mean the Broncos went into overtime once in 1975.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"in 1975 , the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time.\" The data shows they played 14 games and only one of them was in overtime. However, the table's dates might correspond to 1975, but perhaps the actual games were from different years. For example, if Week 1 is September 21, 1975, then indeed all these games would be from that year.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the Broncos went into overtime only once in 1975. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes the game data might not always list every game from a specific season, but here it seems comprehensive. Each week is accounted for with an opponent and result. The only overtime game is Week 11, so one time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos played in overtime only once. By examining each row of the table, we find that there's exactly one game (Week 11) where they went into overtime. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a game played during the season, with details for that specific week.\n\nThe claim mentions 1975, so I need to look for games in that year. But wait, looking at the table, all the dates go up to December 14, 2014. That's way beyond 1975. So that's a problem because the data doesn't cover 1975. This makes me think that maybe there's no information in this table about 1975.\n\nBut I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet. Maybe the user provided an outdated or incorrect table, but for the sake of this task, I have to work with what's given. So, if the table doesn't include any games from 1975, then the claim can't be verified as TRUE because there's no data to support it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check each row's week and date again. The highest week is 14, but the dates go up to December 2014. So even if we assume that the season covered in this table spans from September to December, the years are way beyond 1975. Therefore, it's impossible for there to be any games in 1975 here.\n\nSo, considering that, the claim is about a game in 1975, but our data doesn't include any such game. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by this table, which means it should be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos finish the season with a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl,\" I need to check if there's any relevant information in the provided table.\n\n1. **Check for games in 1975**: The table lists games from weeks 1 to 14, but all dates are beyond 2014, much later than 1975. There are no games in 1975.\n2. **Miami Orange Bowl location**: The claim mentions a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl.

The claim is: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco never have more than 1 win in a row.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than one win in a row. So I need to look into their performance during that season and see if there were any stretches of two consecutive wins.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists games from week 1 to week 14, but wait\u2014wait, hold on. The years aren't specified in the table. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe all these games took place in 1975? Or are they spread across different years?\n\nWait, let me check the data again. Each row has a \"week\" number and a \"date.\" For example, week 1 is September 21, which would be 1975 because Denver Broncos started as an NFL team in 1970, so 1975 makes sense for their early seasons.\n\nSo, each game listed is from the 1975 season. Therefore, the claim refers to that specific year.\n\nNow, I need to go through each week and check if there are any two consecutive wins. So, I'll look at the \"result\" column to see who won each game.\n\nLet's list out the results:\n\nWeek 1: W (37-33)\nWeek 2: W (23-13)\nWeek 3: L (14-38)\nWeek 4: L (9-20)\nWeek 5: W (16-15)\nWeek 6: L (13-26)\nWeek 7: L (17-42)\nWeek 8: L (16-17)\nWeek 9: W (27-17)\nWeek 10: L (21-35)\nWeek 11: W (13-10 OT)\nWeek 12: L (10-17)\nWeek 13: W (25-10)\nWeek 14: L (13-14)\n\nNow, let's look for consecutive wins. \n\nLooking at the results:\n\n- Week 1: Win\n- Week 2: Win \u2192 So weeks 1 and 2 are both wins. That's two in a row.\n\nSo that immediately contradicts the claim because there were two consecutive wins in 1975. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other instances.\n\nWeeks 5 and 6: Week 5 is W, week 6 is L \u2192 no.\nWeeks 9 and 10: W then L \u2192 no.\nWeeks 11 and 12: W then L \u2192 no.\nWeek 13 is W, but the next week (14) is L.\n\nSo only weeks 1 and 2 are two consecutive wins. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there was a stretch of two wins in a row.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. Since the issue is that in week 1 and week 2, both results are W, so those are the relevant rows under \"result\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than one win in a row. However, examining the table, we see that Weeks 1 and 2 both resulted in wins for the Broncos, indicating two consecutive victories.

The claim is: \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 be at the Mile High Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the lowest attendance (i.e., the smallest number of people attending) at a Broncos game in 1975 specifically held at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has data from weeks 1 to 14, spanning dates starting in September 1975 and ending in December 1975. Each row represents a different game with details like week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nThe key points I need to check are:\n1. Year: The claim mentions 1975, so I should focus on games that occurred in that year.\n2. Venue: Mile High Stadium is specified as the location.\n3. Lowest attendance: Need to find if there was a game with the lowest number of attendees in 1975 at Mile High.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row to see which ones are from 1975 and occur at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Week 1: September 21, 1975 (assuming this is correct as data starts in September)\nWait, actually, looking back, the first game is week 1 on September 21, but it's not explicitly stated whether that's 1975 or another year. Wait, but the claim mentions 1975, so I need to confirm if the games in question are indeed from that year.\n\nAssuming that the table covers games up until December 1975 (since week 14 is December 20), but the exact years might not be specified. However, since the claim is about 1975, I should check for games in 1975 at Mile High Stadium and find their attendance numbers.\n\nWait, looking back, the first row's date is September 21, which would be 1975. The last game in week 14 is December 20, 1975.\n\nSo each game from weeks 1 to 14 in the table is part of the 1975 season. Now, among these games, I need to identify which ones are played at Mile High Stadium because the claim specifies that location.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- Week 1: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 2: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 3: Rich Stadium (Buffalo)\n- Week 4: Three Rivers Stadium (Pittsburgh)\n- Week 5: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 6: Arrowhead Stadium (KC)\n- Week 7: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 8: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 9: San Diego Stadium\n- Week 10: Atlanta Stadium\n- Week 11: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 12: Oakland Coliseum\n- Week 13: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 14: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nSo, the games at Mile High Stadium in 1975 are weeks 1,2,5,7,8,11,13.\n\nNow, I need to look at the attendance numbers for these games and find the lowest one.\n\nThe attendances are as follows:\n- Week 1: 51,858\n- Week 2: 52,621\n- Week 5: 52,590\n- Week 7: 52,505\n- Week 8: 49,919\n- Week 11: 44,982\n- Week 13: 36,860\n\nLooking for the lowest attendance, which is 36,860 at week 13.\n\nWait, that's the smallest number among them. So, the lowest attendance in 1975 at Mile High Stadium was indeed 36,860.\n\nThe claim says \"the lowest attendance... be at the Mile High Stadium,\" and according to the table, that's correct because one of the games had that attendance there.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there was a game in 1975 with the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium. The table shows that week 13 against the Philadelphia Eagles had the lowest attendance (36,860) at Mile High Stadium, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells in the table are relevant to support this claim. The claim says: \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. They're talking about the Denver Broncos' performance in 1975, specifically looking at their losses and the highest point total they had in those losses. The claim states that the maximum points they scored in any loss during that year was 15.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with various columns like week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game with these details filled out. \n\nNow, I need to parse through each game to see if there are any losses by the Broncos in 1975 where they scored exactly 15 points or less, but more importantly, whether 15 is indeed the maximum they scored in their losses that season.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows correspond to games played in 1975. The 'date' column lists dates ranging from September 21 to December 20, 1975. So, any game with a date within this range is relevant for the 1975 season.\n\nNext, I need to check each of these games to see if the Broncos lost and what their score was in those losses. If in any of these games, the Broncos scored more than 15 points but still lost, that would make the claim false because they had a higher point total in a loss. Conversely, if all their losses were with 15 or fewer points and there's at least one game where they lost with exactly 15 points, then the claim could be true.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Week 1: They played the Kansas City Chiefs on September 21 and won 37-33.\n2. Week 2: Played Green Bay Packers on September 29 and won 23-13.\n3. Week 3: Lost to Buffalo Bills 14-38, so that's a loss. Their score was 14 points.\n4. Week 4: Lost to Pittsburgh Steelers 9-20, scoring 9 points.\n5. Week 5: Beat Cleveland Browns 16-15, so no loss here.\n6. Week 6: Lost to Kansas City Chiefs 13-26, scoring 13 points.\n7. Week 7: Played Oakland Raiders on November 26 and lost 17-42, scoring 17 points.\n8. Week 8: Lost to Cincinnati Bengals 16-17, scoring 16 points.\n9. Week 9: Beat San Diego Chargers 27-17, so no loss.\n10. Week 10: Lost to Atlanta Falcons 21-35, scoring 21 points.\n11. Week 11: Beat San Diego Chargers in overtime 13-10, so no loss.\n12. Week 12: Lost to Oakland Raiders 10-17, scoring 10 points.\n13. Week 13: Beat Philadelphia Eagles 25-10, so no loss.\n14. Week 14: Lost to Miami Dolphins 13-14, scoring 13 points.\n\nNow, I can list all the losses and their corresponding scores:\n\n- Week 3: 14\n- Week 4: 9\n- Week 6: 13\n- Week 7: 17\n- Week 8: 16\n- Week 10: 21\n- Week 12: 10\n- Week 14: 13\n\nLooking at these, the highest score in a loss is 21 points (against Atlanta Falcons on November 23). So, the Broncos scored 21 points in a loss, which is higher than 15. Therefore, the claim that \"the most points they scored in a loss was 15\" is incorrect because there was a game where they lost with 21 points.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if all these games are indeed part of the 1975 season. The dates go from September 21 to December 20, which covers the entire 1975 season for the Broncos. So, each loss mentioned here is within that timeframe.\n\nTherefore, since they had a higher score in a loss (21), the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the Denver Broncos lost a game with 21 points in 1975, exceeding the claimed maximum of 15 points in losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco go in overtime only 2 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in the year 1975, the Denver Broncos played in overtime only twice. So, my task is to check if the table supports this claim or contradicts it.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a game played by the Broncos during a specific week and year. Wait, but the years in the table are only up to 1975? Let me check the dates.\n\nWait, no. The dates go as far as \"december 14\" and \"december 20,\" which would be 1974 or 1975 depending on the month. But actually, looking at the data, the earliest week is labeled as 1 with a date of \"september 21.\" September is in 1975 because 1975 was a year when the Broncos started playing. So, this table likely covers games from September to December 1974 and early 1975? Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, if week 1 is September 21, 1975, then it's within that year. But the claim is about 1975 specifically.\n\nSo, focusing on 1975, which weeks are relevant here? The table starts at week 1 and goes up to week 14. So, all games from week 1 through week 14 are in 1975 or maybe spanning into 1976, but since the claim is about 1975, I need to check only those games that occurred in 1975.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to figure out which rows correspond to 1975. Let me look at the 'date' column. The dates go from September 21 (week 1) to December 20 (week 14). So, all these games are in 1975 because the Broncos played in September and December of that year.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many times they went into overtime during these games. Overtime occurs when a game is decided by extra points or sudden death after the regulation time ends without a winner. In the table, the 'result' column indicates whether the game was a win (w) or loss (l), followed by the score. Sometimes it notes \"ot\" for overtime, like in week 11.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: vs Chiefs, result w 37-33. No mention of OT.\n- Week 2: vs Packers, w 23-13. No OT.\n- Week 3: vs Bills, l 14-38. No OT.\n- Week 4: vs Steelers, l 9-20. No OT.\n- Week 5: vs Browns, w 16-15. No OT.\n- Week 6: vs Chiefs, l 13-26. No OT.\n- Week 7: vs Raiders, l 17-42. No OT.\n- Week 8: vs Bengals, l 16-17. No OT.\n- Week 9: vs Chargers, w 27-17. No OT.\n- Week 10: vs Falcons, l 21-35. No OT.\n- Week 11: vs Chargers, w 13-10 (OT). Yes, this was an overtime game.\n- Week 12: vs Raiders, l 10-17. No OT.\n- Week 13: vs Eagles, w 25-10. No OT.\n- Week 14: vs Dolphins, l 13-14. No OT.\n\nSo, in the entire table, only week 11 was an overtime game. That's just one game. The claim states that they went into overtime only twice in 1975. But according to this, it's only once. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it claims two times but actually it was only once.\n\nWait, let me double-check if there are any other games marked as OT. Scanning through each result:\n\nLooking at the 'result' column, I see entries like \"w 37 - 33\", \"l 14 - 38\", etc., without any mention of overtime except for week 11. So yes, only one overtime game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states two times when in reality it was once.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Denver Broncos played only one overtime game in 1975 (Week 11). Since the claim states they went into overtime twice, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos finished the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and see if it matches any data in the table. Let me break down the claim:\n\n1. **Year**: 1975\n2. **Team**: Denver Broncos\n3. **Season Result**: Finished the season with a win\n4. **Location**: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game for the Denver Broncos in what looks like their 1975 season.\n\nI'll go through each row to find any games played at the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975 where they won.\n\n- **Row 0**: Week 1 on September 21 against the Kansas City Chiefs. The game was at Mile High Stadium, so not relevant.\n- **Row 1**: Week 2 on September 29 against the Green Bay Packers. Again, Mile High Stadium, not Miami.\n- **Row 2**: Week 3 on October 5 against the Buffalo Bills. This time, it's Rich Stadium in Buffalo. Not our target location.\n- **Row 3**: Week 4 on October 12 vs Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium. Still not Miami.\n- **Row 4**: Week 5 on October 19 vs Cleveland Browns at Mile High. No match.\n- **Row 5**: Week 6 on October 26 vs Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium in KC. Not relevant.\n- **Row 6**: Week 7 on November 26 vs Oakland Raiders at Mile High. Still not Miami.\n- **Row 7**: Week 8 on November 9 vs Cincinnati Bengals at Mile High. No match.\n- **Row 8**: Week 9 on November 16 vs San Diego Chargers at San Diego Stadium. Not our location.\n- **Row 9**: Week 10 on November 23 vs Atlanta Falcons at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. Still not Miami.\n- **Row 10**: Week 11 on November 30 vs San Diego Chargers, this time at Mile High Stadium in a overtime win. But the location is still Denver's home stadium, not Miami.\n- **Row 11**: Week 12 on December 8 vs Oakland Raiders at Oakland-Alameda Coliseum. Not relevant.\n- **Row 12**: Week 13 on December 14 vs Philadelphia Eagles at Mile High. No match.\n- **Row 13**: Week 14 on December 20 vs Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl.\n\nWait, here's a game in row 13 (which is week 14) against the Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl. The result was a loss because they had a record of 6-8 after that game.\n\nBut the claim says they finished the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl. However, in the table, their last game (week 14) against the Miami Dolphins was a loss. That means their last game wasn't a win, so they didn't end the season with a victory at the Miami Orange Bowl.\n\nI need to check if there's any other game at the Miami Orange Bowl where they won after week 14. But looking through all the rows, it seems like the only game at the Miami Orange Bowl is week 14, which was a loss. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the table data. The row for December 20 (week 14) shows the opponent as Miami Dolphins and the result as \"l 13 - 14\". So that's a loss.\n\nI don't see any other games in 1975 at the Miami Orange Bowl where they won. Therefore, the claim is false because their last game against the Dolphins was a loss, not a win.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos finished the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl. However, upon reviewing the table, the only game listed for the Broncos at the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975 (Week 14) resulted in a loss against the Miami Dolphins. There is no evidence of a victory by the Broncos in that specific game or any other game at the Miami Orange Bowl during the 1975 season.\n\n**Answer: \"FALSE\"**\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The game at Week 14 against the Miami Dolphins (row index 13) in column \"result\" shows a loss, which contradicts the claim of finishing with a win.",
