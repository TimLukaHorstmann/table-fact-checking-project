    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the super g value for the season that have an overall score of 16 be 9.\" So, we're looking for a season where the 'overall' column has a score of 16, and in that same season, the 'super g' value should be 9.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, combined.\n- The data rows represent seasons from 2005 to 2012. Notably, some entries have non-numeric values like \"-\" or \"out for season...\", which might be special cases.\n\nNext, I'll scan each row's 'overall' score to see if any match the value 16.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **2005**: overall is \"93\" \u2192 Not 16.\n2. **2006**: overall is \"77\" \u2192 Not 16.\n3. **2007**: overall is \"38\" \u2192 Not 16.\n4. **2008**: overall is \"32\" \u2192 Not 16.\n5. **2009**: overall is \"25\" \u2192 Not 16.\n6. **2010**: overall is \"16\" \u2192 This matches our target score.\n\nNow, let's check the 'super g' value for the 2010 season. The data for 2010 is: [2010, \"16\", \"-\", \"9\", \"4\", \"-\"]. So, the 'super g' column here has a value of \"9\".\n\nSince both conditions are met\u2014overall score is 16 and super g is 9\u2014the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there are any other rows where overall is 16. Looking through the table again:\n\n- **2010** is the only row with an overall score of 16.\n- No other season has an overall score of 16, so we don't need to consider those.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: The claim refers to 'super g' and 'overall'. So, I need to identify which rows and columns are involved. Specifically:\n\n- For 2010, it's row_index 5 (since it's zero-indexed, starting from 2005 as 0). Wait, let me double-check that.\n\nWait, the data array starts with 2005 as the first element (index 0), then 2006 is index 1, and so on. So 2010 would be at row_index 5 because:\n\n2005: 0  \n2006: 1  \n2007: 2  \n2008: 3  \n2009:4  \n2010:5  \n2011:6  \n2012:7\n\nYes, 2010 is index 5. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index 5, column \"super g\" (value \"9\")\n- The same row's 'overall' value (\"16\") isn't directly part of the claim, but it's necessary to verify that in this row, overall is 16 and super g is 9.\n\nWait, no. The claim specifies looking for a season where overall is 16 and super g is 9. So both columns are involved. Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- The 'overall' column at row 5 (2010)\n- The 'super g' column at row 5 (2010)\n\nSo, in the JSON response, I need to include these two as relevant_cells.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE because both conditions are satisfied for 2010, and the relevant cells are the overall and super g columns for that season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data. The 2010 season has an overall score of 16 and a super g value of 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the overall score for the 2006 season be 77\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, combined. Each row represents a different season from 2005 to 2012, with some having special notes like being \"out for season\" in 2012.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the overall score for the 2006 season. So I need to find the data related to the 2006 season and the \"overall\" column.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\n- The first row (index 0) is 2005 with overall \"93\".\n- Second row (index 1) is 2006, and in that row, the overall score is listed as \"77\". That matches the claim exactly.\n- The other rows don't matter unless there's more info, but since the claim is only about 2006, I can focus on that.\n\nSo, the relevant cell would be the 2006 season's overall column. \n\nNow, to make sure, I need to confirm that in row 1 (since it's 0-indexed, so index 1), the \"overall\" value is indeed \"77\". Yes, it is.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in cell row_index=1 and column_name=\"overall\".\n</think>\n\nThe overall score for the 2006 season is indeed 77 as shown in the relevant cell of the table. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. Identify the relevant season mentioned in the claim: 2006.\n2. Locate the corresponding row in the table. The 2006 season is at row index 1.\n3. Check the value in the \"overall\" column for that row, which is \"77\".\n4. Since this matches the claim exactly, it's TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the season that have a super g of 33 be 2008.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table structure. The table has six columns: season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined. Each row represents a different year from 2005 to 2012, except for 2012 which seems to have some injury notes instead of numerical data.\n\nThe claim is specifically about a season with a super g (super g) value of 33 being 2008. So I should look at the super g column for each row and check if 33 appears there, then see what year that corresponds to.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- 2005: super g is 50\n- 2006: super g is 45\n- 2007: super g is -\n- 2008: super g is 33\n- 2009: super g is 30\n- 2010: super g is 9\n- 2011: super g is 27\n- 2012: all entries for that row are \"out for season...\"\n\nSo, in the super g column, the only time it shows 33 is in 2008. That seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other occurrence of 33 elsewhere or maybe misinterpretations. The claim refers to \"the season,\" so it's about a specific year matching the super g value. Since 2008 has 33 and no other years have that number except for 2005 (50), 2006 (45), etc., which are different.\n\nAlso, checking if any rows after 2008 might have 33, but they don't. So it's only 2008.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because 2008 does have a super g of 33.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the super g value for the season that have an overall score of 16 be 33.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It's a JSON with columns: season, overall, slalom, super_g, downhill, combined. The data has rows from 2005 to 2012, but some entries are \"-\". Notably, in 2012, all values seem to be \"out for season : injured in january 2011\", which might mean that the skier wasn't able to compete that season.\n\nThe claim is about a specific season where the overall score is 16. So I need to find the row where the 'overall' column is 16 and then check the corresponding 'super_g' value in that row.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 2005: Overall is \"93\", not 16.\n- 2006: Overall is \"77\", nope.\n- 2007: \"38\", not 16.\n- 2008: \"32\", nope.\n- 2009: \"25\", still not 16.\n- 2010: Here, the overall is \"16\". So that's our row of interest. Now, check the 'super_g' column for this row. In 2010, the super_g is \"9\".\n\nWait, but the claim says that the super_g value should be 33 for the season with an overall score of 16. But in the data, the super_g for 2010 is 9, not 33. So that doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if there's another row where overall is 16. Let me make sure. The next year after 2010 is 2011: overall is \"60\", so no. Then 2012: the overall is \"out for season...\", which isn't a number. So the only row with overall score 16 is 2010, and in that row, super_g is 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that super_g should be 33 when overall is 16, but in reality, it's 9. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"2007 and 2008 both have a super g score of 33.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined. Each row represents a different season from 2005 to 2012.\n\nThe claim is specifically about two seasons: 2007 and 2008, both having a super g score of 33. So I need to check the 'super g' column for these years.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- For 2007 (row index 2), the super g column has \"-\". So no number there.\n- For 2008 (row index 3), the super g column also has \"33\".\n\nSo, in 2007, the super g score isn't provided as a number; it's a dash. That means we can't confirm that 2007 had a super g score of 33 because the data is missing. Therefore, the claim about both 2007 and 2008 having a super g score of 33 isn't fully supported for 2007.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dashes mean that the athlete didn't participate or didn't have a score in that event. So for 2007, even if it's a dash, perhaps we can infer that they didn't have a super g score of 33. Therefore, the claim is only partially true for 2008 but not for 2007.\n\nSince the claim includes both years, and one of them doesn't have a valid super g score in the table, the entire statement isn't fully accurate. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"super g\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the downhill for 2006 be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The columns are season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined. Each row corresponds to a specific season from 2005 to 2012, with some entries having a special message instead of numerical data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the downhill for 2006 be 12.\" So I need to find the entry for the 2006 season in the downhill column and check if it's 12. \n\nLooking at the table, each sub-array is a row corresponding to a different year. The first few rows (0 to 5) have numerical values except the last one, which has text. So I need to find the row where \"season\" is 2006.\n\nIn the data array, the second entry is for 2006. Let's look at that row:\n[\n  2006,\n  \"77\",\n  \"-\",\n  \"45\",\n  \"29\",\n  \"40\"\n]\n\nHere, the columns are in order: season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, combined. So the fifth element is the downhill value for 2006. The value there is \"29\". Hmm, that's not 12.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Could it be a typo or another error? Let me double-check. No, according to this row, the downhill is 29, which doesn't match 12.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is stating that for 2006, the downhill was 12, but the table shows it as 29. That means the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to list which cells were checked.
