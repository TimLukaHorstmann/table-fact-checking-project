The name here starts with \"William,\" but it's written as \"william\" in lowercase, which might be a typo or just the way it's recorded. However, for this check, I think it counts because the relevant part is the start of the name.\n- For Pennsylvania (3), the successor is \"william bigler (d)\". Again, \"William\" starts the name.\n\nSo both California and Pennsylvania have successors whose names begin with \"William.\" Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the only class 2 state name be new hampshire.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that New Hampshire is the only state classified as a Class 2 state in the table. So I should look at the table to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: \"state (class)\", \"vacator\", \"reason for change\", \"successor\", and \"date of successors formal installation\". The data rows provide specific information about each state's changes in leadership.\n\nNow, I need to focus on the column \"state (class)\" because that's what the claim is referencing. Each row has a state with its class number in parentheses, like \"new hampshire (2)\", \"alabama (3)\", etc. So the first step is to check all the entries in this column.\n\nThe claim states that only New Hampshire is classified as Class 2. To verify this, I need to make sure that no other state in the table shares the same class number, specifically 2. \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. \"new hampshire (2)\" \u2013 This is indeed Class 2.\n2. \"alabama (3)\" \u2013 This is Class 3.\n3. \"pennsylvania (3)\" \u2013 Also Class 3.\n4. \"california (3)\" \u2013 Again, Class 3.\n5. \"indiana (3)\" \u2013 And again, Class 3.\n\nFrom this, it's clear that only New Hampshire is listed as a Class 2 state in the table provided. There are no other states with the class number 2 besides New Hampshire.\n\nNow, I should consider if there might be any other factors that could affect this conclusion. The claim specifically mentions \"the only class 2 state name,\" so it's referring to the state names, not the class numbers or anything else. Each of these entries is unique in their state (class) designation. \n\nI also notice that all except New Hampshire have a reason for change related to the legislature failing to elect on time. However, this doesn't impact the class number, so it's irrelevant to the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim holds true because no other states are classified as Class 2.\n</think>\n\nThe only state listed with a \"Class 2\" designation is New Hampshire, as per the table. No other states share this classification.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"state (class)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"there be 2 successors who start in 1855, which be benjamin fitzpatrick and john parker hale.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. There should be two successors.\n2. Both started in 1855.\n3. The names mentioned are Benjamin Fitzpatrick and John Parker Hale.\n\nLooking at the table, it has five rows, each representing a state and its successor information. Each row corresponds to different states: New Hampshire, Alabama, Pennsylvania, California, and Indiana. \n\nI need to check which of these two individuals (Benjamin Fitzpatrick and John Parker Hale) are successors in 1855.\n\nStarting with Benjamin Fitzpatrick:\n- He is listed as the successor for Alabama (3). The date of his formal installation was November 26, 1855. So, he started in 1855. That's one person.\n\nNext, John Parker Hale:\n- Looking through the table, I don't immediately see a row where John Parker Hale is the successor. The first column has \"new hampshire (2)\", but the second entry under vacator is \"vacant,\" which means there was no successor until someone else took over. Wait, the third row is Pennsylvania, and the successor is William Bigler, not Hale. New Hampshire's successor isn't listed here; perhaps it's a different table or elsewhere? But based on this table, I don't see John Parker Hale as a successor in 1855.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The third row for Pennsylvania has William Bigler, and the first row is New Hampshire with \"vacant\" as vacator, so no successor listed here. Maybe Hale was a predecessor? Or perhaps there's an error.\n\nBut according to the table provided, only Alabama (3) has Benjamin Fitzpatrick starting in 1855. John Parker Hale isn't listed as a successor at all. So, maybe the claim is incorrect because only one person (Benjamin Fitzpatrick) started in 1855, not two.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's only one successor from 1855 mentioned in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check for successors who started in 1855. The table shows Benjamin Fitzpatrick as the successor of Alabama (3), installed on November 26, 1855.

Also, Gwin and Fitch are from different states: California and Indiana.\n\nBut the key point is whether they both joined Congress in 1857.

Each row represents a state where the congressperson resigned or couldn't be elected, so each successor is from a different state.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The answer should be either TRUE or FALSE, along with the relevant cells from the table that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that there are two successors in Congress who took office between 1855 and 1857. So, I'm looking for two individuals who became members of Congress during that timeframe and replaced others.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a state and its change in Congress members. The relevant columns here are \"successor\" and \"date of successors formal installation.\" Additionally, the \"state (class)\" might be important to track if multiple states have successors within the specified years.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **New Hampshire (2)**: The successor is John Parker Hale (R), installed on July 30, 1855.\n2. **Alabama (3)**: Successor is Benjamin Fitzpatrick (D), installed on November 26, 1855.\n3. **Pennsylvania (3)**: Successor is William Bigler (D), installed on January 14, 1856.\n4. **California (3)**: Successor is William M. Gwin (D), installed on January 13, 1857.\n5. **Indiana (3)**: Successor is Graham N. Fitch (D), installed on February 4, 1857.\n\nNow, I need to count how many successors took office between 1855 and 1857. Each row has one successor, so initially, it seems like there are five successors. However, the claim specifies \"2 successors,\" which is clearly less than five. This makes me think that perhaps only two of these installations happened between 1855 and 1857, but upon closer inspection, all five successors were installed during this timeframe.\n\nWait a second, looking at the dates:\n\n- July 30, 1855: That's in 1855.\n- November 26, 1855: Also 1855.\n- January 14, 1856: 1856.\n- January 13, 1857: 1857.\n- February 4, 1857: 1857.\n\nSo all five successors took office between 1855 and 1857. But the claim is stating there are only two. That suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"successors.\" Perhaps it's referring to replacements where the previous member was a sitting Congressperson, but in this table, each successor seems to be taking over from someone else, so they're all valid successors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"Congress\" is being interpreted narrowly. For example, if we consider that some of these states were non-members of Congress at certain times, but looking at the data, all these states were part of Congress during their respective years.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the claim refers to two people who are successors in the same Congress session or class? But the table lists different classes (e.g., New Hampshire is class 2, Alabama is class 3), so they're in different sessions. However, the claim doesn't specify whether it's within the same Congress or across all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"there be 2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857.\" So, two people became Congress members during that time, replacing others. Looking at the table, each row is a different state, so each successor is a new member taking office. Therefore, there are five successors listed.\n\nBut the claim says \"two,\" which contradicts the data unless I'm missing something. Maybe the term \"successor\" refers only to a specific context, like a direct replacement in the same position or within the same party, but that doesn't seem to align with the table's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how Congress classes work. The \"state (class)\" column indicates which class the state was in. For example, New Hampshire is class 2, Alabama is class 3. Each of these successors took office in their respective states' Congress classes. But that doesn't limit it to two people.\n\nI'm starting to think that the claim might be incorrect because there are five successors listed who took office between 1855 and 1857. However, maybe the term \"Congress\" refers to a specific branch or body, but even so, each of these individuals became members of Congress during that period.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each successor replaces someone else, so each is an additional member rather than replacing multiple. But regardless, the count seems off from the claim's assertion.\n\nHold on, maybe the term \"successor\" in this context refers to someone who took over a specific role, like Speaker of the House or Senate leadership, but the table doesn't specify that. It just lists successors as members of Congress.\n\nI think I'm going around in circles here. The key point is that the claim says there are two successors between 1855 and 1857, but according to the table, there are five. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, no, the table has five entries, each with a successor. So, if the claim says \"two,\" but we have five, then it's definitely FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\n1. New Hampshire: July 30, 1855\n2. Alabama: November 26, 1855\n3. Pennsylvania: January 14, 1856\n4. California: January 13, 1857\n5. Indiana: February 4, 1857\n\nYes, five successors. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists five successors who took office between 1855 and 1857, not two as stated in the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim asserts that there are exactly two successors in Congress who took office between 1855 and 1857.\n2. **Analyze the Table:** Each row represents a state where a successor was appointed after a vacancy occurred.\n3. **Identify Relevant Data:** Focus on the \"successor\" column and their installation dates.\n4. **Count the Successors:** There are five successors listed with installation dates within the specified timeframe.\n5. **Compare with the Claim:** Since there are five, not two, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"successor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
