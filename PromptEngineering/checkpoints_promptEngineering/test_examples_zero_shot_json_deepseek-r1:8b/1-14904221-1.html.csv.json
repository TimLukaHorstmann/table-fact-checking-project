    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"jelena obri\u0107 go on to win woman's single in 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"jelena obri\u0107\" winning the women's singles in the year 1997. So, I should look for entries in the table related to 1997 and see if she won that event.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like \"year,\" \"mens singles,\" \"womens singles,\" etc., and each row represents a different year with corresponding winners in each category.\n\nNow, I'll go through each relevant column. The claim is about women's singles, so the key column here is \"womens singles.\" I need to find the row for 1997 and check who won in that category.\n\nScanning down the rows:\n\n- 1994: No competition.\n- 1995: nata\u0161a Ostoji\u0107 wins women's singles.\n- 1996: Same winner, nata\u0161a Ostoji\u0107.\n- 1997: The winner is \"jovanka knezevi\u0107.\"\n\nWait, that's different. So in 1997, the women's singles champion was \"jovanka knezevi\u0107,\" not \"jelena obri\u0107.\" That means the claim might be false because it says \"jelena obri\u0107\" won it, but according to the table, she didn't.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are other relevant cells. Maybe the claim refers to a different category, but no\u2014the claim is specifically about women's singles in 1997. So the relevant cell would be the row for 1997 and the column \"womens singles.\"\n\nTherefore, since the winner listed is not \"jelena obri\u0107,\" the claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"jelena obri\u0107\" won the women's singles in 1997. However, according to the table, in 1997, \"jovanka knezevi\u0107\" was the winner of the women's singles. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The claim refers to \"women's singles,\" so we focus on that column.\n2. **Locate the Year 1997 Row:** Find the row corresponding to 1997 in the table.\n3. **Check the Winner for Women's Singles in 1997:** Look at the \"womens singles\" cell under the 1997 row.\n4. **Compare with the Claim:** The winner is listed as \"jovanka knezevi\u0107,\" not \"jelena obri\u0107.\"\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the claimed winner doesn't match, the statement is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nThe claim is: \"In 1994, there was no competition in men's singles, women's singles, or mixed doubles.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns for each year from 1994 to 2001 and various types of competitions including singles for both genders and doubles (men's and women's doubles) as well as mixed doubles.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions 1994, so I need to focus on the first row of data, which corresponds to the year 1994. \n\nLooking at the \"data\" array, each sub-array represents a different competition type for that year. The first entry is the year 1994. Then, under \"mens singles\", it says \"no competition\". Similarly, \"womens singles\" also has \"no competition\", and both \"mens doubles\" and \"womens doubles\" say \"no competition\" as well. Finally, \"mixed doubles\" also states \"no competition\".\n\nSo, in 1994, there were no competitions in any of the specified categories: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, or mixed doubles.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because all relevant cells for 1994 show \"no competition\" across these categories.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I check each relevant cell in the table for the year 1994. All cells under \"mens singles,\" \"womens singles,\" \"mens doubles,\" \"womens doubles,\" and \"mixed doubles\" indicate no competitions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Year**: The claim is about 1994, so I focus on the first row (row_index 0).\n\n2. **Check Each Column for 1994**:\n   - **mens singles**: \"no competition\"\n   - **womens singles**: \"no competition\"\n   - **mens doubles**: \"no competition\"\n   - **womens doubles**: \"no competition\"\n   - **mixed doubles**: \"no competition\"\n\n3. **Conclusion**: All specified competitions had no events in 1994, making the claim true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and check which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the winner of the womens single in 2001 be jelena obri\u0107\".\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It's a JSON with columns like year, mens singles, womens singles, etc., and data for each year from 1994 to 2001.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the women's singles in 2001. So I should look at the row where the year is 2001 and check the column \"womens singles\".\n\nLooking at the table, the last two rows are for 2000 and 2001. The 2000 row shows that the womens singles winner was jelena obri\u0107. For 2001, the same data point needs to be checked.\n\nIn the 2001 row, under \"womens singles\", it says \"jelena obri\u0107\". So yes, the winner of the women's singles in 2001 is indeed jelena obri\u0107.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the row for 2001 and the column \"womens singles\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because the table shows that the winner of the womens singles in 2001 was indeed Jelena Obri\u0107. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107 win the men's single in 1978\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It claims that Ivan \u0110uri\u0107 won the men's singles in the year 1978.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. The table has columns for different categories: year, men's singles, women's singles, and so on. Each row represents a year from 1994 to 2001. However, the years in the data range only from 1994 onwards, which is much later than 1978.\n\nThat already raises a red flag because the table doesn't have any data for the year 1978. If Ivan \u0110uri\u0107 won the men's singles in 1978, there should be an entry for that year in the relevant column. But since the earliest year in the table is 1994, it's impossible for him to have won in 1978 because those records aren't present.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row and column carefully. The columns related to men's singles are at index 1, which means every row's first data point after the year is the men's singles winner. So for each row (year), we can see who won in the men's singles.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 1994: No competition\n- 1995: Jovan Markovi\u0107\n- 1996: Jovan Markovi\u0107\n- 1997: Jovan Markovi\u0107\n- 1998: Jovan Markovi\u0107\n- 1999: Radomir Jovovi\u0107\n- 2000: Jovan Markovi\u0107\n- 2001: Radomir Jovovi\u0107\n\nNone of these winners are named Ivan \u0110uri\u0107. The closest names are Jovan Markovi\u0107 and Radomir Jovovi\u0107, but they don't match Ivan \u0110uri\u0107.\n\nAlso, since the table doesn't include data before 1994, it's clear that any winners before that year aren't recorded here. Therefore, there's no way to confirm Ivan \u0110uri\u0107 won in 1978 because that information isn't present in the table at all.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim is about a win in 1978, but the table only covers from 1994 onwards. Even if Ivan was a winner later, like in 2001, it's under Radomir Jovovi\u0107. There's no mention of him in any of these years either.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because there's no data supporting it within the provided table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
