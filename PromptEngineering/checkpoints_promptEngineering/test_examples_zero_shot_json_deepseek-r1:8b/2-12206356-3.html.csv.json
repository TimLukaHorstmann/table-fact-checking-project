    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in front of me and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"On June 9, the record was 28 - 29 with a loss of Mulholland (5 - 6) and an opponent of the Yankee.\" My task is to check each part of this claim against the table and determine if it's true or false, then specify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll start by locating June 9 in the table. Scanning through the data, I see that there are entries for dates like June 1, 3, 4, etc., so I need to find the one labeled \"june 9\". Let me go row by row. \n\nLooking at the first few rows: row 0 is June 1, row 1 is June 3, row 2 is June 4, row 3 is June 5, row 4 is June 7, row 5 is June 8, and then row 6 is June 9. So, the June 9 game is at row_index 6.\n\nNow, for each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Date**: The date in the claim is June 9. From the table, that's indeed row 6, so that matches.\n\n2. **Record**: The record given is 28 - 29. Looking at row 6, the \"record\" column shows \"28 - 29\". So that part checks out.\n\n3. **Loss**: The claim mentions a loss by Mulholland with a score of 5 - 6. In the table's \"loss\" column for row 6, it says \"mulholland (2 - 1)\". Wait, that doesn't match. The claim says 5 - 6, but the table shows 2 - 1. That's inconsistent.\n\n4. **Opponent**: The opponent is stated as the Yankees. In row 6, under the \"opponent\" column, it's \"yankees\". So that matches.\n\nSo, out of the four parts: date and record match, opponent matches, but loss doesn't match because the table shows a different result for the loss by Mulholland.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported because there's an inconsistency in the loss details. Thus, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
