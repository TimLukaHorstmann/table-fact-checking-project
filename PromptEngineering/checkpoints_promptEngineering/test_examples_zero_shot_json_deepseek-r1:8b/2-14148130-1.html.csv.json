    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each row represents a game, right? The columns are games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. So each row has data for one game.\n\nThe claim makes two main points:\n\n1. There are only 7 games in total.\n2. On 4 occasions, there was a draw, and never more than 1 game was drawn on any occasion.\n\nWait, that second part is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" So, it's saying that in 4 games, there were draws (so the 'drawn' column would have values), and each of those 4 games only had 1 or fewer draws? That doesn't quite make sense because a single game can only have one outcome regarding a draw\u2014either it was drawn or not. So maybe the claim is saying that in 4 games, there were draws (so the 'drawn' count for those rows would be 1), and across all games, no more than 1 game had a draw on any occasion.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended meaning is that there have been 4 draws in total across all games, with each of those 4 games only having one draw. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the table data.\n\nLooking at the 'drawn' column: let's count how many times the value is 1 because a drawn game would typically be indicated by a 1 or something similar. \n\nRow 0: drawn=0\nRow 1: drawn=0\nRow 2: drawn=1\nRow 3: drawn=1\nRow 4: drawn=1 (since in row 4, the 'drawn' is 1)\nRow 5: drawn=0\nRow 6: drawn=1\nRow 7: drawn=0\n\nSo, how many times is 'drawn' equal to 1? Let's count:\n\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 6: 1\n\nThat's four games where the 'drawn' column is 1. So there are indeed 4 occasions with a draw.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says \"never more than 1 game drawn.\" I think this means that in each of those 4 draws, only one game was drawn. But since each row represents a single game, each 'drawn' value is per game, so it's either 0 or 1. So on any given occasion (i.e., in any game), the number of drawn games is at most 1, which is inherently true because you can't have more than one outcome in a single game.\n\nWait, but perhaps the claim is saying that across all games, there were only four draws, and each draw occurred once, not multiple times. So, yes, it's correct because we have exactly four games with a drawn result.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other possible interpretations. The original claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" Maybe it means that on four occasions (i.e., in four different games), the result was a draw, and each of those four games had only one game drawn\u2014that is, no game beyond those four had draws. Wait, but in row 0, 1,5,7 have 0 drawn, which is fine because they didn't have draws.\n\nWait another angle: maybe the claim is saying that across all games, there were exactly 4 draws, each with only one game being a draw on that occasion (which is naturally true because each game can only be a draw once). So the total number of drawn games is four.\n\nLooking at the table, we have four rows where 'drawn' is 1. So the claim holds in that aspect.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- Total games: 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Number of draws: 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Each draw occurred once per game (so no more than one drawn game on any occasion) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms there are exactly 7 games, with 4 draws, each occurring in separate games. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"there be 9 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two specific points where there were 9 points each. Then, it refers to two specific point differences: one is \"30 - 15\" and the other is \"26 - 21.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check for rows that have a total of 9 points and also verify if those rows have the specified point differences.\n\nLet's go through each row in the data:\n\n1. First row: Points are 14. Doesn't match.\n2. Second row: Points are 10. No match.\n3. Third row: Points are 9. So this is one occurrence. Now, check the points difference: It says \"30 - 15.\" Wait, looking at the data for that row, the points difference is given as \"30 - 15\". But wait, in the table's third row, under \"points difference\", it's written as \"30 - 15\" and points are 9. So this matches one of the conditions.\n\n4. Fourth row: Points are 9 again. Now check the points difference: It says \"26 - 21.\" Looking at the fourth row's data, the points difference is indeed \"26 - 21\". So this matches another condition.\n\n5. Fifth row: Points are 7. Doesn't match.\n6. Sixth row: Points are 4. No.\n7. Seventh row: Points are 3. Nope.\n8. Eighth row: Points are 0. Not relevant.\n\nSo, there are two rows where points total to 9: the third and fourth rows. For each of these, we check their point differences:\n\n- Third row: \"30 - 15\" which matches one of the claim's differences.\n- Fourth row: \"26 - 21\" which is another condition in the claim.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met in the table data. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. For each occurrence of 9 points and their respective point differences:\n\nThird row (row_index=2): columns are games, drawn, lost, points difference, points. The points difference is \"30 - 15\", which corresponds to the third column's data.\n\nFourth row (row_index=3): same columns. The points difference here is \"26 - 21\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 2, column \"points difference\".\n- Row index 3, column \"points difference\".\n\nWait, but in the instructions, each relevant cell should specify both row_index and column_name as per the table's structure.\n\nIn the table, columns are: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points.\n\nSo for third row:\n\nRow index is 2 (since it's zero-based), and the column is \"points difference\".\n\nSimilarly, fourth row is index 3, same column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include these two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that whenever the points (probably the 'points' column) are zero, both the drawn games and lost games should also be zero, with lost games specifically being seven. Wait, that last part doesn't quite make sense because if lost games are 7 when points are zero, then drawn games would have to be zero as well? That might not add up correctly.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. Each row represents a different game scenario with these stats.\n\nThe task is to check if every time the 'points' column is 0, both 'drawn' and 'lost' are also 0, and specifically that lost is 7 when points are zero. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make sense because if points are zero, and lost games are seven, then drawn games would have to be negative or something, which isn't possible. Maybe I misinterpret the claim.\n\nLet me read it again: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7.\" So perhaps when points are zero, both drawn is zero and lost is seven. That seems odd because if you have zero points but also lost seven games, that would imply negative or something else. Maybe it's a typo, and they mean that in the scenario where points are zero, either drawn or lost games are zero and the other is seven? Or maybe when points are zero, both drawn and lost games are zero, but then why specify 7?\n\nWait, let me look at the table data to see if any row has points equal to zero. The 'points' column in each row is: 14,10,9,9,7,4,3,0.\n\nLooking for where points are zero: that's the last row, index 7. So I need to check what the drawn and lost columns say in this row.\n\nIn row 7 (index 7), 'drawn' is 0 and 'lost' is 7. So indeed, when points are zero, drawn games are 0 and lost games are 7. That seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, does the claim say \"when the point be 0, the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7\"? Yes. So in that case, this row satisfies the condition because both 'drawn' is 0 and 'lost' is 7 when points are zero.\n\nBut I need to make sure if there are any other rows where points are zero. In this table, only row 7 has points as zero. So we just have one relevant row to check.\n\nSo for the claim to be true, whenever points are zero, both drawn and lost must be zero and seven respectively. Since in the only case where points are zero, drawn is zero and lost is seven, it seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being that specific row and column for 'drawn' and 'lost'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"there be no draw more than 1 and no loss more than 7.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. Each row represents a game with these attributes.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. No draw more than 1: So in all the data, the number of draws should not exceed 1.\n2. No loss more than 7: Similarly, the losses per game should not be more than 7.\n\nI need to check each row for both conditions.\n\nLooking at the 'drawn' column first:\n- Row 0: 0\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 5: 0\n- Row 6: 1\n- Row 7: 0\n\nSo, the maximum number of draws is 1 in all rows. That satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the 'lost' column:\n- All rows have lost as either 0, 2, 5, or 7.\nWait, looking again:\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 2\nRow 2: 2\nRow 3: 2\nRow 4: 3\nRow 5: 5\nRow 6: 5\nRow 7: 7\n\nSo the maximum loss is 7 in row 7. That meets the second part of the claim because it's not more than 7.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"no loss more than 7,\" which means losses shouldn't exceed 7. Since all losses are \u22647, that's okay. So both conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. But I need to check each cell where either condition is relevant. For 'drawn', all rows have drawn \u22641, so every row in the 'drawn' column is relevant. For 'lost', only rows with lost >7 would be relevant, but since none exceed 7, maybe no cells are needed for 'lost.' Wait, but I think it's better to include all rows where either condition applies.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'lost' column doesn't have any values exceeding 7, so no need to mark them. Only the 'drawn' cells are relevant because they show that draws don't exceed 1.\n\nSo, for each row, the 'drawn' value is checked. All of them are \u22641, so all rows in the 'drawn' column are relevant.\n\nBut looking at the table, the 'drawn' values are: 0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0. So all rows have either 0 or 1 drawn, which is within the claim's condition. Therefore, each row's 'drawn' cell is relevant because they need to be checked.\n\nSo, in the relevant_cells, I should list each row where either column is relevant. Since both conditions are about their respective columns, and all rows have data for both, but only the 'drawn' cells are critical here because the losses don't exceed 7. Wait, no\u2014the claim requires that both draws \u22641 and losses \u22647. So for the losses, since none exceed 7, maybe those cells aren't needed. But to be thorough, perhaps include all rows in 'lost' column where lost is 7? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the table, row 7 has lost=7. The claim says \"no loss more than 7,\" which allows up to 7. So it's acceptable. Therefore, that cell is still within the condition and doesn't violate it. Thus, maybe no cells in the 'lost' column are relevant because all of them comply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the 'drawn' column needs to be checked because if any draw exceeds 1, that would make the claim false. Since none do, all rows' 'drawn' cells are relevant.\n\nSo, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant_cells are all rows in the 'drawn' column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" I'll need to parse this into two main parts.\n\n1. **Number of Games**: The claim states that there are only 7 games in total. Looking at the table, each row represents a game, so the first column \"games\" has values like 7 in all entries. Since each row is a game, and there are 8 rows listed (from row_index 0 to 7), this seems contradictory. Wait, no, actually, each entry in the data array is a row, so there are 8 games in total. But the claim says \"only 7 games.\" Hmm, that's an inconsistency right there. So maybe the first part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Number of Draws**: The second part says that on 4 occasions, there was a draw, and importantly, \"never more than 2 game draws.\" Let me check how many draws each row has. The column in question here is \"drawn,\" which counts the number of draws per game. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: drawn=0\n- Row 1: drawn=0\n- Row 2: drawn=1\n- Row 3: drawn=1\n- Row 4: drawn=2\n- Row 5: drawn=0\n- Row 6: drawn=1\n- Row 7: drawn=0\n\nSo, how many times did a draw occur? Rows where \"drawn\" is non-zero are rows 2,3,4,6. That's four draws in total. Now, does any row have more than 2 draws? The maximum \"drawn\" value here is 2 (in row 4). So that part seems to hold.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"never more than 2 game draw.\" So as long as no single game had more than 2 draws, which isn't relevant since each game can only have a certain number of draws. The count is per game, not per overall. So maybe I'm misinterpreting. It could mean that there are never more than 2 draws in any individual game. Looking at the table, all \"drawn\" values are 0,1, or 2. None exceed 2, so that's correct.\n\nBut going back to the first part about the number of games: the claim says only 7 games, but the table shows 8 games (rows from 0 to 7). So this is a conflict. Therefore, the overall claim is false because it misstates the total number of games as 7 instead of 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the \"games\" column. Each row has a value in the \"games\" column which is 7 for all. Maybe that's indicating something else, like each game has certain aspects, but the actual count of games is 8 based on the data structure. So if the claim says only 7 games exist, but there are 8, then it's false.\n\nSo combining both points: since the number of games is incorrect (8 instead of 7), the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that there are only 7 games when in fact there are 8. While the number of draws and their count per game are accurate, the discrepancy in the total number of games makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me break it down. It looks like the claim is making two separate statements.\n\n1. When there are 10 points and a point difference of \"41 - 07\", the game should be 7.\n2. When there are 10 points and a point difference of \"26 - 16\", the game should be 6.\n\nSo, I need to check each of these two conditions against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. Each row represents a different game with certain stats.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows where the points are 10 because both parts of the claim mention 10 points.\n\nScanning through the data:\n\n- Row 0: points =14\n- Row1: points=10\n- Row2: points=9\n- Row3: points=9\n- Row4: points=7\n- Row5: points=4\n- Row6: points=3\n- Row7: points=0\n\nSo, only row 1 has exactly 10 points. Let's check what the other columns say for this row.\n\nRow1:\ngames =7,\ndrawn=0,\nlost=2,\npoints difference=\"26 -16\",\npoints=10.\n\nNow, let's look at each part of the claim against this row.\n\nFirst condition: When there are 10 points and a point difference of \"41 -07\", is the game equal to 7?\n\nLooking at row1, the points difference is \"26-16\", not \"41-07\". So, in this case, when points are 10, the difference is \"26-16\", not \"41-07\".\n\nSecond condition: When there are 10 points and a point difference of \"26 -16\", is the game equal to 6?\n\nAgain, in row1, games=7. So, if the condition is that when there's 10 points and a difference of \"26-16\", the game should be 6. But in reality, it's 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any other rows have points=10 and either \"41-07\" or \"26-16\" as their point difference.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\nOnly row1 has points=10, but its difference is \"26-16\". No other rows have points=10. So, there's no case where points are 10 with a difference of \"41-07\".\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true because:\n\n1. There is no game with 10 points and a difference of \"41-07\".\n2. In the only row with 10 points (difference \"26-16\"), the games column shows 7, not 6.\n\nSo, the claim's two conditions are not met by any row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is making two assertions that don't hold true based on the data provided.\n\n1. **First assertion**: When there are 10 points and a point difference of \"41 -07\", the game should be 7.\n   - No rows have both 10 points and a difference of \"41-07\".\n   \n2. **Second assertion**: When there are 10 points and a point difference of \"26 -16\", the game should be 6.\n   - The only row with 10 points has \"26-16\" as the difference but shows 7 games, not 6.\n\nBoth conditions fail, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at what the claim states: \"there be 10 points on 2 occasions and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\" So, there are two main parts to this claim. \n\nStarting with the first part: \"10 points on 2 occasions.\" I need to check if there are any rows in the table where the 'points' column equals 10. The 'points' data is listed as [14, 10, 9, 9, 7, 4, 3, 0]. Scanning through these values, I see that only one occurrence of 10 exists (in the second row). That means there's only one occasion where points are 10, not two. So this part of the claim doesn't hold true.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \"point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\" I need to check if both these differences exist in the table. The 'points difference' column has values like \"41 - 07\", \"26 - 16\", \"30 - 15\", \"26 - 21\", etc. Looking through these, both \"30 - 15\" (third row) and \"26 - 21\" (fourth row) are present. So this part of the claim is correct.\n\nSince the first part of the claim fails but the second part is accurate, overall the claim isn't fully supported. However, the user instructions specify that if the claim is fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. Therefore, since one part doesn't hold, the entire claim should be considered FALSE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. For each row and column that supports the claim, I have to list them. \n\nLooking at the 'points' column first: we're interested in rows where points are 10. That's only the second row (index 1). For the differences \"30 - 15\" and \"26 - 21,\" these occur in rows 2 (third row) and 3 (fourth row), respectively.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The 'points' column: row indexes are from 0 to 7. In row index 1, points are 10. For the differences, \"30 - 15\" is in row index 2, and \"26 - 21\" is in row index 3.\n\nSo, relevant cells would be:\n- Row 1 (second entry), column 'points' because it has 10.\n- Row 2 (third entry), column 'points difference' for \"30 - 15\".\n- Row 3 (fourth entry), same column for \"26 - 21\".\n\nWait, but the claim says two occasions where points are 10. But in reality, there's only one such occurrence. So I need to include that as well.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells should include row 1, column 'points' and rows 2 and 3, column 'points difference'.\n\nPutting it all together, even though part of the claim is correct, because the first part isn't fully supported, the entire answer is FALSE. The relevant cells are the ones where points are 10 and the specific differences mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes two parts: one about having 10 points on two occasions and another about specific point differences. Checking the table shows only one row with 10 points and both required differences present. Since the first part fails, the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5.\" Hmm, that seems a bit unclear at first glance. Maybe it means that when the points (under the 'points' column) are zero, then the number of drawn games should be three and lost games five.\n\nLooking at the table structure: There's a columns array with \"games,\" \"drawn,\" \"lost,\" \"points difference,\" and \"points.\" The data has several rows, each representing different game statistics. So for each row, I can check the 'points' value and then see how many drawn and lost games there are.\n\nFirst, let me go through each row to find where the points column is zero. Scanning each row:\n\n1. Row 0: points =14 \u2192 Not zero.\n2. Row1: points=10 \u2192 No.\n3. Row2: points=9\u2192Nope.\n4. Row3: points=9\u2192No.\n5. Row4: points=7\u2192No.\n6. Row5: points=4\u2192No.\n7. Row6: points=3\u2192No.\n8. Row7: points=0 \u2192 Yes, this is the only row where points are zero.\n\nNow, for row 7, let's check the 'drawn' and 'lost' columns. The 'drawn' column here is 0 and 'lost' is 7. So drawn is 0 and lost is 7, but the claim says when points=0, drawn should be 3 and lost should be 5.\n\nSince in reality, for the only row where points are zero (row7), drawn is 0 and lost is7, which doesn't match the claim's assertion of drawn=3 and lost=5. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"when the point be 0...\" so perhaps it's referring to multiple rows where points are zero? But looking at the table, only row7 has points=0. So that's the only one we need to check.\n\nTherefore, since in that row, drawn is 0 and lost is7, not 3 and5, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support my answer.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7.\" So, this means two things. First, that the number of draws in any game is not more than 3, and second, that the number of losses does not exceed 7 in any game.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a game with data on games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. The columns relevant to the claim are \"drawn\" and \"lost.\"\n\nFor the \"drawn\" column, each entry should be checked to ensure none exceed 3. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: 0 draws \u2013 okay.\n2. Row 1: 0 draws \u2013 okay.\n3. Row 2: 1 draw \u2013 okay.\n4. Row 3: 1 draw \u2013 okay.\n5. Row 4: 1 draw \u2013 okay.\n6. Row 5: 0 draws \u2013 okay.\n7. Row 6: 1 draw \u2013 okay.\n8. Row 7: 0 draws \u2013 okay.\n\nSo, all drawn counts are 0 or 1, which is well within the limit of no more than 3. Therefore, the first part of the claim holds true based on these cells.\n\nNext, checking the \"lost\" column to ensure none exceed 7:\n\nLooking at each row's lost count:\n\n1. Row 0: 0 losses \u2013 okay.\n2. Row 1: 2 losses \u2013 okay.\n3. Row 2: 2 losses \u2013 okay.\n4. Row 3: 2 losses \u2013 okay.\n5. Row 4: 3 losses \u2013 okay.\n6. Row 5: 5 losses \u2013 wait, that's more than 7? No, 5 is less than 7. So still within limit.\n7. Row 6: 5 losses \u2013 same as above.\n8. Row 7: 7 losses \u2013 exactly 7, which is the limit. The claim says \"no loss more than 7,\" so 7 is allowed.\n\nSo all lost counts are within the stated limit of not exceeding 7.
