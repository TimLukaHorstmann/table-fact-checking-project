    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim is: \"hale irwin be the player with a total of wd.\"\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. It has columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par.\n\nThe data rows each represent a different player and their statistics. I need to find Hale Irwin in this table.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n1. The first row is Ernie Els.\n2. Second is Fuzzy Zoeller.\n3. Third is Curtis Strange.\n4. Fourth is Jack Nicklaus.\n5. Fifth is Steve Jones.\n6. Sixth is Hale Irwin.\n\nSo, Hale Irwin is in the 6th row (row_index 5). Now, I need to check his total and to par values.\n\nLooking at his row: \"hale irwin\", \"united states\", \"1974 , 1979 , 1990\", \"wd\", \"wd\".\n\nThe 'total' column has a value of \"wd\" for Hale Irwin. The claim says \"a total of wd,\" which matches this. So the total part is correct.\n\nNow, does the term \"player with a total of wd\" imply that other players have totals listed numerically? For example, Ernie Els has 148 and +8, Fuzzy Zoeller has 151 and +11, Curtis Strange has 152 and +12, Jack Nicklaus has 153 and +13, Steve Jones has 154 and +14. So all of these have numerical totals.\n\nHale Irwin's total is \"wd,\" which might not be a number but an abbreviation. I'm not sure if \"wd\" stands for something specific, like withdrawal or maybe it's a typo. But in the context of golf scores, \"WD\" can sometimes refer to a score of 2 under par (which would be +2). However, that might vary.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"total of wd,\" so as per the table, Hale Irwin does have a total of \"wd.\" Therefore, the statement is supported by the data. But I'm unsure if this is sufficient because \"wd\" isn't a number. The other players have numerical totals with plus signs indicating under par.\n\nWait, but in the table, for example, Ernie Els has \"+ 8,\" which implies that his total is 148 and he was 8 under par. So the 'to par' column might be separate. So perhaps the 'total' refers to points or score, while 'to par' is another metric.\n\nLooking back at Hale Irwin's row: \"wd\" in both total and to par columns. That suggests that his performance in those years resulted in a withdrawal or some other outcome where he didn't complete the tournament, hence no numerical score.\n\nSo, if the claim says that Hale Irwin has a total of \"wd,\" and according to the table, yes, that's correct. So the statement is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: We need all the columns that support this claim. The player in question is Hale Irwin, so we look at his row. Columns involved are 'player' (to identify who it is), 'total' (to check the value \"wd\"), and maybe 'to par' since both have \"wd.\" However, the 'to par' might just be a separate piece of information.\n\nSo relevant cells would include:\n\n- The row where player is Hale Irwin (row_index 5).\n- The 'total' column for that row.\n- The 'to par' column for that row, as it also has \"wd.\"\n\nThus, the relevant_cells list should include these three.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par. I'll search for Steve Jones in the 'player' column.\n\nIn the table, there's only one Steve Jones entry. His row is the sixth one (since it's zero-indexed, row_index 5). Now, check his totals: under 'total', it says \"154,\" which matches the claim's total of 154. That's good.\n\nNext, check the 'to par' column for Steve Jones. The table shows \"+14\" here as well, which aligns perfectly with the claim's \"+14.\" So both numbers match.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or different values that would contradict the claim.

His country is listed as \"united states,\" which matches the claim's mention of \"the united state player.\" So that's a match there.\n\nNext, looking at his total points: according to the table, under the \"total\" column for Steve Jones, it says 154. That's exactly what the claim is stating. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any discrepancy or if the data might have changed. Wait, in the row for Steve Jones, the year(s) won are 1996, which is accurate. The total is indeed 154, and the \"to par\" is +14.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"hale irwin be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim. It says that Hale Irwin is from the United States. Now, I'll check the table to see what information is provided about Hale Irwin.\n\nLooking at the table data, there are multiple rows and columns. The columns relevant here would be \"player\" and \"country\". So for each player row, especially the one where the player is Hale Irwin, I need to check these two columns.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for Hale Irwin in the table. Scanning through the data:\n\n1. Ernie Els - South Africa\n2. Fuzzy Zoeller - United States\n3. Curtis Strange - United States\n4. Jack Nicklaus - United States\n5. Steve Jones - United States\n6. Hale Irwin - United States\n\nSo, Hale Irwin is indeed in row 5 (if we start counting from 0, it's index 5). Now, looking at the \"country\" column for this row, it says \"united states\". That matches the claim which states he's from the United States. There's no indication of any other country, so this should support the claim.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells. The columns we looked at are \"player\" and \"country\". So, for Hale Irwin, these would be:\n\n- Row index: 5 (since it's the sixth row in a zero-based list)\n- Column name: \"country\"\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, when counting rows, if the first data array is row 0, then Hale Irwin is at index 5. So, his row_index is 5 and column_name for country is \"country\".\n\nBut wait, in the table structure provided, the columns are listed as [\"player\", \"country\", ...], so each row has these columns in order. Therefore, for Hale Irwin's row, the relevant cells are \"player\" (Hale Irwin) and \"country\" (united states). But the claim only mentions his country, so maybe only the country cell is needed? Or both?\n\nWait, the instructions say that if fully supported, answer TRUE and list all relevant cells. So in this case, the claim is about his country, so the country column would be relevant. Also, perhaps the player column, but the claim didn't mention anything about him being a player from the US, just his origin.\n\nWait, no, the claim is specifically about his country, so only \"country\" is directly relevant. The \"player\" might not be necessary unless the claim was about something else related to the player's identity beyond country, but in this case, it's purely about his nationality.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index: 5\n- column_name: \"country\"\n\nBecause that's where his country is listed as United States, which supports the claim. The other columns like \"year(s) won\" and \"total\" are not needed here because they don't pertain to his nationality.\n\nI think that's it. So, since the data shows Hale Irwin is from the United States, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is the country column for row 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the information in the table where Hale Irwin is listed as being from the United States.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Steve Jones is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Steve Jones be a player from the United State with a total score of 154.\" So, I need to check if Steve Jones exists in the table, his country is the United States, and his total score is 154.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par. The data rows are:\n\n1. Ernie Els - South Africa\n2. Fuzzy Zoeller - United States\n3. Curtis Strange - United States\n4. Jack Nicklaus - United States\n5. Steve Jones - United States\n6. Hale Irwin - United States\n\nSo, Steve Jones is indeed in the table as the fifth row (row_index 4). Now, checking his country: it's \"united states,\" which matches the claim.\n\nNext, looking at the total column for Steve Jones. In row 5, the data is [\"steve jones\", \"united states\", \"1996\", \"154\", \"+ 14\"]. So, the total score is 154, which exactly matches the claim.\n\nWait a minute, but I also notice that in the 'total' cell, it's written as just \"154,\" without any additional text like \"wd\" or other abbreviations. Steve Jones' row doesn't have any special notation there; his total is clearly 154.\n\nSo, all the conditions of the claim are met: he is from the United States and has a total score of 154. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The player column is Steve Jones at row 4 (0-indexed), so that's one cell. The country column also needs to match, which it does as \"united states.\" Then, the total column is where his score is, so all three columns: player, country, and total.\n\nWait, but looking back at the instructions, I think they want each relevant cell specified with their row index and column name. So for Steve Jones, that's row 4 (since it's zero-indexed, right? Because the first data row is index 0, so fifth row is 4). And columns are player, country, total.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- row_index 4, column_name \"player\"\n- row_index 4, column_name \"country\"\n- row_index 4, column_name \"total\"\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if the claim refers to 'player from the United States' and 'total score of 154.' So, the player's country is important because it's specified in the claim as the United States. So yes, both 'player' and 'country' columns for Steve Jones are relevant.\n\nAnd of course, the total column where his score is listed as 154 is also relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Steve Jones being a player from the United States with a total score of 154 is fully supported by the table. The relevant cells confirming these details are identified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"when fuzzy zoeller play for the united state , the par be + 11\". So, breaking it down, the player in question is Fuzzy Zoeller, he's from the United States, and the par should be +11. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a JSON structure with columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par. The data has multiple rows, each corresponding to different players and their stats.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant row for Fuzzy Zoeller. Scanning through the data:\n\n1. First row: Ernie Els from South Africa, 1994 & 1997, total 148, +8.\n2. Second row: Fuzzy Zoeller, United States, 1984, total 151, +11.\n3. Third row: Curtis Strange, USA, 1988-1989, total 152, +12.\n4. Fourth row: Jack Nicklaus, USA, multiple years, total 153, +13.\n5. Fifth row: Steve Jones, USA, 1996, total 154, +14.\n6. Sixth row: Hale Irwin, USA, 1974, 1979, 1990, WD (which might mean withdrawal or did not finish), and the par is also WD.\n\nSo, Fuzzy Zoeller's data is in the second row. Now, I need to check the \"to par\" column for that row. According to the table, it says \"+11\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim states \"when fuzzy zoeller play for the united state , the par be + 11\". So, player is Fuzzy Zoeller, country is USA, and par is +11. Yes, that's all in the second row.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because all the conditions mentioned are satisfied by Fuzzy Zoeller's data in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I located Fuzzy Zoeller's row in the table and checked the \"to par\" value, which is indeed +11.

The claim says: \"the total for Hale Irwin be listed as wd in year(s) won in 1996.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par. Each row represents a different player.\n\nI need to focus on the player \"Hale Irwin\" and see if there's any information related to the years 1996 in his record, specifically looking at the total score and whether it's marked as 'wd'.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n- The first few rows don't mention Hale Irwin.\n- Then I find the row for Hale Irwin. Let me check that row.\n\nIn the fifth data row, the player is \"Hale Irwin.\" His country is the United States. The years won are listed as \"1974 , 1979 , 1990\". Wait, the claim mentions 1996. Hmm, that's confusing because in the table, Hale Irwin didn't win in 1996; he last won in 1990.\n\nBut the claim says \"year(s) won in 1996.\" So maybe there's a mistake here. The total for Hale Irwin is listed as \"wd,\" which stands for 'width of green,' indicating he withdrew or didn't finish the tournament, right? So the total would be 'wd' and not a numerical value.\n\nNow, the claim specifically mentions the total for Hale Irwin in 1996 should be 'wd.' But looking at the table, under \"year(s) won,\" it shows his years as 1974, 1979, 1990. There's no mention of 1996, and his total is 'wd' regardless.\n\nWait, but the claim might be mixing up the year. Maybe the user intended to say that in some other year, like perhaps 1996 isn't part of his wins. So let me check: does Hale Irwin have a win in 1996? From what I know, Hale Irwin's most recent win was in 1990. He didn't win again later on, so the claim seems incorrect because he never won in 1996.\n\nBut focusing just on the table data provided, the row for Hale Irwin doesn't mention 1996 as a year won. The years listed are 1974, 1979, and 1990. So the claim's assertion that he won in 1996 is false. Therefore, even if the total was 'wd' in another context, the specific year mentioned in the claim isn't accurate.\n\nNow, to check the relevant cells: we need to identify which cells are checked when verifying this claim. The columns involved would be \"player,\" \"year(s) won,\" \"total,\" and maybe \"to par.\"\n\nFor Hale Irwin, I'll look at his row. So row index is 5 (since it's zero-indexed). The relevant columns are:\n\n- \"player\": to confirm the player.\n- \"year(s) won\": to check if 1996 is listed.\n- \"total\": to see if it's 'wd' in that specific year, but since 1996 isn't a winning year for him, maybe this isn't directly relevant unless the claim implies he participated in 1996 and withdrew, leading to 'wd'. So perhaps both \"year(s) won\" and \"total\" are relevant.\n\nWait, actually, the claim specifically refers to the total in the context of the year 1996. But since Hale Irwin didn't win in 1996, maybe the cell for \"to par\" is also considered because if he withdrew, 'wd' might be under that column as well. Looking at the table, the row for Hale Irwin has both \"total\" and \"to par\" as 'wd.' So perhaps both columns are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include the row for Hale Irwin, specifically checking \"year(s) won,\" \"total,\" and \"to par.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The claim is incorrect because Hale Irwin didn't win in 1996. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Hale Irwin did not win in 1996; his last win was in 1990.

So I need to check if Steve Jones has a total that exceeds 154 in any of his victories.\n\nLooking at the 'total' column for Steve Jones, the value is 154. Now, does this mean that in all his wins, he scored exactly 154? Or does it represent the best score across his career?\n\nI think each row represents a specific year or years in which the player won, and their total might refer to the sum of points or perhaps the highest score. But I'm not entirely sure about the context here. Let me assume that 'total' is the score achieved by the player.\n\nIf Steve Jones has a total of 154, does this mean it's more than 154? No, because 154 is equal to 154, not greater. So if the claim says \"more than 154,\" then Steve Jones doesn't have a higher score than that in his wins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'total' refers to the sum of all his scores across years. If that's the case, and his total is 154, then again, it's equal, not more than. So the claim would be false because there's no entry where Steve Jones has a total exceeding 154.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row seems to represent a specific win or multiple wins in a year. For example, Ernie Els won in 1994 and 1997 with a total of 148. Similarly, Steve Jones only appears once with a total of 154.\n\nSo for Steve Jones, he has a single entry with a total of 154. The claim says when the total is more than 154, it's him. But since his total isn't exceeding 154, the claim would be false.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check which cells are relevant. The 'player' column is definitely relevant because we're looking for Steve Jones. The 'total' column is also relevant because it directly relates to the claim. So the relevant_cells should include row_index 4 (since Steve is fifth, index starts at 0) and both the 'player' and 'total' columns.\n\nWait, no, in the example provided, each relevant cell includes a row_index and column_name. For Steve Jones, he's in row 4, so the row_index would be 4. The columns are 'player' and 'total'. So I need to include both of these as relevant cells because they directly pertain to verifying the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because Steve Jones doesn't have a total exceeding 154 in his wins. And the relevant cells are row 4 for player and total.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Steve Jones' total score is exactly 154, not more than 154.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"steve jones be the player when the country be united state and the total be less than 154.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three specific conditions:\n1. The player must be Steve Jones.\n2. The country must be the United States.\n3. The total should be less than 154.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par. Each row in the data corresponds to a different player with their respective details.\n\nStarting with the first condition: The player must be Steve Jones. I'll scan through each row's player column to find Steve Jones. In the data provided, there is a row where the player is \"steve jones\". However, I notice that the spelling is \"steve\" without an apostrophe, which might be a typo. But since the claim says \"Steve Jones\", I'll look for it as is.\n\nNext, checking the country column. The claim specifies the country should be the United States. Looking at each row:\n- Row 0: South Africa\n- Row 1: United States\n- Row 2: United States\n- Row 3: United States\n- Row 4: United States\n- Row 5: United States\n\nSo, Steve Jones is only in one row where the country is indeed the United States.\n\nNow, the third condition: total less than 154. The total column for each row has numbers or 'wd' (which I assume stands for withdrawal). For Steve Jones, his row is the fifth one:\n[\n  \"steve jones\",\n  \"united states\",\n  \"1996\",\n  \"154\",\n  \"+ 14\"\n]\n\nHere, the total is 154. The claim says the total should be less than 154, but it's exactly 154. Now, I need to interpret whether 154 is considered less than 154. Typically, 'less than' means strictly less, not equal. So 154 is not less than 154; it's equal.\n\nPutting this all together: Steve Jones is in the table with the United States as his country, but the total he achieved is exactly 154, not less than that. Therefore, the third condition of the claim isn't fully supported because the total is not less than 154.\n\nHowever, let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any other Steve Jones entries or misinterpret the data. The only Steve Jones entry is in row 4 with a total of 154. There's no other player named Steve Jones in the table, and no other rows for Steve Jones with a lower total.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, the claim is FALSE because the total is not less than 154; it's equal to 154.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Steve Jones has a total less than 154. However, the table shows his total as exactly 154. Since 154 is not less than itself, the condition isn't met.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Steve Jones win in multiple year with a 154 total\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Steve Jones won multiple years and his total was 154. So I need to check two things: whether Steve Jones has won more than one year and if his total score is exactly 154.\n\nLooking at the table provided, the columns are player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par. The data rows have information about different golf players and their achievements.\n\nI should start by locating Steve Jones in the table. Scanning through the \"player\" column, I see Steve Jones is listed as one of the entries. Specifically, it's the fifth row from the top (row_index 5). \n\nNow, looking at his data: his total is 154. The claim mentions a total of 154, so that part checks out. But what about the number of years he won? In the table, under \"year(s) won,\" Steve Jones has \"1996\" listed. That's only one year. Wait, but the claim says \"win in multiple years.\" Hmm, does \"multiple\" mean two or more?\n\nSo, if Steve Jones only won once in 1996, then the part about winning multiple years isn't accurate. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should check other players to see if there's another Steve Jones entry, but looking at the table, it seems like each player is listed once. So no, Steve Jones only has one year in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Steve Jones won multiple years isn't correct because he only won once. However, his total score of 154 is accurate. The claim might be trying to say both things at once: multiple wins and a specific total. Since the first part is false, the overall claim should be considered false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Steve Jones win in multiple year with a 154 total,\" we need to check two aspects:\n\n1. **Multiple Wins**: Steve Jones only has one year listed (1996) in the table.\n2. **Total Score**: His total is correctly stated as 154.\n\nSince he didn't win multiple years, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the united state be the country when to par be + 11 when the total be more than 151.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. It mentions three conditions:\n\n1. The country must be the United States.\n2. To par should be +11.\n3. Total should be more than 151.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table and check if any row meets all three conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Player: Ernie Els\n- Country: South Africa\nSo, not the United States. So this doesn't fit condition 1.\n\nSecond row:\n- Player: Fuzzy Zoeller\n- Country: United States\n- Total: 151\n- To par: +11\n\nWait, total is exactly 151, but the claim says \"more than 151.\" Is 151 considered more? Hmm, in golf scoring, \"total\" could refer to the score, which can't be more than a certain number. But let's see the data. The second row has total as 151 and to par as +11. So condition 2 is met (to par +11), but condition 3 is whether total is more than 151. Since it's exactly 151, does that count? Maybe not, because \"more than\" implies greater than 151, not equal.\n\nThird row:\n- Player: Curtis Strange\n- Country: United States\n- Total: 152\n- To par: +12\n\nHere, country is correct, but to par is +12, which doesn't match the claim's +11. So condition 2 fails.\n\nFourth row:\n- Player: Jack Nicklaus\n- Country: United States\n- Total: 153\n- To par: +13\n\nAgain, country is correct, but to par is +13, not +11. Condition 2 fails.\n\nFifth row:\n- Player: Steve Jones\n- Country: United States\n- Total: 154\n- To par: +14\n\nSame issue as above; condition 2 isn't met.\n\nSixth row:\n- Player: Hale Irwin\n- Country: United States\n- Total: WD (probably means he didn't finish, so the total is not applicable)\n- To par: WD\n\nThis doesn't fit because to par and total are both WD. So conditions aren't met.\n\nSo going through each row, only the second row meets country being United States. But in that row, total is 151, which is exactly 151, not more than 151. The claim says \"more than 151,\" so it's looking for totals over 151. Since 151 isn't more than itself, condition 3 fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"total\" refers to something else, like total rounds or points, but in golf, often \"total score\" is what's meant. So 151 is not more than 151.\n\nTherefore, no row meets all three conditions: country is United States, to par +11, and total over 151. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Steve Jones be the only player from the United States and the only play with a total of 154.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim to verify it against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"the only player from the United States.\" Looking at the table, Steve Jones is listed as being from the United States.

Let's check all rows:\n\n- Ernie Els: South Africa\n- Fuzzy Zoeller: United States\n- Curtis Strange: United States\n- Jack Nicklaus: United States\n- Steve Jones: United States\n- Hale Irwin: United States\n\nSo, Steve Jones isn't alone; there are several other US players. That means the first part of the claim is false because he's not the only one from the US.\n\nNow, the second part: \"the only play with a total of 154.\" Looking at Steve Jones' row, the total is 154. Are there any other players with a total of 154? Checking all rows:\n\n- Ernie Els: Total 148\n- Fuzzy Zoeller: Total 151\n- Curtis Strange: Total 152\n- Jack Nicklaus: Total 153\n- Steve Jones: Total 154\n- Hale Irwin: WD\n\nSo, only Steve Jones has a total of 154. That part seems true.\n\nPutting it together, the claim is incorrect because while he's the only one with 154, he's not the only US player.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"hale irwin be the only player from the united state to win multiple year.\" Hmm, it seems a bit unclear. I think the intended meaning is that Hale Irwin is the only player from the United States who has won multiple years. So, I need to check if there are any other players from the US with multiple wins.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player and their achievements. The relevant columns here would be \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"year(s) won.\" Since the claim is about United States players, I should focus on rows where the country is United States.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Ernie Els: South Africa \u2013 not US, so irrelevant.\n2. Fuzzy Zoeller: US \u2013 let's check his years. It says 1984. So only one year won. Not multiple.\n3. Curtis Strange: US \u2013 years are 1988 and 1989. That's two years. So he has multiple wins.\n4. Jack Nicklaus: US \u2013 years listed include 1962, 1967, 1972, 1980. That's four separate years, so definitely multiple.\n5. Steve Jones: US \u2013 1996 only, so one year.\n6. Hale Irwin: US \u2013 years are 1974, 1979, 1990. Three years, which is multiple.\n\nSo, the claim says that Hale Irwin is the only player from the US to win multiple years. But looking at the table, both Curtis Strange and Jack Nicklaus have won multiple years as well. Therefore, the claim is false because there are other players (Strange and Nicklaus) who also have multiple wins.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: the columns needed are \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"year(s) won.\" For each player from the US with multiple wins, I need their row indices and column names. So:\n\n- Curtis Strange is in row 2 (index 2). Columns checked: \"year(s) won\" to see how many years he has.\n- Jack Nicklaus is in row 3 (index 3). Similarly, check \"year(s) won.\"\n- Hale Irwin is in row 5 (index 5). Check same columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include these three players' details. Each entry includes their row index and the column name. Since the claim is false, I'll list all three as they are part of the evidence against the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
