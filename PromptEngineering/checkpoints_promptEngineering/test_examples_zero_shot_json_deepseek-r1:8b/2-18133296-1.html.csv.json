    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"government 31 have the kadima party\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"government 31\" likely refers to a specific government led by individual number 31 in the table. Each row in the table seems to represent a different government or leader, with their name, party, and other details like term start and end dates.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, they include: minister, party, governments, term start, and term end. So each row represents a particular minister (or leader) along with their associated government number, their party affiliation, the number of governments under them, and the duration of their term.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: \"government 31 have the kadima party.\" I need to find if there's any row where the \"governments\" column equals 31 and the \"party\" is \"kadima.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for a government number of 31. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Governments = P, which probably isn't 31.\n- Row 1: 7,8,... up to 12. Not 31.\n- ... Similarly, rows continue until I see a \"governments\" value of 31.\n\nLooking further down, I find that in row 18 (index 18), the government number is 31. The data for this row is:\n[\n  \"tzipi livni\",\n  \"kadima\",\n  \"31\",\n  \"18 january 2006\",\n  \"1 april 2009\"\n]\n\nSo, this row shows that government 31 is associated with the Kadima party. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by this data.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows with government number 31 and kadima party. Scanning further, the next row after 18 is index 19: avigdor lieberman, which has government number 32. Then index 20 is Benjamin Netanyahu with 32,33. Index 21 is Silvan Shalom with 30, not 31. So only row 18 (index 18) has government 31 and party kadima.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because government 31, as per row 18, is indeed associated with the Kadima party.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"party\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"government 31 start before 18 January 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"government 31 start before 18 January 2006.\" From the context of the table, each row represents a government and its details. The columns include \"governments\" which seems to be an identifier for each government. For example, row 0 has \"p , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7\" under the \"governments\" column, which I think might correspond to their term numbers or something similar.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, they are: minister, party, governments, term start, term end. So the \"term start\" and \"term end\" columns would be relevant here since the claim is about when a government started relative to a specific date.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"government 31.\" I need to find which row in the table corresponds to government number 31. Scanning through the rows, let me look for where the \"governments\" column has \"31.\"\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: \"p , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7\"\n- ...\n- Row 30: \"kadima\", ... , \"31\"\n\nWait, actually, looking at row 30 (index 30), the governments column is \"31\". So that's government 31.\n\nNow, I need to check when this government started. The \"term start\" for government 31 is in the data of row 30. Looking at the term start date for row 30: it's \"18 January 2006.\"\n\nSo, the claim says \"government 31 starts before 18 January 2006.\" But according to the table, government 31 started on 18 January 2006, not before.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because government 31 didn't start before that date; it started exactly on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that government 31 began before 18 January 2006. Checking row 30 in the table shows that government 31 started on 18 January 2006, not before.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
