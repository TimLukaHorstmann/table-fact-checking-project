    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"ken rosewall and brian fairlie be both from australia\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that both Ken Rosewall and Brian Fairlie are from Australia. To verify this, I need to check their respective rows in the table to see where they are listed as being from.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like \"name,\" \"country,\" etc. The data is a list of players with various statistics.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Name is Ken Rosewall, country is aus (Australia). So that's correct for him.\n2. **Row 5**: Name is Brian Fairlie, country is aus (Australia). That also matches.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that both these players are indeed from Australia as per the table. Since their country columns are 'aus', which stands for Australia, the claim seems to be true based on the data provided.\n\nNext, I have to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim. For each player who is from Australia, I need to note their row index and the corresponding column name. \n\n- Ken Rosewall is at row 0 under the \"country\" column.\n- Brian Fairlie is at row 5 under the same \"country\" column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where both players' countries are listed as 'aus'. Therefore, these two specific cells back up the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that both Ken Rosewall and Brian Fairlie are from Australia is supported by their respective entries in the table. Both have their country listed as 'aus', confirming their origin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"roscoe tanner be the ninth rank tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: rk (which likely stands for ranking), name, country, matches played, matches won, points, and prize money in USD. The data rows include various tennis players with their corresponding statistics.\n\nThe claim is about Roscoe Tanner being the ninth-ranked tennis player in 1973. So I need to find if there's a row in the table where the \"name\" is \"roscoe tanner\" and the \"rk\" is 9 for that year. However, looking at the table, all rows seem to be from different years because each has different \"matches played\", \"matches won\", etc. For example, Ken Rosewall's matches are 42, which might indicate a later career year.\n\nWait, actually, the table doesn't specify the year for each row. So I need to check if there is a row where the name is Roscoe Tanner and the rank (rk) is 9. Looking through the data:\n\nRow 0: Ken Rosewall\nRow 1: Arthur Ashe\nRow 2: Marty Riessen\nRow 3: Roger Taylor\nRow 4: Mark Cox\nRow 5: Brian Fairlie\nRow 6: Jan Kode\u0161\nRow 7: Tom Okker\nRow 8: Roscoe Tanner\n\nWait, row 8 has the name \"roscoe tanner\" (lowercase). Let me check the data again. The last row in the data is:\n\n[\n  [\n    9,\n    \"roscoe tanner\",\n    \"usa\",\n    27,\n    16,\n    24,\n    25250\n  ]\n]\n\nSo this row has rk=9, name=\"roscoe tanner\". Therefore, according to the table, Roscoe Tanner was ranked 9th in 1973.\n\nBut wait, I should confirm if this corresponds correctly. The claim says \"the ninth rank tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit.\" So yes, based on the table, he is indeed ranked 9th that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be row_index=8 and column_name=\"rk\" because those two pieces of information confirm his rank.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where Roscoe Tanner is listed as rank 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ken Rosewell winning more prize money than Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner combined is true or false. Let me start by looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll identify who each person is in the data. The relevant rows are where \"name\" matches \"ken rosewall\" (though I notice a typo in the name; it's probably \"Rosewell,\" but maybe that's intentional). Then, Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner are also in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns, the prize money is given as \"prize money (usd)\". So I need to extract this number for each person mentioned in the claim.\n\nFor Ken Rosewall: His row is the first one with name \"ken rosewell.\" The prize money there is 66400 USD.\n\nTom Okker's row is where name is \"tom okker,\" and his prize money is 34400 USD. Roscoe Tanner's row has name \"roscoe tanner\" with a prize money of 25250 USD.\n\nWait, but the claim says Ken wins more than Tom and Roscoe combined. So I need to add their prize moneys together first.\n\nTom Okker: $34,400\nRoscoe Tanner: $25,250\nCombined, that's 34400 + 25250 = 59,650 USD.\n\nKen Rosewall has 66,400, which is higher than 59,650. So the claim seems true on the surface.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other rows for Tom or Roscoe. Looking back, each name appears once except for \"roger taylor\" and \"mark cox,\" but those are separate people. So only one row each for Tom and Roscoe.\n\nTherefore, adding their prize moneys gives us 59,650, which is less than Ken's 66,400.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are: rk, name, country, matches played, matches won, points, prize money (usd). The data has multiple rows, each representing a person's statistics.\n\nThe claim mentions two people: Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen. So, I need to find their corresponding rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the first row of data:\n1,\n\"ken rosewall\",\n\"aus\",\n42,\n34,\n53,\n66400\n\nThis is Ken Rosewall, not Arthur Ashe or Marty Riessen, so probably not relevant for this claim.\n\nNext, row 2:\n2,\n\"arthur ashe\",\n\"usa\",\n36,\n26,\n41,\n63150\n\nHere we have Arthur Ashe. His matches won are 26. So that's one part of the claim checked out.\n\nNow, moving to row 3:\n3,\n\"marty riessen\",\n\"usa\",\n36,\n26,\n35,\n47200\n\nWait, Marty Riessen also has 26 matches won. That seems to support the claim. So both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen have 26 wins each.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are any other relevant rows. Let me scan through the rest:\n\nRow 4: Roger Taylor with 21 wins - not relevant.\nRow 5: Mark Cox also has 23 wins - doesn't match.\nRow 6: Brian Fairlie has 22 wins - nope.\nRow 7: Jan Kode\u0161 with 19 wins - irrelevant.\nRow 8: Tom Okker at 19 wins - nope.\nRow 9: Roscoe Tanner with 16 wins - doesn't fit.\n\nSo only rows 2 and 3 have 26 matches won.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two people: Roger Taylor and Mark Cox. I should find their entries in the table. Looking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 4 has \"roger taylor\" with columns: rk=4, name=\"roger taylor\", country=\"gbr\".\n- Then, looking for Mark Cox, I see that row 5 also has \"mark cox\" but his rk is listed as 4. Wait, no, the second data entry is [2, \"arthur ashe\"...], then the fourth is roger taylor at position 4, and then in row 5, it's mark cox at position 4 again? Or wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking back: The table has a list of rows, each starting with a number which seems to be their ranking. So for example:\n\nRow 0: rank=1, name=Ken Rosewall\nRow 1: rank=2, Arthur Ashe\nRow 2: rank=3, Marty Riessen\nRow 3: rank=4, Roger Taylor\nRow 4: rank=4, Mark Cox\nSo both Roger Taylor and Mark Cox are at rank 4. But the claim says they \"tie for fourth place,\" which implies they are tied in their position.\n\nNext, I need to check if their points or matches won tie them together. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about their placement, not just points. So it's more about their ranking positions.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row has an 'rk' column that represents their ranking. Roger Taylor is at rank 4 (row 3), and Mark Cox is also at rank 4 (row 4). So they are tied for fourth place because both have the same rk value of 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct in stating that they tie for fourth place.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is fully supported by the table. The relevant columns would be 'rk' since that directly shows their ranking.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones with 'rk' column where both Roger Taylor and Mark Cox have rank 4.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Roger Taylor is in row 3, so row_index=3.\n- Mark Cox is in row 4, so row_index=4.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be these two entries for the 'rk' column.\n\nI should make sure that the claim doesn't imply anything else, like their points being equal or something.

First, I'll break down the claim into its components.\n\nThe claim mentions Roscoe Tanner being the first-ranked tennis player in 1973. So, I need to find information about Roscoe Tanner in the table and check if he was indeed number one that year.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: rk (which likely stands for ranking), name, country, matches played, etc. The data rows have different names, countries, and their corresponding statistics.\n\nI'll scan through each row's \"name\" column to find Roscoe Tanner. Let me go through each entry:\n\n1. Ken Rosewall - not Roscoe.\n2. Arthur Ashe - nope.\n3. Marty Riessen - no.\n4. Roger Taylor - no.\n5. Mark Cox - no.\n6. Brian Fairlie - no.\n7. Jan Kodes - different last name, I think it's Kodes, not Tanner.\n8. Tom Okker - no.\n9. Roscoe Tanner - yes, that's him. His row is the 9th one.\n\nNow, looking at his row, what's his ranking? The \"rk\" column for that row is 9. So in this table, Roscoe Tanner is ranked 9th, not number 1. That seems to contradict the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me check each entry again. In the data, the first column is \"rk\", so for example, Ken Rosewall has rk=1, Arthur Ashe has rk=2, etc. Roscoe Tanner's row shows rk=9.\n\nSo according to this table, in 1973, Roscoe Tanner was ranked 9th, not first. That would make the claim FALSE because he wasn't number one that year.\n\nBut wait, could there be more than one person at rank 1? Let me check if any other player has rk=1 besides Ken Rosewall. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Ken Rosewall: rk=1\n- Arthur Ashe: rk=2\n- Marty Riessen: rk=3\n- Roger Taylor: rk=4\n- Mark Cox: rk=5\n- Brian Fairlie: rk=6\n- Jan Kodes: rk=7\n- Tom Okker: rk=8\n- Roscoe Tanner: rk=9\n\nOnly Ken Rosewall is ranked 1.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen both losing 26 matches each is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim: \"Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen both lose 26 match each.\" So, they each lost 26 matches. That means I need to check their respective records in the 'matches lost' column. Wait, but looking at the table columns provided: \"rk\", \"name\", \"country\", \"matches played\", \"matches won\", \"points\", \"prize money (usd)\". Hmm, I don't see a direct column for matches lost. So, how do I find that?\n\nWell, if 'matches played' and 'matches won' are available, then matches lost can be calculated by subtracting the number of matches won from the total matches played because each match has one winner and one loser (assuming no draws or ties in tennis). So for each player, matches lost = matches played - matches won.\n\nLet me check Arthur Ashe first. Looking at the table data:\n\n- Arthur Ashe is row index 1.\n- His \"matches played\" is 36.\n- He \"won\" 26 matches.\nSo, matches lost would be 36 (played) minus 26 (won) which equals 10 matches lost. But the claim says he lost 26, so that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check: 36 played - 26 won = 10 lost. So Arthur Ashe didn't lose 26, but only 10. That already contradicts the claim, right?\n\nBut wait, let me check Marty Riessen as well to be thorough. Marty Riessen is row index 2.\n\n- Marty Riessen has \"matches played\" of 36.\n- He \"won\" 26 matches.\nSo again, 36 - 26 = 10 matches lost. So he also only lost 10, not 26. That means both of them have 10 losses each, which doesn't match the claim.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me look at all players' data to see if there's any other relevant info that might affect this. For example, is there a possibility that the 'matches lost' column isn't correctly calculated? Well, in the table provided, only \"matches played\" and \"matches won\" are listed, so matches lost would indeed be the difference between those two numbers.\n\nWait another thing: The claim says both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen lose 26 each. So for each of them, I need to verify if their 'matches lost' is 26. But as per the table, neither has that number. Both have 10 losses. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The claim mentions \"matches won\" because it's about how many they've lost. So for both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen, their \"matches won\" column data (which is 26) would be relevant. But since the actual matches lost are calculated from played and won, perhaps both \"matches played\" and \"matches won\" are relevant.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about losing 26 matches each. So to check that, we need 'matches lost' for each player, which is not a column here. Therefore, the only way to find matches lost is by calculating it from 'matches played' minus 'matches won'. Thus, the relevant cells would be \"matches played\" and \"matches won\" for both players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns related to matches are 'matches played' (which is 36 for both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen). But since the claim is about losses, we need to know how many they lost. Since that's not a column, we have to compute it from played and won.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Arthur Ashe:\n- row_index:1\n- columns: \"matches played\" (36) and \"matches won\" (26)\n\nFor Marty Riessen:\n- row_index:2\n- columns: \"matches played\" (36) and \"matches won\" (26)\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include these two players' data for both 'matches played' and 'matches won'.\n\nWait, but in the answer example, they had two entries. Here, we have four cells to check, so perhaps each player's two columns are relevant.\n\nBut let me structure this correctly.\n\nEach relevant cell is an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for Arthur Ashe (row 1), both \"matches played\" and \"matches won\" are relevant because they're needed to calculate his losses. Similarly for Marty Riessen (row 2), the same applies.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list would have four entries:\n\n- {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"matches played\"}\n- {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"matches won\"}\n- {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"matches played\"}\n- {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"matches won\"}\n\nWait, but is that necessary? Because the claim is about matches lost, which is derived from matches played and matches won. So to verify whether they each lost 26, we need their match counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only \"matches played\" and \"matches won\" are relevant because those are the direct data points needed to calculate losses.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So both players' rows have these two columns that are relevant for checking the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen losing 26 matches each, we need to check their \"matches played\" and \"matches won\" from the table because matches lost can be calculated by subtracting wins from total games played. Neither Arthur Ashe nor Marty Riessen have 26 losses; both have 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"matches played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"matches won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"matches played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"matches won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"ken rosewell lose more prize money than tom ekker and roscoe tanner combine.\" First, I need to understand what each part of this claim means.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various tennis players along with some statistics like matches played, matches won, points, and prize money. The player in question here is \"ken rosewell,\" but I notice a typo in the name; it's spelled as \"ken rosewall\" in the table. Maybe it's a typo, so I'll go with \"ken rosewall.\"\n\nNow, I need to check how much prize money each of these players received. The claim mentions two other players: tom ekker and roscoe tanner. Wait, the table has \"tom okker,\" not \"tom ekker.\" That might be another typo. So, it's probably referring to \"tom okker\" instead of \"tom ekker.\"\n\nSimilarly, for \"roscoe tanner,\" that matches exactly as it appears in the table: \"roscoe tanner.\" So, I'll proceed with these corrections.\n\nI need to find the prize money for each of these three players. Let's look at their respective rows:\n\n1. Ken Rosewall (row 0) has a prize money of 66400 USD.\n2. Tom Okker (row 8) has a prize money of 34400 USD.\n3. Roscoe Tanner (row 9) has a prize money of 25250 USD.\n\nThe claim is that Ken Rosewell loses more prize money than the combined total of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner. To test this, I need to calculate the sum of Tom Okker's and Roscoe Tanner's prize money.\n\nCalculating:\nTom Okker: $34,400\nRoscoe Tanner: $25,250\nCombined: 34400 + 25250 = 59650 USD.\n\nNow, compare Ken Rosewall's prize money (66400) to this combined total (59650). Since 66,400 is greater than 59,650, the claim would be false because Ken Rosewell has more prize money than the sum of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner. Wait, no, the claim says Ken loses more than their combined total. If Ken's prize money is higher, then he hasn't lost more; in fact, others have lost less compared to him.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the claim. It says \"ken rosewell lose more prize money than tom ekker and roscoe tanner combine.\" So, perhaps it's saying that Ken lost (i.e., his prize money is) more than their combined total. If that's the case, since 66,400 > 59,650, then yes, Ken has more prize money than the sum of Tom and Roscoe. But the claim says he loses more, which might imply he has less, so perhaps it's a trick question.\n\nWait no, the term \"loses\" here is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that Ken has lost (i.e., given away or not kept) more prize money than the combined total of Tom and Roscoe. But in the context of the table, \"prize money\" is what they have earned. So perhaps it's saying that Ken's prize money is less than the sum of Tom's and Roscoe's, which would make the claim true if that were the case.\n\nWait no, let me clarify: The claim says \"ken rosewell lose more prize money than tom ekker and roscoe tanner combine.\" If we interpret \"lose\" as \"has lost,\" meaning he has less than others, then it's about comparing his prize money to their combined total. So, if Ken's prize money is more than theirs combined, the claim would be false because he didn't lose more, he actually has more.\n\nAlternatively, if \"lose\" means he gave away or spent more, but that's not indicated here. The table shows the prize money they have, so perhaps it's about comparing his amount to theirs. So, in this case:\n\nKen Rosewall: 66,400\nTom Okker: 34,400\nRoscoe Tanner: 25,250\n\nCombined total of Tom and Roscoe: 59,650.\n\nSince Ken has more than their combined total, the claim that he \"loses\" (has less) is false because he actually has more. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns related here are \"prize money (usd)\" for all three players and \"country\" if needed, but in this case, country isn't directly relevant. So the relevant columns are prize money.\n\nThe rows are:\n\nKen Rosewall: row 0\nTom Okker: row 8\nRoscoe Tanner: row 9\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include these rows for the prize money column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Ken Rosewall's prize money is greater than the combined total of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"roger taylor and mark cox aren't tie for fourth place\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are: rk, name, country, matches played, matches won, points, prize money (usd). The data has multiple rows with each player's information.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Roger Taylor and Mark Cox. I need to find their positions in the table to see if they are tied for fourth place or not.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Roger Taylor is listed as row 4 (since indexing starts from 0, but wait, actually, looking closely, row indices start at 0, so the first entry is row 0. Wait, let me check again. The table's \"data\" array has entries in the following order:\n\nRow 0: Ken Rosewall\nRow 1: Arthur Ashe\nRow 2: Marty Riessen\nRow 3: Roger Taylor\nRow 4: Mark Cox\nRow 5: Brian Fairlie\nRow 6: Jan Kode\u0161\nRow 7: Tom Okker\nRow 8: Roscoe Tanner\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nThe data array is as follows:\n\n[\n  [\n    1,\n    \"ken rosewall\",\n    \"aus\",\n    42,\n    34,\n    53,\n    66400\n  ],\n  [\n    2,\n    \"arthur ashe\",\n    \"usa\",\n    36,\n    26,\n    41,\n    63150\n  ],\n  [\n    3,\n    \"marty riessen\",\n    \"usa\",\n    36,\n    26,\n    35,\n    47200\n  ],\n  [\n    4,\n    \"roger taylor\",\n    \"gbr\",\n    31,\n    21,\n    34,\n    42800\n  ],\n  [\n    4,\n    \"mark cox\",\n    \"gbr\",\n    33,\n    23,\n    34,\n    31950\n  ],\n  [\n    6,\n    \"brian fairlie\",\n    \"aus\",\n    32,\n    22,\n    33,\n    30900\n  ],\n  [\n    7,\n    \"jan kode\\u00e5\\u00a1\",\n    \"tch\",\n    27,\n    19,\n    28,\n    23800\n  ],\n  [\n    8,\n    \"tom okker\",\n    \"ned\",\n    29,\n    19,\n    25,\n    34400\n  ],\n  [\n    9,\n    \"roscoe tanner\",\n    \"usa\",\n    27,\n    16,\n    24,\n    25250\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, so each row in the data array is a player. The first column is \"rk\", which I assume stands for ranking, as it's a numbering that increases. So, for example, Ken Rosewall is ranked 1st, Arthur Ashe 2nd, Marty Riessen 3rd, Roger Taylor 4th, Mark Cox also 4th, Brian Fairlie 6th, etc.\n\nSo, looking at the \"rk\" column: row 0 is rk=1, row1=2, row2=3, row3=4, row4=4, then row5=6, and so on.\n\nNow, Roger Taylor is in row 3 (index 3) with rk=4. Mark Cox is in row4 with rk=4 as well.\n\nSo both are at rank 4, same position. The claim says they aren't tied for fourth place, but according to the table, they are tied because both have rk=4. So the claim would be FALSE because they are indeed tied for fourth place.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the \"name\" is either \"roger taylor\" or \"mark cox\". Both have an \"rk\" value of 4, meaning they are tied in fourth place.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
