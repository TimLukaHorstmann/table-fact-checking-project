    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess louise do not married until she be around 38 year old\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim: it's suggesting that Princess Louise didn't marry until she was about 38 years old.\n\nFirst, I should identify all relevant cells in the table related to this claim. The claim mentions \"princess louise,\" so I'll look for rows where the name column starts with \"louise.\" Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 5: \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931\" \u2014 this matches Princess Louise.\n- Other rows have names like Mary, Anne, Charlotte, Victoria, etc., which don't pertain to Princess Louise.\n\nNext, I need to find the column that provides her marriage details. The columns are: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, husband dates.\n\nThe \"date married\" column seems relevant because it directly relates to when she got married. So, in row 5, under \"date married,\" the value is \"1889.\"\n\nNow, I need to verify if Princess Louise was around 38 years old when she married. Her birth year can be inferred from her name dates: 1867 - 1931. If she was born in 1867 and married in 1889, let's calculate her age.\n\n1889 minus 1867 is 22 years old. Wait, that doesn't add up because 1889 minus 1867 is actually 22 years, not 38. That means the claim stating she didn't marry until around 38 is incorrect. She got married at 22.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Princess Louise married much earlier than 38.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Louise did not marry until she was around 38 is false. According to the table, she married in 1889 at 22 years old.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Princess Mary and King William II. From history, I know that Princess Mary was actually named after her grandmother, so there might be some confusion here. Wait, no, the table seems to have several princesses named Mary. For example, row 0 is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\", which probably refers to Princess Mary who was married to King William II.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about Princess Mary marrying before she turns 12. So I need to check when she got married and whether that marriage happened before her 12th birthday.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"name dates\" column. For row 0, it's \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\". The \"date married\" is in another column, which is \"1641\". So she was born around 1631, so in 1641, if that's the year she married, let me check her age.\n\nIf she was born in 1631 (assuming she was around then), in 1641, she would be 10 years old. Wait, but the exact birth year isn't specified; maybe she was born in 1630, making her 11 in 1641. Either way, she was less than 12 when she married.\n\nBut wait, another thing: sometimes the table entries might have different structures. For example, row 6 is \"mary , princess royal 1897 - 1965\", and \"date married\" is 1922. So that's a different Mary, probably Queen Mary of Teck, who was about 25 when she married George V in 1901 or something. Wait no, row 6 says date married is 1922. So maybe the Mary in row 0 is the one who married William II.\n\nWait, let me clarify the rows:\n\nRow 0: Mary, born 1631-1660, married Charles I? No, wait, parent is Charles I, but her husband is William II. So she was married in 1641 when she was around 10 or 11.\n\nSo according to row 0, Mary married William II in 1641, which would be before she turned 12 if she was born in 1631. So that would make the claim TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check the columns again. The relevant columns are \"name dates\", \"date married\", and \"husband dates\". For each row, I need to see if it's about Princess Mary marrying William II before she turned 12.\n\nLooking at row 0: name is Mary, princess royal from 1631-1660; date married is 1641; husband is William II, prince of orange from 1626-1650. So yes, in 1641, if she was born around 1631, that's before her 12th birthday.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"princess mary\", but in row 0, it's \"mary , princess royal\". Is this the correct Mary? Because there are multiple Marys in the table. For example, row 6 is another Mary who married later.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be row 0, columns \"date married\" and perhaps \"name dates\". But wait, the claim is about whether she married before turning 12, so we need to check her age at marriage. That would require knowing her birth year or approximate age.\n\nSince the table only gives the years she was princess royal, and the date she married, in row 0, we can infer that she was around 10 when she married in 1641.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because she married before turning 12.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on Princess Mary marrying King William II before her 12th birthday. According to the table's first row (row 0), Mary married in 1641 at approximately 10 years old, which is before her 12th birthday.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II have have 2 husband\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand the structure of the table and what each column represents.\n\nLooking at the columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, husband dates. The data rows seem to represent different princesses related by their titles and their family connections.\n\nThe claim mentions Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II having two husbands. From the table, each row has a \"name\" which includes the princess's name along with her title and dates. So I should look for rows where the name is \"Princess Anne\".\n\nLooking through the data:\n- Row 0: Mary, Princess Royal 1631 - 1660\n- Row 1: Anne, Princess Royal 1709 - 1759\n- Row 2: Charlotte, Princess Royal 1766 - 1828\n- Row 3: Victoria, Princess Royal 1840 - 1901\n- Row 4: Louise, Princess Royal 1867 - 1931\n- Row 5: Mary, Princess Royal 1897 - 1965\n- Row 6 and 7: Anne, Princess Royal 1950 -\n\nSo, there are two Annes in the table. The first is row 1, and the second is rows 6 and 7.\n\nNow, checking each of these for having multiple husbands. The relevant columns would be \"husband dates\" because that's where their marriages are recorded.\n\nFor row 1 (Anne, Princess Royal 1709 - 1759):\n- Husband dates: \"william iv , prince of orange 1711 - 1751\"\n\nThis indicates she married William IV from 1711 to 1751. Since there's only one husband listed here, that's one marriage.\n\nNow, looking at the later Annes (rows 6 and 7):\n- Row 6: Anne, Princess Royal 1950 -\n  Husband dates: \"mark phillips 1948 -\"\n  So she married Mark Phillips from 1948 onwards. That's only one husband.\n\nRow 7:\n- It also says \"Anne, Princess Royal 1950 -\", but here the husband is listed as \"sir timothy laurence 1955 -\". Wait, that's different from row 6. So in row 7, her husband is Sir Timothy Laurence starting from 1955.\n\nThis suggests that Anne had two marriages: one with Mark Phillips and another with Sir Timothy Laurence. Therefore, she has two husbands.\n\nWait a minute, but the table lists two separate rows for Anne (rows 6 and 7). Are these two different instances or the same person? If it's the same Anne, then her marriage to both would count as having two husbands. However, if they're different princesses named Anne, that complicates things.\n\nBut in reality, Princess Anne of Elizabeth II is a specific individual who married twice. So looking at the data, row 6 shows her husband as Mark Phillips, and row 7 shows another husband, which would mean she had two marriages. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because she has two husbands.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the \"husband dates\" column for any Princess Anne entries. The table lists two instances of Anne with different husbands, indicating multiple marriages.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have gotten a divorce\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Princess Anne is the only one in the list who got a divorce. So I need to check each row in the table and see if any other princesses have a history of divorce besides Anne.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. Each row represents a different princess.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n- Name: Mary, Princess Royal 1631 - 1660\n- She was married to Charles I. From the data, her husband's dates are William II, Prince of Orange from 1626 to 1650. Looking at her date married (1641) and the husband's end date (1650), it seems she might have been married for a while before possibly getting a divorce. But wait, in historical context, Charles I was executed in 1649, so Mary might have been widowed. She remarried, but if she got a divorce, it's unclear here because she was already widowed.\n\nRow 1:\n- Name: Anne, Princess Royal 1709 - 1759\n- Her parent is George II. Her date married is 1734, and her husband is William IV, Prince of Orange from 1711 to 1751. She died in 1759, so if she got a divorce, it would have been before that. But I'm not sure if Anne actually divorced; perhaps she was widowed again after William's death.\n\nRow 2:\n- Name: Charlotte, Princess Royal 1766 - 1828\n- Married George III in 1797. The husband's dates are King Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg from 1754 to 1816. Charlotte died in 1828, so she was widowed but didn't remarry. No indication of a divorce here.\n\nRow 3:\n- Name: Victoria, Princess Royal 1840 - 1901\n- Married in 1858; her husband is Victoria (Queen Victoria) from 1819 to 1901. She was widowed and married again, but no mention of a divorce.\n\nRow 4:\n- Name: Louise, Princess Royal 1867 - 1931\n- Married Edward VII in 1889. Her husband's dates are up to 1910. She remarried after his death, but no divorce mentioned.\n\nRow 5:\n- Name: Mary, Princess Royal 1897 - 1965\n- Married George V in 1922; he died in 1936. She remarried twice more, but again, no mention of a divorce.\n\nRow 6:\n- Name: Anne, Princess Royal 1950 -\n- Married in 1973 to Mark Phillips, and later to Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992. Her column shows her marriage ended in 1987, which was a divorce. So she did get a divorce from her first husband.\n\nRow 7:\n- There are two entries for Anne, same as Row 6, so no new info here.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: it's about Princess Anne of Elizabeth. Wait, that might be a typo or misunderstanding. The table lists \"Princess Royal\" with names like Mary, Anne, Charlotte, etc., but there isn't one named Elizabeth. So perhaps the claim refers to Princess Anne (maybe confusing \"Elizabeth\" as part of her title? Or maybe it's an error). Since the table doesn't have any princess named Elizabeth, the claim might be incorrect because there is no such person in the data.\n\nBut wait, focusing on the content: The table has two entries for Anne, Princess Royal. One (Row 6) shows she got a divorce from her first husband in 1987. Is that correct? Let me check Row 6's data again: \"date married\" is 1973, and \"husband dates\" are Mark Phillips from 1948 to 1987. Wait, but the \"princess royal\" row for Anne says she was married from 1973 - 1987, which would mean her husband filed for divorce or something? Or perhaps she and Mark separated in 1987. So that's a divorce.\n\nLooking at other rows: I don't see any other princesses who got a divorce. Mary (Row 0) might have been widowed but didn't remarry with a divorce; others didn't remarry after their spouses' deaths, so no divorce. So among the listed princesses, only Anne (Row 6 and 7) had a divorce.\n\nBut wait, in Row 0, Mary was married to Charles I, who died in 1649, and she remarried to William II? Or did she get a divorce? No, she became a widow, so she might not have divorced; she remarried. So only Anne in the table has a recorded divorce.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"Princess Anne... be the only princess of the list to have gotten a divorce.\" But the issue is that in the table, the princesses are referred to as \"Mary, Princess Royal,\" etc., but the claim mentions \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth.\" Since there's no princess named Elizabeth in the table, perhaps the claim is incorrect. However, if we assume that \"Elizabeth\" is part of a title (like \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth\"), then maybe it's referring to the correct row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant Princess Anne, as in Row 6 and 7, who did have a divorce.\n\nBut since the table doesn't include any princess named Elizabeth, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no such person. However, the data shows that Princess Anne (Rows 6 and 7) did get a divorce, so she might be considered as the only one in the list with a divorce.\n\nWait, but \"Princess of Elizabeth\" isn't a title I'm familiar with. It could be an error, making the claim factually incorrect because there's no such princess. Therefore, the statement is false because there's no Princess Elizabeth in the data, and even if it was meant to refer to Anne, she is the only one who got a divorce.\n\nSo, in conclusion: The claim is incorrect because there's no Princess Elizabeth in the table, so the assertion that she's the only princess with a divorce isn't applicable since the subject doesn't exist. Alternatively, if \"Elizabeth\" was a mistake and it was meant to refer to Anne, then yes, she's the only one in the list with a divorce.\n\nBut considering all this, I think the answer depends on whether the claim refers correctly to a person in the data or not. Since there's no Princess Elizabeth, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires evaluating the given statement about Princess Anne of Elizabeth and determining its accuracy based on the provided data. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding the Titles**: The table lists princesses with titles such as \"Mary, Princess Royal\" and \"Anne, Princess Royal,\" but there is no entry for a princess named \"Elizabeth.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statement**: The claim refers to \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth.\" Since there's no such princess in the data, this reference is incorrect.\n\n3. **Divorce Record Check**: Among the listed princesses, only Anne (Rows 6 and 7) shows a divorce from her first husband, Mark Phillips, in 1987.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement is factually incorrect because there is no Princess Elizabeth in the table. Additionally, while Princess Anne did have a divorce, referring to her as \"Princess of Elizabeth\" is misleading since such a title doesn't exist in the provided data.\n\n**Final Answer**: The statement is incorrect due to the absence of Princess Elizabeth in the data and the specific reference to her, making the claim factually inaccurate.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40.\" Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and understand its structure. The table has several columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. Each row represents a different person, with their details filled in these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions \"prince mary of charles i.\" Wait, in the table, I see that each row has a number as the order, then a name along with some titles and dates. Looking at row 0: the name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\" So this seems to be Princess Mary, daughter of Charles I.\n\nNow, the claim says she died before age 40. Let's check her death date. In the same row, under \"name dates,\" it says \"1642 - 1660.\" Wait, but that might refer to when she was a princess royal, so perhaps her active years. But wait, in another column, there's \"date married\" which is \"1641.\" So she got married in 1641, and then the \"name dates\" are from 1631-1660, which likely refers to her life as a princess royal.\n\nBut where can I find her actual death date? Let me look at other columns. The row has \"husband dates\" as \"william ii , prince of orange 1626 - 1650.\" So her husband was William II, and their marriage was in 1641, but that doesn't directly give her death date.\n\nWait, maybe the \"name dates\" include when she died? Let me check: the first cell under \"name dates\" is \"1642 - 1660.\" But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps it's a range from when she became princess royal to when she retired or something. Alternatively, maybe the death date is in another column.\n\nLooking at the table again, each row has several pieces of information. For example, row 1 is about Anne, daughter of George II, and her husband William IV. But back to row 0: the parent is listed as \"charles i 1600 - 1649,\" which is Charles I's reign. Mary was his daughter.\n\nNow, in terms of death dates for Princess Mary, historically, she died in 1660. Let me check that. Yes, from what I remember, Princess Mary died in 1660 at the age of about 19 or 20. Wait, but the claim says she died before age 40, which is certainly true because she was only around 20 when she passed.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table: under \"name dates\" for row 0, it's written as \"1642 - 1660.\" Does that indicate her death in 1660? Or is it the period during which she was princess royal? Maybe she became a princess royal from 1631 to 1660. So perhaps she died in 1660.\n\nTherefore, she did die before turning 40 because she was only about 19 or 20 when she passed. So the claim seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing her with anyone else. Let me check row indices. The first row is index 0, which is Mary, daughter of Charles I. Her name dates are 1631-1660, and she died in 1660. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the claim is saying that Prince Mary (of Charles I) died before age 40. Since she died at 19 or 20, that's definitely true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the table has another row with the same order number 7? Let me check. Wait, no, looking back: rows are numbered from 0 to 6, and then again row 7 is present twice. So row 7 seems to have data about Anne, princess royal from 1950 to present.\n\nSo in row 0, the relevant columns for verifying the claim would be \"name dates\" because that's where her lifespan is indicated. Also, perhaps \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" as it shows when she held that title until her death.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0, column \"name dates\": \"1642 - 1660\"\n- Row 0, column \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\": \"1631 - 1660\"\n\nThese two columns together indicate that she was a princess royal until 1660 and died in that year, which is before she turned 40.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the data provided. Princess Mary of Charles I held the title of princess royal from 1631 to 1660 and died in 1660, well before turning 40.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Princess Mary marry her husband William II after her 12th birthday.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. The key elements are Princess Mary and her marriage to William II. So, looking at the table's columns, the relevant ones seem to be \"name dates,\" \"parent,\" \"date married,\" and \"husband dates.\"\n\nNext, I'll look through each row to see if any entries match Princess Mary marrying William II after turning 12. The table has multiple rows, so I need to check each one carefully.\n\nLooking at row 0: It mentions Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660. Her husband is listed as William II, Prince of Orange from 1626-1650. The date married is 1641. Since she was born in 1631, she would have been around 10 years old when they married in 1641, which is before her 12th birthday. That doesn't fit the claim.\n\nMoving to row 1: It's about Anne, not Mary, so I can skip this one since the claim is specifically about Mary.\n\nRow 2: Charlotte is mentioned, again not relevant here.\n\nRow 3: Victoria is involved, not Mary.\n\nRow 4: Louise is in this row. Her husband is Frederick III, not William II, so no match.\n\nRow 5: Mary is listed as Princess Royal from 1867-1931. Her date of marriage is 1889, and her husband is Alexander Duff, not William II. So, again, no match.\n\nRow 6: Another Mary, but she married Henry Lascelles, not William II.\n\nRow 7: Wait, the table has two entries with row index 7? That seems odd. Let me check. Oh, I see. The first entry for row 7 shows Anne marrying Mark Phillips in 1992. The second entry also mentions Anne but lists her husband as Sir Timothy Laurence. Neither of these are William II.\n\nSo, none of the rows mention Mary, Princess Royal (which is likely referring to the original Mary) marrying William II after her 12th birthday. In fact, the first row shows that she married when she was around 10, before turning 12. The claim says after her 12th birthday, so it's false.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"Mary, Princess Royal\" refers to the same person across different rows. Maybe the first Mary is a different person? No, looking at the table's data, the first row is about Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660, and her husband William II. Then in row 6, it's another Mary, Princess Royal from 1897-1965, married to Henry Lascelles. So they are different people with the same name.\n\nTherefore, the claim specifically refers to the first Mary (born 1631) marrying William II after turning 12, which didn't happen because she married at 10. The other Mary in row 6 is a different person altogether. The table doesn't show any entry where the correct Mary marries William II after her 12th birthday.\n\nSo, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a different princess royal with details about her marriage.\n\nThe claim mentions Princess Louise marrying Edward VII before she was 20. So I need to find the relevant rows that pertain to Princess Louise and check when she married.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n- The first column is the order, which seems sequential from 1 to 7.\n- Each row has details about different princesses, including their names, the dates they held the title of Princess Royal, their parents, the date they married, and their husbands' information.\n\nI need to find a row where the name is \"princess louise\" or similar. Scanning through each data row:\n\n1. Row 5: The name is \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931\". This seems to be Princess Louise.\n   - Her parent is \"edward vii 1841 - 1910\".\n   - The date married is \"1889\".\n   - Her husband's details are \"alexander duff , 1st duke of fife 1849 - 1912\".\n\nSo, according to this row, Princess Louise married in 1889. Now, checking her age at that time: she was born in 1867, so 1889 would make her around 22 years old.\n\nThe claim states she married before the age of 20. Since 22 is older than 20, this seems to contradict the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check each row again. The first row (row 5) corresponds to Princess Louise. Her marriage date is in 1889. She was indeed 22 then because 1867 + 22 = 1889. So she didn't marry before turning 20.\n\nBut the claim says \"before the age of 20,\" so if she married at 22, that would make the claim false.\n\nHowever, I should check all rows to ensure there's no other Princess Louise mentioned elsewhere. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 5 is the only one with her name as \"louise , princess royal...\". The others are Mary, Anne, Charlotte, Victoria, etc., so no confusion here.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, Princess Louise married at 22, not before 20. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Louise married Edward VII before turning 20. From the table, Princess Louise (row 5) married in 1889, making her approximately 22 years old, which is after turning 20. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date married\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth be 1 of 3 princesses on the list who have a divorce.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. Princess Anne is involved here. Looking at the table, I see several rows with different princess names. For example, row 7 has \"Anne , princess royal 1950 -\" and mentions her marriage details. So, she's definitely one of the princesses listed.\n\nNow, the claim is about her being one of three who have a divorce. So, I need to check if any other princesses in the table have divorce information. The columns relevant here would be \"parent,\" \"date married,\" and perhaps others that might indicate marital issues leading to a divorce.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Mary has her parent as Charles I and husband William II. No mention of divorce.\n2. Row 1: Anne's parent is George II, husband William IV. No indication of divorce here either.\n3. Row 2: Charlotte's parent is George III, husband Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg. No divorce info.\n4. Row 3: Victoria's parent and husband are both named Victoria. She married in 1858; no mention of divorce.\n5. Row 4: Louise's parent is Edward VII, husband Alexander Duff. No divorce mentioned.\n6. Row 5: Mary's parent is George V, husband Henry Lascelles. No info on divorce.\n7. Rows 6 and 7 both refer to Anne, but the data might be a duplication or correction. Her marriage ended in 1992.\n\nNow, I need to see if any other princesses have a divorce. From the table, there's no explicit mention of any other princess having a divorce. The claim refers to three princesses, and only Anne is listed here. Unless another row has a divorce, but based on the data provided, it doesn't seem so.\n\nI should check each relevant column for Anne and others. The \"parent\" column might indicate if her parent's marriage ended in divorce, but that's about the parent, not her own marriage. Similarly, other columns like \"date married\" or \"husband dates\" don't show a dissolution.\n\nTherefore, there isn't enough evidence in the table to support that Princess Anne is one of three who have had a divorce. The claim might be based on external knowledge, but according to the given data, it's not fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"parent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date married\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Princess Mary of Charles I dies before she turns 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means and see if it's supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions Princess Mary, so I'll look for rows where the name column has \"Mary.\" Looking at the table, there are two rows with \"mary\": row 0 and row 6. Wait, no, actually, looking closer:\n\nRow 0: name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\"\nRow 6: name is \"mary , princess royal 1897 - 1965\"\n\nSo both of these are Princess Marys. Now, the claim is about a specific one: \"Mary of Charles I.\" From row 0, the parent column says \"charles i 1600 - 1649,\" so this must be the correct row.\n\nNext, I need to check her lifespan. The claim states she died before turning 25. Let's see when she was born and when she died. Her name dates are from 1631 to 1660, but wait, looking at the table, the \"name dates\" column for row 0 is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\" The \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" for row 0 is 1642-1660.\n\nWait, that might mean she became a princess in 1642 and died around 1660. So her lifespan would be from around 1625 to 1660? Wait, no, the name dates start at 1631, but maybe her birth date isn't given here. Let me check the columns again.\n\nThe table has columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, husband dates.\n\nFor row 0:\n- name: mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\n- princess royal from: 1642-1660\n- parent: charles i 1600 - 1649\n\nSo she became a princess in 1642 and died in 1660. That would make her around 18 years old when she took the title, but her actual birth year isn't directly given here.\n\nWait, perhaps her death date is 1660, so if she was born in 1631 (assuming the name dates start at 1631), she would be about 29 years old. But that's inconsistent with the claim saying she died before 25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me see each row:\n\nRow 0: Name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660,\" so her reign as princess started in 1631 but became princess royal in 1642 until 1660. So she was born before 1631 and died in 1660.\n\nIf the claim says she dies before turning 25, then I need to check if she was alive when she turned 25. If she died in 1660, let's estimate her birth year. Suppose she was about 20 when she became princess in 1642 (born around 1622). She lived until 1660, so that would make her about 38 years old, which is much later than 25.\n\nWait, but the claim might be referring to her death before reaching 25 years old. So if she was born in, say, 1631, she turned 25 in 1656 and died in 1660. She did live beyond 25, so that would make the claim false.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure because the table doesn't specify her exact birth year. Maybe there's another way to check. Alternatively, perhaps row 6 is a different Mary who died after 1931, but that's a later period and doesn't relate to Charles I.\n\nWait, no, row 0 is the only one with parent as Charles I. So row 0's Mary was alive beyond 25 because she lived until 1660, so if she was born around 1622, she would have been 38 when she died.\n\nSo that means the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Mary of Charles I dies before turning 25. Checking the table, her reign ended in 1660, and even if she was born around 1631, she lived past 25. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II have only 1 husband\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Princess Anne and Elizabeth the II. From the table, I see that each row represents a princess with details like her name, dates as a princess royal, parent, date married, and husband's name along with their dates. So, I need to look for rows where the name is \"Anne, Princess Royal\" because the claim refers to Princess Anne.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 7: The first entry is \"anne , princess royal 1950 -\", so this seems relevant.\n- Wait, in row 7, there are two entries with the same row index. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me check again. Oh no, I see now\u2014the table has rows numbered from 1 to 6 first and then another row 7 and 8? Or maybe it's a typo because row indices go up to 7 but only seven entries are listed, with two having the same index. Wait, looking at the data:\n\nThe data is an array of arrays. The first sub-array is for order 1, then order 2, and so on until order 7. But in the table provided, under \"data\", it's a list where each element represents a row. So, row indices are 0 to 6 (since JavaScript uses zero-based indexing), but in the problem statement, they're referred as row_index starting from 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user mentions that the first row is index 1, so in the JSON, \"row_index\" should be 1-based. So, for example, the first data array is row 1, the second row 2, etc., up to row 7 and 8? Wait, looking at the data:\n\nThe data array has seven elements:\n\n[\n    [ ... ], // row 0 in JSON but row 1 in 1-based\n    [ ... ],\n    ...\n    [ ... ] // this is row 6, which corresponds to order 7?\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the table provided, the \"order\" column lists numbers from 1 to 8, but looking at the data array, it's a list of seven sub-arrays:\n\n[\n    [ ... ], // row 0 (order 1)\n    [ ... ], // row 1 (order 2)\n    ...\n    [ ... ] // row 6 (order 7)\n]\n\nWait no\u2014the first element in data is order 1, the second is order 2, etc., up to order 7. So, rows are from index 0 to 6, but \"row_index\" should be 1 to 7. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nBut regardless, focusing on Princess Anne:\n\nLooking at each row's \"name dates\" column:\n\n- Row 7 (order 7): name is \"anne , princess royal 1950 -\"\n- Another entry in data is for order 7 again, but with different husband details. So, two rows have the same order number?\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back, perhaps it's a mistake in the table because each row should represent a unique entry. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the \"columns\" include \"order\", so each data array represents an order. The first element of data is order 1, and the last is order 7. Then, looking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: order 1, name Mary\n- Row 1: order 2, name Anne (maybe?) Wait no\u2014looking at row 6 in the data array, which is the last one, it's:\n\n[\n  \"anne , princess royal 1950 -\",\n  \"1987 - present\",\n  \"elizabeth ii 1926 -\",\n  \"1973 - 1992\",\n  \"mark phillips 1948 -\"\n]\n\nWait no\u2014no, actually, looking at each sub-array in data:\n\nRow 1 (order=2) is:\n\n[\n  2,\n  \"anne , princess royal 1709 - 1759\",\n  ...\n]\n\nSo that's the first Princess Anne. Then row 6 (order=7) is another entry for \"Anne, Princess Royal 1950 -\".\n\nWait no\u2014row indices are from 0 to 6 in the data array, which correspond to order numbers 1 to 7.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Mary\n- Row 1: Anne (1709-1759)\n- Row 2: Charlotte\n- Row 3: Victoria\n- Row 4: Louise\n- Row 5: Mary again, but different dates\n- Row 6: Anne again, but with 1950- present\n\nSo in the data array, there are two entries for Princess Anne:\n\n1. At row index 1 (order=2), she married George II in 1734.\n2. At row index 6 (order=7), she married Mark Phillips in 1992.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II have only 1 husband.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing because it refers to Princess Anne as being part of Elizabeth the II, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps the user meant \"Princess Anne\" who is the daughter of Elizabeth II.\n\nSo, in the table, there are two rows for Princess Anne:\n\n- Row 1: order=2, married George II in 1734\n- Row 6: order=7, married Mark Phillips in 1992\n\nSo, if the claim says she has only 1 husband, that would be FALSE because according to the table, she has two husbands.\n\nBut wait, I need to check each cell. The relevant cells are:\n\nFor each Princess Anne row, we can extract their \"husband dates\" and see how many marriages they had.\n\nIn row 1 (order=2): husband is George II, married in 1734, no divorce mentioned\u2014so one marriage.\n\nIn row 6 (order=7): married Mark Phillips in 1992. Again, assuming no divorce, that's another marriage.\n\nThus, Princess Anne has two husbands in the table data, meaning the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake\u2014maybe the same person? No, because George II and Mark are different people.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Princess Anne\" refers to the current one (Sophie, but no\u2014that's not relevant here). Wait, the problem statement may be unclear. But according to the table data provided, there are two instances of Princess Anne marrying twice.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, for each row where name includes 'Anne', check the number of marriages.\n\nFor order=2: one marriage\nFor order=7: one marriage\nTotal: two marriages\n\nThus, the claim that she has only 1 husband is false.\n\nHence, the answer is: The statement is incorrect. Princess Anne has had two marriages.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Anne has only one husband is false. According to the provided data, she has married twice. \n\nAnswer: The statement is incorrect. Princess Anne has had two marriages.",
