    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about St. Andrews University's student enrollment is true based on the provided table. The claim says, \"the number of student enrol at st andrew university be 600.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the relevant information for St. Andrews University. Let me check each row in the data array until I find the one that matches the institution name.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- The first entry is Anderson University with 2907 students.\n- Then Appalachian State University has over 17,000 students.\n- Catawba College has about 1,300.\n- Coker College has 1,200.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for St. Andrews University. Scanning down, the 13th row seems to be St. Andrews:\n{\n  \"st andrews university\",\n  \"laurinburg , north carolina\",\n  1958,\n  \"private\",\n  600,\n  \"knights\",\n  \"1988\",\n  \"2012\",\n  \"aac (naia)\"\n}\n\nSo the enrollment number here is 600. The claim says exactly that, so this looks correct.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries for St. Andrews University, but I don't see another one. It seems to be only in row index 13, column \"enrollment\" with value 600.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim: \"the college team whose nickname be blue hose join the conference in the year 1965.\" I need to check if it's true or false using the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The team has a nickname \"blue hose,\" and they joined a conference in 1965. My goal is to find which row in the table matches these conditions.\n\nLooking at the columns, the relevant ones here are probably \"nickname\" and \"joined.\" So, for each row, I'll check if the nickname is \"blue hose\" and then see when they joined.\n\nI start by scanning each row's \"nickname\" column. The first few rows have nicknames like \"trojans,\" \"mountaineers,\" \"indians,\" etc.\u2014none of these are \"blue hose.\" \n\nContinuing down, I find a row with \"blue hose\" as the nickname. That's Presbyterian College, row index 12. Now, checking when they joined: according to the table, they \"joined\" in 1965.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other team with that nickname. Looking through all the nicknames again, only Presbyterian College has \"blue hose.\" Their \"joined\" year is indeed 1965.\n\nSo both conditions are met. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part of the claim means. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. The college's nickname is \"blue hose\".\n2. The college joined in 1972.\n3. The college is a member of SAC (which probably stands for Southern Athletic Conference).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different college with various attributes. I need to check each row to see if any match all three conditions.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Anderson University - Nickname \"trojans\". Doesn't match \"blue hose\".\nRow 1: Appalachian State University - Nickname \"mountaineers\". No.\nRow 2: Catawba College - Nickname \"indians\". Nope.\nRow 3: Coker College - Nickname \"cobras\". Not matching.\nRow 4: East Carolina University - Nickname \"pirates\". No.\nRow 5: Elon University - \"phoenix\". Doesn't match.\nRow 6: Guilford College - \"quakers\". No.\nRow 7: High Point University - \"panthers\". No.\nRow 8: Lenoir-Rhyne University - \"bears\". Not it.\nRow 9: Longwood University - \"lancers\". No.\nRow 10: Mars Hill College - \"lions\". Nope.\nRow 11: Newberry College - \"wolves\". Doesn't match.\nRow 12: UNC Pembroke - \"braves\". No.\nRow 13: Presbyterian College - Nickname is \"blue hose\". That's a match for the first condition.\nNow, check when they joined. The row has \"joined\" as \"1965\", which doesn't match 1972.\nAdditionally, their conference is \"big south (ncaa division i)\", not SAC.\n\nRow 14: Queens University of Charlotte - \"royals\". No.\nRow 15: St Andrews University - \"knights\". Doesn't match.\nRow 16: Western Carolina University - \"catamounts\". No.\n\nSo the only college with \"blue hose\" is Presbyterian College, but their joining year is 1965 and conference isn't SAC. Therefore, none of the colleges in the table meet all three conditions specified in the claim.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check. The claim says the college joined in 1972 and is a member of SAC. Looking back at the table, I might have missed something. Let's check again.\n\nLooking at row 12: UNC Pembroke has nickname \"braves\", which isn't \"blue hose\". Row 13: Presbyterian College - joined 1965, conference big south. So no match for 1972 and SAC.\n\nAnother thought: Is there another college in the table with nickname \"blue hose\" and joining in 1972? From the data provided, it doesn't seem so. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as none of the colleges meet all three criteria.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for a college with the nickname \"blue hose\", joined in 1972, and part of SAC. None match these criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"current conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a college's conference history is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the conference for the college that left in 1974 and again in 1989 be the AAC (NAIA).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be checked. The college in question must have left a conference in both 1974 and 1989, and upon leaving both times, its conference should be the AAC (which is part of NAIA). So, my approach is to look through each row of the table to find any college that has \"left\" years matching 1974 and 1989.\n\nLooking at the data structure, each row represents a different college with various attributes. The relevant columns here are \"joined,\" \"left,\" and \"current conference.\" I need to check these columns for each college to see if their left years match both 1974 and 1989, and then verify their current conference is AAC (NAIA).\n\nLet me go through the table row by row:\n\n1. **Anderson University**: Joined in 1998, left in 2010. Doesn't match our criteria.\n2. **Appalachian State University**: Joined in 1930, left in 1967. Only one left year, not two.\n3. **Catawba College**: Joined in 1930, left in 1989. Only one left year (1989), but we need both 1974 and 1989.\n4. **Coker College**: Joined in 1991, left in 2013. Doesn't match.\n5. **East Carolina University**: Joined in 1947, left in 1962. Only one left year.\n6. **Elon University**: Joined in 1930, left in 1989. Again, only one left year (1989).\n7. **Guilford College**: Joined in 1930, left in 1988. Not matching both years.\n8. **High Point University**: Joined in 1930, left in 1997. Doesn't fit.\n9. **Lenoir-Rhyne University**: Joined in 1930 and 1985, left in 1974 and 1989. Wait, this seems promising. The row has two joined years (1930 and 1985) but the left years are 1974 and 1989. So, yes, this college left in both 1974 and 1989.\n\nNext step: Check the current conference for Lenoir-Rhyne University. According to the table, it's \"aac (naia).\" The claim mentions the AAC (NAIA), so that matches.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Lenoir-Rhyne University is the college that left in both 1974 and 1989 and was part of the AAC (NAIA) conference after leaving. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is for Lenoir-Rhyne University, which left in both 1974 and 1989 with a current conference of AAC (NAIA).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"left\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"current conference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
