    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"overlake village have 1 park and ride project propose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"overlake village.\" Looking at the table, I see that \"overlake village\" appears in the city/neighborhood column for some rows. For example, row 12 has \"overlake village\" under station: east link, and it's located in overlake. So that seems relevant.\n\nNext, the claim says they have \"1 park and ride project propose.\" From the table, each row corresponds to a station with various details, including \"park and ride\" which is a column in the table. The park and ride column has either \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"unknown.\"\n\nSo I need to check if overlake village's entry in the park and ride column is anything that would indicate a proposed project.\n\nLooking through the relevant rows for overlake village, let's see:\n\n- Row 12: Station is east link, city/neighborhood is overlake. Park and ride is \"yes.\" It also mentions \"2021\" as the projected opening.\n- Row 13: Same station and neighborhood but transit center. Park and ride is \"yes.\"\n- Rows 14 and 15 for overlake mention park and ride as \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nWait, row 12 has \"overlake village\" with a park and ride of \"yes,\" indicating that it's operational. So does that mean they have at least one park and ride project? The claim says \"1 park and ride project propose.\" \n\nHmm, if the park and ride is already present (\"yes\"), then perhaps the claim is incorrect because it says \"have 1...propose,\" which might imply it's being proposed or planned. However, since the table shows \"yes\" for park and ride in overlake village, that suggests it's already there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say they have a single park and ride project proposed, but the table doesn't show any indication of a proposal; instead, it shows existing ones. So if the claim is about proposing one, then it would be false because the data indicates they have at least one in place.\n\nWait, let me check all relevant cells:\n\n- For \"overlake village,\" looking under city/neighborhood: rows 12,13,14,15.\n- Park and ride column for these rows: row 12 is yes; row 13 is no? Wait, let me double-check the data.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\nRow 12: \"overlake village\", park and ride: yes\n\nRow 13: \"downtown bellevue\", park and ride: no\n\nRows 14-15: overlake transit center and hospital in bellevue have park and ride as yes or no. Wait, row 14 is hospital with yes? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the table has:\n\nLooking at the data rows again:\n\nRow 12: \"overlake village\", park and ride: yes\n\nRow 13: \"downtown bellevue\", park and ride: no\n\nRow 14: \"hospital\", park and ride: no\n\nRow 15: \"bellevue\", park and ride: no\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought overlake village had yes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me re-examine the data:\n\nLooking at the json data provided:\n\nThe relevant rows for overlake are rows 12-15.\n\nRow 12: \"overlake village\", park and ride: yes\n\nRow 13: \"downtown bellevue\", park and ride: no\n\nRow 14: \"hospital\", park and ride: no\n\nRow 15: \"bellevue\", park and ride: no\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. So in row 12, overlake village has yes for park and ride.\n\nBut the claim is about having one park and ride project proposed. If it's already there (yes), then perhaps the proposal isn't necessary anymore. Or maybe the claim is trying to say they have one that was proposed, but according to the table, it's operational.\n\nSo, based on this, the overlake village does have a park and ride, so the claim saying they have 1 park and ride project propose would be incorrect because it's not a proposal anymore; it's already there. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut I need to make sure about the relevant cells:\n\nThe columns we need are:\n\n- city/neighborhood: overlake village appears in row 12,13,14,15\n- park and ride: yes for row 12\n\nSo the only relevant cell is row 12's park and ride column.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim \"the redondo / star lake station be fund by st2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand each part of the claim.\n\nThe claim has two main parts: the station name and the funding source. The station in question is \"redondo / star lake\". Looking at the table, I need to find a row where the first column (station) matches this name. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one. The columns are: station, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, funded by ST2.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Station is \"boeing access road\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 1: \"jackson park\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"shoreline\" \u2013 no.\nRow 3: \"mountlake terrace\" \u2013 no.\nRow 4: \"lynnwood\" \u2013 no.\nRow 5: \"alderwood\" \u2013 no.\nRow 6: \"164th / ash way\" \u2013 no.\nRow 7: \"everett station\" \u2013 no.\nRow 8: \"highline community college\" \u2013 no.\nRow 9: \"redondo / star lake\" \u2013 yes, this is the row we need. \n\nNow, looking at the funding column, which is the fifth column (index 5) because it's the sixth element in each row. In row 9, the value for funded by ST2 is \"yes\". So that's a match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are at row 9, column \"funded by st2\".\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"funded by st2\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Bellevue have a station proposed at a hospital\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which parts of the claim correspond to the columns in the table. The claim mentions \"Bellevue,\" \"station,\" and \"hospital.\" Looking at the table's columns: station, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, funded by st2.\n\nThe relevant columns here are likely \"station\" and possibly \"city / neighborhood\" since the claim refers to a specific location in Bellevue. The other columns don't seem directly related.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row of the table for entries where both \"station\" is present and the city/neighborhood is \"Bellevue.\" Let me go row by row:\n\n1. The first row doesn't mention Bellevue.\n2. The second row mentions \"shoreline.\"\n3. Third row again is about \"shoreline.\"\n4. Fourth and fifth rows are about \"mountlake terrace\" and \"lynnwood,\" respectively.\n5. Sixth and seventh rows talk about \"alderwood\" and \"164th / ash way,\" neither of which is Bellevue.\n6. Eighth row refers to \"everett station,\" so that's not Bellevue.\n7. Ninth through thirteenth rows: Looking at these, they start with \"highline community college\" down to \"se redmond.\" None of them have a station named in the first cell as \"Bellevue.\"\n8. Wait, actually looking closer, I might have missed some. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I skipped over some rows that mention Bellevue specifically for the city/neighborhood. For example:\n\nLooking at row 10: [\n    \"hospital\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"bellevue\",\n    \"2021\",\n    \"no\",\n    \"yes\"\n]\n\nHere, the station is listed as \"hospital,\" not as a general Bellevue station. So this might be relevant because it mentions Bellevue and a station, but the name of the station is \"hospital.\" The claim says a station is proposed at a hospital, so if there's a station named \"Hospital\" in Bellevue, that would support the claim.\n\nAlso, looking for other rows with Bellevue:\n\nRow 11: [\n    \"120th\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"bellevue\",\n    \"2021\",\n    \"no\",\n    \"yes\"\n]\n\nHere, the station is \"120th,\" which isn't a hospital. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\nSimilarly, row 12: [\n    \"130th\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"bellevue\",\n    \"2021\",\n    \"yes\",\n    \"yes\"\n]\n\nStation name is \"130th.\" Not relevant for the hospital claim.\n\nRow 13: [\n    \"overlake village\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"overlake\",\n    \"2021\",\n    \"yes\",\n    \"yes\"\n]\n\nThis is about Overlake, not Bellevue.\n\nRow 14: [\n    \"overlake transit center\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"overlake\",\n    \"2021\",\n    \"yes\",\n    \"yes\"\n]\n\nAgain, Overlake, not Bellevue.\n\nRow 15: [\n    \"se redmond\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"redmond\",\n    \"unknown\",\n    \"no\",\n    \"no\"\n]\n\nRedmond is another location, so no match.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused some rows. Let me recount properly:\n\nLooking at the data array, which has 19 rows (0 to 18). Each row corresponds to a station.\n\nRows that mention \"Bellevue\" in the city/neighborhood column are rows 10 through 13 and 15? Wait, let me check each row's third element:\n\nRow 0: tukwila\nRow1: shoreline\nRow2: shoreline\nRow3: mountlake terrace\nRow4: lynnwood\nRow5: alderwood mall , lynnwood\nRow6: lynnwood\nRow7: everett\nRow8: des moines\nRow9: federal way\nRow10: fife\nWait, actually, I think I misread earlier. Let me check each row's third element accurately.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: tukwila\n- Row1: shoreline\n- Row2: shoreline\n- Row3: mountlake terrace\n- Row4: lynnwood\n- Row5: alderwood mall , lynnwood\n- Row6: 164th / ash way\n- Row7: everett\n- Row8: des moines\n- Row9: federal way\n- Row10: fife\n- Row11: bellevue (row 11's third element is bellevue)\nWait, no. Let me count from the start:\n\nThe data array has rows as follows:\n\n0: [\n    \"hospital\",\n    \"east link\",\n    \"bellevue\",\n    ...\n]\n\nWait, that can't be right because the station name in row 10 is \"hospital,\" and the city/neighborhood is \"bellevue.\" So in row 10, the station is \"hospital\" in Bellevue.\n\nSo, in row 10:\n\n- Station: hospital\n- City/neighborhood: bellevue\n\nThat's relevant because it mentions a station proposed (as per the table) at a hospital in Bellevue. The claim says \"Bellevue have a station proposed at a hospital,\" which aligns with this.\n\nAdditionally, in rows 11 and 12, the city/neighborhood is still Bellevue, but the stations are \"120th\" and \"130th.\" So only row10 matches both criteria: station name related to a hospital and located in Bellevue.\n\nTherefore, there's a station named \"hospital\" proposed in Bellevue. The claim is stating that such a station exists, which it does according to the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by information from row 10 of the table, where a station named \"hospital\" is listed under Bellevue. This matches the description of a station proposed at a hospital in Bellevue.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"station\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The data rows have various stations and their details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"overlake village\" specifically. So I need to find any row where the city or neighborhood is overlake village. Let me scan through each row's third column for that term.\n\nLooking at row 18: station is overlake transit center, extension east link, city/neighborhood overlake, projected opening 2021, park and ride yes, funded by st2 yes. So that's one relevant cell: row_index 18, column \"park and ride\".\n\nWait, but the claim says they haven't been proposed. However, in this row, park and ride is marked as yes. That suggests a park and ride exists for overlake village. If it's present, then the claim is false.\n\nBut let me check other rows to make sure. Maybe another row with overlake village has different info? Wait, no, I think only row 18 refers to overlake transit center in overlake. The other relevant cell might be row 19: overlake village station, but looking at the data, I don't see a separate entry for overlake village as a station. It's either overlake or overlake transit center.\n\nWait, no, row 20 is se redmond, which is in redmond. So the only relevant row is row 18 where city/neighborhood is overlake and park and ride is yes.\n\nTherefore, since there's a 'yes' for park and ride in overlake village, the claim that one hasn't been proposed is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no park and ride has been proposed for Overlake Village.

The claim is: \"1 neighborhood doesn't have a station propose at a hospital.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each column in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are:\n- station\n- extension\n- city / neighborhood\n- projected opening\n- park and ride\n- funded by st2\n\nThe claim is about neighborhoods without a proposed station at a hospital, so the relevant columns are likely \"station\" and possibly \"city / neighborhood\" or \"hospital.\" Wait, I don't see a column named \"hospital.\" So maybe it's related to another column.\n\nLooking closer, the table includes entries like \"highline community college,\" but I'm looking for something related to hospitals. Scanning through each row:\n\n- In row 12: station is \"east link,\" city is \"bellevue,\" and there's a mention of \"hospital.\" The \"funded by st2\" column says \"yes.\"\n- So, this row has an entry that includes \"hospital.\" The relevant columns here would be the row index (12), \"station\" as \"east link,\" and possibly \"city / neighborhood\" as \"bellevue.\"\n\nWait, but does this mean that a hospital is located at the station? Or that it's proposed? The claim mentions \"doesn't have a station propose at a hospital.\" So I think the claim is suggesting that there's a neighborhood without such a station.\n\nLooking back, in row 12, the \"funded by st2\" column says \"yes,\" which might indicate that funding was received. But does this mean a proposed station? Or maybe it's already built. The station name is \"east link,\" and the city is \"bellevue.\" So perhaps the hospital is served by the east link station.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to a neighborhood not having a proposed station at a hospital. So I'm looking for a neighborhood where there isn't such a proposed station.\n\nLooking through other rows, row 6 mentions \"shoreline\" and \"north corridor hct,\" but no hospital reference. Row 7 is \"everett station,\" etc. None of them mention hospitals except row 12.\n\nSo in row 12, the neighborhood is \"bellevue,\" and it does have a station (east link) which is proposed or funded. So if the claim is that one neighborhood doesn't have such a proposal, then perhaps row 12 is not an example since it does have it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a neighborhood without any station propose at a hospital. If row 12 has a station and mentions a hospital, then perhaps other neighborhoods don't have this. For example, looking for rows where \"hospital\" is mentioned but the station isn't proposed or doesn't exist there.\n\nBut in the table, only row 12 mentions a hospital. So if that's the case, then maybe all other neighborhoods either have stations without hospitals or vice versa.\n\nWait, the claim says \"1 neighborhood doesn't have a station propose at a hospital.\" So perhaps one specific neighborhood lacks such a station proposal related to a hospital.\n\nLooking back, in row 12, the station is east link, and it's in bellevue. The \"funded by st2\" column is yes, so maybe that's a proposed or existing station serving a hospital.\n\nSo if other neighborhoods don't have this, then the claim would be true. But I need to find if there's at least one neighborhood without such a station propose at a hospital.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all neighborhoods do have it except one. Or maybe none do, making the claim false.\n\nWait, row 12 is the only one mentioning a hospital, so perhaps that's the one with a station proposal. So other neighborhoods don't have a proposed station at a hospital, which would make the claim true because there exists at least one neighborhood (like bellevue) without such a station.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the claim says \"1 neighborhood doesn't have...\" So if there is at least one, then the claim is true. If all have it, the claim is false.\n\nLooking through all rows, only row 12 mentions a hospital in the city/neighborhood column. The others don't mention hospitals. So perhaps the claim is saying that one neighborhood lacks such a station proposal related to a hospital. Since only bellevue has a hospital mentioned, and it does have a proposed station (east link), then maybe other neighborhoods do not have this.\n\nWait, but in row 12, \"funded by st2\" is yes, which might mean the station is built or proposed. So if other neighborhoods don't mention hospitals, they may not have such stations. Therefore, there are multiple neighborhoods without a station propose at a hospital, including bellevue? Or wait, no\u2014bellevue does have a station that's connected to a hospital.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- The claim is: \"1 neighborhood doesn't have a station propose at a hospital.\"\n\nSo it's saying one area lacks such a station.\n\nLooking for rows where the city/neighborhood is not associated with a hospital and doesn't have a station propose there.\n\nAlternatively, if in any row, the neighborhood has no station related to a hospital, then the claim could be true.\n\nBut from the table, only bellevue mentions a hospital. So perhaps all other neighborhoods don't mention hospitals, hence they don't have such stations proposed. Therefore, those neighborhoods would satisfy the claim that one neighborhood doesn't have it.\n\nSo if I can point to at least one neighborhood without such a station propose at a hospital, the claim is true.\n\nTherefore, since bellevue does have it, but others don't, then the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"city / neighborhood\"}]}",
