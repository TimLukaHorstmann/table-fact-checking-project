    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"warren kym perform 16 dance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking at the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table data.\n\nFirst, I should identify the key elements in the claim. The main points are:\n- \"warren kym\": This seems to be the name of a couple or performing group.\n- \"perform 16 dance\": This implies that they perform 16 dances.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The columns relevant here would likely be \"couple\" and \"number of dances\". So, I should check these two columns for the row where the couple is \"warren & kym\".\n\nLooking through each row in the \"data\" array:\n- Row 1: Couple is \"brooke & derek\" \u2014 not matching.\n- Row 2: Couple is \"warren & kym\" \u2014 this matches. So, I'll note that down.\n\nNow, for the number of dances in this row. The \"number of dances\" column shows 16 for this couple. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check specific cells in the table. The relevant cells are where the couple is \"warren & kym\" and the number of dances is 16.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify the key elements in the claim: \"warren kym\" and \"perform 16 dance\".\n2. Look for the row where the couple is \"warren & kym\". This is found in row 2.\n3. Check the number of dances in this row, which is 16.\n4. Since both parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row index 1 (second row) for \"couple\" column: \"warren & kym\".\n- Row index 1 (same row) for \"number of dances\" column: 16.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components to see what information it's providing. It mentions Rocco and Karina, so I'm looking for their row in the table. The claim also gives a total score of 89 points, number of dances as 5, and an average of 17.8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different couple or pair. The columns relevant here are \"couple\", \"total points\", \"number of dances\", and \"average\". \n\nI need to locate Rocco & Karina in the table. Scanning through the data, I see that one of the rows has \"rocco & karina\" as the couple. Let's find their row index. Starting from row 0, which is Brooke & Derek, then Warren & Kym (row 1), Lance & Lacey (row 2), Maurice & Cheryl (row 3), Cody & Julianne (row 4), Toni B & Alec (row 5), Susan & Tony D (row 6), Misty & Maksim (row 7), Ted & Inna (row 8), Kim K & Mark (row 9), Rocco & Karina is at row 10. Wait, no, let me recount. Wait, the first couple is row 0: Brooke & Derek, then 1: Warren, 2: Lance, 3:Maurice, 4:Cody, 5:Toni B, 6:Susan,7:Misty,8: Ted,9: Kim K,10: Rocco. Wait no, the data has rows from 0 to 12? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table's data starts with row indices as 0-11 because there are 12 entries. The first row is index 0, second 1, up to 11 at the last entry. So Rocco & Karina is in which row? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\nRow 0: Brooke & Derek\nRow 1: Warren & Kym\nRow 2: Lance & Lacey\nRow 3: Maurice & Cheryl\nRow 4: Cody & Julianne\nRow 5: Toni B & Alec\nRow 6: Susan & Tony D\nRow 7: Misty & Maksim\nRow 8: Ted & Inna\nRow 9: Kim K & Mark\nRow 10: Rocco & Karina\n\nWait, that's row 10. But looking at the data provided in the table:\n\nThe rows are listed as:\n\n0: brooke & derek,\n\n1: warren & kym,\n\n2: lance & lacey,\n\n3: maurice & cheryl,\n\n4: cody & julianne,\n\n5: toni b & alec,\n\n6: susan & tony d,\n\n7: misty & maksim,\n\n8: ted & inna,\n\n9: kim k & mark,\n\n10: rocco & karina,\n\n11: cloris & corky.\n\nWait, no, the last row is index 11. So Rocco & Karina are at row 10? Wait, let me count:\n\n0: brooke\n\n1: warren\n\n2: lance\n\n3: maurice\n\n4: cody\n\n5: toni b\n\n6: susan\n\n7: misty\n\n8: ted\n\n9: kim k\n\n10: rocco\n\n11: cloris.\n\nYes, Rocco & Karina are at row index 10. \n\nNow, looking at their data:\n\nAt row 10, \"rocco & karina\" have total points 89, number of dances 5, and average 17.8. So the claim states that they scored 89 points in 5 dances for an average of 17.8.\n\nSo, to verify, I need to check if these values match.\n\nFrom the table: \n\n- Total points: 89\n- Number of dances: 5\n- Average: 17.8\n\nAll three match exactly with the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Rocco & Karina's performance being 89 points in 5 dances for an average of 17.8 is fully supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"couple\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"total points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"average\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim that \"cody & julianne's average score be 22.5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The table has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. Each row represents a different couple with their corresponding data.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"cody & julianne\" and their average score. So I need to find the relevant row for this couple in the table.\n\nLooking at the \"couple\" column, which is the third column in each row, I can identify where \"cody & julianne\" are listed. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. brooke & derek\n2. warren & kym\n3. lance & lacey\n4. maurice & cheryl\n5. cody & julianne \u2013 found here.\n6. toni b & alec\n7. susan & tony d\n8. misty & maksim\n9. ted & inna\n10. kim k & mark\n11. rocco & karina\n12. cloris & corky\n\nSo \"cody & julianne\" are in the 5th row (index 4 if we start from 0). Wait, no, actually, each sublist is a row, so the first sublist is index 0, and the fifth one is index 4.\n\nNow, looking at their data. The columns relevant to the claim are \"average\", as that's what the claim is about. So I need to find the value in the \"average\" column for this couple.\n\nIn row 4 (cody & julianne), let's see:\n\n- rank by average: 5\n- place: 4\n- couple: cody & julianne\n- total points: 292\n- number of dances: 13\n- average: 22.5\n\nYes, that's exactly the information we're looking for. So their average score is indeed 22.5.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure there are no other instances or mistakes. Let me confirm the row index and column name again.\n\nThe relevant cells would be where \"couple\" is \"cody & julianne\", which is in the 5th position of the data array (index 4). The corresponding average is 22.5, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}]}",

The claim is: \"there be more than 20 dance warren & kym have do together.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. Looking at the table columns, the relevant columns are \"number of dances\" because that's about how many dances they've done. So I need to find Warren & Kym's row and check their number of dances.\n\nLooking at the data rows, each row has a couple's name. Scanning through, I see that one of the rows is \"warren & kym.\" Let me find which row that is. It's the second row in the data array (since it's zero-indexed, it's index 1). \n\nIn that row, under \"number of dances,\" the value is 16. So they've done 16 dances together.\n\nThe claim says more than 20 dances. Since 16 is less than 20, the claim isn't supported by this information.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"22.3 be the average for cody & julianne\" is true based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim means. The claim is making two statements: that 22.3 is the average and that it's for \"cody & julianne\". So I need to check if in the table there's an entry where both conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. The data rows have these columns filled in. Each row represents a different couple, their performance details, etc.\n\nI need to find the specific row for \"cody & julianne\". Scanning through the 'couple' column: 1st row is \"brooke & derek\", 2nd is \"warren & kym\", third is \"lance & lacey\", fourth is \"maurice & cheryl\", fifth is \"cody & julianne\" \u2013 there we go, that's the couple. Now I need to check their average.\n\nLooking at the 'average' column for this row: it says 22.5. Wait, but the claim says 22.3. That doesn't match. So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The fifth row (index 4) has \"cody & julianne\" as the couple. Their average is listed as 22.5. So yes, it's not 22.3.\n\nBut wait, could there be another row that also mentions \"cody & julianne\"? No, each row seems to have a unique couple, so only one entry for them. Therefore, their average is definitely 22.5 in the table, which doesn't match 22.3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the row index or the columns. Let me count again: rows are from 0 to 12, right? So the fifth data array (index 4) is cody & julianne with average 22.5. No, it's consistent.\n\nSo the claim is stating that 22.3 is their average, but according to the table, it's 22.5.
