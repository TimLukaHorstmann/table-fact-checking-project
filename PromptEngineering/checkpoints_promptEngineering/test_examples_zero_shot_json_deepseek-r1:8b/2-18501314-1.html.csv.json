    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim that \"mark lillis have the most total goal of anyone in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Mark Lillis in the table. Looking at the data rows, I see Mark Lillis is the 10th entry (since it's the 11th element starting from 0). Wait, no, let me count properly: the first row is Terry Austin, then Malcolm Brown, and so on until Mark Lillis is the 10th in the array because arrays are zero-indexed. So his data is at index 10.\n\nNext, I need to check the \"total goals\" column for Mark Lillis. From the table, each row has several columns, and the last one is \"total goals.\" Looking at Mark's row: [ \"mark lillis\", \"mf\", \"46\", 20, \"4\", 0, 6, 0, \"56\", 20 ]. So the total goals for Mark Lillis are 20.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this is indeed the highest among all players. To do that, I should compare his total goals with others. Let's go through each player:\n\n1. Terry Austin: Total Goals - 0\n2. Malcolm Brown: 11\n3. David Burke: 1\n4. David Cowling: 8\n5. Brian Cox: 0\n6. Maurice Cox: 1\n7. Steve Doyle: 2\n8. Roy Greenwood: 0\n9. Keith Hanvey: 4\n10. Timothy Hotte: 0\n11. Mick Laverick: 0\n12. Mark Lillis: 20\n13. Keith Mason: 0\n14. Daral Pugh: 2\n15. Colin Russell: 17\n16. Brian Stanton: 17\n17. Kevin Stonehouse: 0\n18. Dave Sutton: 2\n19. Peter Valentine: 0\n20. Phil Wilson: 6\n\nLooking at the numbers, Mark Lillis has 20 total goals, which seems to be the highest in this list. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any higher numbers.\n\nWait, Colin Russell and Brian Stanton both have 17 each, which is less than 20. No one else has more than that. So yes, Mark Lillis does have the highest total goals at 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"total goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 - 82 season",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 - 82 season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about the number of forwards in a specific season, which is mentioned as \"1982 - 82\". Wait, that seems a bit odd because it's written as \"1982 - 82.\" Maybe it's a typo or shorthand for the 1981-82 season? That would make more sense because 82 could be a shorthand for 1982. So I'll assume they're referring to the 1981-82 season.\n\nNext, I need to look at the table provided to find information about players who are forwards in that season. The table has several columns, and each row represents a player with their details. The relevant column here is \"name\" and \"position,\" but more specifically, since the claim is about forwards, I should focus on the \"position\" of each player.\n\nLooking at the data in the table, each row has a \"position\" value. For example, the first row lists Terry Austin as a \"fw,\" which I assume stands for forward. Similarly, I'll go through each player's position to count how many are forwards.\n\nLet me list out all the players and their positions:\n\n1. Terry Austin - fw\n2. Malcolm Brown - df (defender)\n3. David Burke - df\n4. David Cowling - mf (midfielder)\n5. Brian Cox - gk (goalkeeper)\n6. Maurice Cox - mf\n7. Steve Doyle - mf\n8. Roy Greenwood - df\n9. Keith Hanvey - df\n10. Timothy Hotte - fw\n11. Mick Laverick - mf\n12. Mark Lillis - mf\n13. Keith Mason - gk\n14. Daral Pugh - mf\n15. Colin Russell - fw\n16. Brian Stanton - mf\n17. Kevin Stonehouse - fw\n18. Dave Sutton - df\n19. Peter Valentine - df\n20. Phil Wilson - mf\n\nNow, let's count how many forwards (fw) are in this list.\n\n1. Terry Austin - 1 forward\n2. Timothy Hotte - 1 forward\n3. Colin Russell - 1 forward\n4. Kevin Stonehouse - 1 forward\n\nSo that makes a total of 4 forwards.\n\nWait, but I need to check the season specified in the claim. The user mentioned \"1982 - 82.\" If this refers to the 1981-82 season, does the table cover that period? Or is it possible that the data only goes up to a certain year?\n\nLooking at the players' names and their positions, I don't see any dates or years in the data. The table seems to list multiple players, but without context about which season each player was active in. So, there's no direct way to confirm whether these 4 forwards were indeed playing in the 1981-82 season.\n\nHowever, since all the forwards listed are from what appears to be the same dataset and assuming that this data represents the 1981-82 season, it's plausible that the claim is true. But without explicit information about the season for each player, there's an assumption being made here.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the \"position\" abbreviation can help. All forwards are listed as \"fw,\" so four players fit that role. The claim says four people play forward in that season, and based on this count, it seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if any player might have been a forward in another position, or if there's overlapping roles. For example, midfielders can sometimes play as forwards, but in this context, \"mf\" is clearly midfield, and \"df\" is defender, so that shouldn't affect the count of forwards.\n\nAlso, it's possible that the user made a mistake in specifying the season. If they meant 1982, maybe it's the 1981-82 season, or perhaps another season where these players were active. Without more data, I can't be entirely certain, but based on the information given, there are four forwards listed.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim is that four people played forward in a specific season, and according to the table, four players have \"fw\" as their position. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true, I analyzed the provided table for players who are forwards (denoted by \"fw\") in the specified season. The count of such players equals four, aligning with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the data rows, Malcolm Brown is the second entry (row index 1), and David Burke is the third entry (row index 2). \n\nNext, I need to find the relevant columns for their total apps. From the table's structure, the \"total apps\" column seems to be the ninth one in each row.\n\nSo, for Malcolm Brown, his total apps are found in row 1 at column 9. The value there is \"56\". For David Burke, his total apps are in row 2 at column 9, which is also \"56\".\n\nNow, the claim says that Malcolm has 3 more apps than David. Let's subtract their totals: 56 (Malcolm) minus 56 (David) equals 0.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Brian Stanton be 1 of 2 people who have more than 0 FA Cup goal.\" So, I need to find Brian Stanton in the table and check if he has more than 0 goals in the FA Cup. Additionally, I need to make sure that exactly one other person also has more than 0 FA Cup goals.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns like name, position, league apps, league goals, etc., including fa cup apps and fa cup goals. So, for each player, their FA Cup goals are listed in one of the cells.\n\nI need to find Brian Stanton's row and check his FA Cup goals. Let me search through the data rows.\n\nScanning down the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 0: terry austin\n- Row1: malcolm brown\n- Row2: david burke\n- Row3: david cowling\n- Row4: brian cox\n- Row5: maurice cox\n- Row6: steve doyle\n- Row7: roy greenwood\n- Row8: keith hanvey\n- Row9: timothy hotte\n- Row10: mick laverick\n- Row11: mark lillis\n- Row12: keith mason\n- Row13: daral pugh\n- Row14: colin russell\n- Row15: brian stanton\n- Row16: kevin stonehouse\n- Row17: dave sutton\n- Row18: peter valentine\n- Row19: phil wilson\n\nSo Brian Stanton is in row 15.\n\nLooking at his FA Cup goals, the relevant column is \"fa cup goals\". From the table, each player's data includes this. For Brian Stanton (row15), I need to look at the cell under \"fa cup goals\".\n\nIn the data for Brian Stanton: [\"brian stanton\", \"mf\", \"40 (4)\", 13, \"4\", 2, 6, 2, \"50 (4)\", 17]. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nEach player's row is an array where the first element is their name, then position, followed by various stats. The columns are: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, total goals.\n\nSo for Brian Stanton, the FA Cup goals are the 5th element in his row (since it's zero-indexed). Let me count:\n\n0: name\n1: position\n2: league apps\n3: league goals\n4: fa cup apps\n5: fa cup goals\n6: league cup apps\n7: league cup goals\n8: total apps\n9: total goals\n\nSo for Brian Stanton, the 5th element is \"2\". So his FA Cup goals are 2.\n\nSince 2 > 0, he has more than 0 FA Cup goals. Now, I need to check how many other players have more than 0 in fa cup goals.\n\nI'll go through each player:\n\n1. terry austin: fa cup goals = 0 \u2192 no\n2. malcolm brown: fa cup goals =1 \u2192 yes (count=1)\n3. david burke: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n4. david cowling: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n5. brian cox: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n6. maurice cox: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n7. steve doyle: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n8. roy greenwood: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n9. keith hanvey: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n10. timothy hotte: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n11. mick laverick: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n12. mark lillis: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n13. keith mason: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n14. daral pugh: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n15. colin russell: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n16. kevin stonehouse: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n17. dave sutton: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n18. peter valentine: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n19. phil wilson: fa cup goals=0 \u2192 no\n\nWait, only malcolm brown has more than 0 FA Cup goals with a value of 1. Brian Stanton is the second person with FA Cup goals >0.\n\nSo the claim says \"Brian Stanton be 1 of 2 people who have more than 0 FA Cup goal.\" That would mean exactly one other person besides him has more than 0, which is correct because only malcolm brown does.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":15, \"column_name\":\"fa cup goals\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"mark lillis be tie for most total goal of the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems that Mark Lillis might have tied with another player for the highest number of goals in the league during the season. So, my task is to find out if Mark Lillis has the highest total goals and whether someone else also shares this record.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player's statistics. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"name\" (to identify the player) and \"total goals\". \n\nI'll start by locating Mark Lillis in the table. Scanning through the data rows, I find him in row 10:\n\n[\n  \"mark lillis\",\n  \"mf\",\n  \"46\",\n  20,\n  \"4\",\n  0,\n  6,\n  0,\n  \"56\",\n  20\n]\n\nFrom this, his total goals are 20. Now, I need to check if any other player has the same total goals as Mark Lillis.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to find the highest number of total goals:\n\n- Terry Austin: 0\n- Malcolm Brown: 11\n- David Burke: 1\n- David Cowling: 8\n- Brian Cox: 0\n- Maurice Cox: 1\n- Steve Doyle: 2\n- Roy Greenwood: 0\n- Keith Hanvey: 4\n- Timothy Hotte: 0\n- Mick Laverick: 0\n- Mark Lillis: 20\n- Keith Mason: 0\n- Daral Pugh: 2\n- Colin Russell:17\n- Brian Stanton:17\n- Kevin Stonehouse:0\n- Dave Sutton:2\n- Peter Valentine:0\n- Phil Wilson:6\n\nFrom this list, the highest total goals are 20 by Mark Lillis and 17 by both Colin Russell and Brian Stanton. \n\nSo, Mark Lillis has 20 goals, which is higher than Colin Russell's 17. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, in the table, under \"total goals\", Mark Lillis has 20. Now, looking again at the data:\n\n- Mark Lillis: 20\n- Colin Russell:17\n- Brian Stanton:17\n\nSo, Mark's total is higher than both. Therefore, he doesn't tie with them; he surpasses them.\n\nWait, that contradicts my initial thought. So, actually, no one else has a higher total goals than Mark Lillis. So the claim would be TRUE because Mark is the sole leader, not tied.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread someone's data. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at Colin Russell: his row shows \"colin russell\", \"fw\", \"41\", 16, ... and under total goals it's 17? Wait no, in the data, for Colin Russell, the row is:\n\n[\n  \"colin russell\",\n  \"fw\",\n  \"41\",\n  16,\n  \"4\",\n  0,\n  4,\n  1,\n  \"49\",\n  17\n]\n\nYes, total goals are 17. Similarly, Brian Stanton's row is:\n\n[\n  \"brian stanton\",\n  \"mf\",\n  \"40 (4)\",\n  13,\n  \"4\",\n  2,\n  6,\n  2,\n  \"50 (4)\",\n  17\n]\n\nSo both have 17 total goals. Mark Lillis has 20, which is higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Mark Lillis ties for the most total goals is FALSE because he's actually leading, not tied.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mark Lillis ties for the highest total goals. Upon reviewing the table, Mark has 20 total goals, while others like Colin Russell and Brian Stanton have 17 each. Since 20 is higher than 17, there's no tie.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the columns, the FA Cup goals are listed in the column \"fa cup goals\". So I'll focus on that column for each player named Brian Stanton.\n\nLooking through the data rows, I need to find any row where the name is Brian Stanton and see if there's a FA Cup goal recorded. Let me scan each row:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin - not Brian.\nRow 1: Malcolm Brown - nope.\n...\nContinuing until I reach row number 12 for Brian Stanton.\n\nIn row 12, under \"fa cup goals\", it says 2.

But looking at the data, there are others with FA Cup goals. For example, row 3 (David Cowling) has 0, but I think that's because they might not have scored. Wait no, let me check each player.\n\nWait, actually, in the \"fa cup goals\" column:\n\n- Row 1: Malcolm Brown has 1.\n- Row 4: Brian Cox has 0.\n- Row 6: Steve Doyle has 0.\n- Row 9: Colin Russell has 0.\n- Row 14: Peter Valentine has 0.\n- Row 15: Phil Wilson has 0.\n\nWait, no, maybe I was wrong.

So my goal is to check if exactly five players have their position listed as 'fw' and are contributing to the league apps and goals.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns include \"name,\" \"position,\" \"league apps,\" etc. So the relevant column here would be the \"position\" column because we're interested in players who are forwards.\n\nI need to go through each row and check if the position is 'fw' and then count how many such entries there are, specifically looking at their league apps and goals to ensure they have played enough to be considered as part of the team this season. But wait, the claim doesn't specify whether it's about starting lineup or just any appearances. Since the table includes \"league apps,\" which probably refers to total league appearances, I should consider players who have made at least some appearances in the league.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Terry Austin - position 'fw' with 3 league apps.\n2. Maurice Cox - position 'mf', so not a forward.\n3. Steve Doyle - 'mf'.\n4. Roy Greenwood - 'df', so not a forward.\n5. Keith Hanvey - 'df'.\n6.

Let me list all the 'position' entries:\n\n0: fw\n\n1: df\n\n2: df\n\n3: df\n\n4: gk\n\n5: mf\n\n6: mf\n\n7: df\n\n8: mf\n\n9: df\n\n10: df\n\n11: mf\n\n12: gk\n\n13: mf\n\n14: fw (Terry Austin)\n\n15: fw (Timothy Hotte)\n\n16: fw (Colin Russell)\n\n17: fw (Kevin Stonehouse)\n\nWait, no, actually looking at the data rows:\n\nRow 0: position is 'fw'\n\nRow 5: position is 'mf'\n\nRow 8: position is 'df'\n\nRow 15: position is 'fw' (I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount with more attention.)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the positions. Let me list each row's position:\n\n- Row 0: fw\n\n- Row 1: df\n\n- Row 2: df\n\n- Row 3: df\n\n- Row 4: gk\n\n- Row 5: mf\n\n- Row 6: mf\n\n- Row 7: df\n\n- Row 8: mf\n\n- Row 9: df\n\n- Row 10: df\n\n- Row 11: mf\n\n- Row 12: gk\n\n- Row 13: mf\n\n- Row 14: fw (Timothy Hotte)\n\nWait, no. The rows are numbered from 0 to 15 because there are 16 rows in the table (from 0 to 15). Let me list each row's position correctly:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin - 'fw'\n\nRow 1: Maurice Cox - 'mf'?\n\nWait, looking back at the user's data, perhaps I misaligned the positions. The table has 16 entries, so rows 0-15.\n\nEach row starts with the name and then the position. For example:\n\nRow 0:\n\n\"name\": \"Terry Austin\",\n\n\"position\": \"fw\"\n\nSimilarly,\n\nRow 1:\n\n\"name\": \"Maurice Cox\",\n\n\"position\": \"mf\"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo let's list each row's position correctly:\n\n0: fw\n\n1: mf\n\n2: df\n\n3: df\n\n4: gk\n\n5: mf\n\n6: mf\n\n7: df\n\n8: mf\n\n9: df\n\n10: df\n\n11: mf\n\n12: gk\n\n13: mf\n\n14: fw\n\n15: df\n\nWait, no. The last few rows:\n\nRow 13: Phil Wilson - position 'mf'\n\nRow 14: Dave Sutton? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table provided, each row is an object within the array. So perhaps it's better to list each row's name and position as per the data:\n\nLet me try to list each row with their positions:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin - 'fw'\n\nRow 1: Maurice Cox - 'mf'\n\nRow 2: Steve Doyle - 'mf'\n\nRow 3: Roy Greenwood - 'df'\n\nRow 4: Keith Hanvey - 'df'\n\nRow 5: Timothy Hotte - 'fw'\n\nRow 6: Colin Russell - 'df'? Wait, no, the data shows:\n\nLooking back at the user's table:\n\nIn row 15 (last one), name is Phil Wilson, position is 'mf'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just go through each row and note their positions.\n\nI think a better approach is to list all 16 rows with their names and positions:\n\n1. Terry Austin - fw\n\n2. Maurice Cox - mf\n\n3. Steve Doyle - mf\n\n4. Roy Greenwood - df\n\n5. Keith Hanvey - df\n\n6. Timothy Hotte - fw\n\n7. Colin Russell - df? Or 'fw'? Wait, in the table, the 15th row (index 15) is:\n\n\"name\": \"Phil Wilson\",\n\n\"position\": \"mf\"\n\nWait no, looking at the data, perhaps I misread some rows. Let me check each row properly.\n\nFrom the user's data:\n\nThe array starts with Terry Austin as index 0.\n\nLet me list each row's name and position:\n\n0: Terry Austin - fw\n\n1: Maurice Cox - mf\n\n2: Steve Doyle - mf\n\n3: Roy Greenwood - df\n\n4: Keith Hanvey - df\n\n5: Timothy Hotte - fw\n\n6: Colin Russell - df? Or is it 'fw'? Wait, looking at the data:\n\nWait, in the user's table, row 15 (index 15) is Phil Wilson with position 'mf'. But I think I might have misaligned some positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just focus on the 'position' column and count how many times 'fw' appears.\n\nLooking through each row's 'position' value:\n\n- Row 0: fw\n\n- Rows 1,2,3,4: mf, mf, df, df\n\n- Row 5: fw\n\n- Rows 6,7,8,9,10,11: mf, df, mf, df, df, mf\n\n- Row 12: gk\n\n- Row 13: mf\n\n- Row 14: Dave Sutton - df\n\n- Row 15: Phil Wilson - mf\n\nSo the 'position' column has:\n\n1. Terry Austin - fw (row 0)\n\n2. Maurice Cox - mf (row 1)\n\n3. Steve Doyle - mf (row 2)\n\n4. Roy Greenwood - df (row 3)\n\n5. Keith Hanvey - df (row 4)\n\n6. Timothy Hotte - fw (row 5)\n\n7. Colin Russell - df (row 6? Or is it 'mf'?) Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the user's table, the array has 16 elements, indices 0-15.\n\nLooking at index 6:\n\n\"name\": \"Colin Russell\",\n\n\"position\": \"df\"\n\nSimilarly, index 5: Timothy Hotte - position 'fw'.\n\nSo let me count all 'fw' positions:\n\nRows where position is 'fw':\n\n- Row 0: Terry Austin\n\n- Row 5: Timothy Hotte\n\nThat's two.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed some. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: fw \u2192 count=1\n\nRow 1: mf \u2192 no\n\nRow 2: mf \u2192 no\n\nRow 3: df \u2192 no\n\nRow 4: df \u2192 no\n\nRow 5: fw \u2192 count=2\n\nRows 6-15:\n\nRow 6: Colin Russell - df \u2192 no\n\nRow7: Keith Hanvey - df? Or is it 'mf'? Wait, looking at the data:\n\nWait, in the user's table, for example, row 4 is:\n\n\"name\": \"Keith Hanvey\",\n\n\"position\": \"df\"\n\nSimilarly, row 5 is Timothy Hotte with position 'fw'.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow6: Colin Russell - df\n\nRow7: ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is only two 'fw' entries.\n\nThus, in total, there are two players with position 'fw': Terry Austin and Timothy Hotte.\n\nTherefore, the number of players who play as forwards (assuming 'fw' stands for forward) is two.\n\nBut perhaps I missed some rows. Let me check each row's position:\n\nRows 0-15:\n\n0: fw\n\n1: mf\n\n2: mf\n\n3: df\n\n4: df\n\n5: fw\n\n6: df\n\n7: mf\n\n8: mf\n\n9: df\n\n10: df\n\n11: mf\n\n12: gk\n\n13: mf\n\n14: df\n\n15: mf\n\nSo 'fw' appears only in rows 0 and 5. So two players.\n\nTherefore, the number of forwards is two.\n</think>\n\nThe number of players who play as forwards (assuming \"fw\" stands for forward) is **two**.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: Determine how many players have the position \"forward,\" denoted by \"fw.\"\n\n2. **Review the Data Set**: Analyze each player's position listed in the provided data array.\n\n3. **Count the \"fw\" Entries**: Go through each row, checking if the \"position\" field is \"fw.\"\n\n4. **Tally the Results**: Find that \"fw\" appears twice in the list.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: There are exactly two players who play as forwards.\n\nAnswer: 2",

    "claim": "david burke have 3 more total apps than malcolm brown",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"david burke have 3 more total apps than malcolm brown\". Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure provided in JSON format. The columns are \"name\", \"position\", \"league apps\", \"league goals\", \"fa cup apps\", \"fa cup goals\", \"league cup apps\", \"league cup goals\", \"total apps\", and \"total goals\". Each row represents a different player, their position, and various statistics across different competitions.\n\nThe claim is comparing two players: David Burke and Malcolm Brown. The specific comparison is about the number of total applications (apps). The claim says that David Burke has 3 more total apps than Malcolm Brown.\n\nTo verify this, I need to find the relevant data points for both players in the \"total apps\" column. So, I'll start by identifying which rows correspond to each player.\n\nLooking through the table's data array:\n\n1. The first row is Terry Austin.\n2. Second row: Malcolm Brown.\n3. Third row: David Burke.\n4. Fourth row: David Cowling.\n5. Fifth row: Brian Cox.\n6. Sixth row: Maurice Cox.\n7. Seventh row: Steve Doyle.\n8. Eighth row: Roy Greenwood.\n9. Ninth row: Keith Hanvey.\n10. Tenth row: Timothy Hotte.\n11. Eleventh row: Mick Laverick.\n12. Twelfth row: Mark Lillis.\n13. Thirteenth row: Keith Mason.\n14. Fourteenth row: Daral Pugh.\n15. Fifteenth row: Colin Russell.\n16. Sixteenth row: Brian Stanton.\n17. Seventeenth row: Kevin Stonehouse.\n18. Eighteenth row: Dave Sutton.\n19. Nineteenth row: Peter Valentine.\n20. Twentieth row: Phil Wilson.\n\nSo, Malcolm Brown is in the second row, and David Burke is in the third row. Now, I need to look at their \"total apps\" column values.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- For Malcolm Brown (row 1), total apps are listed as \"56\".\n- For David Burke (row 2), total apps are listed as \"53\".\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't add up. The claim says David Burke has 3 more than Malcolm Brown. So, according to this, David Burke has 53 and Malcolm Brown has 56. That would mean Malcolm Brown actually has more total apps than David Burke. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I misread the rows. Let me double-check the data:\n\nLooking at row indexes (starting from 0):\n\n- Row 1: Malcolm Brown\n  - \"total apps\": 56\n\n- Row 2: David Burke\n  - \"total apps\": 53\n\nSo yes, Malcolm Brown has more total apps than David Burke by 3. Therefore, the claim that David Burke has 3 more is FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the rows. The second row is indeed Malcolm Brown, and the third row is David Burke. So their positions are correct.\n\nSo, in terms of relevant cells, I need to point out which cells are being compared. That would be the \"total apps\" column for both players. So, for Malcolm Brown, it's row 1 (index 1) and column \"total apps\". For David Burke, it's row 2 (index 2), same column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include these two cells: one from row 1, total apps; another from row 2, total apps.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that David Burke has 3 more total apps than Malcolm Brown. However, upon reviewing the table, it's clear that Malcolm Brown actually has 56 total apps, while David Burke has 53. This means David Burke does not have more apps but fewer. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"dave sutton and phil wilson both have 44 league apps.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate where Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson are in the table. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the data, I see that Dave Sutton's row has \"df\" as his position, and under \"league apps,\" it shows \"41\". So Dave Sutton doesn't have 44 league apps; he has 41. \n\nNow, checking Phil Wilson: his row also lists \"df\" as his position. The \"league apps\" column for him says \"45.\" So Phil Wilson has 45 league apps, not 44.\n\nTherefore, both of them don't have 44 league apps. The claim is false.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. For each person, their row index and the \"league apps\" column are important. \n\nFor Dave Sutton: He's in row_index 18 (since I'm counting from 0, but let me check\u2014wait, looking at the table, it starts with Terry Austin as row 0, then Malcolm Brown 1, ..., up to Phil Wilson being row 14 (as per the list provided). Wait no, let me count again. The table has 15 players listed, so each row is numbered from 0 to 14. \n\nLooking at Dave Sutton: his name appears in the 18th row? Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's recount the rows:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin\n1: Malcolm Brown\n2: David Burke\n3: David Cowling\n4: Brian Cox\n5: Maurice Cox\n6: Steve Doyle\n7: Roy Greenwood\n8: Keith Hanvey\n9: Timothy Hotte\n10: Mick Laverick\n11: Mark Lillis\n12: Keith Mason\n13: Daral Pugh\n14: Colin Russell\n15: Brian Stanton\n16: Kevin Stonehouse\n17: Dave Sutton\n18: Peter Valentine\n19: Phil Wilson\n\nWait, no. The table has 14 players, not 15, because the last name is Phil Wilson at row 14 (since it's zero-indexed). So I might have miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me list them properly:\n\n0: Terry Austin\n1: Malcolm Brown\n2: David Burke\n3: David Cowling\n4: Brian Cox\n5: Maurice Cox\n6: Steve Doyle\n7: Roy Greenwood\n8: Keith Hanvey\n9: Timothy Hotte\n10: Mick Laverick\n11: Mark Lillis\n12: Keith Mason\n13: Daral Pugh\n14: Colin Russell\n15: Brian Stanton\n16: Kevin Stonehouse\n17: Dave Sutton\n18: Peter Valentine\n19: Phil Wilson\n\nWait, that's 20 rows. But the table in the question lists only up to \"Phil wilson\" as the last row, which would be row index 14 if there are 15 players (0-14). Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct indices are:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin\n1: Malcolm Brown\n2: David Burke\n3: David Cowling\n4: Brian Cox\n5: Maurice Cox\n6: Steve Doyle\n7: Roy Greenwood\n8: Keith Hanvey\n9: Timothy Hotte\n10: Mick Laverick\n11: Mark Lillis\n12: Keith Mason\n13: Daral Pugh\n14: Colin Russell\n15: Brian Stanton\n16: Kevin Stonehouse\n17: Dave Sutton\n18: Peter Valentine\n19: Phil Wilson\n\nBut the original table lists 20 rows, but only up to \"Phil wilson\" as the last entry. Wait no, perhaps it's a typo in the question. Anyway, regardless of exact index, I can find Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson.\n\nDave Sutton is in the row where his name is listed. Looking at the data: his row has:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": x,\n  \"column_name\": \"league apps\",\n  value:41\n}\n\nSimilarly for Phil Wilson, it's:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": y,\n  \"column_name\": \"league apps\",\n  value:45\n}\n\nSo, their league apps are 41 and 45 respectively. Therefore, neither has 44.\n\nThe relevant cells would be the specific rows and column where their league apps are stated. So for Dave Sutton, I need his row index and the \"league apps\" column name, same for Phil Wilson.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
