    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dicky bond and bruce bannister share the lowest number of goal\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"share the lowest number of goal\" suggests that both Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister have the same lowest number of goals in their careers compared to all others listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: name, goals, apps, avge, career. The relevant column for this claim is \"goals\". So, I need to check how many goals each person scored and see if Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister both have the lowest number.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\n1. Bobby Campell: 121 goals\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 88\n3. Dean Windass: 76\n4. John Hallows: 74\n5. Joe Cooke: 68\n6. Gerry Ingram: 64\n7. Bobby Ham: 64\n8. David McNiven: 64\n9. Sean McCarthy: 63\n10. John Hall: 63\n11. David Jackson: 61\n12. Bruce Bannister: 60\n13. Dicky Bond: 60\n\nWait, so both Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond have 60 goals each. Now I need to check if this is the lowest number in the table.\n\nLooking at all the \"goals\" column values:\n\n121,88,76,74,68,64,64,64,63,63,61,60,60.\n\nThe numbers go from 60 up to 121. So 60 is indeed the lowest because it's less than 61 and all higher numbers above that. So both Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond have the same lowest number of goals, which is 60.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete have 64 goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the data to find Bobby Ham's information. The columns in the table are name, goals, apps, avge, and career. \n\nLooking at the table, there's a row with the name \"bobby ham\". Here's that row:\n[\n  \"bobby ham\",\n  64,\n  188,\n  0.34,\n  \"1967 - 1971 , 1973 - 1975\"\n]\n\nSo, Bobby Ham does have 64 goals. Now, the claim mentions two other athletes with 64 goals as well. I need to check if there are any other entries where the 'goals' column is 64.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n- The first athlete is Bobby Campbell: goals 121\n- Frank O'Rourke: 88\n- Dean Windass:76\n- John Hallows:74\n- Joe Cooke:68\n- Gerry Ingram:64 (Wait, here's another with 64)\n- Bobby Ham:64 (already considered)\n- David McNiven:64 (another one)\n- Sean McCarthy:63\n- John Hall:63\n- David Jackson:61\n- Bruce Bannister:60\n- Dicky Bond:60\n\nSo, besides Bobby Ham, Gerry Ingram and David McNiven also have 64 goals. That makes three athletes in total with 64 goals, not just two. Wait, the claim says \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete.\" So if there are actually three athletes (Bobby Ham plus two others), that would make the claim false because it's saying only two others.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's 'goals' column:\nRow 0:121\n1:88\n2:76\n3:74\n4:68\n5:64 (Gerry)\n6:64 (Bobby Ham)\n7:64 (David McNiven)\n8:63\n9:63\n10:61\n11:60\n12:60\n\nSo yes, there are three athletes with 64 goals: Gerry Ingram, Bobby Ham, and David McNiven. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that Bobby Ham and two others have 64 goals when in reality there are actually three athletes (Bobby Ham plus two others). Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"2 other athlete,\" so maybe if only two besides Bobby Ham have 64? But according to the data, Gerry and David also have 64. So that's three athletes total with 64.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim is: \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete have 64 goal.\" So does it mean exactly two others, making a total of three? Or does it mean two in addition to Bobby Ham? Yes, so if there are three, then the claim is incorrect because it says only two others.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 5: Gerry Ingram has 64\nRow 6: Bobby Ham has 64\nRow 7: David McNiven has 64\n\nSo that's three athletes with 64 goals. Therefore, the claim is stating that Bobby Ham and two others (so three total) have 64 goals. But the data shows exactly three. So the claim would be true if it says \"Bobby Ham and two other athletes,\" because that's correct. Wait no\u2014wait, the claim is saying \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete\" which could mean Bobby plus two others = three total.\n\nBut in the table, there are three athletes with 64 goals: Gerry, Bobby, David. So if the claim is stating that Bobby and two others (Gerry and David), then yes, it's correct because that's exactly who they are. Wait no\u2014the claim doesn't specify who the other two are, just that there are two others besides Bobby.\n\nSo the data shows three athletes with 64 goals: Gerry, Bobby, and David. Therefore, the statement \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete have 64 goal\" is correct because there are indeed two other athletes (Gerry and David) who also have 64 goals. So the claim would be true.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The claim says Bobby Ham and two others have 64 goals. If the data shows three people with 64 goals including Bobby, then yes, it's correct because there are two others besides him. Therefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cells are Bobby Ham's row (row index 6) for the 'goals' column and the rows of the other two athletes who have 64.\n\nSo in terms of relevant_cells, we need to include all three: Gerry, Bobby, and David. Because each has a 'goals' value of 64 that supports the claim.\n\nWait, but the instruction says \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete have 64 goal.\" So it's specifically mentioning Bobby Ham as one, and two others. Therefore, in addition to Bobby's row, we need to include the rows for Gerry and David. Because their 64 goals also make the statement true.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because there are three athletes with 64 goals: Bobby Ham, Gerry Ingram, and David McNiven. Therefore, the claim is correct as it states Bobby and two others have 64 goals.\n\nWait no, wait\u2014maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: The claim says Bobby Ham and two other athletes (so three people total) have 64 goals. In the data, there are indeed three athletes with 64 goals: Gerry, Bobby, and David. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would include all three rows where 'goals' is 64: row indices 5,6,7 (assuming starting from 0). Wait no\u2014the rows are:\n\nRow 5: Gerry Ingram\nRow 6: Bobby Ham\nRow 7: David McNiven\n\nSo yes, their goals columns need to be included as relevant cells.\n\nBut wait, the table is a list of data, so row indices are 0 to 12. So Gerry is at index 5 (since it's the sixth element in the array), Bobby at 6, and David at 7.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include rows 5,6,7 for their 'goals' columns because all three have 64 goals, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete have 64 goal\" is **True**. There are indeed three athletes with 64 goals: Bobby Ham, Gerry Ingram, and David McNiven.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Task:** Determine if the statement about Bobby Ham and two other athletes having 64 goals is true based on the given data.\n\n2. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - The data consists of a list where each entry corresponds to an athlete's goal count.\n   - Review each row's 'goals' value:\n     - Row 5 (Gerry Ingram): 64\n     - Row 6 (Bobby Ham): 64\n     - Row 7 (David McNiven): 64\n\n3. **Count the Athletes with 64 Goals:**\n   - There are three athletes with a 'goals' value of 64.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Statement:**\n   - The statement claims Bobby Ham and two others have 64 goals.\n   - With three athletes (Bobby plus two others), the statement holds true.\n\n5. **Determine Relevant Cells:**\n   - Include all rows where the athlete has a 'goals' of 64 to support the claim.\n   - These are rows 5, 6, and 7.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is **True**, and the relevant cells are Bobby Ham (row index 6), Gerry Ingram (row index 5), and David McNiven (row index 7).",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim about Frank O'Rourke's career being one year longer than John Hallows is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where each person is in the table. Looking at the data, Frank O'Rourke is listed as the second entry (index 1) and John Hallows is the fourth entry (index 3). \n\nNext, I need to compare their careers. The 'career' column gives the years they were active. For Frank O'Rourke, it's \"1907 - 1914\", which I'll calculate the duration of. From 1907 to 1914 is 7 years because 1914 minus 1907 is 7. \n\nNow, John Hallows's career is listed as \"1930 - 1936\". That also spans 6 years since 1936 minus 1930 equals 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me check again: 1930 to 1936 inclusive would actually be 7 years (since you count both the start and end years). So if Frank O'Rourke has a career of 7 years and John Hallows also has 7 years, then their careers are the same length, not one year longer.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating. Let's do it again. For Frank: from 1907 to 1914 is indeed 8 years (including both start and end). Because 1907 + 8 would be 1915, so that's correct. John Hallows: 1930 to 1936 is also 7 years? Wait no, let me count each year. From 1930 to 1931 is one year, up to 1936 being the seventh year. So both have a career duration of 8 and 7 years respectively? Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should subtract the start year from the end year plus one. For Frank O'Rourke: 1914 - 1907 = 7, plus 1 equals 8 years. John Hallows: 1936 - 1930 = 6, plus 1 is 7 years. So Frank's career is 8 years and John's is 7 years. Therefore, Frank's career is indeed one year longer than John's.\n\nWait, but looking back at the data, I think I might have miscalculated earlier. Let me double-check each entry:\n\n- Frank O'Rourke: \"1907 - 1914\" \u2192 1914-1907=7, plus 1 is 8 years.\n- John Hallows: \"1930 - 1936\" \u2192 1936-1930=6, plus 1 is 7 years.\n\nYes, that's correct. So Frank's career is 8 years, and John's is 7 years. Therefore, the claim is true because Frank's career is exactly one year longer than John's.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career\"}]}",

The claim mentions \"average\" and \"lowest\", so that points to the \"avge\" column because it likely stands for average or something similar.\n\nNext, I need to find John Hall in the table.

So, I need to find the minimum and maximum values in the 'avge' column and check if their difference is exactly 0.33.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'avge' column has numerical values.

The claim says: \"there be only 1 person have 64 goal.\" Hmm, wait, let me parse that correctly. It seems like the claim is stating that there's only one person with a career total of 64 goals. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents in the table. The columns are:\n- name: The player's name.\n- goals: This might be their total goals scored? Or maybe it's something else. Wait, looking at the data, under \"goals\" we have numbers like 121, 88, etc. That seems high for a single person's career goals. So perhaps this is total career goals. But then there's another column called \"avge,\" which I assume stands for average goals per game or something similar. And then there's \"career,\" which looks like the player's active years.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"64 goal,\" so maybe it's referring to a specific statistic related to goals. Let me check each row in the table and see who has 64 in any relevant column that could be goals or another metric.\n\nLooking at the \"goals\" column first:\n- Bobby Campbell: 121\n- Frank O'Rourke: 88\n- Dean Windass: 76\n- John Hallows: 74\n- Joe Cooke: 68\n- Gerry Ingram: 64\n- Bobby Ham: 64\n- David McNiven: 64\n- Sean McCarthy: 63\n- John Hall: 63\n- David Jackson: 61\n- Bruce Bannister: 60\n- Dicky Bond: 60\n\nSo in the \"goals\" column, Gerry Ingram has 64, Bobby Ham has 64, and David McNiven also has 64. That's three people with 64 goals each.\n\nNow, considering that the claim is about having only one person with 64 goals, but there are at least three, this would suggest the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which column the claim refers to. Could it be \"avge\"? Let me check the \"avge\" column:\n- Bobby Campbell: 0.44\n- Frank O'Rourke: 0.46\n- Dean Windass: 0.35\n- John Hallows: 0.45\n- Joe Cooke: 0.25\n- Gerry Ingram: 0.37\n- Bobby Ham: 0.34\n- David McNiven: 0.3\n- Sean McCarthy: 0.48\n- John Hall: 0.15\n- David Jackson: 0.24\n- Bruce Bannister: 0.29\n- Dicky Bond: 0.2\n\nNone of these have exactly 64, so the \"avge\" column doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nAnother possibility is that the claim is referring to the career column's data, which includes years. For example, someone might have a career spanning two periods, like \"1971 - 1979 , 1981 - 1984.\" But those are years, not goals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"64 goal,\" so maybe the user is referring to the total number of times they scored 64 goals in their career? Or perhaps a specific season or something else.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"david jackson have the least goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: name, goals, apps, avge, career. The data rows include various individuals with their respective stats and careers. My main focus here is on the \"goals\" column because the claim is about David Jackson having the least number of goals.\n\nI need to identify which row corresponds to David Jackson. Scanning through the names in the table: the first few rows are Bobby Campell, Frank O'Rourke, Dean Windass, John Hallowes, Joe Cooke, Gerry Ingram, Bobby Ham, David McNiven, Sean McCarthy, John Hall, David Jackson... Ah, there's David Jackson at row index 10.\n\nNow, looking at the goals column for each person. I'll list out the goal counts:\n\n- Bobby Campell: 121\n- Frank O'Rourke: 88\n- Dean Windass: 76\n- John Hallowes: 74\n- Joe Cooke: 68\n- Gerry Ingram: 64\n- Bobby Ham: 64\n- David McNiven: 64\n- Sean McCarthy: 63\n- John Hall: 63\n- David Jackson: 61\n\nSo, the goal counts are as above. I need to see if David Jackson indeed has the least number of goals. Let's list them in ascending order:\n\nThe lowest goal count here is 60? Wait no, looking again. Wait, no. Let me recount because earlier I think I missed a few.\n\nWait, actually, the last few rows are:\n\n- Bruce Bannister: 60\n- Dicky Bond: 60\n\nBut David Jackson is at 61 goals. So, looking for the smallest number in the goals column, it's 60, achieved by Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond. Then comes Sean McCarthy and John Hall with 63, Joe Cooke with 68, etc., up to Bobby Campell with 121.\n\nSo David Jackson has 61 goals. Now, is this the least? No, because there are two people (Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond) who have 60, which is lower than 61. Therefore, David Jackson does not have the least number of goals; others have fewer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let's list all goal counts again:\n\n121,88,76,74,68,64,64,64,63,63,61,60,60.\n\nSo the minimum is 60, not 61. Therefore, the claim that David Jackson has the least goals is FALSE because there are others with lower numbers.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify which rows and columns to check. The goal column is \"goals\", so for each person, their goals value needs to be checked against others.\n\nBut since we're focusing on whether David Jackson has the least, we need to compare his 61 with all other goal counts. So the relevant_cells would include:\n\n- For David Jackson: row_index 10, column_name \"goals\".\n- For Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond: their rows (rows 9 and 11) and the \"goals\" column.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, let me count the rows correctly. Wait, looking back at the data array:\n\nThe first entry is Bobby Campell, index 0.\n\nThen Frank O'Rourke, index1.\n\nDean Windass:2\n\nJohn Hallowes:3\n\nJoe Cooke:4\n\nGerry Ingram:5\n\nBobby Ham:6\n\nDavid McNiven:7\n\nSean McCarthy:8\n\nJohn Hall:9\n\nDavid Jackson:10\n\nBruce Bannister:11\n\nDicky Bond:12.\n\nSo, Bruce Bannister is at row 11 with goals 60, Dicky Bond at row 12 with 60.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- David Jackson's row (row 10) and \"goals\" column.\n- Bruce Bannister's row (row 11) and \"goals\" column.\n- Dicky Bond's row (row 12) and \"goals\" column.\n\nThese are the cells that show that others have lower goal counts than David Jackson, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"david jackson have the least goal\" is true, we need to compare his goals with others. David Jackson has 61 goals, while Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond have lower values (60). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"john hallow play for more than 10 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, let me make sure I understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that John Hallow played for more than 10 years. \n\nLooking at the table, the columns are name, goals, apps, avge, and career. The 'career' column seems to represent the years the person played. So I should focus on that column for each entry.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the data array to find John Hallow's row. Scanning the \"name\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Bobby Campell\n- Row 1: Frank O'Rourke\n- Row 2: Dean Windass\n- Row 3: John Hallows\nAh, here we go. John Hallows is at row index 3.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'career' value for John Hallows. From the table, his career is listed as \"1930 - 1936\". Let me calculate how many years that is. Subtracting the start year from the end year: 1936 - 1930 = 6 years. But wait, if he played from 1930 to 1936 inclusive, that's actually 7 years (including both start and end). However, sometimes in sports careers, the duration might be considered as the number of seasons played, which could vary depending on the sport.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"more than 10 years.\" So if his career was only 6 or 7 years, that's less than 10. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other John Hallow. Wait, looking back at row 4: Joe Cooke is another name, but it's spelled as \"joe cooke,\" so no. Then, looking at row 9: John Hall is there, but that's a different person. So only row 3 is John Hallows.\n\nSo, his career was from 1930 to 1936, which is 7 years. Therefore, the claim that he played for more than 10 years is not supported by the table data. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"john hallow play for more than 10 year\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyzed the 'career' column of John Hallows in the provided table. His career spans from 1930 to 1936, totaling 7 years, which is less than 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"dicky bond have a lower average than john hall\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the problem.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Dicky Bond and John Hall are in the table. Looking at the data, Dicky Bond is listed as one of the names, specifically in row 9 (since it's zero-indexed, but let me check the rows). Wait, actually, looking back, the data starts with Bobby Campell as row 0, then Frank O'Rourke as row 1, and so on. So Dicky Bond is in row index 9.\n\nJohn Hall is another name in the table. Let's see, he appears in two entries: one at row 3 (John Hallowes?) Wait no, looking again, I think there's a John Hall specifically at row 10? No, wait, let me count correctly:\n\nRow 0: Bobby Campell\nRow 1: Frank O'Rourke\nRow 2: Dean Windass\nRow 3: John Hallows\nRow 4: Joe Cooke\nRow 5: Gerry Ingram\nRow 6: Bobby Ham\nRow 7: David McNiven\nRow 8: Sean McCarthy\nRow 9: John Hall (wait, is it? Let me check the data again.\n\nLooking at row 10: It's John Hall with name \"john hall\", apps 430. So in the table, John Hall is at row index 10.\n\nWait no, let me count correctly. The rows are numbered from 0 to 12. Row 0 is Bobby Campell, up to row 12 being Dicky Bond. Then, looking for John Hall: I see that there's a \"john hall\" entry in the data. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each row's name column:\n- row 3: \"john hallows\"\n- row 10: \"john hall\"\n\nSo, the two individuals are John Hallowes (row 3) and John Hall (row 10). The claim mentions \"dicky bond\" and \"john hall\", so I need to compare their averages.\n\nThe relevant columns for this comparison are \"avge\". So, I'll look at each of their entries in the \"avge\" column.\n\nDicky Bond's avge is listed as 0.2 in row 9 (I think, let me check: yes, row 9 has dicky bond with avge 0.2).\n\nJohn Hall's avge is 0.15 in row 10.\n\nNow, the claim states that Dicky Bond's average is lower than John Hall's. So we need to see if 0.2 < 0.15.\n\nWait, 0.2 is greater than 0.15, so that would mean Dicky Bond has a higher average than John Hall, making the original claim FALSE.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything else. Are there any other columns relevant? The claim only mentions averages, so \"avge\" is the key column here.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Dicky Bond: row index 9, column \"avge\"\n- For John Hall: row index 10, column \"avge\"\n\nThus, comparing these two avge values: 0.2 vs 0.15. Since 0.2 > 0.15, the claim that Dicky Bond has a lower average than John Hall is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\", with the relevant cells pointing to row 9 and column \"avge\" for Dicky Bond, and row 10 and column \"avge\" for John Hall.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the averages of two individuals. After checking their respective data, it's clear that Dicky Bond has a higher average than John Hall.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"avge\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"there be less than 2 difference between the highest and lowest average.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what this means. It\u2019s talking about the 'avge' column because that stands for average. So I need to look at the 'avge' values across all rows.\n\nI should start by extracting the 'avge' data from each row:\n\nRow 0: 0.44\nRow 1: 0.46\nRow 2: 0.35\nRow 3: 0.45\nRow 4: 0.25\nRow 5: 0.37\nRow 6: 0.34\nRow 7: 0.3\nRow 8: 0.48\nRow 9: 0.15\nRow 10: 0.24\nRow 11: 0.29\nRow 12: 0.2\n\nNow, I need to find the highest and lowest averages here. Let me list them:\n\nThe highest average is 0.48 (from row 8). The next one is 0.46 in row1. Wait, no, let me go through each.\n\nLooking at all values: \n\nRow0: 0.44\nRow1: 0.46\nRow2: 0.35\nRow3: 0.45\nRow4: 0.25\nRow5: 0.37\nRow6: 0.34\nRow7: 0.3\nRow8: 0.48\nRow9: 0.15\nRow10: 0.24\nRow11: 0.29\nRow12: 0.2\n\nSo the highest is 0.48, and the lowest is 0.15 (from row9). Wait, but looking again, I see that in row12 it's 0.2, which is higher than 0.15. So actually, the lowest is 0.15, right? Because 0.15 is less than 0.2.\n\nSo highest average = 0.48, lowest = 0.15.\n\nNow, calculate the difference: 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33. \n\nThe claim says there should be less than a 2 difference. Wait, does it mean less than 2 or less than 1? The wording is \"less than 2 difference.\" So 0.33 is definitely less than 2, so the condition holds.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Maybe I misread a value. Let's check each row:\n\nRow0: Bobby Campell - 0.44\nRow1: Frank O'Rourke - 0.46\nRow2: Dean Windass - 0.35\nRow3: John Hallows - 0.45\nRow4: Joe Cooke - 0.25\nRow5: Gerry Ingram - 0.37\nRow6: Bobby Ham - 0.34\nRow7: David McNiven - 0.3\nRow8: Sean McCarthy - 0.48\nRow9: John Hall - 0.15\nRow10: David Jackson - 0.24\nRow11: Bruce Bannister - 0.29\nRow12: Dicky Bond - 0.2\n\nYes, the lowest is definitely 0.15 and highest is 0.48.\n\nDifference is 0.33. So it's less than 2, so the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes, people might interpret \"difference\" as absolute value, but here it's just the subtraction. Since averages are positive, the difference is already positive.\n\nSo yes, the condition holds.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the highest average (0.48) and the lowest average (0.15) have a difference of 0.33, which is less than 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"avge\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"avge\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
