    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim to verify: \"un operation name , uncok 's un operation title be un commission on korea.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the claim is making two statements. The first part says that \"un operation name\" equals \"uncok,\" and the second part says that \"uncok's un operation title\" is \"un commission on korea.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if these statements hold true based on the data in each row.\n\nStarting with the first statement: Is there a row where \"un operation name\" is \"uncok\"? Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The second row has \"uncok\" as the un operation name. So yes, that's correct. It's in row 1 (if we start counting from 0). \n\nNext part of the claim: Does \"uncok's un operation title\" equal \"un commission on korea\"? Checking the same row, under the column \"un operation title,\" it says \"un commission on korea.\" That matches exactly.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the entire claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"un operation name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"un operation title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Australia's role as military advisor be in the UN operation UNAMA.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to identify which ones are relevant. The columns are:\n- \"un operation name\"\n- \"un operation title\"\n- \"location\"\n- \"dates of australian involvement\"\n- \"number of australians involved\"\n- \"australian role\"\n\nThe claim mentions Australia's role as a military advisor, so I should focus on the \"australian role\" column.\n\nNext, I need to find the row where the operation is UNAMA. Looking through the data:\n\nI see that there's a row for \"unama\":\n[\n  \"unama\",\n  \"un assistance mission in afghanistan\",\n  \"afghanistan\",\n  \"2003 - 2004\",\n  \"1\",\n  \"military advisor\"\n]\n\nIn this row, under \"australian role,\" it says \"military advisor.\" That matches the claim exactly. So, Australia's role as a military advisor is indeed in the UN operation UNAMA.\n\nI should check if any other columns might be relevant. The \"dates of australian involvement\" shows 2003-2004, which aligns with the operation's dates. However, since the main focus of the claim is on the role, the \"australian role\" column is the most relevant.\n\nTherefore, all conditions are met, and the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"australian role\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"65 Australian be involve in the un advance mission in cambodia from 1991 - 1992.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. Let's see:\n\n- The number of Australians involved is 65.\n- They were involved in the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIR II? Wait, looking at the table, there's a mission called 'unamir ii' which seems to be the second one. But the claim mentions \"un advance mission in cambodia,\" which might correspond to UNAMIR II or perhaps another mission.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that row 12 corresponds to \"unamir ii\" with the location as Rwanda, but that's not Cambodia. Wait, no\u2014looking again, the rows for Cambodia are: \n\n- Row 13: unamic (UN Advance Mission in Cambodia), dates 1991-1992.\n- Row 14: untac (UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia), 1992-1993.\n\nSo the UNAMIR II is actually Rwanda, not Cambodia. So the claim refers to \"un advance mission in cambodia,\" which should be UNAMIC, row 13.\n\nNow, looking at the number of Australians involved. The data for row 13 (UNAMIC) shows \"65\" as the number of Australians. That matches the claim's \"65.\" \n\nWait, but the column for number of Australians is \"number of australians involved,\" and in that row it's listed as \"65.\" So yes, the number matches.\n\nThe dates are 1991-1992, which align with the data in the table for UNAMIC.\n\nSo all parts of the claim seem to match the relevant cells in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine if the claim about Australia's role in the UN Operation is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim again: \"Australia's role in the UN operation UN Consular Commission be as military advisor.\" So, we're focusing on two main points here\u2014whether Australia was involved in this specific UN operation and what their role was.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find where the UN Consular Commission is mentioned. Scanning through the \"data\" array, I see that the first row has \"un consular commission\" as the operation name. So, that's our relevant row\u2014row index 0.\n\nNow, let's check the \"australian role\" column for this row. The entry says \"military observers.\" Hmm, so according to the table, Australia's role was military observers, not a military advisor.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. Is there any possibility that another row mentions Australia with a different role? Scanning through, I see other operations like UNMOZ and UNAMET, but none of those are the Consular Commission, and they don't mention Australia as being involved in a different role. Each operation has its own involvement, so unless the Consular Commission is mentioned elsewhere, it's only row 0.\n\nSo, the claim says Australia was a military advisor, but the table shows they were military observers. That doesn't match. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because their role wasn't as an advisor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"australian role\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"65 Australian be involve in the un in 1992 - 1993\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions that 65 Australians were involved with the UN between 1992 and 1993. So, I should look for any entries in the table where the number of Australians involved is around that time.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: \"un operation name,\" \"un operation title,\" \"location,\" \"dates of australian involvement,\" \"number of australians involved,\" and \"australian role.\" The data rows contain specific information about various UN operations.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any mention the years 1992-1993 and the number 65. \n\nStarting from the top, I see entries like \"un yemen observation mission\" in 1963, which is too early. Then there's the \"un india - pakistan observation mission\" from 1965-1966, still not matching the time frame.\n\nContinuing down, I find operations like \"undof,\" \"unef ii,\" and \"unifil.\" The \"unef ii\" operation is in Sinai from 1976-1979, which doesn't fit. The \"unifil\" is in Lebanon starting in 1978, so that's also not it.\n\nMoving forward, I see the \"unbro\" operation in Thailand/Cambodia from 1989-1993. This is close to the claimed time frame of 1992-1993, but the number of Australians involved here is mentioned as 2 federal police, which doesn't match 65.\n\nNext, the \"untag\" operation in Namibia from 1989-1990 mentions 613 in two rotations and 28 electoral supervisors. That's a much larger number than 65, but the time frame doesn't align with 1992-1993.\n\nThen there's the \"unamic\" mission in Cambodia from 1991-1992. The number of Australians here is 65, which matches the claim. However, the operation is listed as happening between 1991 and 1992, which is within the claimed years of 1992-1993. So this seems relevant.\n\nLooking further down, I see \"untac\" in Cambodia from 1992-1993 with up to 1215 ADF personnel. That's a significant number but not exactly 65, and it also doesn't mention 65 specifically.\n\nThe \"unamir ii\" mission is for Rwanda from 1994-1995, which is after the claimed period. Similarly, operations like \"onumoz,\" \"minugua,\" and others are either before or after the time frame in question.\n\nI notice that the \"unamir ii\" mentions over 600 in two contingents but that's for Rwanda, not related to Somalia as mentioned in the claim. \n\nSo, focusing on the relevant operations: \"unef ii\" is too early, \"unifil\" is earlier, \"untag\" is earlier, \"unbro\" has only 2, and then \"unamic\" has 65 in 1991-1992. That's within the timeframe of 1992-1993 because it starts in 1991 but ends in 1992.\n\nThe claim says \"in 1992 - 1993,\" so the period is inclusive. Since \"unamic\" was active from 1991 to 1992, part of that time is within the specified years. Therefore, the number 65 does appear for an Australian operation during that timeframe.\n\nThus, the claim seems to be fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of australians involved\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the problem. The task is to verify a claim about the data in the provided JSON table. Each row in the table represents a different UN operation with various attributes like operation name, location, dates of involvement, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the operation name should be \"east timer on korea\" and presumably, this operation is related to Korea. So I need to check if any row in the data matches both the operation name and has Korea as a location or somehow connected to Korea.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: Operation name is \"none\", so that's not it.\n2. Second row: Operation name is \"uncok\" (UN Commission on Korea). The location is Korea, but the operation name doesn't match.\n3. Third row: Operation name is \"unmogip\" related to Kashmir. Not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Operation name is \"untso\", which stands for UN Truce Supervision Organization. It's in Israel and neighboring countries, so not Korea.\n5. Fifth row: Operation name is \"unyom\" (UN Yemen Observation Mission). Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: \"unipom\" related to India-Pakistan. Doesn't mention Korea.\n7. Seventh row: \"undof\" about Israel-Syria. No.\n8. Eighth row: \"unef ii\" in Sinai. Not Korea.\n9. Ninth row: \"unifil\" in Lebanon. No.\n10. Tenth row: \"uniimog\" related to Iran-Iraq. Not relevant.\n11. Eleventh row: \"unbro\" in Thailand/Cambodia border. No.\n12. Twelfth row: \"untag\" in Namibia. Doesn't match.\n13. Thirteenth row: \"unamic\" in Cambodia. No.\n14. Fourteenth row: \"untac\" also in Cambodia. Not Korea.\n15. Fifteenth row: \"unosom i\" in Somalia. No.\n16. Sixteenth row: \"unamir ii\" in Rwanda. Doesn't relate to Korea.\n17. Seventeenth row: \"onumoz\" in Mozambique. No.\n18. Eighteenth row: \"minugua\" in Guatemala. Not relevant.\n19. Nineteenth row: \"unamet\" in East Timor. Doesn't connect to Korea.\n20. Twentieth row: \"untaet\" also in East Timor. No match.\n21. Twenty-first row: \"unmee\" between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Not Korea.\n22. Twenty-second row: \"unmiset\" again in East Timor. Doesn't relate.\n23. Twenty-third row: \"unama\" in Afghanistan. Doesn't connect to Korea.\n\nNow, I've gone through all the rows, and none of them have an operation name that is \"east timer on korea\". Additionally, looking at the 'location' column, there's no mention of Korea in any of these operations. The closest related operation is \"uncok\", but it doesn't match the given name.\n\nI think the claim might be a typo or confusion with another term. Maybe \"east timer\" refers to a specific context not covered here, but based on the table, there's no matching operation. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
