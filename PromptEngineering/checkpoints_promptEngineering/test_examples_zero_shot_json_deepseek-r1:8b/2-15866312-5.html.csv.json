    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is about specific players being the winner, runner-up, and semi-finalist in a certain week of a tier I competition.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim:\n\n- \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" should be the winner.\n- \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\" should be the runner-up.\n- \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\" should be the semi-finalist.\n- The week is specified as \"week of may 8 tier 1\".\n\nI need to check each part against the table. Let's go through each relevant column and row.\n\nLooking at the columns, the relevant ones are \"week of\", \"tier\", \"winner\", \"runner - up\", and \"semi finalists\". So I'll focus on these columns.\n\nStarting with the week: The claim mentions \"may 8 tier 1\". Looking at the table's data:\n\n- Row 3 has \"8 may\" as the week, but the tier is IV. That doesn't match.\n- Row 4 also has \"8 may\", tier I. Hmm, that might be relevant.\nWait, let me check row indices properly. The first row is index 0, then 1, up to 9.\n\nRow 3: week of 8 May, tier IV. Doesn't fit because the claim says tier I.\nRow 4: week of 8 May, tier I. This matches the week and tier mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo for tier I on 8 May, let's look at the \"winner\" column. In row 4, the winner is listed as \"linda harvey - wild chanda rubin 6-7, 6-3, 6-2\". That doesn't match Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check if any other rows have Gigi Fernandez and Natalia Zvereva as winners.\n\nLooking through all the data:\n\n- Row 1: Winner is Conchita Mart\u00ednez.\n- Row 2: Winner is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Martina Hingis, but that's a different pairing.\n- Row 3: Winner is Julie Halard.\n- Row 4: Different winner.\n- Row 5: Conchita Mart\u00ednez again.\n- Row 6: Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez with Natalia Zvereva. Wait, row 6 has \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" as the winner? Let me check:\n\nIn row 6, \"winner\" is \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\". So that's the winner for 8 May, tier I. So if the claim says Gigi and Natalia are winners on that week and tier, that matches.\n\nBut wait, in row 6, the \"week of\" is 15 May? No, wait:\n\nWait, let me check each row properly. The first row is index 0: \"1 may\". Index 3 is \"8 may\", which is row 3, right?\n\nWait no, indexes go from 0 to 9. So row 0: 1 May, tier II.\n\nRow 1: same week (1 May), tier II.\n\nRow 2: 8 May, tier IV.\n\nRow 3: 8 May, tier I. Wait, no:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: 1 May\n- Row 1: 1 May\n- Row 2: 8 May\n- Row 3: 15 May? No, row 2 is index 2: \"week of 15 may tier 1\"? Wait no.\n\nWait the table's data:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: week of 1 May, tier II.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: week of 8 May, tier IV.\n\nRow 3: week of 8 May, tier I.\n\nRow 4: week of 15 May, tier I.\n\nWait no, looking at the data:\n\nEach row's \"week of\" is as follows:\n\nRow 0: \"1 may\"\n\nRow 1: same.\n\nRow 2: \"8 may\", tier IV.\n\nRow 3: \"8 may\", tier I.\n\nRow 4: \"15 may\", tier I.\n\nSo for week of 8 May, tier I, the relevant row is index 3 (row 3), where the winner is \"linda harvey - wild chanda rubin\".\n\nBut the claim says Gigi and Natalia are winners. So in that same week and tier, is there another row where they are winners?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting rows. Let me list all rows with their details:\n\nRow 0: 1 May, tier II.\n\n- Winner: Conchita Mart\u00ednez\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: 8 May, tier IV.\n\n- Winner: Julie Halard\n\nRow 3: 8 May, tier I.\n\n- Winner: Linda Harvey\n\nRow 4: 15 May, tier I.\n\n- Winner: Conchita Mart\u00ednez\n\nRow 5: 15 May, tier I.\n\n- Winner: Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva? No, row 6.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nLooking at the table again, perhaps I misread it. The data is:\n\nFor \"week of\", \"tier\", \"winner\":\n\nRow 0: 1 May, II; winner: Conchita Mart\u00ednez\n\nRow 1: same as above.\n\nRow 2: 8 May, IV; winner: Julie Halard\n\nRow 3: 8 May, I; winner: Linda Harvey\n\nRow 4: 15 May, I; winner: Conchita Mart\u00ednez\n\nRow 5: 15 May, I; winner: Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva 3-6,7-6,6-4.\n\nWait no, row 5 is index 5:\n\n\"row\": [\n    {\"week_of\": \"8 may\", \"tier\": \"IV\", \"winner\": \"julie halard\"},\n    ...,\n    etc.\n\nNo, I think the table's data is as provided. Let me try again.\n\nThe table has 10 rows (indices 0-9). Each row has:\n\nFor example, row 5: week_of: \"15 may\", tier: \"I\", winner: \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini 6-3, 6-1\".\n\nWait no, perhaps the exact data is as follows:\n\nLooking at the table's first few rows:\n\nRow 0:\n{\n    \"week_of\": \"1 may\",\n    \"tier\": \"II\",\n    \"winner\": \"conchita mart\u00ednez\",\n    ...\n}\n\nRow 1: same week and tier.\n\nRow 2:\n{\n    \"week_of\": \"8 may\",\n    \"tier\": \"IV\",\n    \"winner\": \"julie halard\",\n    ...\n}\n\nRow 3:\n{\n    \"week_of\": \"8 may\",\n    \"tier\": \"I\",\n    \"winner\": \"linda harvey - wild chanda rubin 6-7, 6-3, 6-2\",\n    ...\n}\n\nRow 4:\n{\n    \"week_of\": \"15 may\",\n    \"tier\": \"I\",\n    \"winner\": \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini 6-3, 6-1\",\n    ...\n}\n\nWait no, perhaps the exact data is:\n\nLooking at row 4 (index 4):\n\n\"week_of\": \"8 may\", tier: I; winner: \"linda harvey - wild chanda rubin 6-7, 6-3, 6-2\".\n\nNo, that can't be. Let me try to parse the table correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has the full details. For example:\n\nRow 0:\n{\n    \"week_of\": \"1 may\",\n    \"tier\": \"II\",\n    \"winner\": \"conchita mart\u00ednez\",\n    \"runner - up\": \"...\",\n    ...\n}\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut in any case, I'm looking for the week of May 8th, tier I. In row 3 (index 3), the winner is Linda Harvey.\n\nBut according to the claim, Gigi and Natalie are winners in that same week and tier.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another row with that info. Let me check:\n\nLooking at row 5 (index 5):\n\n\"week_of\": \"15 may\", tier: I; winner: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini 6-3, 6-1.\n\nNo, not Gigi and Natalie.\n\nWait, perhaps the table's data is that in week of May 8th, tier I, the winners are different. Let me see:\n\nIn row 3 (index 3):\n\n\"week_of\": \"8 may\", tier: I; winner: linda harvey - wild chanda rubin.\n\nBut the claim says Gigi and Natalie are the winners in that week and tier.\n\nSo perhaps there's a mistake, or maybe the table has more rows. Alternatively, perhaps row 6 (index 6) is the one with Gigi and Natalie as winners.\n\nWait, the user provided the table as:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"week_of\": \"1 may\",\n        \"tier\": \"II\",\n        \"winner\": \"conchita mart\u00ednez\"\n    },\n    ...,\n    {\n        \"week_of\": \"8 may\",\n        \"tier\": \"I\",\n        \"winner\": \"linda harvey - wild chanda rubin 6-7, 6-3, 6-2\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n\nWait no, perhaps the user didn't paste it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps in week of May 8th, tier I, the winner is Gigi and Natalie.\n\nBut according to the table as I can see, row 3 (index 3) has Linda Harvey as the winner for that week and tier.\n\nThus, perhaps the claim is incorrect because in that week and tier, the winner is Linda, not Gigi and Natalie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another row where they are winners. Let me check if any other rows have week_of \"8 may\", tier I.\n\nWait, looking at the table, only row 3 (index 3) has week_of \"8 may\", tier I. So in that case, the claim is incorrect because Linda Harvey won, not Gigi and Natalie.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in transcribing the data, or maybe I'm miscounting rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the table has more than 10 rows? Or maybe each row represents something else.\n\nNo, the table as provided has 10 rows, from index 0 to 9. Each row has \"week_of\", \"tier\", and other details like winner, runner-up, etc.\n\nSo for week of May 8th, tier I, the winner is Linda Harvey, not Gigi and Natalie.\n\nTherefore, the claim that in that week and tier, Gigi and Natalie are winners is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to a different week or tier. But based on the data provided, it seems incorrect.\n\nSo my answer would be: No, in the week of May 8th, tier I, the winner was Linda Harvey, not Gigi and Natalie.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Gigi and Natalie won in the week of May 8th, tier I is incorrect. According to the provided data, Linda Harvey was the winner for that specific week and tier.\n\n**Answer:** No, in the week of May 8th, tier I, the winner was Linda Harvey, not Gigi and Natalie.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim to verify: \"sandrine testud yone kamio be semi finalist the week of 22 may\". I need to check if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. The columns are \"week of\", \"tier\", \"winner\", \"runner - up\", and \"semi finalists\". The data rows seem to represent different weeks with corresponding winners, runners-up, and semi-finalists.\n\nThe claim mentions \"sandrine testud yone kamio\" as a semi finalist in the week of 22 May. So I need to find if this name appears in the \"semi finalists\" column for that week.\n\nLooking through each row, I see several rows where the week is listed as \"22 may\". Specifically, there are two such rows:\n\n1. In row index 6: The data is [\"22 may\", \"tier iii\", \"lindsay davenport\", \"kimiko date\", \"sandrine testud yone kamio\"]. Here, \"sandrine testud yone kamio\" is listed as a semi finalist.\n2. Another row (row index 7) for the same week has different winners and runners-up but doesn't mention sandrine.\n\nWait, no, looking back, actually in the table provided, I think there are two entries for 22 May. Let me count again:\n\n- The user listed 10 rows after the headers. Let's see:\n  - Row 0: 1 May\n  - Row 1: 1 May\n  - Row 2: 8 May\n  - Row 3: 8 May\n  - Row 4: 8 May\n  - Row 5: 15 May\n  - Row 6: 15 May\n  - Row 7: 15 May\n  - Row 8: 22 May\n  - Row 9: 22 May\n\nWait, no. The table has data as an array of arrays. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the \"week of\" column:\n\n- Index 0: 1 may\n- Index 1: 1 may\n- Index 2:8 may\n- Index3:8 may\n- Index4:8 may\n- Index5:15 may\n- Index6:15 may\n- Index7:15 may\n- Index8:22 may\n- Index9:22 may\n\nWait, no. The initial data array has 10 rows. Each row corresponds to a week.\n\nIn the table:\n\nRow 0: Week of 1 May\nRow1: 1 May again (probably same event)\nRow2: 8 May\nRow3:8 May\nRow4:8 May\nRow5:15 May\nRow6:15 May\nRow7:15 May\nRow8:22 May\nRow9:22 May\n\nSo in row 8 and 9, the week is 22 May.\n\nLooking at row8: data is [\"22 may\", \"tier iii\", \"lindsay davenport\", \"kimiko date\", \"sandrine testud yone kamio\"]\n\nSo here, the semi finalists are sandrine testud yone kamio. That matches the claim.\n\nThen in row9: [\"22 may\", \"tier iii\", \"lindsay davenport mary joe fern\u00e1ndez 6 - 2 , 6 - 3\", \"sabine appelmans miriam oremans\", \"sandrine testud yone kamio\"]\n\nWait, so this row also lists sandrine as a semi finalist. So in both rows for week22, sandrine is listed as semi final.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the week of 22 may\". Both row8 and row9 are for week22 May, so both entries would be relevant.\n\nTherefore, the name appears in both, confirming that sandrine was a semi finalist in the week of 22 May. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The columns involved are \"week of\" and \"semi finalists\".\n\nFor each occurrence where \"sandrine testud yone kamio\" is a semi finalist in week22:\n\nLooking at row8: columns are week (row_index 8), and semi_finalists (column name).\n\nSimilarly, row9: same.\n\nSo the relevant cells are both row8 and row9 for the column \"semi finalists\", as they both list sandrine.\n\nWait, but wait, in row9, the data is [\"22 may\", \"tier iii\", ... , \"sandrine testud yone kamio\"], so yes, she's listed again. So both rows 8 and 9 have her as a semi finalist for week22 May.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row8: column_name = \"semi finalists\"\n- Row9: same\n\nBut wait, in row8, the data is [\"22 may\", \"tier iii\", \"lindsay davenport\", \"kimiko date\", \"sandrine testud yone kamio\"]\n\nIn row9: [\"22 may\", \"tier iii\", \"lindsay davenport mary joe fern\u00e1ndez...\", \"sabine appelmans miriam oremans\", \"sandrine testud yone kamio\"]\n\nSo in both, she's a semi finalist.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row8 and row9, both for column \"semi finalists\".\n\nWait, but looking at the data again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 8: week=22 may, tier=iii, winner=lindsay davenport, runner-up=kimiko date, semi_finalists=sandrine testud yone kamio.\n\nRow9: week=22 may, tier=iii, winner=lindsay davenport and mary joe fern\u00e1ndez (with some score), runner-up=sabine appelmans miriam oremans, semi_finalists=sandrine testud yone kamio.\n\nSo yes, in both rows, she is a semi finalist. Therefore, the cells to mark are row8 and row9 for \"semi finalists\".\n\nWait, but I need to be precise: The claim says \"sandrine testud yone kamio be semi finalist the week of 22 may\". So it's about her being a semi finalist in that week.\n\nSince both rows for week22 May list her as semi finalist, that fully supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, answer is TRUE, and relevant cells are row8 and row9, column \"semi finalists\".\n\nWait, but wait another moment: In the table provided, I see the columns as \"winner\", \"runner - up\", and \"semi finalists\". So in each row, the third element is the winner, fourth is runner-up, fifth is semi_finalists.\n\nTherefore, for week22 May, rows 8 and9 have her as semi_finalists.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I check the table for \"sandrine testud yone kamio\" in the \"semi finalists\" column during the week of 22 May. Both relevant rows confirm her participation as a semi finalist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"when week be 9 may , when semi finalist be helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce , and when runner - up be conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini , winner be gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's referring to a specific week (9 May), and within that week, certain conditions about the semi finalists, runner-up, and winner should hold true.\n\nLooking at the table structure: the columns are \"week of\", \"tier\", \"winner\", \"runner - up\", and \"semi finalists\". Each row represents an event or match with details in these columns.\n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the relevant cells in the table. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. Week: 9 May\n2. Semi final participants: Helena Sovkova Mary Pierce\n3. Runner-up: Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini\n4. Winner: Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4\n\nNow, I'll go through the table row by row to see if any match these conditions.\n\nStarting from week \"1 may\", I don't think there's a 9 May week listed. Let me check each row's \"week of\" column:\n\nRow 0: 1 May\nRow 1: 1 May\nRow 2: 8 May\nRow 3: 8 May\nRow 4: 8 May\nRow 5: 15 May\nRow 6: 15 May\nRow 7: 15 May\nRow 8: 22 May\nRow 9: 29 May 2 weeks\n\nHmm, I don't see a row with \"week of\" as 9 May. The closest is 8 May and then 15 May, but no 9 May. So that's a problem because the claim mentions week 9 May.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting weeks. Let me think: If it's starting from week 1, then week 2 would be next week, so week 8 is two weeks later, week 15 another two weeks, etc. So 9 May isn't explicitly listed in the table's \"week of\" column.\n\nIf the claim refers to a week that doesn't exist in the table, it can't be fully supported because there's no data for that week. Therefore, the claim might already be false based on this point alone.\n\nHowever, I should also check if perhaps the week is implied or counted differently. For example, maybe \"week of 8 May\" includes up to the next week, but typically, weeks are Monday-Sunday, so 9 May would be a separate week from 8 May. Since the table doesn't have an entry for 9 May, the claim's condition about the week isn't met.\n\nAdditionally, even if I ignore the week part and look at other conditions, let's see:\n\nThe semi finalists should be Helena Sovkova Mary Pierce. Looking through the \"semi finals\" column:\n\nRow 5: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\nRow 6: helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\nWait, row 6 has \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\" as semi finalists.\n\nBut wait, the claim is for week 9 May. If there's no row with week 9 May, then this condition isn't met either. So regardless of other data, without the week being correct, the claim can't be true.\n\nMoreover, checking the winner: Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4. Let's see if any row has the winner as \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" with those scores.\n\nLooking at the \"winner\" column:\n\nRow 5: gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4\n\nSo that does exist in row 5. However, row 5's week is 15 May, not 9 May. So again, the week part doesn't match.\n\nThe runner-up: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini. Checking the \"runner - up\" column:\n\nRow 1: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\nRow 5: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\n\nBoth are in week 1 May and 15 May respectively, not 9 May.\n\nSo even if other conditions might be met elsewhere, the week part isn't. Therefore, the claim's conditions aren't all fulfilled simultaneously in any row of the table.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the claim is referring to a specific match within the week, but since there's no such week in the table, it's not supported.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because either the week doesn't exist in the table, or even if we ignore that, other conditions aren't met without the correct week.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n]}",

The claim is: \"22 may 22 may be a week when the winner be sandrine testud.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions a specific date, May 22, and states that Sandrine Testud was the winner during that week. So, I need to look in the table for any rows where the \"week of\" is May 22 and the \"winner\" is Sandrine Testud.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week and contains data across columns: week of, tier, winner, runner-up, semi finalists. \n\nI'll go through each row to check if there's a match. Let me list out all the rows with their details:\n\n1. Week 1 May:\n   - Tier II\n   - Winners: Conchita Martinez vs Martina Hingis\n   - Runner-up: Martina Hingis\n\n2. Week 1 May again (same week? Maybe duplicate entry, but not relevant for May 22)\n   \n3. Week 8 May:\n   - Tier IV\n   - Winners: Julie Halard vs Ludmila Richterova\n   - Runner-up: Ludmila Richterova\n   \n4.

Week 15 May:\n   - Tier I\n   - Winners: Magdalena Maleeva vs Irina Spirea\n\n7. Week 15 May again (another entry for that week).\n\n8. Week 22 May:\n   - Tier III\n   - Winner: Lindsay Davenport vs Mary Joe Fernandez\n   - Runner-up: Kimiko Date\n\n9. Another entry for 22 May with different winners.\n\n10. Week 29 May (2 weeks later):\n    - Grand Slam\n    - Winners: Steffi Graf vs Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario\n\n11. Another Grand Slam final on same week with Gigi Fernandez and Natalia Zvereva.\n\nNow, looking for rows where \"week of\" is 22 May.
