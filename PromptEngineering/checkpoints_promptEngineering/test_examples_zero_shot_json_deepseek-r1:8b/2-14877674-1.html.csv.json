    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the fullback ken snelling be pick 58 in round 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim has three main parts: position, player name, and pick number, along with the round. So I need to verify each of these in the table.\n\nStarting with the position \"fullback\". Looking at the table's columns, the relevant column is \"position\". I'll scan through the data to see which rows have \"fullback\" as their position.\n\nNext, the player name is \"ken snelling\". I'll look for this name in the \"player\" column of the table. If found, note down the row index where it appears.\n\nThen, the pick number is 58 and the round is 7. So I need to check if there's a row with both pick number 58 and round 7. Each row represents one pick in a specific round.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Pick 1, Round 1, Player: dick wildung, Position: tackle\nRow 1: Pick 3, Round 3, Player: irv comp, Position: back\nRow 2: Pick 5, Round 5, Player: roy mckay, Position: back\nRow 3: Pick 6, Round 6, Player: nick susoeff, Position: end\nRow 4: Pick 7, Round 7, Player: ken snelling, Position: fullback\n\nHere, in row 4 (index 4), the player is \"ken snelling\", position is \"fullback\". The pick number here is 58 and round is 7. So this matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by the data in row 4.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each component:\n- **Position**: The player's position must be fullback. In row 4, it's \"fullback\".\n- **Player Name**: The name \"ken snelling\" is found in row 4.\n- **Pick Number and Round**: Row 4 has pick number 58 in round 7.\n\nAll conditions are met, confirming the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about George Zellick is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"George Zellick has a position of end and a school/club of Oregon State.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find where George Zellick is mentioned. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: pick 8, player \"dick wildung\"\n- Row 1: pick 23, player \"irv comp\"\n- ...\nWait, maybe I can speed this up by scanning the players' names. The claim is about George Zellick, so I need to find his row.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nAt row 24, the player's name is \"george zellick\". So that's the relevant row. Now, check the columns needed: position and school/club team.\n\nIn row 24:\n- Position column has \"end\"\n- School / club team column has \"oregon state\"\n\nSo both parts of the claim are present in this row. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells confirming George Zellick's position and school are found at row 24 for both columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
