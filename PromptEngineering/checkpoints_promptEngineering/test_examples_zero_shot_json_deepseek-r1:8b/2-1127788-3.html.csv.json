    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the claim. The key points are:\n- Rafael M\u00e1rquez (the person)\n- Scored 3 goals\n- In his career\n- At international friendly competitions\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's a JSON with columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. Each row represents an event or match.\n\nSo, I need to check each row to see if any of them mention Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring 3 goals in an international friendly competition.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data, the 'goal' column has numbers but no names. So that's confusing because how do we know who scored those goals? The table only provides numerical goals and some competition names. There are no player names mentioned.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that without knowing which players scored each goal, it's impossible to link a specific player like Rafael M\u00e1rquez to any of these goals or competitions. \n\nI should look for rows where the competition is \"friendly\" because international friendly competitions would be relevant here. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 4: Friendly\n- Row 9: Friendly\n\nSo, in row 4, the score is 2 - 1 and result is 2 - 1. In row 9, it's 2 - 2 and then 4 - 2. But again, no player names are provided.\n\nSince there are no player names or any indication that Rafael M\u00e1rquez was involved in these matches, I can't confirm he scored 3 goals here. Also, the claim says \"in his career,\" but without knowing all his matches, it's impossible to track if he ever scored exactly 3 goals in friendly competitions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2000 be the only year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says that in the year 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in an international competition, and that he did so only in that year. So, I need to check if there are any records of him scoring more than one goal in international competitions in other years besides 2000.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different match with details like date, score, result, and competition. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'date' (to check the year), 'score', 'result' (though maybe less important here), and 'competition' (to ensure it's an international competition).\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Date is \"5 february 1999\". The score is 1-0, which is just one goal. So, no more than one goal in 1999.\n\n2. Row 1: Date is \"13 february 2000\". Score is 1-0 as well. Only one goal here too. Wait, but maybe I need to check the 'result' column for goals. The result here shows \"4 - 0\", which might be the match score, so perhaps M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal and the team scored 4? Hmm, that's confusing. But in the claim, it's about M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal, not necessarily the total goals of the match.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure: each row has [goal, date, score, result, competition]. The 'score' is likely the team's score, and 'result' might include more details. But the first element is labeled \"goal\", which I think refers to M\u00e1rquez's goals in that match.\n\nWait no, perhaps the columns are: goal (maybe total goals by M\u00e1rquez?), date, score (team's score), result (possibly additional info like penalties or extra time), competition. Or maybe 'score' and 'result' are separate, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at Row 0: [1, \"5 february 1999\", \"1 - 0\", \"3 - 0\", \"1999 carlsberg cup\"]. So the first number is 1, which might be M\u00e1rquez's goals. Then the score is 1-0, so team scored 1, opponent 0. The result is 3-0. Hmm, perhaps 'result' includes the final score or something else.\n\nBut I think the key is that in Row 1: [2, \"13 february 2000\", \"1 - 0\", \"4 - 0\", \"2000 concacaf gold cup\"]. So M\u00e1rquez scored 2 goals here. That's more than one. And the year is 2000.\n\nRow 3: [4, \"12 may 2002\", \"2 - 1\", \"2 - 1\", \"friendly\"] Here, goal is 2, but competition is 'friendly', which might not be international.\n\nRow 5: [5, \"24 july 2003\", \"1 - 0\", \"2 - 0\", \"2003 concacaf gold cup\"]. M\u00e1rquez scored 1 here. Only one goal.\n\nRow 6: [6, \"19 june 2004\", \"3 - 0\", \"3 - 0\", \"2006 world cup qualifier\"]. Score is 3-0, but the 'goal' is 3. So he scored 3 goals. That's more than one and in 2004.\n\nRow 7: [7, \"7 september 2005\", \"2 - 0\", \"5 - 0\", \"2006 world cup qualifier\"]. Goal is 2 here, so two goals in 2005.\n\nRow 8: [8, \"24 june 2006\", \"1 - 0\", \"1 - 2 ( aet )\", \"2006 fifa world cup\"]. M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal. Only one.\n\nRow 10: [10, \"10 september 2008\", \"2 - 0\", \"2 - 1\", \"2010 world cup qualifier\"]. Goal is 2, so two goals in 2008.\n\nRow 11: [11, \"11 june 2010\", \"1 - 1\", \"1 - 1\", \"2010 fifa world cup\"]. M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal here.\n\nRow 12: [13, \"30 october 2013\", \"1 - 0\", \"4 - 2\", \"friendly\"]. Goal is 1.\n\nSo from this, in 2000 (Row 1), he scored 2 goals. In 2004 (Row 6), he scored 3. In 2005 (Row7), 2 goals. In 2008 (Row10), 2 goals. So the claim says that 2000 is the only year where he scored more than one goal in international competition. But clearly, he did so in 2004, 2005, and 2008 as well.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if these competitions are international. For example, \"2000 concacaf gold cup\" is definitely international. \"2006 world cup qualifier\" is international. \"2010 fifa world cup\" is international. So all those rows where he scored more than one goal were in international competitions.\n\nTherefore, the claim that 2000 was the only year M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competition is FALSE because he did so in 2004, 2005, and 2008 as well.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions in multiple years beyond 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"goal\": 2},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"goal\": 3},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"goal\": 2},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"goal\": 2}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in both the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. So I need to check if there are records of him scoring goals in these two tournaments as per the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. Each row represents an instance, probably a match or game. The \"competition\" column specifies which tournament it's referring to.\n\nI need to go through each row and look for entries where the competition is either the 2006 FIFA World Cup or the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Then, check if in those rows, under the \"score\" column, there's a goal scored by M\u00e1rquez, i.e., a '1' in the \"goal\" column, since the data seems to represent goals as 1 for a goal and 0 otherwise.\n\nStarting with the 2006 FIFA World Cup. I'll look for rows where competition is \"2006 fifa world cup\". Scanning through, row 8 has competition \"2006 fifa world cup\". The \"goal\" column here is 1, so M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match.\n\nNow checking the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Looking for rows where competition is \"2010 fifa world cup\". I find row 11: date \"11 june 2010\", score \"1 - 1\", result \"1 - 1\". The \"goal\" column here is 1, so M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match as well.\n\nSo both tournaments have entries where he scored a goal. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, I should ensure there are no other relevant rows that might affect this conclusion. Let me check for any other competitions that might be World Cups but different years. The only ones mentioned in the table are 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup, so nothing else is relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the two rows where competition is the respective World Cups with goal=1.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup, we need to check the table for these competitions.\n\n1. **2006 FIFA World Cup**: Found in row 8, where \"goal\" is 1.\n2. **2010 FIFA World Cup**: Found in row 11, where \"goal\" is 1.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming the claim as TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Mexico only losing once in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and see if it relates to the claim. The columns relevant here are \"result\" because we're looking for instances where Mexico lost, and whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in those matches.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the claim mentions when M\u00e1rquez scores a goal. So I need to check if there's any match where Mexico lost and M\u00e1rquez scored a goal around that time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: No, it's a win.\n- Row 1: Win again.\n- Row 2: Win, so not a loss.\n- Row 3: Friendly game, result is 2-1. So Mexico won? Or is friendly considered a competition? I think in this context, since it's under \"competition,\" but the result shows they lost? Wait, no: for row 3, the score is 2-1, and the result is also 2-1, so that means Mexico won. So not a loss.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each row properly.\n\nRow 0: Result is 3-0, which is a win.\nRow 1: Result 4-0, win.\nRow 2: Score 5-1 and result 7-1, so Mexico won again.\nRow 3: The score is 2-1 and the result is 2-1. So they scored 2, opponent scored 1, so that's a win?\nWait, maybe I'm confusing \"score\" and \"result.\" The column names are score and result. Maybe in row 4, the score is 2-1, but the result is also 2-1, which would mean Mexico won.\n\nSo then, looking for rows where Mexico lost: when does that happen? Let's see:\n\nRow 8: Result is 1-2 (aet). So they lost. That's a loss.\nRow 11: The score is 1-1 and result is 1-1. So it's a draw, not a loss.\nRow 12: They scored 1-0, opponent scored 4-1. Wait, no\u2014row 12 has the score as 1-0, result as 4-1? Wait, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at row 8: \"result\" is \"1 - 2 ( aet )\", so Mexico lost.\nRow 11: both score and result are 1-1. So it's a draw.\nRow 12: the score is \"4 - 1\", but wait, no\u2014looking back:\n\nWait, let me parse each row correctly.\n\nEach row has [goal, date, score, result, competition].\n\nSo for row 8:\nscore: \"1 - 0\"\nresult: \"1 - 2 ( aet )\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. So the actual score is 1-0, but the result after extra time was 1-2. Hmm, perhaps the score is the halftime or something else.\n\nBut regardless, for this task, I think we can consider the result column as indicating whether Mexico won, lost, or drew.\n\nSo row 8: result is loss.\nOther losses? Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 0: Win\n1: Win\n2: Win\n3: Win (since score and result are both 2-1)\n4: Win (score 2-1, result same)\n5: Win (score 1-0, result same)\n6: Win (3-0)\n7: Win (5-0)\n8: Loss\n9: They scored 2-2 in the score? Wait, no\u2014row 9 has \"2 - 2\" as the score and \"4 - 2\" as the result. So that's a win because they scored more.\n\nRow 10: Score 2-0, result 2-1. So win.\nRow 11: 1-1, so draw.\nRow 12: Score is \"4 - 1\", so Mexico won.\n\nSo only row 8 shows a loss.\n\nNow, looking for whether in that match, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nWait, but how can I check if he scored? The table doesn't mention players. It only has score as the match result, not individual goals.\n\nTherefore, from the table alone, we can't confirm if M\u00e1rquez scored in any of Mexico's losses.\n\nBut according to the claim: \"Mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal.\"\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased is that Mexico lost once (only one loss) and that was when M\u00e1rquez scored. But from the table, Mexico lost at least once (row 8). So if in that match M\u00e1rquez scored, then the claim could be TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nBut without knowing if M\u00e1rquez scored in row 8's match, we can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about whether when M\u00e1rquez scored, Mexico lost only once.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me parse the claim again:\n\n\"Mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal.\"\n\nSo it's saying that in all cases where M\u00e1rquez scored, Mexico only lost once.\n\nBut since the table doesn't show M\u00e1rquez scoring in any match, we can't verify whether this is true or false because there's no data about his goals. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data, so it must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I need to check for matches where Mexico lost and whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in those matches.\n\n1. **Identify Matches Where Mexico Lost**: From the table, only row 8 shows a loss (result: \"1 - 2 (aet)\"). There's no other loss recorded.\n   \n2. **Check if M\u00e1rquez Scored in That Match**: The table doesn't provide information on individual player goals, so it's impossible to confirm if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match.\n\nSince the data doesn't support the claim, the answer is:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{B}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez not scoring a goal in international competitions in specific years (2001, 2009, 2012) is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are goal, date, score, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match. My focus is on the 'score' column because that's where the goals scored by each team are recorded.\n\nThe claim mentions international competitions, so I'll need to identify which rows involve international competitions. Looking at the 'competition' column:\n\n- 1999 Carlsberg Cup: Not an international competition.\n- 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup: International (CONCACAF).\n- 2002 World Cup Qualifier: International (FIFA World Cup qualifiers).\n- Friendly matches: Not international.\n- 2003 Concacaf Gold Cup: International.\n- 2006 World Cup Qualifier: International.\n- 2006 FIFA World Cup: International.\n- 2010 World Cup Qualifier: International.\n- 2010 FIFA World Cup: International.\n- 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup: International.\n- Friendly in 2013: Not international.\n\nNow, the relevant rows for international competitions are:\n\n2 (2000), 3 (2002),5 (2003),6 (2004 qualifier),7 (2005 qualifier),8 (2006 World Cup),10 (2008 qualifier),11 (2010 World Cup),12 (2011 Concacaf),13 (2013 friendly, but not international).\n\nThe claim is about M\u00e1rquez not scoring in 2001, 2009, or 2012. So I need to check if there are any matches where he scored in these years.\n\nLooking for rows with dates in 2001, 2009, or 2012 and whether he scored in those matches.\n\nChecking the table:\n\n- No row corresponds to 2001. The closest is 2000 (row 2), but that's not 2001.\n- In 2009: Let me check if any rows have dates around 2009. Looking at the 'date' column, the entries are up to 2013, and there's no row for 2009. So M\u00e1rquez might not have scored in 2009 because there's no data here.\n- For 2012: The last few rows are up to October 2013. No row corresponds exactly to 2012. The closest is 2011 (row12) and 2013 (row13), but neither are 2012.\n\nNow, looking at the 'score' column for each relevant international competition:\n\n- Row2: Score is \"1 - 0\". So M\u00e1rquez scored a goal here? Wait, in which team? The score format is Team A - Team B. Since it's an international match, M\u00e1rquez might have been part of the Mexican national team. If so, if his team scored 1-0, he likely scored that goal. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, but without knowing which team each score belongs to, it's tricky. Maybe the first number is always M\u00e1rquez's goals? Or maybe not. Since the table doesn't specify which team's score is which, perhaps I can only consider if there was any mention of him scoring in those years.\n\nBut looking at the 'goal' column: It seems the goal column indicates the actual goals scored by each side. For example, row2 has 1-0 as score, but does that mean M\u00e1rquez scored a goal? If so, then in 2000, he scored a goal in an international competition.\n\nBut the claim is about not scoring in 2001, 2009, or 2012. So if there's any row in those years where he did score, the claim would be false.\n\nSince I don't see any rows for 2001 or 2009, but the claim says \"do not score... in 2001 or 2009 or 2012\", implying that even in those years, he didn't score. But if there's no data, does it mean he didn't? Or is it possible that he did score and the table doesn't have records?\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about whether he didn't score in those years. So to verify, I need to check if any of his matches in international competitions during 2001, 2009, or 2012 had him scoring a goal.\n\nIf there's no data for those specific years, then maybe he didn't have any such matches, so the claim would be true. But I'm not sure because it's possible that even if the table doesn't show it, he might have scored in those years elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, since the table only includes certain matches, and none of them are in 2001 or 2009 for international competitions where M\u00e1rquez scored, perhaps the claim is true.\n\nWait, but in row3 (2002), the competition is World Cup qualifier. So that's 2002, not 2001. He scored 5-1, so if his team scored first, he might have contributed a goal. But I can't be certain without knowing which side each score refers to.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to check all international competitions where M\u00e1rquez played and see if in 2001, 2009, or 2012 he scored any goals.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- Row2: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup, his team scored 1-0. If that's a goal by him, then he scored.\n- Row3: 2002 World Cup Qualifier, score is 5-1. Maybe he scored.\n- Row5: 2003 Concacaf Gold Cup, scored 1-0.\n- Row6: 2004 qualifier, 3-0.\n- Row7: 2005 qualifier, 2-0.\n- Row8: 2006 World Cup, 1-0 (aet) so maybe he scored.\n- Row10: 2008 qualifier, 1-0.\n- Row11: 2010 World Cup, score 2-0. He might have scored.\n- Row12: 2011 Concacaf, score 4-2. Maybe he scored.\n\nSo in all these matches, M\u00e1rquez's team scored the first goal. If that's his doing, then yes, he scored in those years. So for example, in 2000 (row2), he might have scored the first goal.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about 2001, 2009, and 2012. There are no rows for these specific years. So does that mean he didn't play any international matches where his team scored in those exact years? Or maybe the table doesn't capture all his matches.\n\nSince the table might not include all competitions, I can't be certain whether M\u00e1rquez scored in those years or not based solely on this data. Therefore, without more information, it's safer to say that the claim is true because there's no evidence of him scoring in 2001, 2009, or 2012 from the provided data.\n\nThus, considering all, I think the answer is that the claim is likely true, so the response should be \"The statement is true.\"\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is true.",

So I need to count his goals in all international friendly competitions he played.\n\nLooking at row 4: The score is \"2 - 1\". Since it's a friendly, M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal.\nRow 9: Score is \"2 - 2\", so again, 1 goal for M\u00e1rquez.\nRow 13: Score is \"1 - 0\", so he scored 1 goal here.\n\nWait, but in the data provided, each row's 'score' is written as something like \"1 - 0\". The first number before the hyphen should be M\u00e1rquez's goals, right? So in each of these cases, he scored 1 goal. \n\nBut wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check again. In the table, for example, row 4: score is \"2 - 1\". So if that's the case, then M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal (since it's written as \"2-1\", perhaps indicating the opponents' goals first? Or maybe it's always Team A - Team B. Let me assume that in each 'score' field, the format is [Team A Goals] - [Team B Goals]. So for row 4: \"2 - 1\" would mean M\u00e1rquez's team scored 2 goals and the opponents scored 1. But wait, no\u2014the columns are labeled as score and result. Wait, perhaps 'score' refers to the overall match, but maybe the first number is M\u00e1rquez's goals.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about how the data is structured. Let me clarify: in each row, the 'goal' column indicates the player's goal, or is it the team's total? Wait, no\u2014the 'goal' column might actually be the number of goals scored by M\u00e1rquez in that game.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nEach row has \"goal\", which I think refers to M\u00e1rquez's goals. For example, in row 4: goal is 2, date is 12 May 2002, score is 2-1, result is 2-1. So perhaps 'score' is his team's total goals minus the opponent's.\n\nWait no\u2014the 'score' column might be the overall match score, with M\u00e1rquez's goals in the 'goal' column. Let me check: \n\nIn row 4:\nGoal: 2\nScore: 2 - 1\nResult: 2 - 1\n\nSo if he scored 2 goals, and the result is a 2-1 win, then it makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, in row 13:\nGoal: 1\nScore: 1 - 0\nResult: 4 - 2 (but that's under result).\n\nWait, so each 'score' entry is likely the team's score, and 'goal' is M\u00e1rquez's individual goals. So for example:\n\n- In row 4: he scored 2 goals.\n- In row 9: he scored 1 goal.\n- In row 13: he scored 1 goal.\n\nSo in all three international friendly matches, he scored 1 goal each time. \n\nWait, but I thought the claim was about scoring fewer than 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions. If he scored only 1 or 2 in these games, then overall he didn't score more than a few. But wait, maybe there are other friendly matches where he scored more.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRows 4,9,13 are the only ones labeled as \"friendly\". So let's check all of them.\n\nRow 4: goal=2\nRow 9: goal=1\nRow 13: goal=1\n\nSo in these three games, M\u00e1rquez scored a total of 4 goals (2+1+1). Wait no, wait. Each 'goal' is per game, so in each friendly match, he scored either 1 or 2. So across his career in friendly competitions, he has scored more than 3 goals because in these three games alone he scored 4.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"fewer than 3 goals\". So if he scored 4 or more in friendly competitions, then the statement is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that there are no other friendly matches where he scored fewer. However, based on the table provided, these are all the friendly matches listed.\n\nSo his total goals in friendly competitions would be 2+1+1=4. Therefore, he scored more than 3 goals, so the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored fewer than 3 goals in international friendly competitions. By examining the table, we find that in three friendly matches, he scored a total of 4 goals (2 in one match and 1 each in the other two). Since this exceeds the claim's threshold of fewer than 3 goals, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer: \"FALSE\"**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It mentions the year 2000 and specifically refers to Rafael M\u00e1rquez. The claim states that in 2000, he scored more than 1 goal in an international competition.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different event with details like date, score, result, etc. My task is to find if there's any relevant data that supports or contradicts the claim.\n\nI'll start by checking the year 2000. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see entries for \"13 february 2000\" and \"3 september 2000\". So, Rafael M\u00e1rquez had two matches in 2000. Let's check these rows to find his goals.\n\nLooking at row 2 (index 1), the date is \"13 february 2000\", competition is \"2000 concacaf gold cup\". The score column shows \"1 - 0\" for M\u00e1rquez, and the result is \"4 - 0\". So, he scored 1 goal in that match.\n\nNext, row 3 (index 2) has the date \"3 september 2000\", competition \"2002 world cup qualifier\". Here, his score is \"5 - 1\" and the result is \"7 - 1\", indicating he scored 5 goals. That's definitely more than one.\n\nSo, in both matches in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored at least 1 goal. The claim says he scored more than 1 in an international competition in 2000. Since there are two instances where he scored at least 1, does this satisfy the claim?\n\nWait, the claim specifies that it's \"one of two years\" but focuses on 2000. So the relevant rows would be those from 2000.\n\nTherefore, both row 2 and row 3 for 2000 show M\u00e1rquez scoring goals in international competitions. Each has him scoring at least one goal, which is more than zero but maybe not exceeding one? Wait, no. In the first match (row 2), he scored 1 goal, which is exactly one. The second match (row 3) he scored 5 goals.\n\nSo, in 2000, M\u00e1rquez did score more than zero goals in international competitions, and at least once he scored more than one (in row 3). Therefore, the claim that \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is somewhat true but needs to check if it's accurate.\n\nWait, the claim says \"more than 1 goal\". In row 2, he scored exactly one. So does scoring exactly one count as \"more than 1\"? No, because more than one would mean two or more. Therefore, only row 3 (5 goals) satisfies that condition.\n\nHowever, the claim refers to 2000 being one of two years where he did this. I need to check if in any other year besides 2000, he scored more than one goal in an international competition.\n\nLooking through other rows: row 4 is 2002, but M\u00e1rquez scored 2-1, which is one goal. Not more than one. Row 5 (2003) has him score 1-0 and 2-0, so two goals? Wait, the score column shows \"1 - 0\" for M\u00e1rquez and \"2 - 0\". So his own goals are 1 in that match. Therefore, not more than one.\n\nRow 6 (2004) has him score 3-0, which is three goals\u2014so that's more than one. Row 7 (2005) he scores 2-0 and 5-0, so two goals\u2014also more than one. So in 2004 and 2005, he scored multiple goals.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions \"2000 be 1 of 2 year...\", implying that 2000 is one such year, but there are others. However, the claim doesn't specify that it's only 2000; it says \"be\" which might be a typo for \"in\". So the main point is whether in 2000, he scored more than one goal in at least one match.\n\nIn row 3 (index 2), M\u00e1rquez scored five goals. That's definitely more than one. Therefore, the claim that in 2000 he did this is true because there was at least one match where he scored more than one goal.\n\nAdditionally, since the claim says \"2000 be 1 of 2 year...\", it might refer to another year as well, but the main focus is on 2000. Since M\u00e1rquez did score more than one in 2000, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in at least one international competition during 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and provide relevant cells. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 [something], but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for Rafel M\u00e1rquez in the table. Scanning through each row's 'name' column... Wait, looking back, the columns are \"goal\", \"date\", \"score\", \"result\", and \"competition\". So the 'name' isn't explicitly listed. Hmm, maybe the first column is player names? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 1: goal=1, date=5 Feb 1999, score=1-0, result=3-0, competition=1999 Carlsberg Cup\n- The name isn't in any of these columns. So perhaps each row represents a different match or event with player stats.\n\nWait, maybe the 'name' is implied by something else? Or perhaps it's the first column, but it's labeled as \"goal\". No, that doesn't make sense because goal counts would vary per match.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a single game where M\u00e1rquez played. Let me see if there's any information about goals in 2006 and 2010 World Cups.\n\nLooking through the table for 2006 FIFA World Cup: Found in row 8. The date is June 24, 2006. Score is 1-0 (M\u00e1rquez), result is 1-2 (aet). So he scored a goal there.\n\nNow for 2010 FIFA World Cup: Looking at row 11. Date is June 11, 2010. The score is 1-1, meaning M\u00e1rquez didn't score in that match.\n\nSo the claim says he scored a goal in 2006 but remained scoreless in 2010. That seems true based on these two matches.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For 2006, it's row 8, columns: date (to confirm the year), competition (2006 FIFA World Cup), and score (1-0 where he scored). So columns 'date', 'score', and 'competition' in row 8.\n\nFor 2010, it's row 11, same columns. But wait, the claim is about him scoring a goal at the 2006 World Cup but staying scoreless in 2010. So we need to confirm he scored in 2006 (which he did) and didn't score in 2010 (which he didn't). Therefore, for both years, relevant cells include 'date', 'score', and 'competition'.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be row 8 and row 11, each with columns: date, score, competition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Mexico losing one of two times in international competitions when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the claim clearly. The claim states that \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal.\" So, it's saying that in two instances where Mexico played in international competitions, they lost one game and won another, but specifically when M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, they lost.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The table has columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. Each row represents a different match or event. My task is to find rows where Mexico's result was a loss (since the claim mentions losing one of two times), and M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match.\n\nI'll go through each row and check for these conditions:\n\n1. Check if the result is a loss (i.e., the \"result\" column shows a loss).\n2. Verify if the \"goal\" column indicates that M\u00e1rquez scored, which I assume means he scored at least one goal in that match.\n3. Ensure it's an international competition, so competitions like World Cup qualifiers, FIFA World Cup, CONCACAF Gold Cup, etc., qualify.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Result is \"3 - 0\". Since Mexico scored 1 and the result was a win (3-0), this isn't a loss. So not applicable.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Result is \"4 - 0\" again, a win. Not a loss.\n\n- **Row 3**: Result is \"7 - 1\", which is a win for Mexico. No loss here either.\n\n- **Row 4**: This one shows a result of \"2 - 1\". So it's a draw? Wait, the score is 2-1, but what's the result? The \"result\" column says \"friendly,\" which isn't an international competition. So even if it was a loss, it's not relevant since it's a friendly match.\n\n- **Row 5**: Result is \"2 - 0\", so Mexico won. Not a loss.\n\n- **Row 6**: Score is 3-0, result is win. Not applicable.\n\n- **Row 7**: Score is 2-0, result is win. Still not a loss.\n\n- **Row 8**: This row has the \"result\" as \"1 - 2 (aet)\". That's a loss for Mexico because they scored first but lost in extra time. Now, check if M\u00e1rquez scored. The score is 1-0, so he scored the goal. The competition is FIFA World Cup, which is international. So this row meets both conditions: Mexico lost and M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\n- **Row 9**: Result is a win (4-2), so not applicable.\n\n- **Row 10**: Result is \"2 - 1\", which means it's a loss for Mexico? Wait, no\u2014wait, the score is 2-0. Wait, no: in row 10, the score is 2 - 0, and result is win. So that's not a loss.\n\nWait, let me double-check. In row 8, M\u00e1rquez scored, leading to Mexico's loss. Now, looking for another instance where Mexico lost with M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\n- **Row 4**: Friendly match, so not international.\n- **Row 12**: Result is \"1 - 0\", a win, but competition is CONCACAF Gold Cup. No loss here.\n- **Row 11**: Result is a draw (1-1). Not a loss.\n\nWait, looking back at the rows:\n\nAfter row 8, I don't see any other row where Mexico lost and M\u00e1rquez scored in an international competition. The only instance is row 8: Mexico lost, M\u00e1rquez scored, and it's the FIFA World Cup.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 of 2 times.\" So does that mean there are two instances? Or is it saying that Mexico lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored in a total of two competitions?\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRows where Mexico lost: row 8 (2006 World Cup), row 4 (friendly, not international), row 10 (win, so no), row 11 (draw), row 12 (win), etc.\n\nWait, wait\u2014no. Wait, let me check each row's result again:\n\n- Row 1: Mexico won.\n- Row 2: Won.\n- Row 3: Won.\n- Row 4: Friendly, draw.\n- Row 5: Won.\n- Row 6: Won.\n- Row7: Won.\n- Row8: Lost.\n- Row9: Won.\n- Row10: Won (score is 2 - 0).\nWait, no: row 10 shows \"result\" as \"4 - 2\", but the score is \"2 - 1\". Wait, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in row 8: date is 24 June 2006, score is 1-0 (so M\u00e1rquez scored), result is loss because it's 1-2 aet. So that's one instance.\n\nLooking for another instance where Mexico lost with M\u00e1rquez scoring in an international competition.\n\nChecking other rows:\n\nRow 12: date June 2011, score 1 - 0, so M\u00e1rquez scored. Result is \"4 - 1\", which is a win, not a loss. So that's not applicable.\n\nWait, what about row 11? It's the 2010 World Cup final. Score is 1-1, so no goals for Mexico beyond maybe M\u00e1rquez, but since it's a draw, not a loss.\n\nRow 13: result is \"4 - 2\", which means Mexico won. Not applicable.\n\nSo only row 8 meets both conditions: Mexico lost in an international competition (FIFA World Cup) and M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 of 2 times.\" So does that mean there are two such instances? But from the table, I can't find another one.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check each row again:\n\n- **Row 4**: Friendly match (not international), so no.\n- **Rows with Mexico losing in international competitions**:\n  \n  - Row 8: loss, M\u00e1rquez scored.\n  \n  Any others? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nOnly row 8 has a loss for Mexico in an international competition with M\u00e1rquez scoring. Therefore, only one instance. But the claim says \"1 of 2 times,\" implying two instances where Mexico lost when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread another row.\n\nWait, row 12: June 2011. Result is 4-1, which is a win. No loss there.\n\nRow 10: result 2 - 0? Wait, in the table provided:\n\nLooking at the rows as given:\n\nRow data:\n\n1. Mexico vs. El Salvador: Score 3-0, Result: Win\n2. Mexico vs. Guatemala: Score 4-0, Result: Win\n3. Mexico vs. Honduras: Score 7-1, Result: Win\n4. Mexico vs. Bolivia: Score 2-1, Result: Friendly (Draw)\n5. Mexico vs. Ecuador: Score 2-0, Result: Win\n6. Mexico vs. Colombia: Score 3-0, Result: Win\n7. Mexico vs. Peru: Score 2-0, Result: Win\n8. Mexico vs. Germany: Score 1-0, Result: Loss (1-2 aet)\n9. Mexico vs. Poland: Score 4-2, Result: Win\n10. Mexico vs. USA: Score 1-0, Result: Win\n11. Mexico vs. Brazil: Score 1-1, Result: Draw\n12. Mexico vs. Panama: Score 1-0, Result: Win\n\nWait, in row 8, M\u00e1rquez scored the only goal as Mexico lost to Germany in the semis.\n\nSo that's one instance. Any others?\n\nLooking back, I don't see another row where Mexico lost with M\u00e1rquez scoring in an international competition. Therefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant only once, not two times.\n\nBut given the data, there's only one instance. So the statement might be inaccurate.\n\nWait, perhaps row 4: friendly match, so it doesn't count as international. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another match I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe looking at other competitions:\n\nBut in the table provided, all the matches are either World Cup qualifiers, FIFA World Cup, or CONCACAF Gold Cup. No others listed here.\n\nThus, only row 8 meets both criteria: loss and M\u00e1rquez scoring in international competition.\n\nSo, if the claim is \"Mexico lost once when Marqu\u00e9s scored,\" that's correct. But saying it's one of two times might be misleading because there's only one instance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant in two different competitions, but in this table, only FIFA World Cup and CONCACAF Gold Cup are present. Only row 8 is a loss.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that based on the data provided, Mexico lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored, not twice.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n1. **Mexico vs. Germany (2006 FIFA World Cup)**:\n   - Score: 1-0\n   - Result: Loss (1-2 aet)\n   - Marqu\u00e9s scored the goal.\n\nThere is only one instance where Mexico lost in an international competition with Andr\u00e9s Marqu\u00e9s scoring.\n\n**Answer**: There was only one match where Mexico lost, and Andr\u00e9s Marqu\u00e9s scored in an international competition.",

So he scored a goal (1), which means in 2006 he did score, but the claim is about 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any matches in those years where M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (1999/2/5)**: \"1999 Carlsberg Cup\"\u2014not relevant year.\n- **Row 1 (2000/2/13)**: \"2000 Concacaf Gold Cup\"\u2014that's in 2000, not 2001.\n- **Row 3 (2000/9/3)**: World Cup qualifier for 2002. M\u00e1rquez scored a goal here? The score is 5-1, but I need to see the \"goal\" column.\n\nWait, the table's structure is columns: goal, date, score, result, competition.\n\nSo for each row, the first number is the goal, presumably his team's goals. For example, in Row 0: goal=1, so his team scored one goal.\n\nIn Row 3 (2000/9/3), the goal column is 5. So M\u00e1rquez scored five goals? That seems high for a friendly or qualifier match. Maybe that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about 2001, 2009, and 2012. Are there any rows with dates in those years?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 4 (2002/5/12): May 2002\u2014friendly.\n- Row 7 (2005/9/7): 2006 World Cup qualifier\u2014so 2005, not the target.\n- Row 8 (2006/6/24): 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2014he scored a goal in this match.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 2001, 2009, and 2012. Are there any rows for these years?\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nThe latest row after 2006 is Row 13 (2013/10/30). So perhaps M\u00e1rquez didn't have matches in those specific target years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing some data. Let me list all the dates in the table to see if any fall into 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nThe dates are:\n\n- \"5 february 1999\"\n- \"13 february 2000\"\n- \"3 september 2000\"\n- \"12 may 2002\"\n- \"24 july 2003\"\n- \"19 june 2004\"\n- \"7 september 2005\"\n- \"24 june 2006\"\n- \"28 march 2007\"\n- \"10 september 2008\"\n- \"11 june 2010\"\n- \"12 june 2011\"\n- \"30 october 2013\"\n\nSo, there are no rows with dates in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying that he didn't remain scoreless in those specific years. But if none of his matches are in those years, then the statement would be true because he doesn't have any matches to have scored in those years. Wait, but the claim is about whether he remained scoreless\u2014so in 2001, 2009, or 2012, was he scoreless? If there are no matches in those years, then perhaps he didn't play, hence remained scoreless.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it works. Alternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because he did play in some international competitions, but not necessarily in those specific years.\n\nWait, the competition names include \"2002 World Cup qualifier,\" \"2006 FIFA World Cup,\" etc. So for 2001, there might be no matches listed here, meaning he didn't play in any international competitions that year. Therefore, he remained scoreless because he didn't have any matches to score in.\n\nSimilarly for 2009 and 2012: if he didn't play any matches in those years, then he remained scoreless.\n\nSo the claim is stating that he did not remain scoreless (i.e., he scored goals) in those years. But since there are no matches in those years, the statement would be false.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nThe original task says: \"You are tasked with determining whether or not the following statement is true.\"\n\nAssuming that the statement is about him not remaining scoreless (i.e., he did score goals) in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nBut from the data provided, there are no matches for those years. So he didn't have any games in those years, meaning he remained scoreless by default because he wasn't playing.\n\nTherefore, the statement that he didn't remain scoreless (i.e., he scored goals) would be false.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to analyze if there are any matches where he scored in those years. Since none exist, then the claim that he did not remain scoreless is false because he didn't play at all.\n\nBut actually, remaining scoreless implies that he played but didn't score. If he didn't play (no matches), he wasn't necessarily scoreless\u2014he just didn't play. So it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to see if in 2001, 2009, or 2012, he scored any goals.\n\nSince there are no matches in those years listed here, then he didn't have opportunities to score, hence remained scoreless. Therefore, the statement that he did not remain scoreless is false because he actually did remain scoreless by not playing.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself tangled.\n\nPerhaps a better approach: The statement is \"he did not remain scoreless.\" So it's saying he scored goals in those years. But since there are no matches listed for 2001, 2009, or 2012, the answer would be that the statement is false because he didn't have any games to score in those years.\n\nTherefore, the task is to check if in 2001, 2009, or 2012, M\u00e1rquez scored any goals. If not, then the statement is false.\n\nBut wait, looking back at Row 8 (2006/6/24): He did score a goal in 2006. So he can score in other years. But the claim is about specific years: 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n\nIf there are no matches for those years, then the answer is that he remained scoreless in those years because he didn't play any games. Therefore, the statement \"he did not remain scoreless\" would be false.\n\nAlternatively, if the term \"remain scoreless\" implies only when playing, then if he didn't play, it's different.\n\nThis is a bit unclear, but based on the data given, there are no matches in 2001, 2009, or 2012. Therefore, M\u00e1rquez did not have any games to score in those years, so he remained scoreless because he didn't play. Therefore, the statement that he did not remain scoreless is false.\n\nWait, but actually, \"remaining scoreless\" implies that he played and didn't score. If he didn't play, it's a different scenario. So if he didn't play in those years, he wasn't scoreless; he just didn't participate.\n\nTherefore, the statement would be true because he did not remain scoreless\u2014he didn't play at all. But I'm not sure.\n\nI think to clarify: The claim is whether he \"did not remain scoreless.\" So if he scored goals in those years, then the statement is true. If he didn't score but played, it's still about remaining scoreless. If he didn't play, he wasn't scoreless because he didn't have a chance.\n\nTherefore, since there are no matches for 2001, 2009, or 2012, M\u00e1rquez neither remained scoreless nor did he not remain scoreless; rather, he just didn't play in those years. So the statement's truthfulness depends on whether \"remaining scoreless\" requires playing.\n\nIf remaining scoreless is defined as playing and not scoring, then since he didn't play, he wasn't scoreless, making the statement false because he did remain scoreless? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is that the statement is false because there's no evidence of him scoring in those years. But without any matches, it's unclear.\n\nI think I need to proceed with the assumption that the statement is that he scored goals in 2001, 2009, or 2012. Since there are none listed, the statement is false.\n\nSo, to conclude: The statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is false because there are no records of M\u00e1rquez scoring goals in the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false.",
