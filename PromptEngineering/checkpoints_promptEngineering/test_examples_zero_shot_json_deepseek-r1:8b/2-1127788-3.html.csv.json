    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions.\" So, the key points here are that M\u00e1rquez scored three goals, it was in an international competition (friendly match), and this happened during his career.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns for goal, date, score, result, and competition. The data is about matches, not individual players. So, I need to check if any of these games were friendly competitions where M\u00e1rquez scored three goals.\n\nI notice that in row 4 (index 3), the competition is listed as \"friendly.\" The score for that game was 2-1, so M\u00e1rquez's team scored two goals, but it doesn't mention his individual contribution. It just says the match result. Similarly, other friendly matches like row 9 and row 13 don't specify his goal count.\n\nThe claim mentions three goals specifically, which isn't directly indicated in any of the table entries. Each game lists the score of the match, not how many each player scored. Without specific data on M\u00e1rquez's goals in these matches, I can't confirm he scored exactly three in any friendly competition.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim isn't fully supported. The answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support my conclusion. The claim is: \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. Each row represents a different match or event with these details.\n\nThe claim is about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than 1 goal in an international competition only in the year 2000. So I need to look through each row and check if M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in any other years besides 2000, especially in international competitions.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go row by row:\n\nRow 0: Date is February 5, 1999. The competition is \"1999 Carlsberg Cup.\" I'm not sure if this was an international competition, but M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal and the result is a 3-0 win. So he only scored once.\n\nRow 1: February 13, 2000. Competition is \"2000 Concacaf Gold Cup,\" which is an international tournament. The score is 1-0 for M\u00e1rquez's team, so he scored 1 goal. Wait, but the claim says more than 1 goal. So this might not support the claim because he only scored once.\n\nRow 2: September 3, 2000. Competition is \"2002 World Cup Qualifier.\" Score is 5-1, so M\u00e1rquez scored 5 goals. That's definitely more than one and in 2000. This supports the claim.\n\nRow 3: May 12, 2002. Friendly match, not an international competition. So irrelevant for this claim.\n\nRow 4: July 24, 2003. \"2003 Concacaf Gold Cup,\" which is international. Score is 1-0, so M\u00e1rquez scored once. Doesn't support the claim as he didn't score more than one.\n\nRow 5: June 19, 2004. \"2006 World Cup Qualifier.\" Score is 3-0, M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in this match. That's in 2004, so another year where he scored more than one. This contradicts the claim that 2000 was the only year.\n\nRow 6: September 7, 2005. \"2006 World Cup Qualifier.\" Score is 2-0, M\u00e1rquez scored two goals. So in 2005, again, more than one goal in an international competition. This contradicts the claim as well.\n\nRow 7: June 24, 2006. FIFA World Cup 2006. Score is 1-0 for his team, but the result was a loss with extra time (1-2 aet). M\u00e1rquez scored one goal here. So not more than one.\n\nRow 8: March 28, 2007. Friendly match, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 9: September 10, 2008. \"2010 World Cup Qualifier.\" Score is 2-0, so M\u00e1rquez scored two goals in 2008. Another year where he scored more than one in an international competition.\n\nRow 10: June 11, 2010. FIFA World Cup 2010. Score is 1-1, so he only scored once. Doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 11: June 12, 2011. \"2011 Concacaf Gold Cup.\" Score is 1-0, so M\u00e1rquez scored once. Not more than one.\n\nRow 12: October 30, 2013. Friendly match, irrelevant.\n\nNow, compiling this information:\n\nThe claim says only in 2000 did M\u00e1rquez score more than one goal in international competitions. However, rows 2 (2000), row5 (2004), row6 (2005), and row9 (2008) all have him scoring more than once in international competitions. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are other years beyond 2000 where he scored more than one goal.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion. Each time M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition, those rows (2,5,6,9) would have columns related to that. Specifically, the 'score' and 'competition' columns show where it happened.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- Row 2: score is 5-1, competition is \"2002 World Cup Qualifier\" (but since it's 2000, perhaps the year in row is the date's year. Wait, no\u2014the row index corresponds to the date's order, but I need to check the date for each row.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the rows:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 12, with dates as follows:\n\nRow 2: September 3, 2000 (so year 2000)\nRow5: June 19, 2004\nRow6: September7, 2005\nRow9: September10, 2008\n\nYes, so those rows correspond to 2000, 2004, 2005, and 2008.\n\nSo for each of these rows, the score is more than one. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row2 (2000): columns \"score\" and \"competition\"\n- For row5 (2004): same\n- Row6 (2005)\n- Row9 (2008)\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include each of these rows' score and competition.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to list each relevant cell as an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" So for each row where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competition, I need to note which columns are relevant. Since the claim is about the year, perhaps looking at the date column would also be relevant, but the date might not directly tie to the year in the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the score and competition columns, as those show whether it's an international match and how many goals he scored.\n\nBut let me think: The claim says \"more than one goal in international competitions,\" so both the fact that it's an international competition (competition column) and that he scored more than one goal (score column). So for each row where both are true, we need to include those columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the score, as that directly shows if he scored more than once. The competition could be a separate consideration.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to list all relevant cells, it's better to consider which specific data points make the claim false. Since M\u00e1rquez had other instances where he scored more than once in international competitions beyond 2000, those rows' score and competition columns would support the conclusion that the original claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, for each of these rows (2,5,6,9), we have:\n\n- row 2: \"score\" and \"competition\"\n- row5: same\n- row6: same\n- row9: same\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[\n { \"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"score\"},\n { \"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"competition\"},\n { \"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"score\"},\n { \"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"competition\"},\n { \"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"score\"},\n { \"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"competition\"},\n { \"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"score\"},\n { \"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"competition\"}\n]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including the date column as well since it's about the specific instance in 2000 and other years.\n\nBut considering the instructions again, they say to identify cells that are relevant to the claim. The claim is about M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in international competitions only in 2000. Each row where he scored more than once in an international competition after 2000 would disprove this. So each of these rows (2,5,6,9) has both the score and competition columns that are relevant.\n\nTherefore, I should list each of these four rows, noting their 'score' and 'competition' columns as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions not only in 2000 but also in 2004, 2005, and 2008. These instances disprove the original assertion.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - **Row 2 (September 3, 2000):** M\u00e1rquez scored 5 goals in the \"2002 World Cup Qualifier,\" an international competition.\n   - **Row 5 (June 19, 2004):** He scored 3 goals in the \"2006 World Cup Qualifier.\"\n   - **Row 6 (September 7, 2005):** He scored 2 goals in the \"2006 World Cup Qualifier.\"\n   - **Row 9 (September 10, 2008):** He scored 2 goals in the \"2010 World Cup Qualifier.\"\n\n2. **Columns to Consider:**\n   - **\"score\":** Indicates if M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.\n   - **\"competition\":** Confirms if the match was part of an international competition.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that M\u00e1rquez only scored more than one goal in international competitions in 2000 is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nEach row where M\u00e1rquez scored more than once in an international competition is relevant due to their \"score\" and \"competition\" columns.\n\n```json\n[\n {\n   \"row_index\":2,\n   \"column_name\":\"score\"\n },\n {\n   \"row_index\":2,\n   \"column_name\":\"competition\"\n },\n {\n   \"row_index\":5,\n   \"column_name\":\"score\"\n },\n {\n   \"row_index\":5,\n   \"column_name\":\"competition\"\n },\n {\n   \"row_index\":6,\n   \"column_name\":\"score\"\n },\n {\n   \"row_index\":6,\n   \"column_name\":\"competition\"\n },\n {\n   \"row_index\":9,\n   \"column_name\":\"score\"\n },\n{\n   \"row_index\":9,\n   \"column_name\":\"competition\"\n}\n]\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions not only in 2000 but also in 2004, 2005, and 2008. The relevant cells include the \"score\" and \"competition\" columns from these rows, as they directly show instances where his performance disproves the original assertion.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup.\" So, I need to check if he scored goals in these two tournaments. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has information about a match or game, including the competition name. My task is to identify which rows correspond to the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups.\n\nStarting with the 2006 FIFA World Cup. I'll scan through the \"competition\" column for this year. Scrolling down:\n\n- Row 8: Competition is \"2006 fifa world cup\". So, that's the one we're looking for.\n- Now, in row 8, the score columns are:\n  - goal: 1\n  - date: \"24 june 2006\"\n  - result: \"1 - 2 ( aet )\"\n\nSo, M\u00e1rquez scored a goal here, which is '1' in the goal column. That means he did score in the 2006 World Cup.\n\nNext, checking for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Looking through the competition column again:\n\n- Row 11: Competition is \"2010 fifa world cup\". This is the tournament in question.\n- In row 11:\n  - goal: 1\n  - date: \"11 june 2010\"\n  - result: \"1 - 1\"\n\nSo, M\u00e1rquez scored again here. That's another goal.\n\nTherefore, he scored in both tournaments, which supports the claim. Now, I need to map this back to the table and identify which cells are relevant. For each of these two rows (2006 and 2010 World Cup), the goal column is important because it shows whether M\u00e1rquez scored. So, for row 8, the goal cell is at index 0, and for row 11, the goal cell is also at index 0.\n\nPutting this together, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 8, column \"goal\"\n- Row 11, column \"goal\"\n\nI think that's all. No need to check other columns because the claim specifically mentions scoring goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table as Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"Mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main points:\n1. Mexico loses only once in international competitions.\n2. That loss occurs specifically when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows where Mexico has lost (i.e., result column shows a loss). From the table, I can see that each row represents an event with columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. \n\nLooking at the 'result' column:\n- Row 0: Result is \"3 - 0\" (win)\n- Row1: \"4 - 0\" (win)\n- Row2: \"7 - 1\" (win)\n- Row3: \"2 - 1\", same as score, so it's a draw\n- Row4: \"2 - 0\" (win)\n- Row5: \"3 - 0\" (win)\n- Row6: \"5 - 0\" (win)\n- Row7: \"1 - 2 (aet)\" \u2013 this looks like a loss because Mexico scored 1 and lost 2. So this is a loss.\n- Rows8,9,10,11,12,13 all show wins or draws but no losses.\n\nSo there's only one instance where Mexico loses, which is in row7. Now I need to check if that particular match was when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. \n\nLooking at the 'score' column for row7: \"1 - 0\". That means Mexico scored 1 and the opponent scored 2. So in this case, Mexico lost 2-1 (after extra time). But I need to check if M\u00e1rquez scored that goal.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't provide information about who scored the goals. It only shows the score as \"1 - 0\" or similar, not who scored them. Therefore, I can't confirm whether M\u00e1rquez was the one who scored in that match. The claim states that Mexico loses once when M\u00e1rquez scores, but since we don't have data on scorers, this part isn't verifiable from the table.\n\nMoreover, the claim says \"only lose 1 time,\" which aligns with the table showing only one loss. But without knowing if M\u00e1rquez scored in that loss, I can't confirm the second condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim's accuracy can't be fully supported by the data provided because we lack information on goal scorers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mexico loses once in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring fewer than three goals in his career at international friendly competitions is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"rafael m\u00e1rquez score fewer than 3 goal in his career at international friendly competition.\"\n\nSo, I need to find information related to Rafael M\u00e1rquez's goals in friendly competitions. Looking at the table, I see a column called \"competition,\" and another one called \"score.\" Each row represents a different game or event.\n\nI'll start by checking which rows are about international friendly competitions because that's where the claim is focused. International friendly matches would likely be under categories like \"friendly\" or similar terms in the competition column.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 4: Competition is \"friendly\"\n- Row 9: Competition is \"friendly\"\n- Row 12: Competition is \"friendly\"\n\nSo, rows 4, 9, and 12 are relevant because they involve friendly competitions, which are international matches.\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I need to check the \"score\" column to see how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored in those games.\n\nRow 4: Score is \"2 - 1\". That means he scored 2 goals.\nRow 9: Score is \"2 - 2\". He scored 2 goals here as well.\nRow 12: Score is \"1 - 0\". Again, only 1 goal.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"fewer than 3 goals in his career.\" So, if we add up all his goals across these friendly competitions:\n\nHe scored 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 goals. That's definitely more than 3.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other types of competitions as well, but the claim specifically mentions \"international friendly competition,\" so only those rows where competition is \"friendly\" are relevant for this check.\n\nSo, in all the friendly matches he played (rows 4,9,12), he scored a total of 5 goals. That's more than 3, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut I need to be careful because maybe the data doesn't show all his goals. The table only includes some matches, perhaps not all of his career. However, based on what is provided here, in friendly competitions, he scored at least 2 goals each time.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Rafael M\u00e1rquez didn't score any goals in international competitions during three specific years: 2001, 2009, and 2012. So, my task is to check the table provided and see if there are any entries where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in those years.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. Each row represents an event with these details. The 'goal' column seems to indicate whether he scored or not\u20141 for yes, 0 for no? Wait, actually, looking at the first row:\n\nGoal is 1, date is \"5 february 1999\", score is \"1 - 0\", result is \"3 - 0\", competition is \"1999 carlsberg cup\".\n\nSo maybe 'goal' is indicating whether he scored a goal in that match. So 1 means he did, 0 means he didn't.\n\nNow, I need to look through each row and check for the years 2001, 2009, and 2012. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 1: date is \"5 february 1999\" \u2192 not in our target years.\nRow 2: \"13 february 2000\" \u2192 2000, nope.\nRow 3: \"3 september 2000\" \u2192 2000 again. No.\nRow 4: \"12 may 2002\" \u2192 2002. Not a target year.\nRow 5: \"24 july 2003\" \u2192 2003. Close but not 2001, so no.\nRow 6: \"19 june 2004\" \u2192 2004. No.\nRow 7: \"7 september 2005\" \u2192 2005. Not a target.\nRow 8: \"24 june 2006\" \u2192 2006. No.\nRow 9: \"28 march 2007\" \u2192 2007. No.\nRow 10: \"10 september 2008\" \u2192 2008. Not a target.\nRow 11: \"11 june 2010\" \u2192 2010. Close, but not our targets.\nRow 12: \"12 june 2011\" \u2192 2011. Not 2012.\nRow 13: \"30 october 2013\" \u2192 2013. No.\n\nWait, so none of the target years (2001, 2009, 2012) are present in this table. That means there's no data showing whether M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in those specific competitions or not. Therefore, based on the information given, the claim could be true because he didn't score in any of these events as listed.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if the 'date' format might correspond to different years that could match 2001, 2009, or 2012 when written differently. For example, \"24 july 2003\" is clear, but what about dates like \"7 september 2005\"? No, those are straightforward.\n\nAlso, considering the claim says \"does not score a goal in international competition\", so even if he scored in other competitions during those years, as long as there's no evidence of him scoring in the specified competitions on those years, it would hold. But since the table doesn't have any entries for 2001, 2009, or 2012, we can't find a case where he did score.\n\nTherefore, without any evidence to the contrary, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez does not score a goal in international competitions during 2001, 2009, or 2012. The table provided does not have any entries for those specific years, meaning there's no data indicating he scored goals during those periods.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, I think the user is referring to a specific event or tournament happening in the year 2000. The phrase \"2000 be 1 of 2 year\" might mean that in the year 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez was part of two different competitions, and he scored more than one goal in each. Alternatively, it could mean that in 2000, he played two matches (or tournaments) where his score exceeded one goal.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows related to the year 2000 because the claim mentions 2000. The table has multiple entries, and I should check which ones are from 2000.\n\nScanning through the \"date\" column:\n\n- Row 1: 5 February 1999\n- Row 2: 13 February 2000 (year 2000)\n- Row 3: 3 September 2000\n- Row 4: 12 May 2002\n- Row 5: 24 July 2003\n- And so on.\n\nSo, rows 2 and 3 are in 2000. Now, I need to check the \"score\" for each of these two rows because the claim talks about scoring more than one goal.\n\nRow 2 has a score of \"1 - 0\". Wait, that's just one goal, right? So that doesn't exceed one. But let me make sure: in soccer, when you see \"1 - 0\", does that mean one goal scored by the team or against them? I think it's the former\u2014so the team scored one goal.\n\nSo in row 2, M\u00e1rquez's team scored one goal, and the opponent didn't score any. So he scored one goal, which isn't more than one.\n\nRow 3: 3 September 2000, with a score of \"5 - 1\". That means his team scored five goals, so he definitely scored at least one, but maybe more. Wait, in soccer, the score is usually the total goals by each team, not per player. So if it's 5-1, that means M\u00e1rquez's team scored five goals, and the opponent scored one.\n\nBut does this mean M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal? It's possible, but we don't know exactly how many goals he contributed unless there's data on his individual goals, which I don't see here. The table gives the match result as \"score\" which is a team score, not an individual player's goals.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because in 2000, M\u00e1rquez didn't have any entries where he scored more than one goal in international competitions. Wait, but looking back at row 3: it's a World Cup qualifier against Ecuador, and if his team scored five goals, he likely contributed multiple goals, but the exact number isn't specified.\n\nWait, the claim says \"more than 1 goal.\" So did M\u00e1rquez score more than one goal in each of two international competitions in 2000? Or is it that in 2000, he participated in two matches where his team scored more than one goal?\n\nLooking back at the table, row 2: date is 13 February 2000, competition is Concacaf Gold Cup. The score is \"1 - 0\". So M\u00e1rquez's team scored one goal.\n\nRow 3: date is 3 September 2000, competition is World Cup qualifier. Score is \"5 - 1\". So the team scored five goals.\n\nSo in row 2, he didn't exceed one goal. In row 3, his team scored multiple goals, but we don't know if M\u00e1rquez himself scored more than one. Since the table only gives the match result as a score, not individual player goals, it's unclear whether he scored more than once.\n\nTherefore, there's no direct evidence from the table that in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in two international competitions. The claim might be based on an assumption or data not provided here. So I think the claim is FALSE because we can't confirm that he scored more than one goal in each of those competitions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006, but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\" \n\nI think the key points here are:\n1. Did M\u00e1rquez score a goal in 2006?\n2. Was he scoreless in the 2010 FIFA World Cup?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event with details like date, score, result, and competition. The columns are: goal (which I think is a typo because it's listed as \"goal\", but the actual data seems to be about whether a goal was scored by M\u00e1rquez or not), date, score (which might refer to the match score), result, and competition.\n\nWait, the first column in the table is labeled \"goal,\" but looking at the data, each row has numbers. For example, row 1: [1, ...], which I think indicates that a goal was scored by M\u00e1rquez? Or maybe it's indicating whether he scored a goal or not. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, in the first data row:\n[\n  1,\n  \"5 february 1999\",\n  \"1 - 0\",\n  \"3 - 0\",\n  \"1999 carlsberg cup\"\n]\nSo the first value is 1, then date, score (1-0), result, competition.\n\nBut what does column 0 represent? The label says \"goal,\" but in this context, maybe it's indicating that a goal was scored by M\u00e1rquez. But if that's the case, 1 would mean he scored, and 0 would mean he didn't. Wait, no, because looking at row 8:\n[\n  8,\n  \"24 june 2006\",\n  \"1 - 0\",\n  \"1 - 2 ( aet )\",\n  \"2006 fifa world cup\"\n]\nSo in this case, the score is 1-0. But was M\u00e1rquez the one who scored? The claim is about M\u00e1rquez scoring, so maybe we need to track his goals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. The first column might be indicating whether a goal was scored by someone else or not, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"score\" refers to M\u00e1rquez's own team's score and the opponent's score. For example, in row 1: \"1 - 0\" could mean M\u00e1rquez's team scored 1, opponents 0. But if he scored a goal, perhaps it's indicated elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the \"goal\" column is indicating whether M\u00e1rquez scored or not. So for each event, if the first number (goal) is 1, that means he scored, and 0 means he didn't.\n\nBut looking at row 8: [8, \"24 june 2006\", ...], so goal is 8? That can't be right because scoring a goal should only be 1 or 0. So perhaps the first column isn't about goals but something else, like the match number or identifier.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the table structure. Let me check again.\n\nThe columns are:\n- goal\n- date\n- score\n- result\n- competition\n\nLooking at row 8: the date is \"24 june 2006\", which matches the 2006 World Cup. The score is \"1 - 0\". Result is \"1 - 2 (aet)\". So perhaps M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match, making the first column '1' indicating he scored.\n\nSo for row 8: [1, date, score, result, competition], so goal=1 means he scored.\n\nSimilarly, looking for when he might have scored in 2006. The claim says he scored at the 2006 World Cup but remained scoreless in 2010.\n\nWait, but in row 11:\n[\n  11,\n  \"11 june 2010\",\n  \"1 - 1\",\n  \"1 - 1\",\n  \"2010 fifa world cup\"\n]\nSo goal is 1, which would mean he scored a goal. But the claim says he remained scoreless in 2010.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So according to the table, row 11: M\u00e1rquez scored a goal (goal=1) in 2010 World Cup. But the claim says he remained scoreless there.\n\nSo this is a problem. The claim would be false because according to the table, he did score in 2010.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm misunderstanding which player we're talking about. The claim is about M\u00e1rquez, but perhaps it's referring to another player named M\u00e1rquez or maybe there's a confusion with another name.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"goal\" column isn't directly indicating whether M\u00e1rquez scored. Maybe the \"score\" column indicates the overall match score, and we have to infer from that whether he scored. But without knowing which team's goals correspond to M\u00e1rquez, it's difficult.\n\nWait, maybe the first column is just an index or identifier, not about goals at all. That would make more sense because in row 8: goal=8, but that doesn't align with scoring a goal.\n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the table is mislabeled, and \"goal\" refers to something else, like the number of matches played or something else entirely.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The claim says M\u00e1rquez scored at the 2006 World Cup but was scoreless in 2010. So looking for evidence of that.\n\nIn row 8 (2006), if the goal column is 1, then he scored. In row 11 (2010), if the goal column is 0, then he didn't score.\n\nLooking at row 11: [11, \"11 june 2010\", ...], so goal=11? That can't be right because a goal should be 1 or 0. So maybe the first column isn't about goals but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured incorrectly, and the first column is not related to M\u00e1rquez's scoring.\n\nThis makes me think that I might not have enough information from the table to confirm whether M\u00e1rquez scored in 2006 or not, let alone in 2010.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is incorrect based on the data. For example, if in row 11, M\u00e1rquez didn't score (goal=0), but according to the table, goal=11 which is impossible, so perhaps he did score, making the claim wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"score\" column shows that his team scored 1 and opponents 0, so M\u00e1rquez could have scored that goal, making him have scored in 2006. But then in 2010, if the score is a draw, it's possible he didn't score, but according to row 11, perhaps he did.\n\nI'm getting stuck here because I don't know how the \"goal\" column correlates with M\u00e1rquez's actual scoring.\n\nMaybe another approach: look for events where M\u00e1rquez participated in the World Cup. The claim refers to 2006 and 2010 World Cups.\n\nLooking through the table, row 8 is 2006, so [8, \"24 june 2006\", ...], but again, goal=8 doesn't make sense for scoring.\n\nRow 11 is 2010: [11, ...], goal=11. So perhaps he scored in both tournaments, contradicting the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on this, the claim would be incorrect because M\u00e1rquez did score in both 2006 and 2010 World Cups according to the table (goal=1 in each), making the claim that he remained scoreless in 2010 false.\n\nWait, but if the first column is not about goals, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe it's an internal index for the data set, so the values don't correspond to actual scoring.\n\nIn that case, without clear information on M\u00e1rquez's scoring from the table, perhaps the claim can't be definitively proven or disproven.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I think the key point is whether in 2006 he scored and in 2010 he didn't, based on the table data. If in both cases, according to the table, he scored, then the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, the claim that Carlos M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but remained scoreless at the 2010 FIFA World Cup appears to be incorrect. The table indicates that in both tournaments, M\u00e1rquez scored goals (indicated by a value of '1' in the \"goal\" column). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; Carlos M\u00e1rquez did score goals at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups.",

The claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez does not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's stating that M\u00e1rquez didn't have a game without scoring in specific years: 2001, 2009, and 2012. So, I need to look for any international matches where he scored goals in those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a match: goal number, date, score (which is M\u00e1rquez's team's score minus the opponent's), result, and competition. \n\nI should check if there are any entries in 2001, 2009, or 2012 where M\u00e1rquez scored at least one goal.\n\nStarting with 2001: The table has data from 1999 onwards. I don't see any row for 2001. The closest is row 4 with a date of May 12, 2002, which is after 2001. So, there's no record in 2001, meaning M\u00e1rquez might have been scoreless that year. But the claim says he doesn't remain scoreless in those years, so if there's no data, it's unclear.\n\nWait, but the claim uses \"or\" for 2001, 2009, and 2012. So even if one of them is false, the overall claim might be false. Let me check each year:\n\nFor 2009: I need to find a row with date in 2009. The table goes up to 2013. Looking through the rows, there's no date in 2009. So again, M\u00e1rquez might have been scoreless that year as well.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed it. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 4: May 12, 2002\nRow 5: July 24, 2003\nRow 6: June 19, 2004\nRow 7: September 7, 2005\nRow 8: June 24, 2006\nRow 9: March 28, 2007\nRow 10: September 10, 2008\nRow 11: June 11, 2010\nRow 12: June 12, 2011\nRow 13: October 30, 2013\n\nNo rows for 2009 or 2012 either. So in all three years (2001, 2009, 2012), there's no data, implying that M\u00e1rquez might have been scoreless in those competitions.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"does not remain scoreless,\" meaning he scored at least once in each of those years. If he was scoreless in any of those years, the claim is false because he remained scoreless there.\n\nSince there's no data for 2001, 2009, or 2012, it's possible that M\u00e1rquez didn't score in any of them. Therefore, he did remain scoreless in each of those years, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Rafael M\u00e1rquez was scoreless in international competitions in 2001, 2009, and 2012 as there are no records of him scoring in those specific years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the given table is true or false. The claim is: \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Mexico lost one out of two matches in an international competition where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. So, I need to look through the table to find any instances where Mexico played in such a context and whether they lost with M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different match with columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. The \"result\" column seems important because it shows whether Mexico won or lost. The \"competition\" column tells us the type of competition.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any match involves Mexico, where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, and Mexico lost.\n\nStarting from row 0: goal is 1, date is February 1999, competition is 1999 Carlsberg Cup. The result is 3-0 in favor of Mexico. So they won here, but I'm looking for a loss when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nRow 1: date is February 2000, score is 1-0, result is 4-0, competition is Concacaf Gold Cup. M\u00e1rquez might have been playing; the goal is 1. The result is a win, so not relevant for a loss.\n\nRow 2: September 2000, score is 5-1, result is 7-1. Another win.\n\nRow 3: May 2002, goals are both 2, M\u00e1rquez scored here (goal=2), but the result is a draw (2-2). So no loss.\n\nRow 4: July 2003, score is 1-0, result is 2-0. Win again.\n\nRow 5: June 2004, goals are 3-0, result is 3-0. Win.\n\nRow 6: September 2005, score is 2-0, result is 5-0. Win.\n\nRow 7: June 2006, M\u00e1rquez scored (1-0), but the result was a loss in extra time (1-2). So here, Mexico lost when he scored. That seems relevant.\n\nSo this row (row index 7) has competition as 2006 FIFA World Cup, which is international. The goal is 1 from M\u00e1rquez, and the result shows a loss. Therefore, this matches the claim: Mexico lost once in an international competition where M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lose 1 of 2 times.\" So does that mean there are two instances where this happened? Let me check further rows to see if another such case exists.\n\nRow 8: March 2007, score is 2-2 (friendly), so it's not an international competition as per the table since friendly isn't listed as international. So irrelevant.\n\nRow 9: September 2008, score is 2-0 vs. result of 2-1. Win, so no loss.\n\nRow 10: September 2010, score is 2-0, result is 2-1. Win.\n\nRow 11: June 2010, World Cup, goals are both 1-1. It's a draw, not a loss.\n\nRow 12: June 2011, Concacaf Gold Cup, score is 1-0, result is 4-1. Win.\n\nRow 13: October 2013, friendly again, so not international.\n\nSo the only instance where Mexico lost in an international competition with M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal is row 7. The claim says \"lose 1 of 2 times,\" implying there should be two such instances. But I found only one. Therefore, the claim might be false because it refers to two times, but only once is supported.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another instance. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row for a loss and M\u00e1rquez scoring:\n\nRow 7: Yes, loss with M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n\nAre there any others? For example, in the World Cup qualifiers or other competitions where Mexico lost when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nIn row 10 (2010 qualifier), score is 2-0, but result is a loss 2-1. But M\u00e1rquez didn't score here because goal is listed as 1, not his.\n\nWait, no, the \"goal\" column shows who scored the first goal. So in row 7, M\u00e1rquez scored the first goal (1-0), then Mexico lost. In other rows where they lost, like row 10, it's 2-0 to 2-1, but the goal is 1 from someone else.\n\nSo only row 7 matches: international competition, loss, and M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"lose 1 of 2 times,\" implying two instances. But I found only one. So the claim might be false because it claims there were two such losses when in fact there's only one.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim doesn't specify the number of competitions, just that they lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored. It says \"1 of 2 times,\" but perhaps that's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe it refers to two different competitions where this happened.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"lose 1 of 2 time in international competition.\" So does that mean one instance out of two attempts? Or is it saying they lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored, and also another instance?\n\nIn any case, from the table, I found only one instance where Mexico lost in an international competition with M\u00e1rquez scoring. Therefore, the claim stating \"lose 1 of 2 times\" might be inaccurate because there's only one such case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is correct if it's saying that in two competitions, they lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored. But in this table, only one such instance exists. So perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct assessment is that the claim is false because it refers to two instances, but only one is present in the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made is that Mexico lost \"1 of 2 times\" in international competitions where Andr\u00e9s Iniesta scored a goal. However, based on the data provided, there is only one instance (the 2006 FIFA World Cup) where this occurred. Therefore, the claim is false as it inaccurately states two instances when only one exists.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Mexico lost in an international competition with Andr\u00e9s Iniesta scoring a goal only once, not twice.",
