    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"in the 1958 - 59 season , the point total be 84\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to the 1958 - 59 season in the table. The 'season' column should help identify that. Scanning through each entry, I find that the fifth array has \"1958 - 59\" as the season. So, the relevant row is at index 7.\n\nNow, within this row, I need to check the points column since the claim mentions a point total. The 'points' value for this row is 84. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other columns that might relate, but in this case, the points column directly addresses the claim. So, the relevant cells would be the one from row index 7 and the \"points\" column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the 1948 - 49 season have a win % of 0.552",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim given is: \"the 1948 - 49 season have a win % of 0.552\". \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the data. There's a JSON table with columns like season, games, won, lost, tied, points, pct %, goals for, goals against, and standing. The data is a list of lists, each representing a season.\n\nLooking at the claim, it specifically mentions the 1948 - 49 season and a win percentage of 0.552. So I need to find that particular row in the table.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's \"season\" column to locate the one that matches \"1948 - 49\". From the data provided:\n\n1. 1947 - 48\n2. 1948 - 49\n3. 1949 - 50\n4. 1950 - 51\n5. 1951 - 52\n6. 1952 - 53\n7. 1953 - 54\n8. 1954 - 55\n9. 1955 - 56\n10. 1956 - 57\n11. 1957 - 58\n12. 1958 - 59\n13. 1959 - 60\n14. 1960 - 61\n\nThe second row (index 1) is \"1948 - 49\". So that's the correct row.\n\nNow, within this row, I need to check the \"won\" and \"pct %\" columns. The claim mentions a win percentage of exactly 0.552. \n\nLooking at the \"pct %\" column for this row: it's listed as 0.552. And the \"won\" count is 25 out of 48 games, which calculates to (25/48)*100 \u2248 52.08%, but wait, in the table, the pct % is given directly as a number. So according to the table, the win percentage for 1948 - 49 is 0.552.\n\nTherefore, the claim matches exactly with the data provided in the \"pct %\" column of that row.\n\nSo I need to identify which cells are relevant. The season in question is at row_index 1. The columns we need to check are both \"won\" and \"pct %\", but since the claim directly references \"win %\", which corresponds to the \"pct %\" column, it's sufficient to include that column.\n\nWait, actually, \"pct %\" is a percentage, so if the claim says win %, then maybe both \"won\" and \"pct %\" are relevant. But in this case, since the claim directly states the pct value as 0.552, which matches exactly with the \"pct %\" column, perhaps only that column needs to be checked.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check both the \"won\" count and the percentage to make sure they align correctly. So the relevant cells are row 1's \"pct %\" and possibly \"won\". However, since the claim directly references the percentage, maybe just the pct % is needed, but it's safer to include both in case there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, no, because if someone claims that the win percentage is 0.552, we can check the pct % column. The \"won\" count is 25 out of 48, which is approximately 52%, not exactly 55.2%. However, in the table, it's given as 0.552, so perhaps they've calculated it differently or rounded it. So maybe only the pct % is relevant.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, I should check both \"won\" and \"pct %\" because without checking \"won\", someone might argue that the percentage doesn't match if there's a discrepancy in calculation. But since the table provides the percentage directly, perhaps just that column is needed.\n\nI think for this task, we need to specify which cells are relevant based on what the claim refers to. Since the claim mentions win %, and in the table, \"pct %\" is given as 0.552, so I should include both the \"won\" count and the \"pct %\".\n\nWait, but wait: \"won\" is a count of games won, while \"pct %\" is the percentage. So for someone to claim the win %, they might refer to either the count or the percentage. But the claim specifically mentions the percentage (0.552). Therefore, I should include only the relevant column that contains this value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to check both to ensure that the percentage is accurate based on the \"won\" count. So in that case, both cells need to be included.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, when they have a claim about revenue and employees, they listed two columns. So perhaps here, since the claim refers to the win %, which corresponds to one column (\"pct %\"), but maybe also \"won\". Hmm.\n\nWait no, \"win %\" is likely referring to the percentage, which is the \"pct %\" column. So in that case, only that column needs to be included.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I should confirm if 25/48 equals 0.552. Calculating 25 divided by 48: 25 \u00f7 48 \u2248 0.5208333... which is approximately 52.08%. However, the table says it's 0.552. So there's a discrepancy here. That means that either the data in the table is incorrect, or perhaps the \"pct %\" is calculated differently.\n\nWait, but the problem states that I have to determine if the claim is true based on the given data, not check if the data itself is accurate. So regardless of whether 25/48 is approximately 0.552 or not, according to the table, for the 1948-49 season, the \"pct %\" is listed as 0.552. Therefore, the claim is directly referencing that value.\n\nSo in that case, I think only the \"pct %\" column needs to be checked because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is row 1, \"pct %\". So I need to include both the index and the column name. Wait, but how? The user expects a list of cells or their indices.\n\nLooking at the example, it seems they want the indices or positions of the relevant columns. For instance, if in row 1, columns 3 (assuming indexing starts at 0) is \"won\", and column 6 is \"pct %\".\n\nSo perhaps I need to specify both column indices: 6 for \"pct %\" and maybe 2 for \"won\". But since the claim is about the percentage, which is in column 6, but the count is in column 2.\n\nWait, but no, the claim isn't directly making a statement about \"won\", just about the percentage. So perhaps only column 6 (pct %) needs to be checked. Because if the percentage matches what's stated in the table, then the claim is true regardless of whether it's calculated correctly or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both columns need to be checked because the claim could imply that based on \"won\", the percentage should be as stated.\n\nBut the problem says: determine if a claim about the data is correct. So if the claim says that for the 1948-49 season, the win % is 0.552, then we check if in the table, for that row, the pct % is 0.552.\n\nSo only the \"pct %\" column needs to be included as a relevant cell.\n\nTherefore, in terms of indices:\n\nLooking at each row, columns are: 0: season, 1: games, 2: won, 3: lost, 4: tied, 5: points, 6: pct %, etc.\n\nSo for row 1 (index 1), the \"pct %\" is column 6. So relevant cell indices would be [1,6].\n\nThus, I need to provide both the row index and the column index of the \"pct %\" value that matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row 1, column 6.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the 1948 - 49 season's win percentage is accurate, we locate the corresponding row in the table. The second row (index 1) matches \"1948 - 49\", and within this row, the \"pct %\" column lists the value 0.552. This directly aligns with the claim.\n\n**Answer:** True. Relevant cell: row 1, column 6 (\"pct %\").\n\n\\boxed{True}",

The claim is: \"for the 1950 - 51 season, there be 54 game play, with 30 won and 24 lost and 0 tie, for a standing of 1st oha.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the data in the table to see if it matches the claim.\n\nLooking through each row, I need to find the one that corresponds to the 1950 - 51 season.

The claim says 30 won, so that matches.\n- lost: 24 losses. The claim also mentions 24 lost, so that's correct.\n- tied: 7 ties in reality, but the claim says 0 ties. That doesn't match.\n- points: 53 points according to the table, but the claim doesn't specify points. So maybe not relevant here.\n\nThe standing for 1950-51 is \"6th oha\" in the data, but the claim says \"1st oha.\" That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, so the claim's standings don't match the actual data. It claims 1st place, but the table shows they were 6th.\n\nBut I should focus only on the aspects mentioned in the claim. The claim talks about games played (54), won (30), lost (24), and standing. So the number of games is correct, wins and losses are as stated, but the standing is different.\n\nSo, does the claim have to be fully accurate? Since the standing doesn't match, the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the 1950-51 season's standings being first is incorrect; they were actually sixth.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support my answer. The claim is: \"the team finish 1st oha in the season they have a win % of 0.769.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The team finishing 1st oha likely refers to their standing in the league or hierarchy during that season. The win percentage of 0.769 is a specific number, so I need to find if any row in the table has both a win% of exactly 0.769 and a standing of \"1st oha.\"\n\nLooking at the table's data, each sub-array represents a season with various stats. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Season: 1947 - 48\n- Win %: 0.528 (Not 0.769)\n- Standing: 6th oha\n\nSecond row:\n- Win%: 0.552, standing:4th oha\n\nThird row:\n- Win%:0.604, standing:3rd oha\n\nFourth row:\n- Win%:0.491, standing:6th oha\n\nFifth row:\n- Win%:0.565, standing:5th oha\n\nSixth row:\n- Win%:0.598, standing:4th oha\n\nSeventh row:\n- Season:1953 - 54\n- Win%:0.729 (That's higher than 0.769), so not matching\n- Standing:1st oha\n\nEighth row:\n- Win%:0.673, standing:1st oha\n\nNinth row:\n- Win%:0.615, standing:1st oha\n\nTenth row:\n- Season:1956 -57\n- Win%:0.5 (Not 0.769)\n- Standing:3rd oha\n\nEleventh row:\n- Season:1957 -58\n- Win%:0.673, standing:1st oha\n\nTwelfth row:\n- Season:1958 -59\n- Win%:0.769 \u2705 This matches the win percentage.\n- Standing:1st oha \u2705 This matches the finish.\n\nSo in this season (row 12), both conditions are met. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need their row_index and column_name.\n\nLooking for columns related to win% and standing.\n\nIn the table, the columns include \"pct %\" which is the same as win%, so column index 6 (0-based) is \"pct %\".\n\nStanding is column index 9.\n\nRow 12 has the season 1958 -59. Looking at each sub-array:\n\nThe 12th element in data corresponds to row_index 11? Wait, let me count: the data array starts with index 0 as first entry, so row_index 12 would be beyond the list. Wait, no, wait the rows are from 0 to 10, because there are 11 entries (from 1947-48 to 1960-61). So for 1958-59, that's the 12th season? No, let me count again.\n\nWait, data has 11 elements, each representing a different season. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: 1947-48\n\nRow1: 1948-49\n\nRow2: 1949-50\n\nRow3:1950-51\n\nRow4:1951-52\n\nRow5:1952-53\n\nRow6:1953-54\n\nRow7:1954-55\n\nRow8:1955-56\n\nRow9:1956-57\n\nRow10:1957-58\n\nWait, no. Wait the 11 entries start at row0 (1947-48) up to row10 (1960-61). So 1958-59 would be in which row? Let's list:\n\nrow0:1947-48\n\nrow1:1948-49\n\nrow2:1949-50\n\nrow3:1950-51\n\nrow4:1951-52\n\nrow5:1952-53\n\nrow6:1953-54\n\nrow7:1954-55\n\nrow8:1955-56\n\nrow9:1956-57\n\nrow10:1957-58\n\nWait, row11 would be 1958-59, but the data array only has up to row10. Wait, no, looking back, the user provided 11 rows in data, from 1947-48 to 1960-61.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0:1947-48\n\nRow1:1948-49\n\nRow2:1949-50\n\nRow3:1950-51\n\nRow4:1951-52\n\nRow5:1952-53\n\nRow6:1953-54\n\nRow7:1954-55\n\nRow8:1955-56\n\nRow9:1956-57\n\nRow10:1957-58\n\nWait, so 1958-59 isn't listed. Or did I miscount? Let me check the user's data:\n\nThe data array has 11 elements, each with season names from 1947-48 to 1960-61.\n\nWait, perhaps 1958-59 is row10? Wait no:\n\nLet me list the seasons in order:\n\n1. 1947-48 (row0)\n\n2. 1948-49 (row1)\n\n3. 1949-50 (row2)\n\n4. 1950-51 (row3)\n\n5. 1951-52 (row4)\n\n6. 1952-53 (row5)\n\n7. 1953-54 (row6)\n\n8. 1954-55 (row7)\n\n9. 1955-56 (row8)\n\n10. 1956-57 (row9)\n\n11. 1957-58 (row10)\n\nWait, so the last season in the data is row10:1957-58. So where's 1958-59? It seems it's not in the table. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nThe user provided:\n\ndata = [\n    [\"1947-48\", ...], //row0\n\n    ..., //up to row10: [\"1960-61\", ...]\n]\n\nSo 1958-59 would be in which row? After 1957-58, it's 1958-59 (row11), but the data only goes up to row10. So perhaps there is no row with 1958-59.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all:\n\nRow0:1947-48\n\nRow1:1948-49\n\nRow2:1949-50\n\nRow3:1950-51\n\nRow4:1951-52\n\nRow5:1952-53\n\nRow6:1953-54\n\nRow7:1954-55\n\nRow8:1955-56\n\nRow9:1956-57\n\nRow10:1957-58\n\nSo 1958-59 is not in the table. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, but looking back, row10 is 1957-58, and the next would be 1958-59 (row11), which isn't present. So maybe there's no season with both win% 0.769 and finish 1st oha in this table. But wait, I thought earlier that row12 is 1958-59, but that might not exist.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check each row for \"pct %\" equal to 0.769.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nrow0:0.528\n\nrow1:0.552\n\nrow2:0.604\n\nrow3:0.491\n\nrow4:0.565\n\nrow5:0.598\n\nrow6:0.729\n\nrow7:0.673\n\nrow8:0.615\n\nrow9:0.5\n\nrow10:0.673\n\nNone of these have 0.769, so perhaps the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but row6:1953-54 has 0.729, which is higher than 0.769, but not equal.\n\nRow7:1954-55:0.673\n\nRow8:1955-56:0.615\n\nSo none have exactly 0.769. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I thought earlier that row12 had it, but if there's no such row, then perhaps I was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the season as 1958-59.\n\nWait, perhaps 1958-59 is row10? But let me list again:\n\nRow0:1947\n\nEach increment by 1 year, so row6:1953-54\n\nrow7:1954-55\n\nrow8:1955-56\n\nrow9:1956-57\n\nrow10:1957-58\n\nSo 1958-59 would be after that. But the data stops at 1960-61 in row10? No, wait:\n\nWait, looking back, the user's data is:\n\n[\n    [\"1947-48\", ...],\n    [\"1948-49\", ...], //row1\n    [\"1949-50\", ...], //row2\n    [\"1950-51\", ...], //row3\n    [\"1951-52\", ...], //row4\n    [\"1952-53\", ...], //row5\n    [\"1953-54\", ...], //row6\n    [\"1954-55\", ...], //row7\n    [\"1955-56\", ...], //row8\n    [\"1956-57\", ...], //row9\n    [\"1957-58\", ...], //row10\n]\n\nSo row10 is 1957-58.\n\nThus, the last season in the table is 1957-58.\n\nTherefore, there's no data for 1958-59.\n\nHence, there is no row with both 0.769 and finish 1st.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the rows has exactly 0.769. Let me check:\n\nLooking at all \"pct %\" values in each row:\n\nRow0:0.528\n\nRow1:0.552\n\nRow2:0.604\n\nRow3:0.491\n\nRow4:0.565\n\nRow5:0.598\n\nRow6:0.729\n\nRow7:0.673\n\nRow8:0.615\n\nRow9:0.5\n\nRow10:0.673\n\nNone equal 0.769.\n\nThus, there's no such row in the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine if there exists a season in the provided data where the team finished first with a win percentage of exactly 0.769 (76.9%).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Data Structure:** The data consists of multiple rows, each representing a season with two key metrics: the year (season name) and the win percentage.\n2. **Key Metrics Checked:** For each row, we check if the win percentage is exactly 0.769 and if the team finished first.\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**\n- Iterate through each row of the data.\n- Check the value of the \"pct\" (win percentage) for each season.\n- Verify whether this value equals 0.769.\n- Additionally, confirm that the team finished first in that season.\n\n**Findings:**\nAfter evaluating all rows:\n- No season has a win percentage of exactly 0.769.\n- Therefore, no such season exists where the team achieved both a 76.9% win rate and first place finish.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no season in the provided data where the team finished first with a win percentage of 0.769.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the season with the lowest pct % be 1958 - 59 with 769\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what this claim is saying. It mentions two things: the season and its corresponding pct%. The season mentioned is \"1958 - 59\", which I should verify exists in the table. Then, it states that this season has the lowest pct% of 0.769. Wait, hold on\u2014looking at the table, each row represents a different season with various statistics.\n\nSo my first step is to find the row corresponding to \"1958 - 59\". Scanning through the data, I see rows labeled from \"1947 - 48\" up to \"1960 - 61\". So yes, there's a row for \"1958 - 59\".\n\nNext, I need to check the 'pct %' column for that season. Looking at each row, each has a 'pct %' value. For \"1958 - 59\", the pct% is listed as 0.769. \n\nBut wait, the claim says the pct% is 769. That's not correct because in the table, pct% is a decimal number, like 0.528 or 0.604. So 769 doesn't make sense there. It should be 0.769.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me check again: \"the season with the lowest pct % be 1958 - 59 with 769\". So it's saying that in that season, the pct% is 769? That can't be right because in the table, the highest pct% is over 0.7, but none reach 1.0. So perhaps the claim has a mistake here.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Is \"with 769\" referring to points or something else? Let me look at the data for \"1958 - 59\". The row shows:\n\n[\n  \"1958 - 59\",\n  54,\n  40,\n  11,\n  3,\n  84,\n  0.769,\n  257,\n  175,\n  \"1st oha\"\n]\n\nSo the 'points' column is 84, and 'pct%' is 0.769. So the claim says the season has the lowest pct% of 769. That's incorrect because the actual pct% is 0.769, not 769.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Could it be that the user meant to say that \"1958 - 59\" has the lowest pct% with 76.9%, which is 0.769? Or perhaps there's a typo in the claim?\n\nBut according to the table, the 'pct%' column doesn't have any value as high as 700. So the claim is incorrect because it states the pct% is 769 when in reality it's 0.769.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if \"1958 - 59\" is indeed the season with the lowest pct%. Let me go through each row to find all 'pct%' values:\n\n- 1947-48: 0.528\n- 1948-49: 0.552\n- 1949-50: 0.604\n- 1950-51: 0.491\n- 1951-52: 0.565\n- 1952-53: 0.598\n- 1953-54: 0.729\n- 1954-55: 0.673\n- 1955-56: 0.615\n- 1956-57: 0.5\n- 1957-58: 0.673\n- 1958-59: 0.769\n- 1959-60: 0.562\n- 1960-61: 0.438\n\nLooking at these, the lowest pct% is actually 0.438 from the 1960 - 61 season. The second lowest might be 0.5 from 1956 - 57 or 0.491 from 1950 -51.\n\nSo \"1958 - 59\" doesn't have the lowest pct%. Therefore, the claim's statement is incorrect on two counts: the season is not the one with the lowest pct%, and the pct% value is presented incorrectly as 769 instead of 0.769.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"pct %\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the final standing in season 1956 - 57 be 4th oha with 25 game win.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points: the final standing and the number of games won. Specifically, it says that in the 1956-57 season, the team finished 4th in the oha standings and had 25 wins.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season. The columns include \"season,\" \"games,\" \"won,\" \"lost,\" etc., so I can check both aspects of the claim by looking for the correct season and then verifying the number of won games and the standing.\n\nFirst step: Identify which row corresponds to the 1956-57 season. Scanning through the seasons, I see:\n\n- Row 0: 1947 - 48\n- Row 1: 1948 - 49\n- Row 2: 1949 - 50\n- Row 3: 1950 - 51\n- Row 4: 1951 - 52\n- Row 5: 1952 - 53\n- Row 6: 1953 - 54\n- Row 7: 1954 - 55\n- Row 8: 1955 - 56\n- Row 9: 1956 - 57\n- Row 10: 1957 - 58\n- Row 11: 1958 - 59\n- Row 12: 1959 - 60\n- Row 13: 1960 - 61\n\nSo, row 9 is for the season \"1956 - 57.\" Now, let's check how many games they won. Looking at the \"won\" column in this row, it shows 25. That matches with the claim stating 25 game wins.\n\nNext, we need to verify the final standing. The \"standing\" column for row 9 says \"3rd oha.\" But the claim is saying it was \"4th oha.\" There's a discrepancy here: according to the table, they finished 3rd, but the claim says 4th.\n\nSo, the number of wins matches, but the standing does not. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because while they did have 25 wins, their final position was 3rd, not 4th.\n\nWait a moment\u2014let me double-check to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Looking back at row 9 (season 1956-57), \"standing\" is listed as \"3rd oha.\" So yes, that's correct; it's 3rd, not 4th.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the standing doesn't match. The other part of the claim about the number of wins is correct, but since one part is wrong, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in season 1956-57, the team finished 4th and had 25 wins. However, according to the table, they actually finished 3rd with 25 wins. Since the standing doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the point in the 1958 - 59 season be more than 85.0",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the point in the 1958 - 59 season be more than 85.0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions \"points\" and specifies that they should be more than 85.0 in the 1958-59 season. So my main goal is to find the points column for that specific season.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different season. The columns include various statistics like games won, lost, tied, points, etc. My focus will be on the \"points\" column.\n\nI need to identify which row corresponds to the 1958-59 season. Looking at the first column of the data array, I see entries like \"1947 - 48\", \"1948 - 49\", up until \"1960 - 61\". Scanning through these, I find that the sixth entry is for \"1958 - 59\".\n\nNow, within that row, I need to check the value in the \"points\" column. From the data provided, the points for that season are listed as 84. So, the claim says more than 85.0. Since 84 is less than 85.0, this means the claim is not fully supported.\n\nI should also make sure I'm looking at the correct columns and rows to avoid any mistakes. The \"points\" column is indeed present in each row, so I didn't misread that. Also, confirming the season index: the first data row is 1947-48 (row_index 0), then 1948-49 (1), and so on until 1958-59, which is row_index 10.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me count again. The rows are:\n\n0:1947-48\n\n1:1948-49\n\n2:1949-50\n\n3:1950-51\n\n4:1951-52\n\n5:1952-53\n\n6:1953-54\n\n7:1954-55\n\n8:1955-56\n\n9:1956-57\n\n10:1957-58\n\n11:1958-59\n\nWait, no. The data array has 12 rows because the seasons go from 1947-48 to 1960-61, which is 14 years but only 12 entries here? Wait, let me recount.\n\nLooking at the initial JSON structure, the \"data\" array has 12 subarrays:\n\n1. 1947-48\n\n2. 1948-49\n\n3. 1949-50\n\n4. 1950-51\n\n5. 1951-52\n\n6. 1952-53\n\n7. 1953-54\n\n8. 1954-55\n\n9. 1955-56\n\n10. 1956-57\n\n11. 1957-58\n\n12. 1958-59\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial JSON has \"data\" as an array with 12 elements. Let me check each:\n\nYes, the data starts from \"1947 - 48\" and goes up to \"1960 - 61\". So the 11th element (index 10) is \"1958 - 59\", which I need to verify.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me count: index 0 is first, so 1947-48, then index 1 is next, up to index 12 being 1960-61. Wait, but in the JSON provided, the data array has 11 elements? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThere are 11 rows listed after \"columns\":\n\n1. 1947 -48\n\n2. 1948-49\n\n3. 1949-50\n\n4. 1950-51\n\n5. 1951-52\n\n6. 1952-53\n\n7. 1953-54\n\n8. 1954-55\n\n9. 1955-56\n\n10. 1956-57\n\n11. 1957-58\n\n12. 1958-59\n\nWait, no, the table shows up to 1960-61 as the last season, which would be row 11 if starting from 0? Or is it 12 rows? Let me recount:\n\n1. 1947-48 (row 0)\n\n2. 1948-49 (1)\n\n3. 1949-50 (2)\n\n4. 1950-51 (3)\n\n5. 1951-52 (4)\n\n6. 1952-53 (5)\n\n7. 1953-54 (6)\n\n8. 1954-55 (7)\n\n9. 1955-56 (8)\n\n10. 1956-57 (9)\n\n11. 1957-58 (10)\n\n12. 1958-59 (11)\n\n13. 1959-60? No, the last one is \"1960 - 61\" which would be row 12.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me just list them:\n\nRow 0:1947-48\n\n1:1948-49\n\n2:1949-50\n\n3:1950-51\n\n4:1951-52\n\n5:1952-53\n\n6:1953-54\n\n7:1954-55\n\n8:1955-56\n\n9:1956-57\n\n10:1957-58\n\n11:1958-59\n\n12:1960-61\n\nSo, the 1958-59 season is at row 11. Now, checking the \"points\" for that row.\n\nIn row 11 (1958-59), points are listed as 84. So, since 84 < 85.0, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not true because in 1958-59, points were 84, which is less than 85.0.\n</think>\n\nThe points for the 1958-59 season were 84, which is less than 85. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",
