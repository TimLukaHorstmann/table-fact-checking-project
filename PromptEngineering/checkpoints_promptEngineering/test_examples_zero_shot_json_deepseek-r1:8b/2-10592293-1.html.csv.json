    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"corrado barazzutti be partner on november 15 , 1976\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. \n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that Corrado Barazzutti was a partner on November 15, 1976. So I need to look in the table for any entry where \"partner\" is Corrado Barazzutti and the date is November 15, 1976.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: outcome, date, tournament, partner, opponents in the final. The data rows contain these columns. \n\nI should go through each row to check if any match both criteria: partner as Corrado Barazzutti and date as November 15, 1976.\n\nStarting from row 0, the partner is Vijay Amritraj, not Corrado. Next rows also show different partners until I reach row 14 (index 13). \n\nRow 13: The date is \"10 march 1983\" \u2013 not November 15. Next, row 14: Date is \"11 july 1983\" \u2013 still no. Then row 15: It shows a tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, on July 11, 1983, partner Mike Bauer. No match.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed the specific November date. Let me check rows with dates around November 1976.\n\nLooking back, row 12 (index 11): Date is \"9 march 1976\" \u2013 not November. Row 13: March again. Row 14: April. Then row 15: August. Hmm, maybe I need to go further.\n\nWait, the table has rows beyond that. Let me list them all properly.\n\nActually, the table provided goes up to row index 19 (last entry is row 19). So I should check each date for November 15, 1976. \n\nLooking through each row's date: Most are in various months and years. For November 15, 1976, the only relevant dates would be if any row has that exact date.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look specifically for rows where \"partner\" is Corrado Barazzutti. Let me scan the partner column:\n\nLooking at each row's partner:\n- Row 0: Vijay Amritraj\n- Row 1: ...\n- ...\n- Row 11 (index 10): John Austin\n- Row 12 (index 11): Fritz Buehning\n- Row 13 (index 12): David Carter\n- Row 14 (index 13): Tony Giammalva\n- Row 15 (index 14): Vijay Amritraj\n- Row 16 (index 15): Mike Cahill\n- Row 17 (index 16): Bruce Manson\n- Row 18 (index 17): Pavel Sloviel\n- Row 19 (index 18): Tony Giammalva again.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. The row indices go from 0 to 19 because there are 20 rows of data. Each row has 5 columns: outcome, date, tournament, partner, opponents in the final.\n\nNow, looking for any row where partner is Corrado Barazzutti and date is November 15, 1976. From the data provided:\n\nIn row 10 (index 9): Partner is Jaime Fillol.\nRow 11: John Austin.\nRow 12: Fritz Buehning.\nRow 13: David Carter.\nRow 14: Tony Giammalva.\nRow 15: Vijay Amritraj.\nRow 16: Mike Cahill.\nRow 17: Bruce Manson.\nRow 18: Pavel Sloviel.\nRow 19: Tony Giammalva.\n\nNone of these partners are Corrado Barazzutti. Therefore, there is no entry where both the partner is Corrado and date is November 15, 1976.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there's no such row in the table that satisfies both conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for the partner being Corrado Barazzutti on November 15, 1976. No matching entries were found in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"On August 8, 1980, Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts were the opponents.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It's a JSON with columns: outcome, date, tournament, partner, and opponents in the final. Each row represents an event with these details.\n\nI need to find any rows where both \"Tom Gullikson\" and \"Butch Walts\" appear in the same tournament as opponents on August 8, 1980. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- I'll start by looking at the date column for August 8, 1980. Scanning through, I find a row with \"runner - up\" status, date \"8 august 1980\", location Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The partner is John Austin, and the opponents are Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts.\n\nWait, that's exactly what the claim says: they were opponents on August 8, 1980. So this row is relevant because it matches all conditions in the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows for August 8, 1980. Looking further, I don't see another entry with the same date. So only one row matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"corrado barazzutti partner with geoff master on november 15 , 1976.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two people: Corrado Barazzutti and Geoff Master. The event happened on November 15, 1976.\n\nLooking at the table columns: outcome, date, tournament, partner, opponents in the final. The relevant columns for this claim are 'partner' because it's about who Barazzutti partnered with, and 'date' to check if it was November 15, 1976.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the data to find matches.\n\nStarting from row 0: outcome is \"runner - up\", date is October 21, 1973. Not relevant since it's a different date and player.\n\nRow 1: winner on November 19, 1973. Date doesn't match, so skip.\n\nRow 2: November 16, 1974. Also not November 15, so move on.\n\nRow 3: Runner-up on August 19, 1974. Not the date we're looking for.\n\nRow 4: Winner on August 19, 1974. Date doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: February 10, 1975.

No match.\n\nRow 11: April 28, 1980. Not November.\n\nRow 12: August 8, 1980. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 13: April 6, 1981. No.\n\nRow 14: August 3, 1981. Different date.\n\nRow 15: November 1, 1982. Close, but not November 15.\n\nRow 16: November 30, 1982. Not the specific date.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a row where the date is November 15, 1976. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at row 17: February 21, 1983. No. Then row 18: July 11, 1983. Hmm, maybe I skipped some rows. Let me recount from the beginning to ensure I didn't miss any relevant data.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all rows where the date is November 15, 1976. But looking through each row's date:\n\nRow 0: 10/21/73\n1:11/19/73\n2:11/16/74\n3:8/19/74\n4:8/19/74\n5:2/10/75\n6:3/10/75\n7:3/24/75\n8:8/5/75\n9:9/15/75\n10:4/14/80\n11:4/28/80\n12:8/8/80\n13:4/6/81\n14:8/3/81\n15:11/1/82\n16:11/30/82\n17:2/21/83\n18:7/11/83\n\nNone of these rows have a date of November 15, 1976. So, there's no data in the table that matches both the date and the partner details mentioned in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, looking for Corrado Barazzutti as a 'partner' in the 'partner' column: \n\nRow 0: Partner is John A.\nRow 1: Partner is Fred Stolle\nRow 2: Partner is Mike Cahill\nRow 3: Partner is Bruce Manson\nRow 4: Partner is Mark Edmondson\nRow 5: Partner is Pavel Shmakov\nRow 6: Partner is Bruce Manson\nRow 7: Partner is Pavel Shmakov\nRow 8: Partner is Bruce Manson\nRow 9: Partner is Tony Giammalva\nRow 10: Partner is Brian Teacher\nRow 11: Partner is Mark Edmondson\nRow 12: Partner is Tom Gullikson\nRow 13: Partner is Brian Teacher\nRow 14: Partner is Bruce Manson\nRow 15: Partner is Vijay Amritraj\nRow 16: Partner is David Carter\nRow 17: Partner is Pavel Shmakov\nRow 18: Partner is Mike Bauer\n\nNone of these partners are Corrado Barazzutti or Geoff Master on November 15, 1976. Therefore, the claim doesn't have support in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Corrado Barazzutti partnered with Geoff Master on November 15, 1976. After reviewing each row of the table, none match both the date and partner details mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The columns 'date' and 'partner' are relevant for verifying the claim.\n2. **Check Each Row for November 15, 1976:** None of the rows have a date of November 15, 1976.\n3. **Check Partners for Corrado Barazzutti on That Date:** Since no row matches the date, there's no need to check partners further.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is not supported by any data in the table, so it must be considered FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
