Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"perth glory be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007.\" So, I need to check if Perth Glory was the away team for both those specific dates mentioned in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. Each row represents a match with these details. \n\nThe claim is about two dates: 4 August 2007 and 12 August 2007. So I should focus on the rows where the date matches either of these.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The first row has a date of \"14 july 2007\" \u2013 that's not relevant.\n- Second row, \"20 july 2007\" \u2013 also not relevant.\n- Third row is \"28 july 2007\" \u2013 nope.\n- Fourth row: \"4 august 2007\". Let me check the away team here. It says \"perth glory\" in the away team column.\n- Fifth row: \"12 august 2007\". The away team is also \"perth glory\".\n\nSo, for both 4 August and 12 August, Perth Glory was indeed the away team.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the relevant cells. Each of these dates corresponds to a specific row in the table. For 4 August, it's row index 3 (since we start counting from 0). For 12 August, it's row index 4.\n\nTherefore, the columns to look at are \"date\" and \"away team\". So each relevant cell will have the row index and the column name.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should be TRUE because both dates in the claim match the away team as Perth Glory.

The table has six columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium.\n\nThe claim mentions two dates: 4 August 2007 and 20 July 2007. So, I need to find the corresponding rows for these dates in the data section.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- Round: 1\n- Date: 14 July 2007\nNot relevant because it's not either of the specified dates.\n\nSecond row:\n- Round: 2\n- Date: 20 July 2007\nThis is the match on 20 July 2007. The stadium for this match is Hindmarsh Stadium, as seen in the column \"stadium.\" So, the crowd size here is important.\n\nThird row:\n- Round: 3\n- Date: 28 July 2007\nNot relevant since it's neither of the specified dates.\n\nFourth row:\n- Round: SF (which I think stands for Semi-Final)\n- Date: 4 August 2007\nThis is the match on 4 August 2007 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. So, this row has the crowd size we need.\n\nFifth row:\n- Round: GF (Grand Final)\n- Date: 12 August 2007\nNot relevant because the claim is about 4 August, not 12 August.\n\nNow, I'll check the crowd numbers for both dates.\n\nFrom the table, on 20 July 2007, the crowd was 3513 at Hindmarsh Stadium. On 4 August 2007, the crowd was 5967 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium.\n\nThe claim states that the crowd on 4 August was larger than on 20 July. Since 5967 is greater than 3513, this part of the claim is true.\n\nSo, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant cells are:\n\n- For 20 July: row index 1 (since it's zero-indexed), and column \"crowd.\"\n- For 4 August: row index 3, column \"crowd.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the crowd on 4 August was indeed larger than on 20 July.

The claim says: \"the home team be adelaide unite on both 20 july 2007 and on 12 august 2007.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asking. It's asserting that the home team was Adelaide United for two specific dates: July 20, 2007, and August 12, 2007. So I need to check both of these dates in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. The data rows contain entries for each game on a particular date.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to the specified dates. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** \n   - Date: \"14 july 2007\" \u2013 not one of the claim's dates.\n   \n2. **Row 1:** \n   - Date: \"20 july 2007\" \u2013 this is one date in the claim.\n   - I'll check the home team here. The value under \"home team\" is \"adelaide united.\" So that's a match for July 20, 2007.\n\n3. **Row 2:** \n   - Date: \"28 july 2007\" \u2013 not relevant.\n\n4. **Row 3:** \n   - Date: \"4 august 2007\" \u2013 close to August 12 but not the same date.\n   \n5. **Row 4:** \n   - Date: \"12 august 2007\" \u2013 this is the second date in the claim.\n   - Checking the home team here, it's listed as \"adelaide united.\" So that matches for August 12, 2007.\n\nNow, I need to see if both dates have Adelaide United as the home team. From the checks above, both July 20 and August 12 do have Adelaide United. Therefore, the claim seems correct on both counts.\n\nHowever, wait a minute\u2014looking at the row indices, rows 1 and 4 are the relevant ones because they correspond to the two specified dates. The home teams for these rows are indeed Adelaide United in both cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is TRUE because for both the given dates, the home team was Adelaide United.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified true as both specified dates have Adelaide United as the home team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"the stadium used for the game on 20 July 2007 be the same as the stadium used for the game on 12 August 2007.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to find the games on those dates and check their stadiums. The table has a 'date' column, so I can filter the rows based on that.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: Date is 14 July 2007\nRow 1: Date is 20 July 2007\nRow 2: Date is 28 July 2007\nRow 3: Date is 4 August 2007\nRow 4: Date is 12 August 2007\n\nSo, the game on 20 July 2007 is row 1. The stadium for that game is \"hindmarsh stadium\".\n\nNext, the game on 12 August 2007 is row 4. The stadium for that game is also \"hindmarsh stadium\".\n\nTherefore, both games were held at the same stadium.\n\nNow, I need to map this information back to the table's structure. The 'stadium' column is what we're interested in. So, for each relevant date, we get the row index and check the 'stadium' value.\n\nFor 20 July 2007 (row 1), the stadium is \"hindmarsh stadium\" at column index 6 (since columns are [\"round\", \"date\", ..., \"stadium\"], so index starts at 0).\n\nSimilarly, for 12 August 2007 (row 4), the same column is used with the same value.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are both in the 'stadium' column but different rows. Wait, actually, each game's stadium is a single cell. So for each date, we need to check the 'stadium' cell.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be two separate entries: one from row 1 (20 July) and another from row 4 (12 August), both pointing to the 'stadium' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both games on the specified dates were held at the same stadium.

The claim is: \"adelaide unite be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions Adelaide Unite being the away team on two specific dates: August 4th and August 12th, 2007. So I need to check if there are any matches in the table where Adelaide United is listed as the away team on those dates.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for \"round,\" \"date,\" \"home team,\" \"score,\" \"away team,\" \"crowd,\" and \"stadium.\" The data rows have specific information. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0:** \n   - Date: July 14, 2007\n   - Away Team: Perth Glory\n   - This doesn't match August dates or Adelaide United as away.\n\n2. **Row 1:** \n   - Date: July 20, 2007\n   - Away Team: Perth Glory\n   - Again, not the right date or team.\n\n3. **Row 2:** \n   - Date: July 28, 2007\n   - Away Team: Melbourne Victory\n   - Not matching.\n\n4. **Row 3:** \n   - Date: August 4, 2007\n   - Home Team: Central Coast Mariners\n   - The away team here is Perth Glory, so Adelaide isn't the away team on this date.\n\n5. **Row 4:** \n   - Date: August 12, 2007\n   - Away Team: Adelaide United\n   - This matches the claim for both dates in question because the row's date is August 12th and the away team is Adelaide United.\n\nWait, but the first part of the claim mentions August 4th. In Row 3, on August 4th, the away team was Perth Glory, not Adelaide United. So that doesn't match. However, the second part about August 12th does match because in Row 4, Adelaide United is the away team on August 12.\n\nSo the claim says both dates have Adelaide as away. But on August 4, they weren't. Therefore, only August 12 is correct. Since not all parts of the claim are supported, it should be false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a specific date: 4 August 2007. Looking at the table, I should find the row corresponding to this date. The table's data rows have dates in the second column, so I'll check that column for \"4 august 2007\". \n\nOnce I locate the correct row, I need to identify which columns are relevant. The claim talks about the crowd size at Hindmarsh Stadium on that day. So, looking at the columns, \"crowd\" and \"stadium\" are important. The \"crowd\" column gives the number of people who attended, and the \"stadium\" column tells where the match was held.\n\nIn the table, I'll check each row for the date 4 August 2007. Let's see: looking through each data row, the fourth one (row index 3) has \"4 august 2007\". Now, in that same row, what's the stadium? It says \"bluetongue central coast stadium\", which is different from Hindmarsh Stadium. So, this isn't the right match for the claim.\n\nWait a minute. The claim refers to Hindmarsh Stadium, but none of the rows with 4 August have that as the stadium. Let me double-check: row index 1 has \"hindmarsh stadium\" on 20 July 2007. But the date in the claim is 4 August, so that's not the same date.\n\nSo, there is no row where the date is 4 August 2007 and the stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium. That means the data needed to verify the claim isn't present in the table. Without knowing the crowd size at that specific match, I can't compare it to others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Could there be another row? Let me check again. Row 0: 14 July, not the date. Row 1: 20 July, Hindmarsh but different date. Row 2: 28 July, Darwin stadium. Row 3: 4 August, BlueTongue. Row 4: 12 August, Hindmarsh. So, the only other Hindmarsh match is on 12 August.\n\nSo, for the claim about 4 August, there's no data in the table. Therefore, it's impossible to verify whether the crowd was larger than any others because that particular game isn't recorded. Thus, the claim can't be fully supported as TRUE based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific match on 4 August 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium, but this match isn't present in the table.

I'll need to find these specific rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The first row is for round \"1\" on 14 July 2007.\n- The second row is round \"2\" on 20 July 2007. The home team here is Adelaide United, and the away team is Perth Glory.\n- The third row is round \"3\" on 28 July 2007 with Perth Glory as the home team.\n- The fourth row is labeled \"sf\" (probably a playoff) on 4 August 2007 with Central Coast Mariners as the home team.\n- The fifth row is labeled \"gf\" (grand final) on 12 August 2007, where Adelaide United is the home team.\n\nWait, so for the date 20 July 2007 (second row), the home team is Adelaide United, not Newcastle Jets.

The first part of the claim refers to 20 July 2007. From the table, that's row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed), and the home team there is Adelaide United, so it's definitely not Newcastle Jets.\n\nThe second date mentioned is 12 August 2007, which corresponds to row index 4. Here, the home team is Adelaide United again, as indicated by the data: \"adelaide united\" in the home team column.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the stadium used for the game on 12 august 2007 be same stadium use in the game on 28 july 2007.\" So basically, the person is saying that the venue where Perth Glory played against Adelaide United on August 12 was the same as the one they used when they played Melbourne Victory on July 28.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant rows and columns. The claim mentions two specific dates: 12 August 2007 and 28 July 2007. So I should look for those exact dates in the \"date\" column.\n\nLet me scan through the data:\n\n- Row 0: 14 July 2007\n- Row 1: 20 July 2007\n- Row 2: 28 July 2007 \u2013 this is one of our target dates.\n- Row 3: 4 August 2007\n- Row 4: 12 August 2007 \u2013 the other target date.\n\nSo, relevant rows are row 2 (28 July) and row 4 (12 August). \n\nNext, I need to check what the home and away teams were on those dates because sometimes the stadium might change based on which team is playing. On row 2, the home team is Perth Glory, and they're playing Melbourne Victory at Darwin Football Stadium. On row 4, Perth Glory is again the home team but this time they play Adelaide United at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nWait a minute, so in row 2 (28 July), the stadium was Darwin Football Stadium, while in row 4 (12 August), the venue was Hindmarsh Stadium. Therefore, the stadiums are different on these two dates, even though Perth Glory was playing away in both cases but against different opponents.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that the stadium used on both those dates was the same, which isn't true because they're using different venues.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check the stadium for both specified games. \n\n- **28 July 2007**: Perth Glory (home) vs Melbourne Victory at Darwin Football Stadium.\n- **12 August 2007**: Perth Glory (home) vs Adelaide United at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nSince these are two different stadiums, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
