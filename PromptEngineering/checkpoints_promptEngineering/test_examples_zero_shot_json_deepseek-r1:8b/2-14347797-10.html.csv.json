    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is asking. It wants me to check which game on April 14 had the New Jersey Devils as the opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, and series status. The columns are \"game,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"score,\" and \"series.\"\n\nSo I need to find the row where the date is April 14. Let's go through the rows one by one.\n\nRow 0: Game 1 on April 8 vs. New Jersey Devils.\nRow 1: Game 2 on April 10 vs. New Jersey Devils.\nRow 2: Game 3 on April 12 vs. New Jersey Devils.\nRow 3: Game 4 on April 14 vs. New York Devils? Wait, no, the opponent column here says \"new jersey devils.\" Wait, in the table provided, row 3's opponent is \"new jersey devils\"? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the data:\n\n[\n  [\n    1,\n    \"april 8\",\n    \"new jersey devils\",\n    \"3 - 2\",\n    \"flyers lead 1 - 0\"\n  ],\n  [\n    2,\n    \"april 10\",\n    \"new jersey devils\",\n    \"3 - 2\",\n    \"flyers lead 2 - 0\"\n  ],\n  [\n    3,\n    \"april 12\",\n    \"new jersey devils\",\n    \"2 - 4\",\n    \"flyers lead 2 - 1\"\n  ],\n  [\n    4,\n    \"april 14\",\n    \"new jersey devils\",\n    \"3 - 0\",\n    \"flyers lead 3 - 1\"\n  ],\n  [\n    5,\n    \"april 17\",\n    \"new jersey devils\",\n    \"3 - 1\",\n    \"flyers win 4 - 1\"\n  ]\n]\n\nSo row 4 is April 14, and the opponent is indeed New Jersey Devils. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. The claim says \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil.\" So yes, that matches with the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe opponent on April 14 is the New Jersey Devils, as shown in row 4 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
