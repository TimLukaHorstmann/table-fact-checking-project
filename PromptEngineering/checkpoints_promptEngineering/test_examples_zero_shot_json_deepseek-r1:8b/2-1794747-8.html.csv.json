    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"imelda staunton win the laurence olivier award for best actress in a musical category in 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe claim mentions Imelda Staunton. Looking at the table, under the 'nominee' column, there's an entry for Imelda Staunton in one of the rows. Specifically, row 3 has \"imelda staunton\" as the nominee for the best actress in a musical category in 2013.\n\nNext, the award ceremony is the Laurence Olivier Award. Checking the table, all the entries from 2013 have \"laurence olivier award\" as the award ceremony, so that matches.\n\nThe result of the award is \"won,\" which aligns with the 'result' column showing \"won\" for that particular row.\n\nSo putting it all together: Imelda Staunton was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award in 2013 in the best actress category and she won. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this claim. The columns involved are 'nominee', 'result', 'year', and 'award ceremony'. So each of these needs to be checked for the specific row where Imelda Staunton is nominated and won in 2013.\n\nThe relevant rows are:\n- Row 3: [2013, \"laurence olivier award\", \"best actress in a musical\", \"imelda staunton\", \"won\"]\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n1. Row 3, 'nominee' column\n2. Row 3, 'result' column\n3. Row 3, 'year' column\n4. Row 3, 'award ceremony' column\n\nTherefore, I'll list these as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data, confirming that Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award in 2013 for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The columns are: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, result. The data rows provide information about various awards over the years, including who was nominated and whether they won.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Imelda Staunton being a nominee in 2012. So I need to find if there's any row from the year 2012 where the \"nominee\" is Imelda Staunton.\n\nLooking at the table, let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Year is 2012, award ceremony is evening standard award, category is best musical, nominee is also best musical. So no, not Imelda.\n- Rows 1 to 4 are from 2013, so they don't apply since the claim is about 2012.\n- The remaining rows (5-7) are also 2013, so irrelevant.\n\nSo in all 2012 rows, I didn't find any where the nominee is Imelda Staunton. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: Since there's no row in 2012 where the nominee is her, but perhaps to check, we need to look at all 2012 rows' \"nominee\" column. So row_index 0 has column_name \"nominee\", which I should include.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check. The claim is about a specific year and a specific person being a nominee. Since there are no such entries in 2012 for Imelda, the answer is FALSE. But to provide relevant cells, maybe all 2012 rows' \"nominee\" column need to be checked. So row_index 0's \"nominee\" cell.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
