    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"shrek be nominate for a tony award in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Shrek.\" Looking at the table, there are multiple entries where the nominated work is \"Shrek,\" so that's a good starting point. The claim also specifies \"tony award,\" which is one of the columns in the table, specifically under \"award.\"\n\nNext, the time frame is 2009. I'll need to check if any row in the data has the year 2009 and the category as either \"best performance by a leading actress in a musical\" or another relevant Tony Award category since Shrek might have been nominated in multiple categories.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that in 2009, there are several entries for \"Shrek.\" Let's examine each one:\n\n- In row 18 (0-indexed would be 18?), the data is [2009, \"tony award\", \"best performance by a leading actress in a musical\", \"shrek\", \"nominated\"]. So that's a nomination for the Tony Award in the category of best performance for Shrek.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Shrek be nominate for a tony award in 2009.\" So this entry shows that Shrek was indeed nominated for a Tony Award in 2009. That seems to support the claim.\n\nBut I should check if there are any other relevant cells. There's also row 19: [2009, \"drama desk award\", \"outstanding actress in a musical\", \"shrek\", \"nominated\"], and row 20: [2009, \"outer critics circle award\", \"outstanding actress in a musical\", \"shrek\", \"won\"]. So Shrek was also nominated for the Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics Circle Award but only won the latter. However, the claim is about being nominated for a Tony Award, which is confirmed by row 18.\n\nWait, but in the table, row indices might be from 0 to n-1. Let me count: there are 21 entries (from 2002 to 2013). So row 0 is [2002, \"tony award\", ...], up to row 20 being [2013, ...]. Therefore, row 18 is indeed the 19th entry, which would be 2009.\n\nSo in row 18, the columns relevant are year=2009, award=\"tony award,\" category=\"best performance by a leading actress in a musical,\" nominated work=\"shrek,\" and result=\"nominated.\" That directly supports the claim that Shrek was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 18 for \"year\" (2009), \"award\" (\"tony award\"), \"category\" (\"best performance by a leading actress in a musical\"), and \"nominated work\" (\"shrek\"). Also, perhaps the result column is necessary to confirm it's just a nomination.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include row 18 with columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result. But according to the instructions, I need to specify which cells are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about being nominated for a Tony Award in 2009, the key information is the year, award type, category, and that Shrek was nominated.\n\nTherefore, the cells to include would be:\n\n- row_index:18 (which corresponds to 2009)\n- column_name: \"year\"\n- row_index:18\n- column_name: \"award\"\n- row_index:18\n- column_name: \"category\"\n- row_index:18\n- column_name: \"nominated work\"\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about being nominated for a Tony Award. So maybe only the award and category columns are necessary to confirm that Shrek was indeed nominated in that specific category.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. row 18, \"award\" (tony award)\n2. row 18, \"category\" (\"best performance by a leading actress in a musical\")\n3. row 18, \"nominated work\" (\"shrek\")\n\nBut perhaps also including the year is necessary to confirm it's 2009.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the award and category are sufficient since they directly tie into the claim.\n\nI think the answer should include all relevant columns that support the claim. So:\n\n- The year must be 2009: row 18, \"year\"\n- The award must be Tony Award: row 18, \"award\"\n- The category is best performance by a leading actress in musical: row 18, \"category\"\n- The nominated work is Shrek: row 18, \"nominated work\"\n\nBut wait, the result column shows it was just a nomination. So perhaps that's also relevant to confirm that it wasn't a win.\n\nSo all these columns are necessary to verify that Shrek was indeed nominated for the Tony Award in 2009.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include all these.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"Shrek's nominated work\" and says it \"won a drama award in 2009.\" So, I should look for entries in the table where the year is 2009, the category is related to a drama award, and the work is Shrek.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an award with details like year, award name, category, nominated work, and result. The columns are: year, award, category, nominated work, result.\n\nI'll start by searching for rows where the year is 2009. Scanning through the data, I see that there's a row with year 2009. Let me check it:\n\n- Year: 2009\n- Award: tony award\n- Category: best performance by a leading actress in a musical\n- Nominated work: Shrek\n- Result: nominated\n\nHmm, so this shows that Shrek was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009 but the result is \"nominated,\" not \"won.\"\n\nNext, are there other rows for 2009? Yes, there's another row with:\n\n- Year: 2009\n- Award: drama desk award\n- Category: outstanding actress in a musical\n- Nominated work: Shrek\n- Result: nominated\n\nSame result here\u2014Shrek was only nominated.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"won a drama award.\" I need to check if any row for 2009 shows that Shrek won an award. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rows again for 2009, there's another one:\n\n- Year: 2009\n- Award: outer critics circle award\n- Category: outstanding actress in a musical\n- Nominated work: Shrek\n- Result: won\n\nAh, here we go! This row shows that Shrek was awarded the outer critics circle award in 2009. So, it wasn't just a nomination but an actual win.\n\nWait, but I need to check which columns are relevant for the claim. The claim mentions \"drama award,\" so I should look at the 'award' column. The row where Shrek won is under the 'outer critics circle award.' That's different from, say, Tony or Drama Desk awards, which are also mentioned in other rows.\n\nHowever, the claim doesn't specify the exact type of drama award but just says \"drama award.\" So, if the table has any row for 2009 where Shrek was awarded a drama-related prize, regardless of the specific award name, then it's true.\n\nWait, no. The claim is specifically about \"drama award,\" so we need to see if there's a row in 2009 where Shrek's nominated work won a drama award. In this case, yes, because one of the rows shows that Shrek was awarded the outer critics circle award.\n\nBut wait, the columns are 'award,' which is the specific name. So, does \"outer critics circle award\" qualify as a drama award? I think it's considered a drama award since it's for performance in musicals, similar to Tony and Drama Desk awards.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Year 2009\n- Award: outer critics circle award (but wait, no\u2014wait, the 'award' column is actually the name. So in this case, the row has \"outer critics circle award\" as the award name.)\n\nBut let me check each cell:\n\nFor 2009, there are three entries:\n\n1. tony award, best performance... nominated\n2. drama desk award, outstanding actress... nominated\n3. outer critics circle award, outstanding actress... won\n\nSo, for the third row in 2009, Shrek's nominated work (\"Shrek\") resulted in a \"won\" for the outer critics circle award.\n\nTherefore, Shrek did win a drama award (specifically the outer critics circle award) in 2009. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that there are no other relevant cells beyond this. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking at all the rows for 2009:\n\n- The first row: tony award, Shrek was nominated\n- Second row: drama desk award, Shrek was nominated\n- Third row: outer critics circle award, Shrek won\n\nSo only the third row is a win. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because Shrek did win a drama award in 2009.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant:\n\nFor the winning row (third row of 2009), columns are:\n\n- row_index: 18\n- column_name: award\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, looking at the table, each row has year, award, category, nominated work, result. So in this case, for the third row in 2009, the relevant columns would be:\n\n- row_index: let's count. Wait, I don't have the exact indices here, but from the example given earlier, it's a list of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\"\n\nAssuming that each row is listed in order starting from 0, so for 2009 rows:\n\n1. Row 18: tony award\n2. Row 19: drama desk award\n3. Row 20: outer critics circle award\n\nSo the third row (row_index:20) has the 'award' column as \"outer critics circle award.\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n\nWait, but in the table, each row's columns are:\n\n0: year\n1: award\n2: category\n3: nominated work\n4: result\n\nSo for row 20, column 1 is \"outer critics circle award.\" Therefore, the relevant cell is {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n\nAdditionally, since the claim mentions Shrek's nominated work, perhaps the 'nominated work' column is also relevant? Let me see: in that row, the 'nominated work' is Shrek. So maybe we need to include that as well.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Shrek's nominated work won a drama award.\" So both the 'award' and 'nominated work' columns are involved. However, the example given only includes two cells: revenue and employees, so perhaps in this case, including both 'award' and 'nominated work' would be necessary.\n\nBut wait, let me check: The claim is about whether Shrek's nominated work (Shrek) won a drama award. So to confirm that, we need to see if the 'result' was \"won\" for that specific row, which it does. So perhaps both 'award' and 'nominated work' are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the 'award' column is needed because the result is \"won.\" But I think the question is about the claim's components: \"Shrek's nominated work won a drama award,\" so we need to ensure that Shrek was the one who won (nominated work), and the award in question is a drama award.\n\nSo, perhaps both 'award' and 'nominated work' columns are relevant. Let me see:\n\nIn the third row of 2009, the 'award' is \"outer critics circle award,\" which is a drama award, and 'nominated work' is Shrek. So the result was \"won.\"\n\nTherefore, to show that Shrek's nominated work (Shrek) won a drama award, we need both columns: 'award' (to confirm it's a drama award) and 'nominated work' (to confirm it's Shrek).\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. {\"row_index\":20, \"column_name\":\"award\"}\n2. {\"row_index\":20, \"column_name\":\"nominated work\"}\n\nBut wait, in the example given, only two columns were included, but perhaps here both are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just 'result' is needed, but that's not part of the claim. The claim refers to the award and the nominated work.\n\nTherefore, I think including both 'award' and 'nominated work' would be appropriate to show that Shrek's work was awarded a drama award in 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Shrek's nominated work won the outer critics circle award in 2009. The relevant cells are the 'award' column where the result was \"won\" and the 'nominated work' column which confirms it was Shrek.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"2012 have a nominated result\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that in 2012, there was a nomination in some category.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result. So each row represents an award and related information for a specific year.\n\nFirst, I should filter the rows to find those where the \"year\" is 2012. Scanning through the data:\n\n- The first few years are 2002, then 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, and finally 2012 and 2013. So I'm interested in the 2012 rows.\n\nLooking at row 19 (since it's zero-indexed, but let me count properly). Wait, let's see: each year group is a series of entries. For example, 2002 has 5 entries, then 2005 with 4 entries? No, wait, checking again:\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the data array:\n\nStarting from row 0 (year 2002), it goes up to row 6 for 2005, then rows 7-12 for 2006, 13-18 for 2008 and 2009, then 19-27 for 2011, 28 for 2012, and 29 for 2013.\n\nSo the 2012 row is at index 28. Let me confirm that:\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n...\n16: 2006\n17: 2006\n18: 2008\n19: 2009\n20: 2009\n21: 2011\n22: 2011\n23: 2011\n24: 2011\n25: 2012 (index 25)\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list the data:\n\nRows 0-5: 2002 (5 entries)\n6-9: 2005 (4 entries)\n10-13: 2006 (4 entries)\n14-17: 2008 and 2009 (each has 3 or 4? Wait, no. Let me list each entry with their indices:\n\n0: 2002\n1: 2002\n2: 2002\n3: 2002\n4: 2002\n5: 2002\n6: 2005\n7: 2005\n8: 2005\n9: 2005\n10: 2006\n11: 2006\n12: 2006\n13: 2006\n14: 2008\n15: 2008\n16: 2009\n17: 2009\n18: 2009\n19: 2011\n20: 2011\n21: 2011\n22: 2011\n23: 2012 (row index 23)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking for rows where the \"year\" is 2012. Each row starts with the year, so let's check:\n\n- Row 19: 2011\n- Row 20: 2011\n- Row 21: 2011\n- Row 22: 2011\n- Row 23: 2012 (year is 2012)\n- Row 24: 2012\nWait, no. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: 2002\n...\nContinuing up, I think the 2012 entries start around index 25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to just find all rows where \"year\" is 2012.\n\nLooking through the data, after 2011 comes 2012 and 2013. So the 2012 row would be somewhere in the middle.\n\nI see that at index 28: \"teen choice award\", which is for 2012, as per the year column being 2012.\n\nSo row 28: year=2012, award=\"teen choice award\", category=\"breakout star female\", nominated work=\"bunheads\", result=\"nominated\".\n\nTherefore, in 2012, there was a nomination. So the claim says \"2012 have a nominated result,\" which is TRUE because in 2012, the award had a \"nominated\" result.\n\nNow, I need to find which columns are relevant. The claim mentions that 2012 has a \"nominated result.\" Looking at the table, each row's last column is \"result,\" which indicates whether it was a win or not. So in this case, the result is \"nominated.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the row where year=2012 and the \"result\" column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list should include the cell at row 28 (assuming that's the index) and column_name=\"result\".\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the exact index. Let me recount:\n\nEach group of years is as follows:\n- 2002: rows 0-4\n- 2005: rows 5-8\n- 2006: rows 9-12\n- 2008: rows 13-15\n- 2009: rows 16-18\n- 2011: rows 19-22\n- 2012: row 23 and perhaps more.\n\nWait, actually, the data provided is as follows:\n\n0: 2002\n1: 2002\n2: 2002\n3: 2002\n4: 2002\n5: 2005\n6: 2005\n7: 2005\n8: 2005\n9: 2006\n10: 2006\n11: 2006\n12: 2006\n13: 2008\n14: 2008\n15: 2008\n16: 2009\n17: 2009\n18: 2009\n19: 2011\n20: 2011\n21: 2011\n22: 2011\n23: 2012 (Teen Choice Award)\n24: 2012 (Breakout Star Female)\n25: 2012 (Nominated work is Bunheads)\nWait, no, perhaps each year has multiple entries. Let me list all rows:\n\nIndices and Year:\n0:2002\n1:2002\n2:2002\n3:2002\n4:2002\n5:2005\n6:2005\n7:2005\n8:2005\n9:2006\n10:2006\n11:2006\n12:2006\n13:2008\n14:2008\n15:2008\n16:2009\n17:2009\n18:2009\n19:2011\n20:2011\n21:2011\n22:2011\n23:2012 (Teen Choice Award)\n24:2012 (Breakout Star Female)\n25:2012 (Nominated work: Bunheads)\n26:2013 (Single row)\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check:\n\nEach entry is a separate object in the data array.\n\nLooking for rows where year=2012:\n\nAt index 23: award is \"Teen Choice Award\", year=2012\nIndex 24: award is \"Breakout Star Female\", year=2012\nIndex 25: award is \"bunheads\", year=2012? Or category?\n\nWait, the structure is each object has year, award, category, nominated_work, result.\n\nSo index 23:\nyear:2012,\naward:\"Teen Choice Award\",\ncategory:\"\",\nnominated_work:\"\",\nresult:\"Nominated\".\n\nSimilarly, index24:\nyear:2012,\naward:\"Breakout Star Female\",\ncategory:\"\",\nnominated_work:\"\",\nresult:\"Nominated\".\n\nWait, that can't be. Because \"breakout star female\" is the award, and then category might be empty? Or perhaps it's the nominated work.\n\nWait no, looking at earlier rows:\n\nFor example, row 0:\nyear:2002,\naward:\"\",\ncategory:\"\",\nnominated_work:\"\",\nresult:\"Won\".\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check a specific row.\n\nRow 0 (index 0):\n{\n  \"year\": 2002,\n  \"award\": \"\",\n  \"category\": \"\",\n  \"nominated_work\": \"\",\n  \"result\": \"Won\"\n}\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because other rows have more details. Maybe the data is structured differently, with each object having all five columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the award, category, and nominated_work are sometimes empty strings, but result is always present.\n\nSo in row 23 (index23):\n{\n  \"year\":2012,\n  \"award\":\"Teen Choice Award\",\n  \"category\":\"\",\n  \"nominated_work\":\"\",\n  \"result\":\"Nominated\"\n}\n\nSimilarly, index24:\n{\n  \"year\":2012,\n  \"award\":\"Breakout Star Female\",\n  \"category\":\"\",\n  \"nominated_work\":\"\",\n  \"result\":\"Nominated\"\n}\n\nWait, that would mean in 2012, there are two rows where the result is \"Nominated.\"\n\nBut I think perhaps each row is an entry for a specific award, so maybe index23 and index24 are separate awards both happening in 2012.\n\nTherefore, for the claim, which refers to 2012 having a \"nominated\" result, we need to include cells from these rows where the result is \"Nominated.\"\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- row23 (index23), column \"result\"\n- row24 (index24), column \"result\"\n\nBut I'm not sure if the indices are 0-based. Let me recount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that in the 2012 year, at least one award had a \"Nominated\" result, so we can include any of those cells where \"result\" is \"Nominated.\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be the rows for 2012 and the \"result\" column.\n\nBut to get the exact indices, perhaps I need to list them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data provided was:\n\n[\n    {year:2002, award:\"\", category:\"\", nominated_work:\"\", result:\"Won\"},\n    ...,\n    {year:2012, award:\"Teen Choice Award\", category:\"\", nominated_work:\"\", result:\"Nominated\"},\n    {year:2012, award:\"Breakout Star Female\", category:\"\", nominated_work:\"\", result:\"Nominated\"},\n    ...\n]\n\nIf that's the case, then rows 23 and 24 (assuming 0-based indexing) are the ones where year=2012.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be these two entries, specifically their \"result\" columns.\n\nTherefore, in the response, I should include both row23 and row24, each with column \"result\".\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's just one cell. Maybe the data has only one entry for 2012.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is such that year:2012 appears once, but with multiple awards.\n\nIn any case, to answer accurately, I should state that in the 2012 row(s), the \"result\" column indicates a \"Nominated\" outcome.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be all rows where year=2012 and column=\"result\".\n\nSo, for example:\n\n[\n    {year:2012, award:\"Teen Choice Award\", category:\"\", nominated_work:\"\", result:\"Nominated\"},\n    {year:2012, award:\"Breakout Star Female\", category:\"\", nominated_work:\"\", result:\"Nominated\"}\n]\n\nHence, the relevant_cells would be these two entries in their respective rows and column.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether the claim \"In 2012, there was a 'nominated' result\" is true based on the provided data. The analysis involves identifying the relevant cells that contribute to this conclusion.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, the statement is correct. In 2012, there were awards with a \"Nominated\" result.\n\n**Relevant Cells Explanation:**\n- **Rows:** The rows corresponding to the year 2012.\n- **Columns:** The \"result\" column for each of these rows.\n\nThese cells show that the results included \"Nominated,\" confirming the claim.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",

The table has several columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result.\n\nI need to find any entries where the year is 2012 and the nominated work is \"bunheads.\" Looking at the data, I see that there's an entry with year 2012, award \"teen choice award,\" category \"breakout star female,\" and the result is \"nominated.\"\n\nSo, in row index 19 (since it's the 20th element if we start counting from zero), the columns are:\n- year: 2012\n- award: teen choice award\n- category: breakout star female\n- nominated work: bunheads\n- result: nominated\n\nThis matches the claim. The claim says \"bunheads have win for breakout female star.\" Wait, but in the table, it's \"nominated,\" not \"won.\" So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the categories. Let me double-check. The claim might be referring to another award where bunheads won. Are there any other entries for 2012 with bunheads? No, only the teen choice award is listed for 2012.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row index 19, columns: year (2012) and result (\"nominated\"). Since the claim says they \"won,\" but according to the table, it's \"nominated,\" that makes the claim false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",
