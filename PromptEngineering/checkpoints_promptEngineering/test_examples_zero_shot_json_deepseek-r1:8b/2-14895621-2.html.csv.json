    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and figure out which cells in the table support this. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\". \n\nFirst, I should parse what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n1. Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng.\n2. This happened three times (at tournaments).\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nThe data in the table is as follows:\n\n- Row 0: all entries are \"world championships\".\n- Row 1: outcome is \"3\", event is \"wd\", year is 1985, venue is Calgary, Canada, partner is Kang Haeng - Suk.\n- Row 2: all entries are \"asian games\".\n- Row 3: outcome is \"1\", event is \"wd\", year is 1982, venue is New Delhi, India, partner is Kang Haeng - Suk.\n- Rows 4 and 5 have different events (\"other open tournaments\").\n\nSo, focusing on the claim about Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng three times at tournaments. I need to check if there are any rows where both partners include \"kang haeng - suk\" and whether that happens three times.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: partner is \"Kang Haeng - Suk\". So, this is one instance.\n- Row 3: same partner as above. That's two instances.\n- Are there any other rows? Let me check all the data:\nRow 0: world championships, but I don't see any partners specified here, so maybe that's a different event without partnerships listed?\nWait, looking at row indices in the table:\n\nThe first row (index 0) has \"world championships\" as outcome, event, year, venue, partner. Wait no, actually, each sub-array is a row with all five columns.\n\nLooking again: Each sub-array represents a single record. For example, row 1: outcome=3, event=wd, year=1985, venue=calgary..., partner=kang haeng...\n\nSo, the rows are:\n\nRow 0:\noutcome: world championships\nevent: world championships\nyear: world championships (maybe a typo? Or perhaps it's meant to be the same for all columns)\nvenue: world championships\npartner: world championships\n\nWait, that seems odd. The first row has \"world championships\" repeated across all columns. Does that mean it's an event without a specific outcome or partner?\n\nRow 1:\noutcome=3, event=wd, year=1985, venue=calgary..., partner=kang haeng...\n\nSo this is one instance where kang haeng is the partner.\n\nRow 2:\nAll entries are \"asian games\", so maybe that's another event without specific partners.\n\nRow 3:\noutcome=1, event=wd, year=1982, venue=New Delhi..., partner=kang haeng...\n\nThat's the second instance.\n\nRows 4 and 5 have \"other open tournaments\" as outcome, but again, do they have partners?\n\nWait, looking at row 5:\n\n[\n  \"1\",\n  \"wd\",\n  \"1985\",\n  \"india open\",\n  \"kang haeng - suk\"\n]\n\nSo, outcome=1, event=wd, year=1985, venue=India Open, partner=kang haeng.\n\nThat's the third instance where kang haeng is the partner. So that makes it three times: rows 1, 3, and 5.\n\nBut wait, row 0 has \"world championships\" as the partner? Or does it have no partner specified? Let me check:\n\nRow 0:\n[\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\"\n]\n\nSo all columns are \"world championships\". Does that mean that in the world championships event, Hwang Sun partnered with themselves? Or is this a different context?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The partner column in row 0 is also \"world championships\", which might be a mistake or perhaps an indication that there was no specific partnership listed for that record.\n\nBut rows 1,3,5 have the partner as Kang Haeng - Suk, so that's three times.\n\nSo the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng three times. From the table, it seems that yes, it happened in 1985 (row1), 1982 (row3), and 1985 again (row5). So three instances where they were partners.\n\nBut wait, row5's year is also 1985, so maybe it's two events in 1985? Or perhaps the same event? No, because venue is different: Calgary vs India Open. So, three distinct events.\n\nSo, based on that, the claim should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are rows where partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, which are row1, row3, and row5.\n\nWait, but in the table, row0 has partner as \"world championships\", which might not be relevant. Rows 2 has \"asian games\" as partner, so that's another event without partnership details.\n\nSo, the cells to check are rows where the partner is Kang Haeng - Suk. So rows1,3,5.\n\nBut wait, in row5, outcome is 1, which might mean a different status than row1 (outcome=3). But regardless of outcome, it's still a partnering event with Kang Haeng.\n\nSo yes, three times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in rows 1, 3, and 5 where \"kang haeng - suk\" is listed as the partner. This meets the condition of partnering three times at tournaments.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 1982 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman's double event , finish first , 1 of 2 time she win an event with kang haeng.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key points. It mentions Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1982. She was in the double woman's double event and finished first. Also, it says this was one of two times she won an event with Kang Haeng.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different competition or event. The columns are outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: All entries are \"world championships.\" Doesn't seem relevant since the claim is about Asian Games in 1982.\n\n2. Row 1: Outcome is \"3\", event is \"wd\" (maybe stands for women's doubles), year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. So in 1985, Hwang participated in a women's doubles event with Kang and got 3rd place.\n\n3. Row 2: All entries are \"asian games.\" So this is the Asian Games event. The outcome is \"1\", which might mean first place. Year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. So in 1982, Hwang participated in the Asian Games as a woman's doubles player with Kang and they finished first.\n\n4. Row 3: Outcome \"other open tournaments,\" not relevant since claim is about Asian Games.\n\n5. Row 4: Outcome \"1\", event \"wd\", year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. So in 1985, Hwang won the women's doubles at the India Open with Kang, finishing first.\n\nSo from the table:\n\n- In 1982 (Row 2), Hwang participated in Asian Games with partner Kang and placed 1st.\n- In 1985 (Rows 1 and 4), she had two wins: one at World Championships (Row 0 is not relevant) and another at India Open.\n\nWait, Row 1 is for 1985, but the event was \"wd\" which might be women's doubles. So in 1985, Hwang got 3rd place in the world championships with Kang, and also won the India Open with her. But the claim says she finished first once, one of two times she won with Kang.\n\nWait, in Row 2 (1982), she placed 1st in Asian Games. So that's one win. Then in 1985, she had at least two wins: 3rd place might not count as a win. Wait, but \"outcome\" is listed as \"1\" for the Asian Games and India Open, which likely means first place. But Row 1 has outcome as \"3\", which would mean third place, so that's not a win.\n\nSo Hwang participated in the Asian Games in 1982, placing first with Kang. Then in 1985, she placed first at the India Open but got 3rd at the World Championships. So that makes one win (Asian Games) and another win (India Open). Wait, but the claim says \"one of two times she win an event with kang haeng.\" So does that mean she won twice? Or did she win once?\n\nWait, in 1982: outcome is 1 (win)\nIn 1985: in Row 4, outcome is 1 (another win). So that's two wins.\n\nBut the claim says \"one of two times,\" so it's correct. She participated in the Asian Games in 1982 with Kang and won, which was one time. Then another time in 1985 at India Open. So the claim seems to align with the table.\n\nWait, but the table has Row 1 (1985) as \"3\" for outcome, so maybe that's not a win. But Row 4 is \"1\", so that's a win. So total two wins: 1982 and 1985. The claim says one of two times, which matches.\n\nBut let me check the columns again. The claim mentions \"double woman's double event.\" In the table, the column for event is either \"world championships,\" \"asian games,\" etc., but I don't see a specific mention of \"double woman's double event\" in the event column. Wait, looking at Row 1 and Row 4: both have \"wd\" as the event, which might stand for women's doubles. So the claim is referring to the women's doubles event.\n\nSo Hwang participated in women's doubles events with Kang Haeng in 1982 and 1985, finishing first once (1982) and winning another (1985). So the claim says she finished first once, which aligns with Row 2. It also mentions that this was one of two times she won an event with Kang, which is accurate because there's another win in 1985.\n\nTherefore, all points in the claim are supported by the table. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in rows 2 and 4 of the table. Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1982 with Kang Haeng, finishing first. She also won the India Open in 1985 with Kang. These are two instances of her winning events with Kang, as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in calgary , canada.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify the relevant parts of this claim and map them to the columns in the table. The table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nLooking at the claim, the key elements are:\n- Partner: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng\n- Event: 1985 World Championship\n- Venue: Calgary, Canada\n\nSo I need to find rows where these conditions match.\n\nStarting with the partner column. The table has a 'partner' column, so that's straightforward. We're looking for any row where the partner is \"kang haeng - suk\" because that's how it's spelled in the data. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: partner is \"world championships\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 1: partner is \"kang haeng - suk\" \u2013 this matches.\n- Row 2: partner is \"asian games\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 3: partner is \"kang haeng - suk\" \u2013 another match.\n- Rows 4 and 5: partners are \"other open tournaments\" and \"india open\" respectively, which don't match.\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 have the partner as Kang Haeng - Suk. \n\nNext, check the event column. The claim mentions \"world championship,\" so looking for any row where the 'event' is \"world championships.\" Let's see:\n\n- Row 0: event is \"world championships\" \u2013 matches.\n- Row 1: event is \"wd\" \u2013 abbreviation for World Championships, but does that count? Maybe, but let me check if \"wd\" is considered as world championships in the data. Looking at row 1: event is \"wd,\" which probably stands for World Darts or something else. Wait, no, in the table's context, 'event' might be a general term. But in row 0, it's explicitly \"world championships.\" So I think we should focus on rows where the exact string is present.\n\nRow 0: event is \"world championships\" \u2013 yes.\nRow 1: \"wd\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 2: \"asian games\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: same as row 1, \"wd\" \u2013 no.\nRow 4: \"other open tournaments\" \u2013 no.\nRow 5: \"india open\" \u2013 no.\n\nSo only row 0 has the exact event name matching.\n\nNow, year is 1985. Let's check which rows have year 1985:\n\n- Row 1: year is 1985\n- Row 3: year is 1982 (no)\n- So only row 1 has the correct year.\nBut wait, row 0's event is \"world championships\" but its year is not specified. Wait, no, looking back at the table data, each row has four columns after 'partner': outcome, event, year, venue. Wait, no, the columns are outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nWait, in the data provided:\n\nEach data row has five elements: outcome, event, year, venue, partner? No, looking at the first data row:\n\n[\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\",\n  \"world championships\"\n]\n\nBut that can't be right because the columns are outcome, event, year, venue, partner. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, in the table, each row has five elements: outcome (1st), event (2nd), year (3rd), venue (4th), partner (5th). So for example, row 1 is:\n\n[\n  \"3\",\n  \"wd\",\n  \"1985\",\n  \"calgary , canada\",\n  \"kang haeng - suk\"\n]\n\nSo outcome is \"3\", event is \"wd\", year 1985, venue Calgary, partner Kang Haeng.\n\nSimilarly, row 0 has all columns as \"world championships,\" which doesn't make sense because they should be different. Wait, perhaps the first column is 'outcome' and others are varying. So I think each row represents a specific event, with outcome being something like \"1\" or \"3\", etc., but in rows 0,2,4,5, the outcome is \"world championships,\" which seems odd because it's likely that outcome refers to some result, not the name of the event.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nThe columns are:\n- outcome\n- event\n- year\n- venue\n- partner\n\nSo each row has five entries. For example, row 0: all \"world championships\" \u2013 so that would mean outcome is world championships, event is world championships, etc., which seems off because it's the same across all columns, implying perhaps a mistake in data entry.\n\nBut regardless, for our purpose, we need to find rows where:\n\n- Partner is Kang Haeng - Suk (rows 1 and 3)\n- Event is \"world championships\" (row 0 only)\n- Year is 1985 (only row 1)\n\nSo now, the claim says that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1985 World Championship in Calgary. \n\nLooking at row 1: partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, event is \"wd\" (which I'm assuming stands for something else, maybe World Darts or another abbreviation), year 1985, venue Calgary, and outcome \"3\".\n\nRow 0: partner is same as row 1, but event is \"world championships,\" year not specified because in row 0, the year is \"world championships\" again, which doesn't make sense. Wait no, in row 0, all columns are \"world championships,\" so the year would be \"world championships\"? That can't be right. So perhaps row 0 is a general entry without specific data.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table structure. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the JSON again:\n\n{\n  \"columns\": [\n    \"outcome\",\n    \"event\",\n    \"year\",\n    \"venue\",\n    \"partner\"\n  ],\n  \"data\": [\n    [\n      \"world championships\",\n      \"world championships\",\n      \"world championships\",\n      \"world championships\",\n      \"world championships\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"3\",\n      \"wd\",\n      \"1985\",\n      \"calgary , canada\",\n      \"kang haeng - suk\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"asian games\",\n      \"asian games\",\n      \"asian games\",\n      \"asian games\",\n      \"asian games\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"1\",\n      \"wd\",\n      \"1982\",\n      \"new delhi , india\",\n      \"kang haeng - suk\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"other open tournaments\",\n      \"other open tournaments\",\n      \"other open tournaments\",\n      \"other open tournaments\",\n      \"other open tournaments\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"1\",\n      \"wd\",\n      \"1985\",\n      \"india open\",\n      \"kang haeng - suk\"\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n\nEach data row has five elements, which correspond to the columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nSo for each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- outcome: world championships\n- event: world championships\n- year: world championships (which is odd)\n- venue: world championships\n- partner: world championships\n\nWait, that can't be correct because venues and partners are people or places, not \"world championships.\"\n\nThis suggests that the data might have errors in how it's structured. Alternatively, perhaps the first element is 'outcome,' which could be something like the result of an event (e.g., 1 for win, 3 for third place), while the other columns represent different aspects.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should focus on the rows that make sense: rows 1,3,5 have specific data, while row 0 seems to have all \"world championships,\" which may be a header or a mistake.\n\nAssuming that, let's re-examine the relevant rows:\n\nRow 1:\n- outcome: 3\n- event: wd (maybe World Darts)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: calgary , canada\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo this seems like an actual entry where in 1985, at Calgary, someone partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk, and the outcome was 3.\n\nRow 3:\n- outcome:1\n- event: wd\n- year:1982\n- venue:new delhi , india\n- partner:kang haeng - suk\n\nSo this is another entry, in 1982, at New Delhi, with partner Kang Haeng - Suk, outcome 1.\n\nSimilarly, row 5:\n- outcome:1\n- event:wd\n- year:1985\n- venue:india open\n- partner:kang haeng - suk\n\nSo this is another entry in 1985, at India Open, partner same as before, outcome 1.\n\nNow, the claim is that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk for the first time in 1985 at Calgary. So we need to see if such an event exists in our data.\n\nLooking at row 1: it's in 1985, at Calgary, partner Kang Haeng - Suk, outcome 3.\n\nSo yes, that matches: Hwang Sun (assuming the 'outcome' refers to the player's result when partnering with Kang Haeng - Suk) had an outcome of 3 in 1985 at Calgary. So this would be their first time partnering, as there is no earlier entry for Hwang Sun with Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by row 1.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that Hwang Sun is indeed the player referred to in the 'outcome' column of row 1. If outcome represents Hwang Sun's result, then yes, outcome 3 would mean he won third place or something similar when partnering with Kang Haeng - Suk for the first time.\n\nAlternatively, if outcome refers to the event itself (e.g., a tournament), then perhaps it's not directly about Hwang Sun. But given that we don't have more information, I think it's safe to assume that the 'outcome' relates to the player's performance in the partnership.\n\nTherefore, the data supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk for the first time at the 1985 World Championships in Calgary is supported by the provided data. Specifically, row 1 of the table indicates an event in 1985 at Calgary where Hwang Sun (represented by outcome '3') partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk, resulting in their initial collaboration.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk for the first time in 1985 at the World Championships in Calgary.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully reading the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1985 india open finish first 2 year after win the asian game\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to understand what each part refers to. \n\n1. **Partner**: Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng.\n2. **Event Location and Name**: The 1985 India Open.\n3. **Year**: 1985.\n4. **Timeframe**: \"finish first 2 year after win the asian game\".\n\nNow, looking at the table, I see it has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nI'll go through each row to find relevant information.\n\n- **Row 0**: Outcome is \"world championships\", but the claim is about the 1985 India Open. So this row doesn't seem relevant.\n  \n- **Row 1**: The outcome is \"3\". Not sure what that refers to, but the event is listed as \"wd\" and year 1985. Venue is Calgary, Canada, with partners Kang Haeng - Suk. Wait, the partner here is Kang Haeng - Suk, not Hwang Sun. So this might be a different event or perhaps a typo in the name.\n\n- **Row 2**: Outcome is \"asian games\". The event and venue are both \"asian games\" but the year is 1982. The claim mentions winning the Asian Games, which happened before 1985, so maybe this is related, but I'm not sure how yet.\n\n- **Row 3**: Outcome is \"1\", event \"wd\", year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. This seems relevant because it's about the 1985 India Open with the partner's name matching part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 4**: Outcome \"other open tournaments\", not relevant to the claim.\n\n- **Row 5**: Outcome \"1\", event \"wd\", year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. This is another entry for the same event as row 3 but perhaps with more details or a different perspective.\n\nWait, looking at rows 3 and 5: both have the event as \"wd\" (maybe an abbreviation) and the venue as \"India open\". The partners are Kang Haeng - Suk in both. The claim mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng. But in the table, I see \"kang haeng - suk\" which might be a variation of \"Kang Haeng Suk\". Maybe it's the same person, but the name is written differently. Or perhaps there's a typo.\n\nSo, the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open. But in the table, the partner listed for that event (rows 3 and 5) is \"kang haeng - suk\". If this is indeed Kang Haeng Suk, then perhaps the claim refers to the correct person but uses a different name format.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions finishing first two years after winning the Asian Games. Looking at row 2: outcome is \"asian games\" with year 1982. So in 1985, which is two years after 1983 (since 1982 + 2 = 1984? Wait, maybe that's not how it's intended). Alternatively, maybe the claim means finishing first for two consecutive years after winning the Asian Games.\n\nIn row 3 and 5, the outcome is \"1\", so perhaps they finished first in 1985. But I'm not sure if that's related to the two years after winning the Asian Games.\n\nWait, the claim says \"finish first 2 year after win the asian game\". Maybe it means that Hwang Sun won the Asian Games (which happened in 1982, as per row 2) and then in the next two years (1983, 1984), he finished first at the India Open. But in the table, the entries for 1985 are rows 3 and 5, which have outcome \"1\", so perhaps they finished first in 1985. That's three years after 1982, not two. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two years refer to consecutive years, like finishing first in 1984 and 1985, but row 3 is for 1985. There isn't a row for 1984, so it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open. The table shows that the partner was \"kang haeng - suk\" in rows 3 and 5. So if \"kang haeng - suk\" is the same as \"Kang Haeng Suk\", then perhaps the claim's partner name is slightly different but refers to the same person.\n\nBut the claim uses \"partner with kang haeng at\", which might imply that the partner is Kang Haeng alone, while the table lists \"kang haeng - suk\". So there might be a discrepancy in the names. Maybe it's a typo or variation in name spelling.\n\nMoreover, the outcome for rows 3 and 5 is \"1\", which could mean first place. So perhaps Hwang Sun finished first at the India Open in 1985, partnering with Kang Haeng Suk. If that's accurate, then the claim might be true, except for possibly the partner's name variation.\n\nBut since the table shows \"kang haeng - suk\" and not just \"kang haeng\", maybe the claim is using a different version of the name, which could be incorrect. Alternatively, if both versions refer to the same person, then it might still hold.\n\nHowever, the user instruction says that all cells are as per the data in the table. So I have to consider whether the partner in 1985 India Open was indeed Kang Haeng Suk or someone else.\n\nIn rows 3 and 5, the partner is \"kang haeng - suk\", which seems to be a specific name. The claim says Hwang Sun partnered with \"kang haeng\" without the \"-suk\". This could be a discrepancy. If the table has \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner, then perhaps the claim's reference is incorrect.\n\nAlso, regarding the timeframe: winning the Asian Games (row 2) was in 1982. The next two years would be 1983 and 1984, but there are no entries for those years in the table. The first entry after that is row 3 for 1985 India Open. So if the claim refers to finishing first in both 1984 and 1985, it's only supported by 1985 data, not 1984.\n\nBut since row 2 is about winning the Asian Games in 1982, perhaps the two years refer to 1983 and 1984, but without entries for those years, it's unclear. The claim doesn't specify how many times they finished first after winning, just that they did so.\n\nIn any case, the key points are:\n\n- Partner: Does Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng Suk in 1985 India Open? Table shows yes.\n- Did he finish first? Yes, outcome is \"1\".\n- Is it two years after winning Asian Games (1982)? The next year would be 1983, but there's no data. Then 1984, also nothing. But in 1985, which is three years later, it's shown.\n\nSo the timing might not align exactly as \"two years after\". It's more like four years later if counting from 1982 to 1986, but that's speculative.\n\nPutting it all together: The table supports that Hwang Sun did partner with Kang Haeng Suk at the India Open in 1985 and finished first. Whether this is two years after winning the Asian Games is debatable since there are no entries for 1983 or 1984. So maybe the claim is partially correct, but not entirely if it's about timing.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended that after winning in 1982, they finished first each of the next two years (83 and 84), which isn't supported by data. However, the key part of the claim about partnering and finishing first in 1985 seems to be supported.\n</think>\n\nThe task at hand is to evaluate whether the statement holds true based on the provided data. The statement claims that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open, finished first, two years after winning the Asian Games in 1982.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Partner Identification:**\n   - The table lists the partner as \"kang haeng - suk\" (rows 3 and 5), not just \"Kang Haeng.\"\n   - The claim uses \"kang haeng,\" potentially missing the \"-suk\" part, which may indicate a discrepancy.\n\n2. **Timing:**\n   - Winning the Asian Games occurred in 1982.\n   - The next two years (1983 and 1984) have no data in the table.\n   - In 1985, Hwang Sun finished first as indicated by outcome \"1.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the statement partially holds\u2014Hwang Sun did partner with Kang Haeng Suk at the 1985 India Open and finished first\u2014the timing aspect isn't fully supported by the provided data. The claim's reference to \"two years after\" winning the Asian Games in 1982 isn't corroborated, as there are no entries for 1983 or 1984. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement is partially supported by the data provided, specifically regarding the partnership and performance in 1985, but the timing aspect does not align with the available information.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1982 world championship in the india open.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are three main elements: the partners (Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng), the event (1982 World Championship), and the venue (India Open). \n\nLooking at the table columns, I see \"outcome,\" \"event,\" \"year,\" \"venue,\" and \"partner.\" So, the relevant columns for this claim would be \"event,\" \"year,\" \"venue,\" and \"partner.\"\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to find matching information.\n\nRow 0: The event is \"world championships,\" which doesn't match the specific event mentioned in the claim. The year here is 1985, but the claim refers to 1982. So, this row isn't relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 1: This row has outcome \"3,\" event \"wd\" (I'm not sure if that's an abbreviation), year 1985, venue \"calgary , canada,\" and partner \"kang haeng - suk.\" The partner here is Kang Haeng, but Hwang Sun isn't mentioned. Also, the event is in 1985, not 1982. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: This row mentions \"asian games\" as the outcome and event, which doesn't relate to the claim at all. So no relevance here.\n\nRow 3: The outcome is \"1,\" event \"wd,\" year 1982, venue \"new delhi , india,\" partner \"kang haeng - suk.\" Again, Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner here, so this doesn't support the claim either.\n\nRow 4: This row talks about \"other open tournaments\" and doesn't mention anything relevant to the claim. So, not applicable.\n\nRow 5: Outcome is \"1,\" event \"wd,\" year 1985, venue \"india open,\" and partner \"kang haeng - suk.\" The partner is Kang Haeng, but Hwang Sun isn't mentioned here. Plus, the year doesn't match the claim's 1982.\n\nWait a minute\u2014did I miss any rows? Let me check again. Oh, the last row (row index 5) has \"india open\" as the venue, which matches part of the claim. But Hwang Sun isn't listed here as a partner; it's Kang Haeng - Suk. So that doesn't help.\n\nPutting this together, none of the rows explicitly mention both Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng as partners in 1982 at the India Open World Championship. The only instance with \"kang haeng - suk\" is in row 1 (year 1985) and row 5 (venue India Open but same year as another entry). \n\nTherefore, there's no data in the table that supports the claim. Hwang Sun isn't paired with Kang Haeng in 1982 at the India Open. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not fully supported by any row in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"With her partner kang haeng, hwang sun finish in the top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see where relevant information might be. Let me check each row and column.\n\nThe table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. The data rows are:\n\n1. [\"world championships\", \"world championships\", \"world championships\", \"world championships\", \"world championships\"]\n2. [\"3\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"calgary , canada\", \"kang haeng - suk\"]\n3. [\"asian games\", ...]\n4. [\"1\", \"wd\", \"1982\", \"new delhi , india\", \"kang haeng - suk\"]\n5. [\"other open tournaments\", ...]\n6. [\"1\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"india open\", \"kang haeng - suk\"]\n\nLooking for the partner named kang haeng - suk, which matches the claim's partner. So rows 2,4,6 are relevant because they have this partner.\n\nNow, check each of these rows:\n\nRow 2: Outcome is \"3\", event is \"wd\". The venue is calgary, canada. Year is 1985.\n\nRow 4: Outcome is \"1\", event \"wd\", venue new delhi, india, year 1982.\n\nRow 6: Outcome \"1\", event \"wd\", venue indiana open, year 1985.\n\nSo these are three different venues: calgary, new delhi, and indiana open. The years covered are 1982, 1985, but wait, the claim says from 1982 to 1985, which includes 1983, 1984 as well. Hmm, so does the table have any other entries in that period? Let me check.\n\nRows with kang haeng - suk are rows 2 (1985), 4 (1982), and 6 (1985). So only two years: 1982 and 1985. There's no data for 1983 or 1984, so does this mean she didn't finish in the top 3 during those years? Or maybe the claim is that she finished in top 3 at three different venues from 1982 to 1985, which includes those two years and one more? Wait, but the table only shows her participating in events in 1982, 1985. So perhaps she didn't have a third year in the top 3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" So the period is four years (including both endpoints), which would be 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985. The table has entries in 1982 and 1985 but not 1983 or 1984.\n\nSo does that mean she only had two top 3 finishes? Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims three different venues in that four-year span, but the data shows only two.\n\nAdditionally, the relevant cells are columns for each of these rows. So row 2 has outcome (3), event (wd), year (1985), venue (calgary), partner (kang haeng). Row4: outcome (1), event (wd), year(1982), venue(new delhi), partner(kang haeng). Row6: outcome(1), event(wd), year(1985), venue(india open), partner(kang haeng).\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row 2, columns: outcome, event, year, venue\n- row4, same columns\n- row6, same columns\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"finishing in top 3.\" So looking at the 'outcome' column. In row2, it's 3, which might indicate top 3 (assuming 3 means third place). Rows4 and 6 have outcome as 1, which could mean first place. So if 1 is first, then only row2 has a top 3 finish. But the claim says she finished in top 3 at three different venues. If 'outcome' of 1 indicates first place, then maybe she didn't finish in top 3 in those two years.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe outcome values are something else. Like maybe '3' means third place, and '1' is a win. So she won twice (1982 and 1985) at different venues, but only finished third once in 1985. That would mean she didn't have three top 3 finishes, just one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'outcome' column represents something else. Maybe it's not about placement but event results. Without knowing exactly what the numbers represent, it's hard to be certain. But assuming that lower numbers mean better performance, maybe 1 is first, so she only had two top performances and one third place, which still doesn't reach three top 3 finishes.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because the data shows only two instances where she finished in the top 3 (maybe) at two venues, not three. So the answer would be FALSE, with relevant cells being rows2,4,6 and their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng finished in the top 3 at three different venues between 1982 and 1985. Analyzing the table:\n\n- **Relevant Rows:** Rows 2, 4, and 6 (where \"partner\" is Kang Haeng - suk) provide data on their performances.\n- **Venues:** Calgary (1985), New Delhi (1982), and India Open (1985).\n- **Years Covered:** The period includes 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. However, the table only shows events in 1982 and 1985.\n- **Outcome Analysis:** Row 2 has an outcome of \"3\" (likely third place), while rows 4 and 6 have \"1\" (possibly first place). This means she finished top 3 only once during that period.\n\nSince there are only two years with available data, and only one instance of a top 3 finish, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are from these three rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"hwang sun partner with asian game 5 time at tournament\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions \"Hwang Sun\", who I assume is a person's name, possibly an athlete. The claim says that Hwang Sun partnered with the Asian Games five times in tournaments. So, I'm looking for instances where Hwang Sun and the Asian Games are both involved in events.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. Each row represents a different instance or event. \n\nNow, let's go through each row to see if any match the claim. The first row seems to have all \"world championships\" in every column, which doesn't mention Asian Games, so probably not relevant.\n\nThe second row has outcome as \"3\", event as \"wd\". I'm not sure what \"wd\" stands for here. Maybe it's an abbreviation. Then there's the year 1985, venue in Canada, and partner Kang Haeng - Suk. Since this isn't about Asian Games or Hwang Sun, it's probably not relevant.\n\nThird row: All columns are \"asian games\". But I need to check if Hwang Sun is a partner here. The partner column says \"kang haeng - suk\", which seems like another name. Maybe that's the same as Kang Haeng Suk? If so, then this could be relevant because it's an Asian Games event with a partner.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Hwang Sun partnering with Asian Games five times. So if in one of these rows, Hwang Sun is partnered with Asian Games at a tournament, that would count as one instance. But I need to check each row carefully.\n\nLooking back at the data: In the third row, event is \"asian games\", partner is \"kang haeng - suk\". If Kang Haeng Suk is Hwang Sun, then this could be relevant. However, without knowing for sure, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe fourth row has outcome as \"1\", event as \"wd\" again, so not Asian Games. Venue in India, partner same as before.\n\nFifth row: All columns are \"other open tournaments\". Not related to Asian Games or Hwang Sun.\n\nSixth row: Outcome is \"1\", event is \"wd\", venue is \"india open\", and partner is \"kang haeng - suk\" again. So if this is a tournament where Hwang Sun partnered with someone, but the event isn't specified as Asian Games, it might not be relevant unless \"other open tournaments\" refers to something else.\n\nWait, but in row 3, the event is \"asian games\", so that could be the first instance. Then maybe there are more instances elsewhere? Let me check if any other rows mention Asian Games with Hwang Sun as partner.\n\nLooking at the data again: Row 2 mentions \"wd\" which might stand for something else, not Asian Games. Rows 1 and 4 don't mention Asian Games either. So only row 3 has \"asian games\" in event, but partner is another name. If that's Hwang Sun's real name or alias, then it counts.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"kang haeng - suk\" is the same as Hwang Sun. Maybe it's a different person with a similar name. Without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, but in row 6, partner is also \"kang haeng - suk\", and event is \"wd\". So perhaps that's another instance where Hwang Sun was partnered with someone else at a tournament, maybe Asian Games or others.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions partnering with Asian Games five times. If only one row (row 3) has \"asian games\" as the event, but partner might not be Hwang Sun, then it doesn't fully support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, if multiple rows have both \"asian games\" and \"kang haeng - suk\" as partner, that could imply five times. Let's count: Row 2 has partner Kang Haeng Suk, row 3 same, row 4 same, row 6 same. So four instances where partner is Kang Haeng Suk, but only in rows 2,3,4,6.\n\nWait, row 3 is the only one where event is \"asian games\". The others have \"wd\" or other tournaments. So only in row 3 is both event Asian Games and partner Kang Haeng Suk present.\n\nTherefore, there's only one instance where Hwang Sun (if that's the name) partnered with Asian Games at a tournament. Since the claim says five times, it's not supported by the table.\n\nWait, but the claim might have a typo or misinterpretation. Maybe \"asian game\" refers to multiple events? Or perhaps I'm missing some rows where both \"asian games\" and Hwang Sun's partner are mentioned.\n\nLooking again: Only row 3 has \"asian games\" as event, and partner Kang Haeng Suk. If that's the same person as Hwang Sun, then it's one instance. But if Hwang Sun is someone else, perhaps another name, then maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, if \"partner\" refers to a team or organization, but I think it's a person here.\n\nSo based on this, there's only one row where both event is Asian Games and partner might be Hwang Sun (if they are the same). Since the claim states five times, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains only one instance where \"asian games\" is listed as an event with \"kang haeng - suk\" as a partner. If \"kang haeng - suk\" corresponds to Hwang Sun, there's only one match, not five.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"in 1985 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman's double event , finish second , 2 of 3 time she win an event with kang haeng.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to see what each part is claiming.\n\n1. **Year**: 1985\n2. **Event**: The Asian Games, specifically in the \"double woman's double\" event.\n3. **Outcome**: Finish second (i.e., come in second place).\n4. **Partner**: Kang Haeng - Suk.\n5. **Frequency**: It mentions that this is the second time Hwang Sun has won an event with Kang Haeng, implying she's done it twice out of three times.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's any data that matches these points.\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array in the table:\n\n- The first row seems to be a header for columns like outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n- Rows 2 and 4 have some specific entries. Let me check each relevant column for each of these rows.\n\nStarting with row index 1 (second row):\n\n- **Outcome**: \"3\" \u2013 Wait, that doesn't make sense because the claim mentions finishing second, which is 2nd place, not third.\n  \nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me double-check. The columns are outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nIn row 1 (index 0), all entries are \"world championships\". That's probably irrelevant for this claim since it's about the Asian Games.\n\nRow 2 (index 1): \n- Outcome: \"3\" \u2013 Hmm, that seems odd. If the outcome is \"3\", maybe it's indicating a third-place finish?\n- Event: \"wd\" \u2013 Not sure what \"wd\" stands for here.\n- Year: 1985\n- Venue: \"calgary , canada\"\n- Partner: \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\nWait, so in 1985, Hwang Sun participated in the event with partner Kang Haeng-Suk. The outcome is listed as \"3\". So did she finish third?\n\nBut the claim says she finished second and that this was the second time she won an event with Kang Haeng. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at row 4 (index 3):\n- Outcome: \"1\" \u2013 That would be first place.\n- Event: \"wd\" again, maybe indicating something specific?\n- Year: 1982\n- Venue: \"new delhi , india\"\n- Partner: \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\nSo in 1982, she won the event with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\nThen row 5 (index 4): \n- Outcome: \"other open tournaments\" \u2013 Not relevant for the Asian Games claim.\n  \nRow 6 (index 5):\n- Outcome: \"1\"\n- Event: \"india open\" \u2013 That's a different event, not the Asian Games.\n- Year: 1985\n- Venue: \"india open\"\n- Partner: \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\nSo in 1985, she participated in the India Open, finished first with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the Asian Games. Let me see if there's any row that mentions the Asian Games and has a relevant outcome.\n\nLooking back at row 2 (index1): The event is \"wd\". Maybe \"wd\" stands for \"woman's doubles\"? That could make sense.\n\nSo in row 2, event is \"wd\", which might stand for Woman's Double. Outcome is \"3\", so she finished third in the Asian Games in 1985 with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\nBut the claim says she finished second and that this was the second time she won an event with Kang Haeng. \n\nWait, but in row4 (index3), she participated in the Asian Games in 1982 with Kang Haeng-Suk and finished first. Then in row2 (index1), she participated again in 1985, finishing third. But the claim says in 1985, she was second.\n\nSo there's a conflict here: The table shows her finishing third in 1985, but the claim says second.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions that it's the second time she won an event with Kang Haeng. In row4 (index3), she won in 1982, and in row6 (index5), she won in 1985, which is the India Open, not the Asian Games. So she has two wins: one at the Asian Games in 1982 and another at the India Open in 1985.\n\nBut the claim specifically talks about the Asian Games, so that would be only one win (1982) unless there's another row I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking again, row2 (index1) is for 1985. The event is \"wd\" which might be Woman's Double, and she finished third. So in 1985, she didn't win the Asian Games but came third. Therefore, her second win with Kang Haeng would have been at the India Open in 1985.\n\nBut the claim says that in 1985, she participated in the Asian Games, which is not accurate because row2 (index1) shows her participating in an event called \"wd\" in 1985, but it's unclear if that's the Asian Games or another event. The Asian Games row might be elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again.\n\nThe first entry (row0) is all \"world championships\", which doesn't match the Asian Games. Row1 (index1): event is \"wd\", which might not specify the Asian Games. Row4 (index3): event is \"asian games\", yes! So row4 is the one for the Asian Games in 1982, where she finished first with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\nRow6 (index5) is about the India Open in 1985, which she won with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\nBut the claim says in 1985, she participated in the Asian Games. However, row1 (index1) is for 1985 but shows her participating in an event that's not explicitly the Asian Games; it's \"wd\", which could be ambiguous. The actual Asian Games entry is in row4 (index3), where she participated in 1982.\n\nSo there's a conflict: The claim says she participated in the Asian Games in 1985, but according to the table, she only did so in 1982 and finished first. In 1985, she was either at another event or perhaps the same event with different results.\n\nWait, row1 (index1) is 1985, outcome \"3\", venue \"calgary , canada\". That doesn't match the Asian Games because the Asian Games are usually held in Asia, not Calgary, Canada. So row1 must be a different event, possibly the World Championships or something else.\n\nTherefore, the table shows that Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games (event name: asian games) only once, in 1982, where she won with Kang Haeng-Suk. In 1985, she was at another event (maybe World Championships) but didn't win, finishing third.\n\nSo the claim says in 1985, she participated in the Asian Games, which is incorrect because it's not listed for 1985. Instead, she was at a different event where she finished third. Also, she has only one win with Kang Haeng-Suk in the Asian Games (1982). \n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that this was her second time winning an event with him, which is true because she won again in 1985 (India Open), but that's a different event.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- In 1982: Participated in the Asian Games, finished first with Kang Haeng-Suk. That's one win.\n- In 1985: Participated in an event called \"wd\", which might be another competition, not the Asian Games, and she finished third.\n- Also, in 1985, she won the India Open with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially correct but incorrect in stating that she participated in the Asian Games in 1985. She only did so in 1982. So the timeline doesn't match.\n\nMoreover, the claim says that this was her second time winning an event with him, which would be accurate if considering both the Asian Games and India Open as wins, but it's unclear from the table how many events she won with him beyond what is shown.\n\nBut focusing on the specifics of the claim: She did win the Asian Games once (1982) and another event in 1985. However, in 1985, she didn't participate in the Asian Games but a different event where she came third. Therefore, the claim's statement about her participating in the Asian Games in 1985 is false.\n\nAlso, regarding the outcome, she finished first in 1982 and third in 1985 (not second), so that part is incorrect too.\n\nSo to answer the task: The user wants me to simulate a thought process of someone analyzing this data. I need to consider all aspects, maybe make some assumptions where information is unclear.\n\nI think I've covered most points. So overall, the claim has inaccuracies regarding the event in 1985 and the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis reveals that the original claim contains inaccuracies. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Event Participation in 1985**: The claim states Hwang participated in the Asian Games in 1985. However, according to the table:\n   - In 1982 (Row4), she won the Asian Games with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n   - In 1985 (Row1), she participated in an event labeled as \"wd,\" which likely stands for Woman's Doubles, but not explicitly the Asian Games. The venue is Calgary, Canada, which doesn't align with typical Asian Games locations.\n\n2. **Outcome in 1985**: The claim mentions she finished second, but the table shows her finishing third in that year's event (Row1).\n\n3. **Win Count with Kang Haeng-Suk**:\n   - She won the Asian Games in 1982.\n   - She also won the India Open in 1985 (Row6), adding to her win tally.\n\nIn summary, while she did win the Asian Games once and another event in 1985, she didn't participate in the Asian Games in 1985. The claim inaccurately specifies both the event and outcome for that year.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"With her partner Kang Haeng, Hwang Sun finishes first at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" So, I need to check if there are three different venues where Hwang Sun finished first with Kang Haeng between those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. The relevant columns here seem to be \"venue\" and maybe \"partner\" since the claim mentions both.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0:\n   - Outcome: world championships\n   - Event: world championships\n   - Year: world championships (probably a placeholder; might indicate all years)\n   - Venue: world championships (same as event)\n   - Partner: world championships (again, likely placeholder)\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - Outcome: 3\n   - Event: wd\n   - Year: 1985\n   - Venue: calgary , canada\n   - Partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThis row is interesting because the partner matches \"kang haeng - suk,\" which might be Kang Haeng. The outcome is \"3,\" but I'm not sure what that signifies\u2014maybe a ranking or position.\n\n3. Row 2:\n   - Outcome: asian games\n   - Event: asian games\n   - Year: asian games\n   - Venue: asian games\n   - Partner: asian games\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - Outcome: 1\n   - Event: wd\n   - Year: 1982\n   - Venue: new delhi , india\n   - Partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nAgain, partner is Kang Haeng and outcome is \"1,\" which might indicate first place.\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - Outcome: other open tournaments\n   - Event: other open tournaments\n   - Year: other open tournaments\n   - Venue: other open tournaments\n   - Partner: other open tournaments\n\n6. Row 5:\n   - Outcome: 1\n   - Event: wd\n   - Year: 1985\n   - Venue: india open\n   - Partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo, rows 1,3, and 5 all have Kang Haeng as the partner. Let's look at their outcomes:\n\n- Row 1 outcome is \"3,\" which might mean third place.\n- Row 3 outcome is \"1,\" so first place.\n- Row 5 outcome is \"1,\" again first place.\n\nNow, checking the venues for these three rows:\n\nRow 1: calgary , canada\nRow 3: new delhi , india\nRow 5: india open\n\nSo that's three different venues: Calgary (Canada), New Delhi (India), and India Open. Wait, but are \"calgary\" and \"new delhi\" considered separate from \"india open\"? Yes, they are different venues.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" Let me check the years:\n\nRow 1: 1985\nRow 3: 1982\nRow 5: 1985\n\nSo yes, these three rows cover both 1982 and 1985. However, the third row (row 5) is in 1985, same as row 1, but different venue.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"from 1982 to 1985,\" which includes those years, so three different venues across these years would satisfy the condition if each event was first place with Kang Haeng.\n\nHowever, looking at the outcomes:\n\n- Row 3: outcome is 1 (first)\n- Row 1: outcome is 3\n- Row 5: outcome is 1\n\nSo only two of them are first places. The claim says \"finish first,\" which implies only first place matters. So maybe rows 3 and 5 count, but row 1's outcome being 3 might not count because they didn't finish first.\n\nBut the claim doesn't specify the exact position; it just says they finished first. So if outcome is 1, that's first place. Therefore, in rows 3 and 5, Hwang Sun finishes first with Kang Haeng at two different venues (New Delhi and India Open). But row 1 has outcome 3, so maybe not counted.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" So maybe all three are considered, regardless of outcome. The claim doesn't specify that they have to finish first in each venue, just that they finished first at three different venues during those years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim implies that they finished first at three different venues where they both participated with Kang Haeng during 1982-1985.\n\nWait, but the problem is about finishing first. So only rows where outcome is 1 would count as first places. Let me check:\n\nRow 3: 1982, venue New Delhi, partner Kang Haeng, outcome 1 \u2192 First place.\nRow 5: 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng, outcome 1 \u2192 First place.\n\nSo that's two instances where they finished first with Kang Haeng at different venues. But the claim says three different venues. So unless there's another row where they finish first with Kang Haeng at a third venue during those years, but looking through the table:\n\nRows 0-6: only rows 3 and 5 have outcome 1 and partner Kang Haeng. Row 4 is about other tournaments, not sure if that counts. Wait, row 4's partner is \"other open tournaments,\" which might be a general term, not specific to kang haeng.\n\nSo maybe there are only two instances where they finished first with Kang Haeng at different venues between 1982 and 1985. Therefore, the claim says three different venues, but based on the table, it seems like only two are supported.\n\nWait, but row 1's outcome is 3, which might indicate that Hwang Sun didn't finish first there. So the only two rows where they finished first with Kang Haeng are rows 3 and 5, at New Delhi and India Open.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the partner in those rows is indeed Kang Haeng. In row 1, partner is kang haeng - suk, which might be a variation of the name. So maybe it's referring to the same person.\n\nTherefore, Hwang Sun with Kang Haeng finished first at two different venues: New Delhi and India Open, but not three. The claim says three, so that would make it FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all rows where partner is kang haeng - suk:\n\nRow 1: partner is kang haeng - suk, outcome 3\nRow 3: partner is kang haeng - suk, outcome 1\nRow 5: partner is kang haeng - suk, outcome 1\n\nSo three rows. Now, in two of these, they finished first (outcomes are 1). The third row has an outcome of 3, which might mean third place.\n\nIf the claim is about finishing first, then only the rows where outcome is 1 count. So that's two instances. Therefore, there aren't three different venues where she finished first with Kang Haeng between 1982-1985 based on the table.\n\nWait, but the venue in row 1 is calgary , canada; row3: new delhi , india; and row5: india open. So that's three different venues, but only two of them were first places.\n\nSo if the claim says \"finish first,\" then it's not met for all three venues, hence the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng finished first at three different venues between 1982 and 1985 based on the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Kang Haeng as Partner:**\n   - The relevant rows are row 1 (1985, Calgary), row 3 (1982, New Delhi), and row 5 (1985, India Open).\n\n2. **Determine Finishing Positions:**\n   - Row 1: Outcome is 3 \u2192 Not first.\n   - Row 3: Outcome is 1 \u2192 First.\n   - Row 5: Outcome is 1 \u2192 First.\n\n3. **Identify Venues:**\n   - Calgary (Canada), New Delhi (India), and India Open are three distinct venues.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies finishing first at three different venues. However, only two of the three rows meet this criterion (rows 3 and 5).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the table, there are only two instances where Hwang Sun finished first with Kang Haeng at different venues between 1982 and 1985. Therefore, the claim that they finished first at three different venues is **FALSE**.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi , india finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\" \n\nHmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. I need to parse this and check against the table data. The table has columns for outcome, event, year, venue, and partner.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows represent different events or tournaments.\n- Each row has information about an outcome (like \"1\" or \"3\"), event name (\"world championships\", \"asian games\", etc.), year, venue, and partner (\"kang haeng - suk\").\n\nThe claim mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng at the 1982 New Delhi, India event. It also refers to finishing first two years after winning the world championship.\n\nLet me identify each part of the claim:\n\n1. Partner: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng\n   - So I need to find rows where the partner is listed as \"kang haeng - suk\" since that seems like a possible variation or alias for Kang Haeng.\n   \n2. Event: At the 1982 New Delhi, India event\n   - Looking for a row where the venue is \"new delhi , india\" and the year is 1982.\n\n3. Outcome: Finish first two years after winning the world championship\n   - This part is a bit trickier. It suggests that in the two years following their victory (presumably in the world championships), they finished first. So I need to see if there's an outcome for those years where the result was \"1\" and the event was a world championship.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: All columns are \"world championships\". But no partner or year. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Outcome \"3\", event \"wd\" (maybe \"world championships\"), year 1985, venue Calgary, Partner Kang Haeng - Suk. So this is a world championship in 1985 with an outcome of 3 and partner as mentioned. Not the 1982 event, so maybe not directly relevant unless it's part of the first two years after their win.\n  \nWait, but when did Hwang Sun win the world championships? The claim says they won before finishing first in two subsequent years. So if Row 1 is 1985, perhaps that's one of those first two years.\n\nBut wait, let me see:\n\n- In the table, the partner \"kang haeng - suk\" appears in Rows 1 and 5.\n- Row 1: 1985 Calgary, outcome 3\n- Row 5: 1985 India Open, outcome 1\n\nSo maybe in 1982 they didn't have that partner. So perhaps the claim is about 1982, but the table shows a partner in 1985.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, find all rows where the partner is \"kang haeng - suk\". Those are Rows 1 and 5.\n\nRow 1: Event is \"world championships\", venue Calgary, year 1985, outcome 3.\nRow 5: Event is \"india open\", venue India Open, year 1985, outcome 1.\n\nSo the partner Kang Haeng is present in both these rows. Now, looking for the event at New Delhi, India in 1982.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 3 has venue \"new delhi , india\" and year 1982. But the outcome is 1, event is \"asian games\".\n\nWait, but that's not the world championships. The claim says they finished first two years after winning the world championship. So perhaps in 1982, they won something else, or maybe it's after a world championship win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: if Hwang Sun won the world championships (say, for example, in 1985), then the next two years would be 1986 and 1987. But that doesn't match any rows. Alternatively, perhaps in 1982 they were part of an event where they finished first, which is the New Delhi Asian Games.\n\nBut the claim says they finished first two years after winning the world championship, so maybe in 1984 and 1985 they won something? Wait, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the table:\n\nRow 1: Outcome 3, year 1985, venue Calgary. Partner is Kang Haeng.\nRow 5: Outcome 1, year 1985, event \"india open\", partner Kang Haeng.\n\nSo in both cases, they have the same partner in 1985. Now, the claim refers to 1982. So that would be a different row, Row 3, which is New Delhi Asian Games in 1982 with outcome 1 and partner Kang Haeng.\n\nWait no, Row 3's partner is also \"kang haeng - suk\"? Let me check:\n\nRow 3: [\n      \"1\",\n      \"wd\",\n      \"1982\",\n      \"new delhi , india\",\n      \"kang haeng - suk\"\n    ]\n\nYes, so in 1982 at New Delhi, the outcome was 1, event \"wd\" (maybe world championships?), but actually looking back, the columns are:\n\nThe first column is \"outcome\", which is \"1\".\n\nSecond column: \"event\" as \"wd\". Wait, that might be a code. In Row 1, event is \"wd\" and it's labeled as \"world championships\". So maybe in Row 3, \"wd\" also refers to world championships.\n\nSo Row 3: outcome 1, event world championships, year 1982, venue New Delhi, partner Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nThat would mean that in 1982, they won the world championships with an outcome of 1. Then the next two years (1983 and 1984), if they finished first again, but according to the table, in 1985 (Row 1) they had outcome 3, which is not first place.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit because the claim says \"finish first 2 year after win the world championship\". So if they won in 1982, then in 1983 and 1984, they should have finished first. But in the table, in 1985 (Row1) outcome is 3, which isn't first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two years are 1984 and 1985 after winning in 1983? But I don't see a Row for 1983.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says that they finished first two years after winning the world championship. So if they won in, say, 1982 (Row3), then in 1983 and 1984, they should have finished first. But the table shows Row1 as 1985 with outcome 3, which isn't first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the partner is Kang Haeng, and in 1982 they had a different event but still first place. Let me check all rows where the partner is \"kang haeng - suk\".\n\nOnly Rows1 and 3 have that partner:\n\n- Row1: 1985, outcome 3, event world championships\n- Row3: 1982, outcome 1, event world championships\n\nSo in 1982, they won (outcome 1), then in 1985, they had outcome 3. The claim says they finished first two years after a win. So maybe the next year is 1983 and 1984.\n\nBut in the table, there's no data for those years except for Row1 in 1985 with outcome 3. Therefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect because it states that they finished first in 1982 (as per Row3) and then in 1983 and 1984, but there's no evidence of them finishing first again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"finish first two year after win\". Maybe it's not necessarily consecutive years. Or perhaps the two years are after a single victory, so like in 1982 they won, then in any two subsequent years, they finished first.\n\nBut looking at the data, Row3: 1982 (outcome1), and then in 1985, outcome3, which is not first. So that doesn't support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the partner is different in other events where they finished first.\n\nWait, let me see all rows:\n\nRow2: [\n      \"1\",\n      \"asian games\",\n      \"1982\",\n      \"new delhi , india\",\n      \"something\"\n    ]\n\nNo, that's not relevant. Wait, Row3 has the partner as Kang Haeng - Suk, with outcome 1 in 1982.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is correct: they won in 1982 (Row3), then finished first again in 1983 and 1984, but according to the table, there's no data for those years. So maybe the table only shows some events, not all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which event is being referred to. The claim mentions \"finish first two year after win\", so if they won in 1982, then in 1983 and 1984, but without that data, we can't confirm from the table.\n\nBut the key point is whether the partner is present in those years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main points are:\n\n- Did Hwang Suk (partner) participate in events where they finished first?\n\nFrom the table: Yes, in 1982 at New Delhi with outcome1, and in 1985 at India Open with outcome1.\n\nBut in Row3 (New Delhi 1982), partner is Kang Haeng - Suk. Wait, perhaps I misread that. Let me check again.\n\nRow3's fifth element is \"kang haeng - suk\". So Partner is Kang Haeng, not Hwang Suk.\n\nWait, maybe the names are different. Perhaps the claim refers to Hwang Suk as the partner, but in the table, it's Kang Haeng. That would be a problem because then there's no match between the claim and the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is correctly represented as \"kang haeng - suk\" in Row3, which might be a variant spelling of Hwang Suk or another name.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing Hwang Suk with Kang Haeng. If they are different people, then the partner in 1982 is Kang Haeng, not Hwang Suk. So if the claim refers to Hwang Suk's partner, but the data shows Kang Haeng, that would be a problem because there's no match.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the names. Maybe \"kang haeng - suk\" is a variant or a different way of writing Hwang Suk's name.\n\nAssuming they are the same person:\n\n- In 1982 (Row3), partner Kang Haeng, outcome1\n- In 1985 (Rows1 and 5), partner Kang Haeng, outcomes 3 and 1\n\nSo in both 1982 and 1985, they had the same partner, Kang Haeng.\n\nThe claim says that after winning a world championship, they finished first for two consecutive years. So if in 1982 they won (outcome1), then in 1983 and 1984, they should have finished first again.\n\nBut according to the table, there's no data for those years. However, perhaps the \"world championships\" refers to a different event or year. Alternatively, maybe the two years are non-consecutive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because in 1985 they didn't finish first (outcome3), which would contradict the claim of finishing first two years after a win.\n\nWait, but if in 1982 they won (outcome1), then in 1985 (three years later) they had outcome3, not first. So that wouldn't fit the claim of \"two consecutive years\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to lay it out step by step:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The person referred to as partner in the claim is Hwang Suk.\n- In the table, the partner's name is \"kang haeng - suk\", which might be a transliteration of Hwang Suk or another name.\n\nLooking at Row3: [\n  \"1\",\n  \"asian games\",\n  \"1982\",\n  \"new delhi , india\",\n  \"kang haeng - suk\"\n]\n\nSo in 1982, at the Asian Games in New Delhi, with partner Kang Haeng - Suk, they achieved outcome1.\n\nIf this is indeed Hwang Suk's participation, then:\n\n- Did Hwang Suk compete in other events with Kang Haeng - Suk?\n\nLooking elsewhere:\nRow5: [\n  \"1\",\n  \"india open\",\n  \"1985\",\n  \"bangalore , india\",\n  \"kang haeng - suk\"\n]\n\nSo in 1985, at the India Open in Bangalore, they achieved outcome1.\n\nBut since there's no data for 1983 or 1984, we can't confirm whether they finished first in those years. However, if the claim says that after winning a world championship (possibly in 1982), they finished first for two consecutive years afterward, but the table only shows data up to 1985 with outcome1 and 3.\n\nTherefore, without data showing first-place finishes in both 1983 and 1984 by Hwang Suk and Kang Haeng - Suk, we can't confirm the claim. However, considering that there's no conflicting evidence, maybe the claim is acceptable based on available data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"two years after\" refers to any two subsequent years, not necessarily consecutive. In that case, having at least one more first-place finish would suffice. Since Row5 shows a first-place in 1985, which is three years after 1982, that might count as one of the required years.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided:\n\n- Hwang Suk participated with partner Kang Haeng - Suk in events where they achieved first places in 1982 and 1985.\n- There's no data to confirm first-place finishes in the intervening years (1983-1984).\n- The claim states that after winning a world championship, they finished first for two consecutive years. Without evidence of first-place finishes in both 1983 and 1984, the claim cannot be fully supported.\n\nHowever, if the \"two years\" refers to any subsequent years rather than consecutive ones, then having at least one more first-place finish (as in 1985) could be considered sufficient. Therefore, depending on the interpretation, the claim might be partially supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Hwang Suk's partner finished first for two consecutive years after winning a world championship is partially supported based on the provided data. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Winning Event**: In 1982 at the Asian Games in New Delhi, Hwang Suk and their partner Kang Haeng - Suk achieved outcome1.\n2. **Subsequent Performances**:\n   - In 1985 at the India Open in Bangalore, they also achieved outcome1 with Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\n3. **Data Limitations**: The table lacks information about first-place finishes in 1983 and 1984, which are the consecutive years following their win in 1982.\n\n4. **Interpretation of \"Two Consecutive Years\": If \"consecutive\" implies back-to-back years, there's insufficient evidence to confirm first-place finishes in both 1983 and 1984.\n   - However, if \"two years\" refers to any subsequent years rather than necessarily consecutive ones, having at least one more first-place finish (as in 1985) could be considered sufficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is partially supported based on the available data, especially if interpreting \"two years\" non-constrictively.",
