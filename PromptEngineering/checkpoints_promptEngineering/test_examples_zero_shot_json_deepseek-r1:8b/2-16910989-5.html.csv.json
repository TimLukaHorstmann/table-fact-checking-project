    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Kristofer Martin is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Kristofer Martin be nominated for 3 act award in 2012, win the german moreno youth achievement award.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table and check if there's any mention of Kristofer Martin. But wait, looking at the data, I don't see a column or any entries that mention \"Kristofer Martin.\" The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. The claim refers to two specific awards: being nominated for a 3-act award in 2012 and winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" \"stand out season performer,\" \"none,\" \"nominated.\" No Kristofer here.\n\nRow 1: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo,\" \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" \"oros,\" \"won.\" Still no Kristofer.\n\nRow 2: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards,\" \"best actor in a supporting role,\" \"oros,\" \"won.\" Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: 2012, \"the young critics circle awards,\" \"best performance,\" \"oros,\" \"nominated.\" No mention of Kristofer.\n\nRow 4: 2012, \"28th pmpc star awards for movies,\" \"new movie actor of the year,\" \"tween academy : class of 2012,\" \"nominated.\" Not about Kristofer.\n\nRow 5: 2012, \"famas awards,\" \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" \"n / a,\" \"won.\" This seems relevant because it mentions the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. So, Kristofer won this award in 2012.\n\nWait, but the claim also mentions being nominated for a 3-act award in 2012. Looking through all the rows, there's no mention of a 3-act award or any other award that Kristofer was nominated for in 2012 except maybe row 4, where he was nominated as \"new movie actor of the year.\" But since the claim specifically mentions a 3-act award, and I don't see that category listed in the table, it's unclear if that part is true.\n\nBut according to the table, Kristofer did win the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012. So, part of the claim is correct, but the other part about being nominated for a 3-act award isn't supported by the data provided. Since the claim has two parts and only one is verified, I think the overall answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are where Kristofer won the German Moreno award in row 5, which is column index 3, but looking at the table, it's actually the fourth column (0-based index 3). So, the relevant_cells would include row_index 5 and column_name \"german moreno youth achievement award.\"\n\nWait, but the claim mentions Kristofer being nominated for a 3-act award. Since that category isn't in the table, I can't verify it. Therefore, since part of the claim is false, the overall answer is \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"german moreno youth achievement award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"In 2013, Kristofer Martin received only an honorable mention for best supporting actor in 'oros' at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but won best actor in a supporting role for 'oros' at the 10th Golden Screen Award.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify the relevant parts of this claim and map them to the table columns.\n\nThe key elements are:\n1. Year: 2013\n2. Person: Kristofer Martin\n3. First event: Honorable mention for best supporting actor in 'oros' at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo.\n4. Second event: Won best actor in a supporting role for 'oros' at the 10th Golden Screen Award.\n\nI need to check if these events are accurately represented in the table. Let's look at each data row for 2013.\n\nRow 1 (index 0): \n- year: 2013\n- award giving body: \"1st sunday all stars awards\"\n- category: \"stand out season performer\"\n- nominated for: none\n- result: nominated\n\nThis doesn't match the claim because it's about a different award and category.\n\nRow 2 (index 1):\n- year: 2013\n- award giving body: \"16th long island international film expo\"\n- category: \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\"\n- nominated for: oros\n- result: won\n\nThis matches the first part of the claim. So, row_index 1 and columns: year, award giving body, category, result.\n\nRow 3 (index 2):\n- year: 2013\n- award giving body: \"10th golden screen awards\"\n- category: \"best actor in a supporting role\"\n- nominated for: oros\n- result: won\n\nThis matches the second part of the claim. So, row_index 2 and columns: year, award giving body, category, result.\n\nNow, checking if Kristofer Martin is mentioned as the nominee in any of these rows. Looking at the table data:\n\nIn row 1 (2013), the \"nominated for\" column says \"none.\" \nRow 2: \"oros\"\nRow 3: \"oros\"\n\nBut the claim specifies that Kristofer Martin received these awards. The table doesn't explicitly mention him by name, only refers to \"oros\" as the nominated-for category.\n\nSo, even though the events match in terms of award categories and results, the table doesn't confirm that it's specifically Kristofer Martin who won or was nominated. Therefore, there's no direct evidence in the table supporting the claim about him receiving these awards.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition against the table. Since the person isn't mentioned, maybe we can assume that Kristofer is the one referred to as \"oros\" (perhaps it's a placeholder for his name). But the table doesn't specify this, so I'm not sure.\n\nHowever, looking at row 4 and 5 in 2012, there are mentions of 'tween academy : class of 2012' which might refer to Kristofer, but that's another year. So, maybe in 2013, the awarding bodies are linked to him, but the table doesn't confirm it.\n\nSince the claim states that he received these awards, and the table shows those awards with \"oros\" as the category, but without specifying if it's for Kristofer, I'm leaning towards the claim being TRUE because it's likely referring to his achievements. But the table only mentions 'oros' in the nominated-for column, not linking it to a person.\n\nWait, actually, the instruction says to check whether each condition is fully supported by the table. The claim includes Kristofer Martin as the recipient, but the table doesn't mention him. Therefore, the relevant cells would still be those two rows because they match the award details and results, but without Kristofer's name. However, since the table doesn't specify that it's him, maybe the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. The claim is about Kristofer Martin specifically, but the table only mentions \"oros\" as the category. So perhaps the claim is not fully supported because the table doesn't confirm it's him. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nWait no, maybe \"oros\" refers to Kristofer in this context. If that's the case, then the relevant cells are rows 1 and 2, columns year, award giving body, category, result. So the answer would be TRUE if we assume \"oros\" is him, but without explicit mention, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim includes Kristofer Martin's name, which isn't in the table. Therefore, the table doesn't support that he received these awards because it doesn't mention him specifically. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Kristofer Martin is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"Kristofer Martin have been nominate for 7 act award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is asserting. It mentions two specific years, 2012 and 2013. It claims that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 acting awards in these two years combined and won 4 of them.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an award event with details like the year, the awarding body, category, nominated for, and result. The columns are: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nI need to check if there are any rows that involve Kristofer Martin. However, looking at the table, I notice that none of the \"nominated for\" or other fields mention \"Kristofer Martin.\" Instead, some entries have \"oros\" listed in the \"nominated for\" column and others have different categories like \"best performance\" or \"new movie actor of the year.\"\n\nWait, maybe Kristofer Martin is referred to by a different name or alias in the table. Let me check each row's \"nominated for\" and \"result\" columns carefully.\n\nRow 0: Award is \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" category is \"stand out season performer.\" Nominated but didn't win. No mention of Kristofer Martin here.\n\nRow 1: \"16th long island international film expo,\" category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" result is \"won.\" Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: \"10th golden screen awards,\" category \"best actor in a supporting role,\" result \"won.\" Again, not mentioning Kristofer Martin.\n\nRow 3: 2012, \"the young critics circle awards,\" category \"best performance.\" Nominated but no win. No match.\n\nRow 4: 2012, \"28th pmpc star awards for movies,\" category \"new movie actor of the year.\" Nominated, result not given as it's \"nominated.\"\n\nRow 5: 2012, \"famas awards,\" category \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" result \"won.\" Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: 2012, \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards,\" category \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching.\" Result \"won.\"\n\nWait a second, the claim is about acting awards. None of these seem to be acting awards except perhaps row 0 and others if they're in acting categories. But looking at the categories: \"stand out season performer,\" \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" \"best actor in a supporting role,\" \"best performance,\" etc. Some are acting-related, but none of them refer to Kristofer Martin.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"7 act award.\" So perhaps these are 7 acting awards. Looking at the table, between 2012 and 2013, how many acting awards does Kristofer Martin have?\n\nWait, in the table, each row is a separate award event. Let me count how many times an acting award was given to someone named Kristofer Martin or if he's involved.\n\nBut in all the rows provided, I don't see any mention of Kristofer Martin. The \"nominated for\" and other fields are categories or organizations, not people. So it seems like the table doesn't list individual winners or nominees but rather the awards themselves.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data in the table about Kristofer Martin being nominated for or winning acting awards between 2012 and 2013, the claim isn't supported by the information provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check each row again. Each row represents an award event, not a person. So the \"nominated for\" column is about categories, not individuals. For example, in row 6, it's \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching,\" which doesn't relate to acting.\n\nSo, since none of the entries mention Kristofer Martin or any award he might have been part of, the claim can't be verified as true based on this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Kristofer Martin being nominated for 7 acting awards between 2012 and 2013 and winning 4 is not supported by the provided table. The table lists various award events but does not mention Kristofer Martin in any capacity, including nominations or wins.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:** The claim asserts that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 acting awards between 2012-2013 and won 4 of them.\n2. **Table Review:** Each table row represents an award event with details on the awarding body, category, whether he was nominated, and result.\n3. **Relevance Check:** None of the rows mention Kristofer Martin in any field (nominated for, result, etc.), indicating no support for the claim.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the table lacks information about Kristofer Martin's awards, the claim is deemed false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells used in the verification. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations be for his performance in Oros.\" The key points here are that there are three instances where Kristofer Martin was nominated for awards related to his performance in a project named \"Oros.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row and see if it pertains to Kristofer Martin. Wait, but looking through the table's data, I don't actually see any mention of Kristofer Martin by name. The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. The rows list various award bodies, categories, and results.\n\nWait a second, maybe Kristofer Martin is represented under another name in the table? Let me check each row:\n\n1. First row: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" etc. No mention of Kristofer Martin.\n2. Second row: 16th long island expo, category about best supporting actor. No name there.\n3. Third row: 10th golden screen awards, category is best actor in a supporting role. No name.\n4. Fourth row: 2012, \"the young critics circle awards,\" category is best performance. No Kristofer Martin.\n5. Fifth row: 28th pmpc star awards, category is new movie actor of the year. No name.\n6. Sixth row: Famas awards, category is German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. No name.\n7. Seventh row: Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, category is most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching. Again, no Kristofer Martin.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. The table's data doesn't mention Kristofer Martin at all. So how can the claim be verified if he isn't listed? That suggests that there might be a disconnect between the claim and the provided data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Kristofer Martin\" is an alias or another name used in different award listings, but it's not present here. The table only lists award categories and results without mentioning individuals by name except for 'oros' which seems to be a category or project.\n\nWait, looking at the rows again, some have \"nominated\" as the result, others \"won.\" So perhaps each row represents an award nomination and win for someone, but since there's no direct link to Kristofer Martin in the data, maybe the claim is false because he isn't mentioned.\n\nBut wait, the user's instruction says that I need to check if the claim is supported by the table. Since the table doesn't mention Kristofer Martin at all, the claim can't be fully verified as TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine each row carefully:\n\nLooking for any row where \"Kristofer Martin\" is mentioned in the 'nominated for' or other columns. But no, none of the rows have his name. The categories mention things like 'best performance,' 'new movie actor of the year,' etc., but without a specific person's name, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"oros\" refers to Kristofer Martin? But that seems unlikely because \"oros\" is listed as a category or a term in some columns. For example, in row 2: nominated for \"oros,\" which might mean the award is for something else, not necessarily related to his name.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about how many times he was nominated for performance in Oros, but since there's no mention of him in any row, the count can't be determined. Therefore, the claim is based on a premise that isn't supported by the table data.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim states that Kristofer Martin had three award nominations related to his performance in Oros. The table doesn't include any rows where he was nominated or won for anything, let alone specifically for Oros. Therefore, there's no support in the table for this claim, making it FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, since none of the cells mention Kristofer Martin, there are no relevant cells to verify the claim. So the answer is \"FALSE\" with no relevant cells listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe claim says: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 be not base[d] on nomination for a specific show.\" Wait, I think there might be a typo in the claim. It probably means that two of his award wins aren't based on nominations for specific shows.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several awards where Kristofer Martin was nominated or won. Each row has details like year, awarding body, category, nominated for, and result. I need to check which rows relate to Kristofer Martin's wins that are not based on a nomination for a specific show.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the wins by Kristofer Martin in 2012 and 2013. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards\", category is \"stand out season performer\", nominated.\nSo, he was nominated but didn't win here.\n\nRow 1: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo\", category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\", won. So this is a win, but the category isn't a specific show nomination. Wait, what's \"nominated for\"? In row 1, \"nominated for\" is \"oros\". I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe it's an abbreviation; perhaps it's a typo or placeholder.\n\nRow 2: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards\", category is \"best actor in a supporting role\", won again. The \"nominated for\" here is also \"oros\".\n\nRow 3: 2012, \"the young critics circle awards\", category is \"best performance\", nominated. So no win here.\n\nRow 4: 2012, \"28th pmpc star awards for movies\", category is \"new movie actor of the year\", nominated. Again, no win.\n\nRow 5: 2012, \"famas awards\", category is \"german moreno youth achievement award\", won. The \"nominated for\" here is \"n / a\".\n\nRow 6: 2012, \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards\", category is \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\", won. So another win.\n\nNow, focusing on the years 2012 and 2013, Kristofer Martin has two wins in 2013 (Rows 1 and 2) and three wins in 2012 (Rows 5 and 6 are wins). Wait, that's more than two, but the claim is about between 2012 and 2013. So from 2012 to 2013, he has multiple wins.\n\nThe claim says \"two of the award wins...be not based on nomination for a specific show.\" So we need to find two wins where he didn't get nominated for a specific show.\n\nLooking at each win:\n\nRow 1: Won, but in 2013. The \"nominated for\" is \"oros\", which I'm not sure about. Maybe it's not a specific show, so this could be one.\n\nRow 2: Similarly, won in 2013 with \"nominated for\" as \"oros\".\n\nRow 5: Won in 2012, and \"nominated for\" is \"n / a\", which probably means there was no nomination. So this win is based on not being nominated, or perhaps the category doesn't require a specific show.\n\nRow 6: Won in 2012, but the category is \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching.\" That sounds like it's about a specific show or program, so this might be based on nomination for that show.\n\nSo from 2012 and 2013, the wins are:\n\n- 2013, Row1: perhaps not based on a specific show.\n- 2013, Row2: same as above.\n- 2012, Row5: no \"nominated for\" data, so likely not based on nomination.\n- 2012, Row6: possibly based on a specific show.\n\nSo Kristofer Martin has two wins in 2013 (Rows1 and 2) that are not based on a specific show's nomination. That aligns with the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"result\"}, {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"result\"}]}",

The claim states: \"Kristofer Martin was only nominated for 1 act award in 2013 but didn't win any.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the data to see if there's a relevant entry for Kristofer Martin in 2013. The table has multiple rows, each with different award bodies and categories.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- The first row is for 2013 but mentions \"none\" under \"nominated for,\" which doesn't seem related.\n- The second row is about the 16th Long Island International Film Expo in 2013. It mentions a nomination but it's for someone named \"oros.\" Kristofer Martin isn't mentioned here, so this row might not be relevant unless there's a name associated with \"oros.\"\n- The third row also refers to \"oros\" being awarded in 2013. Again, no mention of Kristofer.\n- The fourth row is for 2012, so it's not relevant since the claim is about 2013.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row more carefully.\n\nRow 0: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" \"stand out season performer,\" \"none,\" \"nominated.\" No mention of Kristofer Martin here.\n\nRow 1: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo,\" \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" \"oros,\" \"won.\" So \"oros\" got a honorable mention and won. If \"oros\" is Kristofer's name in disguise or an alias, then maybe this row is about him. But without the name matching, it's unclear.\n\nRow 2: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards,\" \"best actor in a supporting role,\" \"oros,\" \"won.\" Again, \"oros\" won here. If that's Kristofer, then he was nominated? Wait, looking back at row 1, for the same year and award body, it says \"nominated.\" So perhaps there was a nomination but not a win.\n\nWait, no, row 1 shows \"nominated,\" while row 2 shows \"won\" for \"oros.\" Maybe in 2013, Kristofer was nominated for something else. Let me check other rows.\n\nRow 5: 2012, so not relevant. Row 6: 2012 as well. So only the first three rows are for 2013.\n\nLooking at all the \"nominated\" entries in 2013:\n- Row 0: \"none\"\n- Row 1: \"nominated\"\n- Row 2: \"won\"\n\nWait, row 2 is a \"won\" for \"oros,\" but that's a different category. So in 2013, Kristofer might have been nominated for another award.\n\nBut the claim says he was only nominated for 1 act award in 2013 and didn't win any. From the table, in 2013, the relevant rows are:\n- Row 0: \"stand out season performer,\" but no mention of Kristofer.\n- Row 1: \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" and won. If this is Kristofer, then he was both nominated and won. But the claim says he didn't win any.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim is about Kristofer being only nominated for one act award in 2013 but not winning. So let's see if there's a row where Kristofer was the nominee.\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see an entry that explicitly mentions Kristofer Martin by name. The \"nominated\" entries are either for \"none,\" \"oros,\" or other categories without his name. \n\nIf the claim is based on Kristofer being nominated as \"oros,\" then maybe in 2013 he was only nominated once and didn't win. But since the claim specifically mentions \"Kristofer Martin,\" and the table doesn't mention him, I think there's no evidence to support it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"kristofer martin\" is not mentioned at all in the table, so the claim can't be true because there's no data supporting that he was nominated or won anything. \n\nAlternatively, if \"oros\" refers to Kristofer, then row 1 shows he was nominated and row 2 shows he won another award. That would contradict the claim that he didn't win any.\n\nSo, without explicit mention of Kristofer Martin in the table, the claim might be false because there's no data supporting it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Kristofer Martin has been nominated for 7 best actor award between 2012 and 2013, win 4 of those awards.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 best actor awards between 2012 and 2013.\n2. He won 4 of those awards.\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table to see if it's supported.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that the columns are: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. The data rows include various award bodies and categories for different years, including 2012 and 2013.\n\nI'll start by looking for any mention of Kristofer Martin in the \"nominated for\" column or anywhere else that might relate to him. However, scanning through the table's \"nominated for\" entries, I see names like \"oros\" and other entities, but none explicitly say \"Kristofer Martin.\" This makes me wonder if he is even mentioned in the table at all.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row to see if any of the award bodies relate to Kristofer Martin. But without his name appearing anywhere in the data, it seems like the claim might not be directly supported by this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Kristofer Martin\" is associated with the entity listed as \"oros.\" However, that's speculative and there's no direct evidence in the table that links \"oros\" to him. The categories mentioned are things like \"stand out season performer,\" \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" etc., but none specifically refer to Kristofer Martin.\n\nNow, looking at the years: 2012 and 2013 are covered in the claim. So I need to check if there's any data in those years related to him. In 2012, one award is \"new movie actor of the year,\" another is \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" and so on. None have Kristofer Martin's name.\n\nIn 2013, there are three awards mentioned: \"stand out season performer,\" \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" and \"best actor in a supporting role.\" Again, none of these are directly linked to Kristofer Martin.\n\nSo, based on the table, there is no explicit mention of Kristofer Martin being nominated or winning any awards. Therefore, the claim that he was nominated seven times between 2012-2013 and won four seems unsupported by the data provided.\n\nAdditionally, I should check for any cells that might relate to this. The \"nominated for\" column could be relevant if it contains information about Kristofer Martin's nominations. However, since his name isn't there, those cells are not directly relevant. Similarly, the \"result\" column would matter only if he had won, but again, without any mention of him in the table, these cells aren't relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim isn't supported by the information in the table, so it's likely FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided data. None of the entries mention Kristofer Martin or provide evidence of his nominations or wins as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"In 2013, Kristofer Martin receives 2 honorable mentions for best support actor in Oros at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but wins best actor in a supporting role for Oros at the Famas award.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each part of this claim against the data. Let's start by identifying the relevant columns: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, result.\n\nThe first part mentions 2013, so I should look for rows where year is 2013. The second part refers to Kristofer Martin, but in the table, under \"nominated for\" and \"result,\" there are names like \"oros.\" Wait, that might be a typo or shorthand for someone's name? Maybe it's supposed to be Kristofer Martin.\n\nLooking at row 1: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" \"stand out season performer,\" \"none,\" \"nominated.\" So this doesn't mention anything about support actor or Famas.\n\nRow 2: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo,\" \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" \"oros,\" \"won.\" Wait, here it says the award giving body is that expo, category is honorable mention for best supporting actor. So Kristofer Martin got a honorable mention there. But the claim says he received two honorable mentions? Hmm, no, only one row has that. So maybe the claim's first part is incorrect.\n\nNext, the third row: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards,\" \"best actor in a supporting role,\" \"oros,\" \"won.\" So this seems to be another award where Kristofer won. But wait, it's for best actor, not support. The claim says he wins best actor in a supporting role at Famas. \n\nWait, let me check the Famas row. Looking through the table again, I see in row 5: 2012, \"famas awards,\" \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" \"n / a,\" \"won.\" So this is about Famas but in 2012 for a different category, not supporting actor.\n\nWait, no, let me check all the rows again. Oh, wait, I might have missed one. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" stand out season performer, none, nominated.\nRow1: 2013, 16th expo, honorable mention for best support actor, oros, won.\nRow2: 2013, 10th golden screen, best support actor? No, wait, it's \"best actor in a supporting role,\" which is a bit confusing. Is that the same as best supporting actor?\nWait, category is \"best actor in a supporting role,\" which might be similar to best supporting actor. So if Kristofer won this at Famas... but Famas is in 2012.\n\nSo in row3: 2012, young critics circle, best performance, oros, nominated.\nRow4: 2012, 28th pmpc star awards, new movie actor, tween academy, nominated.\nRow5: 2012, famas, german moreno award, n/a, won.\nRow6: 2012, 1st party pilipinas, most liked loveteam, n/a, won.\n\nSo in row2 (index 2), it's 2013, golden screen awards, best actor in supporting role, oros, won. So that's a win for best actor in supporting role at oros in 2013. But the claim says he wins this at Famas in 2013? Wait, but Famas is in row5 which is 2012.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me list them again with their indexes:\n\nRow0: 2013, 1st sunday... nom.\nRow1: 2013, expo, honorable mention for support actor, oros, won.\nRow2: 2013, golden screen, best support actor (or is it best actor in supporting role?), oros, won.\nRow3: 2012, young critics, best performance, oros, nom.\nRow4: 2012, pmpc, new movie actor, tween academy, nom.\nRow5: 2012, famas, german moreno award, n/a, won.\nRow6: 2012, party pilipinas, most liked loveteam, n/a, won.\n\nWait, in row1: honorable mention for best support actor. So he got that at the expo, but he didn't win it; he was just nominated? No, wait, \"result\" is \"won,\" so he actually won that category. But it's an honorable mention, which might be a bit confusing because usually honorable mentions are nominations without winning.\n\nWait, in row1: award giving body is 16th long island expo, category is honorable mention for best support actor, nominated for oros, and result is \"won.\" So he won that award? Or does \"honorable mention\" mean something else. Maybe the term \"won\" here refers to being recognized with an honorable mention, but perhaps it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThen in row2: 2013, golden screen awards, category is best actor in supporting role, oros, result is won. So that's a win for the same award category as mentioned in the claim. But wait, in the claim, it says he wins at Famas, but Famas is a different award body.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the columns. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow1: 2013, expo, honorable mention for best support actor (category), oros (nominated for?), result won.\n\nSo in 2013, Kristofer got a honorable mention at the expo for best support, and won something else? Or did he win that category?\n\nWait, maybe \"nominated\" is for someone else. Maybe \"nominated for\" refers to another person, but it's unclear. The claim says \"Kristofer Martin receives 2 honorable mentions,\" but in the table, I only see one row where he got a honorable mention.\n\nWait, hold on: looking at the data, each row seems to be about different awards. So in row1, Kristofer won an award for honorable mention as best support actor at the expo. In row2, he won another award for best actor in supporting role at golden screen. But the claim says he received two honorable mentions and a win.\n\nWait, no, the claim says: \"receives 2 honorable mentions... but wins best actor in supporting role.\" So in the table, I see only one honorable mention (row1), and a win for best actor (row2). So does that mean the claim is saying he got two, but he actually got one? That would make the claim false.\n\nWait, perhaps \"oros\" refers to another person or another category. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"nominated for\" part. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach row has: award name, category, nominated for, result.\n\nSo in row1: 16th expo, category is honorable mention for best support actor, nominated for oros, and result won.\n\nDoes that mean he was nominated for oros but got an honorable mention in the supporting actor category? Or is \"nominated for\" separate from the category?\n\nI think it's structured as:\n\nAward name: 16th long island expo\n\nCategory: honorable mention for best support actor (so the award category is that)\n\nNominated for: oros (maybe another person?)\n\nResult: won.\n\nSo perhaps in this case, he was awarded an honorable mention for best support actor, but since result is \"won,\" maybe it's a bit conflicting. Maybe \"honorable mention\" is not a win but just recognition.\n\nWait, no, if the result is \"won,\" that suggests he took home the award. So perhaps the category is being misreported as \"honorable mention for best support actor\" when in reality, he won that award, which was the honorable mention? Or maybe it's an actual honor without a win. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"nominated for oros\" means he was shortlisted for oros but got an honorable mention in another category.\n\nBut regardless, the claim says he received two honorable mentions (for supporting actor) and a win. The table shows one honorable mention and one win, so that's inconsistent with the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, unless I'm miscounting rows or misreading categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"best actor in supporting role\" is considered the same as best support actor, but it's not two separate awards.\n\nIn any case, the key points are:\n\n- The claim says Kristofer received 2 honorable mentions for supporting actor and won a best supporting actor award at Famas in 2013.\n\nBut according to the table:\n\n- In 2013, he got an honorable mention (maybe without winning) at expo, and a win at golden screen for best support.\n\nWait, no: in row1, he \"won\" the honorable mention? Or did he just get it. The term \"won\" is confusing here because usually, you don't \"win\" an honorable mention; that's more of a nomination without winning.\n\nBut if the result is \"won,\" perhaps he actually won the award, which was categorized as \"honorable mention for best support actor.\" That seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"best support actor\" and \"best actor in supporting role\" are two different categories. So perhaps in 2013, he got two wins: one as best support actor at expo, and another as best actor in supporting role at golden screen.\n\nBut the claim says he received two honorable mentions for supporting actor and a win for Famas, which is not matching because in the table, he didn't get a Famas award in 2013. He got it in 2012 but that was a different category.\n\nSo the main points are:\n\n- The claim implies he has multiple honorable mentions as supporting actor, and a specific win at Famas.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- In 2013, he won once (golden screen) for best support.\n\n- He had an \"honorable mention\" at expo, which is probably not equivalent to a win.\n\nSo the claim's numbers don't match, meaning it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the user is incorrect. Upon analyzing the provided data:\n\n1. **Honorable Mentions and Wins**: The data indicates that Kristofer received one \"honorable mention\" for Best Supporting Actor at the 16th Long Island Expo in 2013 and won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role category at the 10th Golden Screen Awards also in 2013.\n\n2. **FAMAS Award**: The FAMAS award mentioned in the claim was actually given in 2012, not 2013, and for a different category (German Moreno Award), not as Best Supporting Actor. This discrepancy shows that Kristofer did not win the FAMAS award for Best Supporting Actor in 2013.\n\nTherefore, the original claim contains inaccuracies regarding both the number of honorable mentions and the timing and category of the FAMAS award.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is false based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"All of Kristofer Martin's award nominations be for his performance in Oros.\" So, I'm supposed to check if every award nomination listed for Kristofer Martin (assuming that's who 'Kristofer Martin' refers to) was given for his performance in the project or role called \"Oros\".\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me go through each row and see where \"Kristofer Martin\" is mentioned. Wait, actually, I don't see a column with \"Kristofer Martin\" as a name. The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nSo maybe I need to look at the 'nominated for' column or perhaps another approach. Alternatively, perhaps each row is an award, and we have to check if the 'nominated for' field refers to his performance in Oros.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't include a name column. Hmm, that complicates things. So I might need to assume that any row where the category or other details relate to Oros could be relevant. Alternatively, perhaps each row is an award that Kristofer Martin was either nominated for or won, and we have to see if all his nominations are related to \"Oros\".\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. 2013, 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, Stand Out Season Performer, none, nominated\n2. 2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo, Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Oros, won\n3. 2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Oros, won\n4. 2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards, Best Performance, Oros, nominated\n5. 2012, 28th PMPC Star Awards for Movies, New Movie Actor of the Year, Tween Academy: Class of 2012, nominated\n6. 2012, FAMAS Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, N/A, won\n7. 2012, 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching, N/A, won\n\nSo the 'nominated for' column lists things like \"none,\" \"Oros,\" \"Best Supporting Actor,\" etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about Kristofer Martin's award nominations all being for his performance in Oros. So each of his nominations should be related to his work in Oros.\n\nLooking at the data, each row seems to represent an award. But without a column indicating who was awarded or who it's for, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps 'nominated for' refers to what he was nominated for, which could relate to his performance in Oros.\n\nLet me check each relevant cell that might support or contradict the claim.\n\nLooking at row 2: The award is from the Long Island Film Expo, category is Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, and the nominated for field is Oros. So this is a nomination in Oros.\n\nRow 3: Golden Screen Awards, category Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated for Oros, so won. This would support the claim as it's related to his performance in Oros.\n\nRow 4: Young Critics Circle, Best Performance, nominated for Oros. Again, supports the claim.\n\nRows 5 and 7 have 'nominated for' fields that don't mention Oros. Row 5: \"New Movie Actor of the Year,\" category is Tween Academy. So this is a nomination not related to Oros. Similarly, row 6: FAMAS Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, which might be unrelated.\n\nSo, in rows 2,3,4, they are all related to Oros. But rows 5 and 7 aren't. Therefore, Kristofer Martin has award nominations not for Oros, so the claim that \"all of his award nominations are for Oros\" is false.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if row 5's 'nominated for' field refers to a specific role or category. If it's about being a new movie actor, perhaps it's separate from Oros. So rows 2,3,4 are supporting the claim, while rows 5 and 7 are counterexamples.\n\nThus, since not all nominations are for Oros, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"all of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 be base [sic] on nomination for a specific show.\" Hmm, I think there's a typo here. It probably means \"based on nomination.\" So the claim is saying that all his award wins were based on being nominated for a specific show.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it lists various awards, the year, the awarding body, category, who was nominated for, and the result (nominated or won). The relevant years are 2012 and 2013. Kristofer Martin seems to be involved in these awards, as several entries have \"oros\" as the nominator.\n\nWait, but actually, in the table, the \"nominated for\" column has values like \"none,\" \"oros,\" \"tween academy : class of 2012,\" etc. So I need to check if all his wins were based on a nomination.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First entry: 2013, award body is \"1st sunday all stars awards.\" Category is \"stand out season performer,\" nominated for \"none,\" and result was \"nominated.\" Since he wasn't nominated here, this doesn't count as a win based on nomination.\n\n2. Second entry: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo,\" category \"honorable mention...\" He was \"won\" here. The \"nominated for\" is \"oros.\" So Kristofer won because he was nominated. This one counts.\n\n3. Third row: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards,\" category \"best actor in a supporting role,\" and he was \"won.\" Nominated for \"oros.\" Another win based on nomination.\n\n4. Fourth row: 2012, \"the young critics circle awards,\" category \"best performance,\" nominated. He didn't win here because it's \"nominated.\"\n\n5. Fifth row: 2012, \"28th pmpc star awards for movies,\" category \"new movie actor of the year.\" Nominated for \"tween academy : class of 2012.\" So he was nominated but didn't win.\n\n6. Sixth row: 2012, \"famas awards,\" category \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" won. He was \"won\" here, and the \"nominated for\" is \"n / a.\" Wait, \"n/a\" might mean there's no specific show nominated for. So this could be an exception.\n\n7. Seventh row: 2012, \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards,\" category \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching,\" won. Nominated for is \"n / a.\" Similar to the previous one.\n\nSo now, I need to check if all his wins (rows where result is \"won\") are based on being nominated for a specific show. Let's list out the rows where he won and see their \"nominated for\" column.\n\nSecond row: \"oros\" as nominator.\nThird row: \"oros\" again.\nSixth row: \"n / a.\"\nSeventh row: \"n / a.\"\n\nWait, in the sixth and seventh rows, it says \"won\" but the \"nominated for\" is \"n / a.\" So he won without being specifically nominated for a show. That would mean the claim isn't fully supported because not all his wins were based on nomination for a specific show.\n\nAlso, looking at the fifth row: he was nominated for \"tween academy : class of 2012,\" but didn't win, so it's irrelevant to his wins.\n\nSo, in rows where he won (second, third, sixth, seventh), two of them (\"oros\") are based on being nominated for a specific show, while the other two have \"n / a.\" Therefore, not all his award wins were based on nomination for a specific show. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all of Kristofer Martin's award wins between 2012 and 2013 were based on being nominated for a specific show. However, in two instances (6th and 7th rows), he won without being specifically nominated for a show, as \"n / a\" indicates no specific nomination.
