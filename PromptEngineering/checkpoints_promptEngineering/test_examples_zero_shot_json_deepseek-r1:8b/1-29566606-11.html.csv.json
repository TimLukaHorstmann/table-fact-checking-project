    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has five columns: programme, date (s) of original removal, original channel (s), date of return, and new channel (s). The data rows provide information about different TV programmes, including their original broadcast channels, when they were removed, when they returned, and where they returned.\n\nThe claim in question is about \"art attack\" being originally broadcast on CITV. So I need to check if the original channel for \"art attack\" is indeed CITV.\n\nLooking at the table's data rows, specifically the fourth row:\n\n[\n  \"art attack\",\n  \"13 july 2007\",\n  \"citv\",\n  \"6 june 2011\",\n  \"disney junior\"\n]\n\nHere, the programme is \"art attack,\" and in the original channel column, it's listed as \"citv.\" So that matches the claim.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows for \"art attack\" or variations that might contradict this. But from the table, each row seems to represent a single programme, so \"art attack\" only appears once, and in that row, the original channel is CITV.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided. The relevant cell is the one in row 3 (since it's zero-indexed) under the column \"original channel (s).\" So the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell pointing to row 3 and column \"original channel (s).\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is true, I checked the 'original channel' column for the programme \"art attack.\" The original channel listed is CITV. \n\nThe relevant cell is in row 3, column \"original channel (s)\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions that \"big brother\" returns on September 9, 2011. So I need to find if this specific information is present in the table.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: programme, date of original removal, original channel, date of return, new channel.\n\nI'm interested in the 'programme' column because the claim mentions \"big brother.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n1. First row: Programme is \"celebrity big brother\" \u2013 not relevant.\n2. Second row: Programme is \"big brother\" \u2013 this matches.\n3. Third and subsequent rows: Programmes are different, so no.\n\nSo only the second row's programme is \"big brother.\"\n\nNow, checking the 'date of return' column for that specific row. The date provided in the claim is September 9, 2011. Looking at the data:\n\n- Second row has \"9 september 2011\" under date of return. That matches exactly.\n\nAdditionally, let me check other columns related to the claim to ensure no conflicts. The 'date of original removal' for \"big brother\" is September 10, 2010, which is correct but not part of the claim, so it doesn't affect the truthfulness. The original channel was Channel 4, and after return, it's still on Channel 5, as per the data.\n\nSince all relevant information in the claim is supported by the table without any discrepancies, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim and identify which columns are relevant. The claim mentions a show returning on a specific date. In the table, the relevant columns would be \"programme\", \"date of return\", and possibly others like \"original channel\" if needed for verification, but the main focus here is the return date.\n\nLooking at the data provided in the table, each row represents a different programme along with its removal and return details. I'm specifically interested in the row where the programme is \"born to be different\". So, I'll find that row first.\n\nIn the data section, there's a row for \"born to be different\" with the following details:\n- Programme: born to be different\n- date (s) of original removal: 2004 13 september 2007 5 may 2009\n- original channel: channel 4\n- date of return: 9 june 2011\n- new channel (s): n / a (same channel as original)\n\nWait, the claim says it returns on August 18, 2011. But according to the table, the actual date of return is June 9, 2011. That's in June, not August. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI should check if there's any chance I'm misunderstanding the data. The \"date (s) of original removal\" for this programme spans multiple dates: 2004, September 13, 2007, and May 5, 2009. It seems like it was removed on these various dates, but when it returned is June 9, 2011.\n\nLooking at other rows to make sure I'm not missing something else. The other programmes have their return dates correctly placed in the table, so that's consistent. For example, \"absolutely fabulous\" returns on December 25, 2011, and \"art attack\" on June 6, 2011, which matches their entries.\n\nSo, back to \"born to be different.\" The claim says August 18, 2011, but the table shows June 9, 2011. That's a month difference. Since the dates don't match, the claim isn't supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the return date stated in the claim doesn't align with what's listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"born to be different\" returns on August 18, 2011. However, according to the table, it returned on June 9, 2011. Since the dates don't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of return\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
