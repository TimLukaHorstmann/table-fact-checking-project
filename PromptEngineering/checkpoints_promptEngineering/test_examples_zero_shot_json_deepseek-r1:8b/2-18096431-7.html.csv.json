    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the relevant data in the table. Mark Brooks is in row 0, column \"to par\" which is -11. Kenny Perry is also in row 1, but his \"to par\" is also -11. So both of them have the same score here.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other players with a lower \"to par\" than -11. Looking through the table:\n\n- Mark Brooks: -11\n- Kenny Perry: -11\n- Steve Elkington: -10\n- Tommy Tolles: -10\n- Justin Leonard: -9\n- Jesper Parnevik: -9\n- Vijay Singh: -9\n- Lee Janzen: -8\n- Per-Ulrik Johansson: -8\n- Phil Mickelson: -8\n- Larry Mize: -8\n- Frank Nobilo: -8\n- Nick Price: -8\n\nSo the lowest \"to par\" is -11, and only Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry have that. Therefore, they do tie for having the lowest to par.\n\nI should check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"mark brook and kenny perry,\" so I need their rows (0 and 1) and specifically the \"to par\" column. So the relevant cells would be row 0, column \"to par\" and row 1, same column.\n\nThat's it. The claim is true because both have -11 as their to par scores, which is the lowest in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the \"to par\" column for Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry, comparing them against other players. Both have a \"to par\" of -11, the lowest score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"mark brook be the player who earn the most money\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"mark brook\" as a player. Looking at the table's data, I see that in row 0 (which is index 0), the player is \"mark brooks\". Wait, it's spelled \"mark brooks\", not \"brook\". That might be a typo or maybe different spelling. So I should check if it's the same person.\n\nNext, the claim says \"earn the most money.\" In the table, each row has a 'money' column. So I need to look at the 'money' values for each player and see who has the highest amount.\n\nLet me list out all the players and their corresponding 'money' figures:\n\nRow 0: mark brooks - 430000\nRow 1: kenny perry - 260000\nRows 2-4 (t3, t5, t5): australian, then united states, etc., but money is 140000 each.\nRows 5-7 (t5, t8, t8, etc.): money varies, some at 86667 and 57500.\n\nWait, row 0 has mark brooks with 430k, which seems higher than others. Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking through each data row:\nRow 0: 430000\nRow1:260000\nRow2:140000\nRow3:140000\nRow4:86667\nRow5:86667\nRow6:86667\nRow7:57500\nRow8:57500\nRow9:57500\nRow10:57500\nRow11:57500\n\nSo mark brooks has the highest money at 430k, which is more than any other player's amount listed. Therefore, the claim that \"mark brook be the player who earn the most money\" should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I notice that in row0, the place is \"1\", and the player is \"mark brooks\". So yes, he is indeed one of the players, and his money is 430k. No other player has more than that. So the claim seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because mark brooks' money value (430000) is higher than any other player's money in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that Nick Price is the sole player from Zimbabwe in the table. So, my task is to check if any other players listed are also from Zimbabwe and share the same last name or similar details as Nick Price.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The relevant columns for checking the claim are \"player\" and \"country\". \n\nI'll go through each row in the data to see if any other players besides Nick Price are from Zimbabwe.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Player: Mark Brooks\n- Country: United States\n\nSecond row:\n- Player: Kenny Perry\n- Country: United States\n\nThird row:\n- Player: Steve Elkington\n- Country: Australia\n\nFourth row:\n- Player: Tommy Tolles\n- Country: United States\n\nFifth row:\n- Player: Justin Leonard\n- Country: United States\n\nSixth row:\n- Player: Jesper Parnevik\n- Country: Sweden\n\nSeventh row:\n- Player: Vijay Singh\n- Country: Fiji\n\nEighth row:\n- Player: Lee Janzen\n- Country: United States\n\nNinth row:\n- Player: Per-Ulrik Johansson\n- Country: Sweden\n\nTenth row:\n- Player: Phil Mickelson\n- Country: United States\n\nEleventh row:\n- Player: Larry Mize\n- Country: United States\n\nTwelfth row:\n- Player: Frank Nobilo\n- Country: New Zealand\n\nThirteenth row:\n- Player: Nick Price\n- Country: Zimbabwe\n\nSo, from the data provided, only Nick Price's row has \"Zimbabwe\" listed as the country. I need to check if there are any other players with the last name \"Price.\" However, in this table, the player names seem to be unique, and no one else has \"Price\" as their last name.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that the claim isn't about being the only one from Zimbabwe in general, but specifically Nick Price. Since there's only one entry from Zimbabwe, which is Nick Price, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim \"nick price be the only player from zimbabwe\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Nick Price is the sole player listed as being from Zimbabwe. No other players share this designation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The data rows include information about various players, their performance in a tournament, and their scores.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Frank Nobilo being the only player from New Zealand. So my task is to check if there's any other player listed with \"New Zealand\" as their country besides Frank Nobilo.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to see which players are from New Zealand.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The first few rows are for Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Steve Elkington, Tommy Tolles, Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, and Vijay Singh. Their countries are mostly United States and Australia. None are from New Zealand here.\n\n- Then I see a row with \"frank nobilo\" under the player column, and his country is listed as \"new zealand\". So that's one player from New Zealand.\n\nI continue scanning the rest of the rows:\n\n- Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, and Nick Price are all from the United States or Sweden. No New Zealand here.\n\nWait a second, I might have missed someone. Let me check again. The next few rows after that include Frank Nobilo again? Or is it another player?\n\nLooking closely: There's a row with \"frank nobilo\", country \"new zealand\". Then, at the end of the table, there's another row for \"frank nobilo\"? No, I think that might be a typo. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread it earlier. The rows are as follows:\n\n- The first 5 rows: players from US, Australia, US, etc.\n- Then the next few rows, including Lee Janzen and others from US or Sweden.\n- At some point, there's a row for Frank Nobilo with country \"new zealand\".\n- The last row is Nick Price from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, in total, only one player from New Zealand: Frank Nobilo. Therefore, the claim says he's the only one, which seems correct based on this table.\n\nBut wait, I'm going to double-check each player's country.\n\nLooking at all players:\n\n1. Mark Brooks - US\n2. Kenny Perry - US\n3. Steve Elkington - Australia\n4. Tommy Tolles - US\n5. Justin Leonard - US\n6. Jesper Parnevik - Sweden\n7. Vijay Singh - Fiji\n8. Lee Janzen - US\n9. Per-Ulrik Johansson - Sweden\n10. Phil Mickelson - US\n11. Larry Mize - US\n12. Frank Nobilo - New Zealand\n13. Nick Price - Zimbabwe\n\nSo yes, only Frank Nobilo is listed as being from New Zealand. No other players share that country.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Frank Nobilo be the only player from New Zealand\" is TRUE based on this table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"}]}",

The claim is \"kenny perry earn 170000 less than mark brook.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows and columns in the table are relevant. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks. So I need to find their respective data in the table. Looking at the \"player\" column:\n\n- Mark Brooks is in row 0.\n- Kenny Perry is in row 1.\n\nNext, the claim compares their earnings, specifically looking at a difference of $170,000. The relevant columns here would be \"money,\" which shows the prize money each player earned. \n\nIn row 0 (Mark Brooks), the \"money\" value is 430,000.\nIn row 1 (Kenny Perry), the \"money\" value is 260,000.\n\nTo check if Kenny earned $170,000 less than Mark, I need to see if 430,000 - 260,000 equals 170,000. Let me calculate that: 430,000 minus 260,000 is indeed 170,000.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The table has columns: place, player, country, score (which seems to be calculated), to par, and money. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about Kenny Perry earning the most money among all players in the table. To verify this, I need to look at the \"money\" column for each player, including Kenny Perry, and see if his amount is higher than everyone else's.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n1. The first row is Mark Brooks with $430,000.\n2. The second row is Kenny Perry with $260,000.\n3. Steve Elkington: $140,000\n4. Tommy Tolles: $140,000\n5. Justin Leonard and Jesper Parnevik both have $86,667\n6. Vijay Singh also has $86,667\n7. Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, and Nick Price all share the same amount of $57,500.\n\nComparing all these values, the highest money earned is by Mark Brooks at $430,000. Kenny Perry has $260,000, which is lower than Mark's 430k. Therefore, Kenny Perry isn't the one with the most money; Mark Brooks is.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because Kenny Perry doesn't have the highest \"money\" value in the table. His money is less than Mark Brooks'.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant column for this claim would be the \"money\" column since we're comparing the amounts earned by each player. Each row's money value needs to be checked, but specifically focusing on Kenny Perry's row.\n\nLooking at the data, Kenny Perry is in the second row (index 1). So the relevant cells are row index 1 and the \"money\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par.\" Hmm, first things first, I need to figure out what each part of this means.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. So, the claim is specifically about two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry, and their \"to par\" scores. \n\nI remember that in golf, \"to par\" refers to the score relative to the target score of a hole or round. If a player's total is equal to the par (usually 72 for professional tournaments), they have scored par. If they're one under, it's birdie, and so on. But here, the term seems to be used as a measure of how much under or over the target they were.\n\nSo, the claim says Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tie for having the lowest \"to par.\" That means I need to look at their respective \"to par\" values in the table and see if both are equal and lower than others. \n\nLooking through the data:\n\nMark Brooks is in row 0, his \"to par\" is \"-11\".\nKenny Perry is in row 1, also with a \"to par\" of \"-11\".\n\nNext, I need to check if any other players have a lower (more negative) \"to par\" than -11. Because if someone has, say, \"-12,\" then Brooks and Perry wouldn't be the lowest.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 2: Steve Elkington, \"-10\"\nRow 3: Tommy Tolles, \"-10\"\nRow 4: Justin Leonard, \"-9\"\nRow 5: Jesper Parnevik, \"-9\"\nRow 6: Vijay Singh, \"-9\"\nRow 7: Lee Janzen, \"-8\"\nRow 8: Per-Ulrik Johansson, \"-8\"\nRow 9: Phil Mickelson, \"-8\"\nRow 10: Larry Mize, \"-8\"\nRow 11: Frank Nobilo, \"-8\"\nRow 12: Nick Price, \"-8\"\n\nSo, the lowest \"to par\" is -11 by Brooks and Perry.

So, to verify this, I need to check if there are any other players listed under \"country\" as Zimbabwe besides Frank Nobilo.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns include \"player,\" \"country,\" and others like \"score,\" but for this claim, I'm focusing on the \"player\" and \"country\" columns. I'll go through each row to see who is from Zimbabwe.\n\nThe first few rows:\n- Mark Brooks: United States\n- Kenny Perry: United States\n- Steve Elkington: Australia\n- Tommy Tolles: United States\n\nNone of these are from Zimbabwe. Then, looking further down:\n- Lee Janzen: United States\n- Per-Ulrik Johansson: Sweden\n- Phil Mickelson: United States\n- Larry Mize: United States\n- Frank Nobilo: New Zealand? Wait, that's not right. Oh no, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table, one of the rows is for \"frank nobilo\" and his country is listed as \"new zealand.\" Hmm, so he isn't from Zimbabwe after all. That changes things. So if Frank Nobilo is actually from New Zealand, then there are no players from Zimbabwe in the table.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The row for Frank Nobilo says:\n[\n  \"t8\",\n  \"frank nobilo\",\n  \"new zealand\",\n  ...\n]\n\nSo his country is New Zealand, not Zimbabwe. Therefore, if I'm looking for players from Zimbabwe, I need to check if any other player has their country listed as Zimbabwe.\n\nLooking again at the table, scrolling through all the rows:\n- Lee Janzen: United States\n- Per-Ulrik Johansson: Sweden\n- Phil Mickelson: United States\n- Larry Mize: United States\n- Frank Nobilo: New Zealand\n\nWait, so none of these are from Zimbabwe. But earlier, I thought someone was from Zimbabwe, but maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the row where \"frank nobilo\" is listed again. Oh, yes, it's definitely New Zealand.\n\nSo if Frank Nobilo isn't even from Zimbabwe, then there might be another player from Zimbabwe. Wait, looking back at the table, I don't see any player with country as Zimbabwe.

Therefore, there are at least two players from Zimbabwe: Nick Price and possibly others?\n\nWait, no, in row 11, it's only Nick Price from Zimbabwe. So the claim says \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe.\" But since Frank isn't even from Zimbabwe, and there is another player (Nick Price) from Zimbabwe, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The claim is about Frank being the only one from Zimbabwe. Since he's not from Zimbabwe, it's automatically false because there's at least Nick Price who is from Zimbabwe.\n\nAlternatively, if no other players are from Zimbabwe, then maybe the claim is true, but since there is another player, it's false.\n\nSo to break it down:\n- Check all rows for country == \"zimbabwe.\"\n- Only row 11 has that.\n- Player in row 11: Nick Price\n- So there is at least one player from Zimbabwe besides Frank Nobilo (who isn't even from Zimbabwe).\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells. The claim involves checking two columns: \"player\" and \"country.\" For each player, their country is listed. To verify the claim, we need to check if any other players have \"zimbabwe\" as their country besides Frank Nobilo.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n- For each row, check the \"player\" name and \"country.\"\n- Specifically, look for rows where country is \"zimbabwe.\" That's only one row: row 11.\n- Also, perhaps check Frank Nobilo's row to confirm his country isn't Zimbabwe.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Frank being the only one from Zimbabwe. So we need to find if any other player besides him (if he were from Zimbabwe) is also from there. Since he isn't, and there's another player who is, that's enough.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- The row for Frank Nobilo to check his country.\n- The row where a player is from Zimbabwe to see that someone else exists.\n\nThus, the relevant rows are row 9 (Frank Nobilo) and row 11 (Nick Price).\n\nWait, but in the table provided earlier, it's:\n\nRow indices may vary based on how it's presented. Let me assume the data is as follows:\n\n[\n  [\"t8\", \"frank nobilo\", \"new zealand\"],\n  ...\n  [\"t8\", \"nick price\", \"zimbabwe\"]\n]\n\nSo for row where player is Frank Nobilo, country is new zealand.\n\nAnd a separate row where player is Nick Price, country is zimbabwe.\n\nTherefore, the cells to check are:\n- The \"player\" and \"country\" columns for each row.\nBut since it's a big table, but for this claim, we need to find if any other players besides Frank Nobilo (who isn't even from Zimbabwe) have country as zimbabwe.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all rows where country is zimbabwe. Only one such row exists: Nick Price.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the claim, the relevant information is that there's at least one player from Zimbabwe besides any others.\n\nBut since Frank Nobilo isn't even from Zimbabwe, and there's another player who is, that makes the claim false.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n- The claim says Frank is the only one from Zimbabwe.\n- In reality, Nick Price is also from Zimbabwe.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, we need to identify all players whose country is zimbabwe. Only Nick Price in row 11. And perhaps Frank's country to confirm he isn't from there.\n\nSo the cells to consider are:\n- The player and country columns for both Frank Nobilo (to see his country) and Nick Price.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe\" is false because:\n\n1. **Frank Nobilo's Country**: According to the table, Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand, not Zimbabwe.\n\n2. **Another Player from Zimbabwe**: There exists another player, Nick Price, who is listed as being from Zimbabwe.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect as there are at least two players from Zimbabwe: Frank Nobilo (incorrectly claimed) and Nick Price (actually from Zimbabwe).\n\n**Relevant Cells Checked:**\n- Frank Nobilo's row to confirm his country.\n- Rows where any other player's country is Zimbabwe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kenny perry earned 170000 more than mark brooks\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying that Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brooks. So, I need to find their respective earnings in the table and see if there's a difference of exactly 170k.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The \"money\" column seems to represent the earnings or the prize money each player received. So, I should focus on that column for both players mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, let's find Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry in the table. \n\nStarting with Mark Brooks: Scanning through the rows, I see a row where \"player\" is \"mark brooks\". That's the first data row, which is row index 0. His money is listed as 430,000.\n\nNext, looking for Kenny Perry. His name appears in another row, specifically row index 1. His money is 260,000 there.\n\nWait a second, so Mark Brooks earned 430k and Kenny Perry earned 260k. The difference between their earnings would be 430,000 - 260,000, which equals 170,000. That's exactly the amount stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because Kenny Perry did earn $170,000 less than Mark Brooks. Wait, no\u2014wait, the claim says Kenny earned more. Oh wait, no. Actually, 430k minus 260k is 170k, so Kenny earned less. So does that mean the claim is false? Because it's saying Kenny earned more.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake there. Let me double-check. The claim says \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\". If Mark earned 430k and Kenny earned 260k, then Kenny earned less, not more. So the difference is actually negative, meaning the claim is false.\n\nWait no, maybe I got it reversed. Let me clarify: if the claim is that Kenny earned $170k more, then we'd subtract Mark's earnings from Kenny's. But in this case, 260k (Kenny) minus 430k (Mark) is a negative number, meaning Kenny earned less, not more.\n\nSo the claim says Kenny earned more, but according to the table, he earned less. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check again. Let me look at their rows again to confirm.\n\nRow 0: Mark Brooks, money 430,000\nRow 1: Kenny Perry, money 260,000\n\nSo yes, Kenny earned less than Mark by $170k. Therefore, the claim that Kenny earned $170k more is incorrect because he actually earned $170k less.\n\nWait, but the problem might be about whether the claim is TRUE or not based on their earnings. So if the claim says Kenny earned 170k more, but he didn't, it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Kenny Perry did not earn $170,000 more than Mark Brooks; in fact, he earned less.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
