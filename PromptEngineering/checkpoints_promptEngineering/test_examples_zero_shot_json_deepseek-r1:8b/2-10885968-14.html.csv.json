    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89)\". \n\nFirst, I should check each row in the data section of the table to see if any match this claim. Looking at the columns provided, the relevant parts here are the home and away teams, their scores, and perhaps the venue.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has the home team as \"footscray\" with a score of 5.7 (37). The away team is \"hawthorn\" with 17.15 (117).\n2. Second row: home is \"fitzroy\" (17.17) vs \"geelong\" (13.18).\n3. Third row: home is \"essendon\" (13.15) against \"south melbourne\" (12.6).\n4. Fourth row: home team is \"st kilda\" with 10.12 vs \"north melbourne\" with 13.11.\n5. Fifth row: Richmond vs Collingwood, scores 23.13 and 7.14.\n6. Sixth row: Carlton vs Melbourne, scores 18.7 and 6.22.\n\nWait, the fourth row has north melbourne as the away team. Their score is 13.11 (89). The claim says \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89)\". So that matches exactly in terms of both the score format and the value.\n\nSo I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking at the table structure, each row has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nThe claim mentions the away team's score for north melbourne, so I should look for the away team column and their score in that row.\n\nIn the fourth data row (index 3), the away team is \"north melbourne\" with a score of 13.11 (89). So the columns involved are:\n\n- \"away team\"\n- \"away team score\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row_index 3, column_name \"away team\" and \"away team score\".\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows that might also have north melbourne as away. Looking back, only one row has them as the away team.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because the claim is supported by the data in those specific cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the data provided in the table's fourth row under the \"away team score\" column for north melbourne.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instruction about which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the score for the away team of north melbourne be 7.14 (56)\". So, we're looking for two things in the table: the name of the away team that is north melbourne and their score which should match 7.14 (56).\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with data across several columns. The columns relevant here are \"away team\" and \"away team score\". So I need to find rows where the \"away team\" is north melbourne.\n\nI'll go through each row of the data to see if any have \"north melbourne\" in the \"away team\" column. \n\n- Row 0: away team is hawthorn \u2013 not north melbourne.\n- Row 1: away team is geelong \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: away team is south melbourne \u2013 no.\n- Row 3: away team is north melbourne \u2013 yes, this is relevant. \n- Row 4: richmond is the home team, so the away team is collingwood \u2013 not north melbourne.\n- Row 5: carlton vs melbourne \u2013 away team is melbourne, which isn't north melbourne.\n\nSo only row 3 has north melbourne as the away team. Now I need to check if their score matches 7.14 (56).\n\nLooking at the \"away team score\" column in row 3: It's listed as \"13.11 (89)\". Hmm, that doesn't match 7.14 (56). So even though it's the correct away team, the score is different.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the rows. Let me double-check row 4 because the user might have confused home and away teams. In row 4, the home team is richmond with a score of 23.13 (151), and the away team is collingwood with 7.14 (56). So that's a different away team.\n\nSo in the table, north melbourne as an away team only appears once, but their score doesn't match the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no row where north melbourne's away score is 7.14 (56).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. In row 3, the home team is st kilda and the away team is north melbourne with a score of 13.11 (89). That doesn't match. The claim says 7.14 (56), which is from another game where collingwood was the away team against richmond.\n\nSo yes, the claim is definitely incorrect because north melbourne's away score in their actual game wasn't 7.14 (56). Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there is no row where the away team is north melbourne with a score of 7.14 (56).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
