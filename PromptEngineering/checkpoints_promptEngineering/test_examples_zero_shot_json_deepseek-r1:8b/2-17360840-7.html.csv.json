    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements here are:\n1. The opponent is \"buffalo sabres.\"\n2. The attendance for that specific game should be 10,750.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with various details such as date, opponent, location, attendance, etc. My task is to find the row where the opponent is \"buffalo sabres\" and check if the attendance matches 10,750.\n\nI'll start by examining each row's \"opponent\" column:\n\n- Row 0: washington capitals\n- Row 1: carolina hurricanes\n- Row 2: atlanta thrashers\n- Row 3: phoenix coyotes\n- Row 4: anaheim ducks\n- Row 5: los angeles kings\n- Row 6: san jose sharks\n- Row 7: philadelphia flyers\n- Row 8: florida panthers\n- Row 9: dallas stars\n- Row 10: buffalo sabres\n- Row 11: montreal canadiens\n- Row 12: carolina hurricanes\n- Row 13: philadelphia flyers\n- Row 14: anaheim ducks\n\nFrom this, I can see that \"buffalo sabres\" are the opponents in row index 10. Now, I'll check the attendance for that specific game.\n\nLooking at row 10:\n- attendance is listed as 15611.\n\nThe claim states that the attendance was 10,750. Since 15,611 doesn't equal 10,750, the claim is not supported by this data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
