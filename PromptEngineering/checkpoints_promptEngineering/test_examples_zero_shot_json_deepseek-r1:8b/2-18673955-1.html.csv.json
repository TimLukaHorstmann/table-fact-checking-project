    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find any games played on October 30, 1977. Looking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 1: September 19\n- Row 2: September 25\n- ...\n- Row 6: October 23\n- Row 7: October 30\n\nSo, the game on October 30 is row 7.\n\nNext, I need to check the week number for that game. The 'week' column shows 7 for that row. \n\nThe claim says there's no game listed after week 7 on that date. But wait, if the week is exactly 7, does that mean it's not greater than 7? The wording in the claim is a bit unclear\u2014whether \"greater than week 7\" includes week 7 itself or not.\n\nLooking at the data, the week for October 30 is 7, which isn't greater than 7. So there are no games on that date beyond week 7. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we locate the game on October 30, 1977, which is in row 7 and has a week number of 7. Since 7 is not greater than 7, there are no games listed beyond that week on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
