    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"Charles Aden Black died on August 4, 2005 (aged 86), 10 years older than Arthur Sheekman who died at 76.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided to find information about both Charles Aden Black and Arthur Sheekman.\n\nLooking for Charles Aden Black, I see his entry in row 34. It says he died on August 4, 2005 (aged 86). The claim states that he was 10 years older than Arthur Sheekman when he died. So, I need to check Arthur Sheekman's age at death.\n\nArthur Sheekman is in row 35. His death date is January 12, 1978 (aged 76). Wait, if Charles died in 2005 and Arthur in 1978, that would make a difference of 27 years, not 10 years. That doesn't match the claim. So, the claim seems incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says Charles was 10 years older than Arthur when he died. But if Arthur died at 76 and Charles at 86, that's actually a difference of 10 years between their ages, not their death dates. Because 76 + 10 = 86. So, perhaps the wording is about their ages, not the time between their deaths.\n\nSo, I need to check both their ages at death. Charles was 86 when he died in 2005, and Arthur was 76 when he died in 1978. The age difference is indeed 10 years (86 - 76 = 10). So, the claim's statement about the age difference is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original instruction says to check if Charles was 10 years older than Arthur who died at 76. Looking back at the table, Arthur Sheekman died in 1978 at 76, and Charles Aden Black died in 2005 at 86, which is exactly 10 years more. So, the claim is true regarding their ages.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the ages are correctly noted in the table. Let me confirm each row:\n\nRow 34: Charles Aden Black - August 4, 2005 (aged 86)\nRow 35: Arthur Sheekman - January 12, 1978 (aged 76)\n\nYes, so their ages at death match the claim's statement about the age difference. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Age\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Age\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau all die in the year 2003\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying each of the individuals mentioned in the claim: Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau. I need to check their respective rows in the table to find out when they died.\n\nStarting with Jill Ireland: I'll scan through the table looking for \"Jill Ireland.\" Upon checking row 0, I don't see her name listed under any of the columns like Death Year or anything else. So, it seems that Jill Ireland isn't present in the table. This could mean a few things\u2014maybe she wasn't involved in any of these celebrity deaths, or perhaps there's an error in the data provided. Either way, since she's not listed, I can note that her death year isn't available here.\n\nNext up is Judy Garland: I'll look through each row to find her name. Scanning down, in row 10, I see \"Judy Garland\" under the Death Year column with the value 1966. That means Judy Garland died in 1966, not 2003. This already contradicts the claim, but I should continue checking the other names just to be thorough.\n\nNow, Walter Matthau: Looking through the rows again, in row 7, I see \"Walter Matthau\" with a death year of 1991. So he passed away in 1991 as well. That's another point against the claim since he didn't die in 2003 either.\n\nSo, based on this analysis:\n- Jill Ireland isn't listed at all.\n- Judy Garland died in 1966.\n- Walter Matthau died in 1991.\n\nNone of them died in 2003. Therefore, the claim is not accurate. The relevant information to support this conclusion would be their respective death years and whether Jill Ireland is even present in the data or not.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Death Year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Death Year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Pilar Wayne and John Wayne have 2 daughters and 1 son, and so do Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's stating that both Pilar Wayne & John Wayne and Gena Rowlands & John Cassavetes have two daughters and one son. So, I should check each person's family details in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start with Pilar Wayne. Scanning through the rows, I find her entry at row 35. Her husband is John Wayne, so I need to look at their children. According to the table, they have two daughters: Aissa and Marisa, and one son named John. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes. She's listed in row 48. Their entry shows she has two daughters: Alexandra and Zoe, and one son, Nick. That also matches the claim of having two daughters and one son.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the claim that John Wayne and Gilda Radner both died of cancer is true based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"John Wayne and Gilda Radner both die of cancer, stomach cancer for John and ovarian cancer for Gilda.\" So, I need to verify two main points: that John Wayne died from stomach cancer and that Gilda Radner died from ovarian cancer. If both are accurate based on the table, then the claim is true.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to find entries for John Wayne and Gilda Radner.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first entry (row 0) is Pilar Wayne, not relevant.\n- Row 1: Robert Wagner, nope.\n- Row 2: Roman Polanski, not relevant.\n- Row 3: Dana Reeve, nope.\n- Continuing down... Wait, maybe I should go directly to the relevant rows.\n\nWait, let me list out all the rows where John Wayne or Gilda Radner appear.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 5: Trish Van Devere - not relevant.\n- Row 13: Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate - not relevant.\n- Row 15: Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood - nope.\n- Row 20: Pilar Wayne and John Wayne. Ah, here we go.\n\nIn row 20 (index 20), the names are Pilar Wayne and John Wayne. The causes of death: stomach cancer for John. So that supports the first part of the claim about John Wayne dying from stomach cancer.\n\nNow, looking for Gilda Radner. She is mentioned in row 24 (index 24): Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner. The cause is ovarian cancer, which matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both parts are confirmed by the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to check if all details match exactly. Let me confirm:\n\n- John Wayne: died of stomach cancer.\n- Gilda Radner: died of ovarian cancer.\n\nYes, that's what the table shows. So the relevant cells are the ones in row 20 and row 24 for their respective causes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as both John Wayne and Gilda Radner passed away due to cancer, specifically stomach cancer and ovarian cancer respectively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"cause_of_death\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"cause_of_death\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true based on the data given in the table. The claim says that the longest length of marriage is 71 years, specifically between Mona Graham and Karl Malden.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are \"longest length of marriage\" being 71 years and that this applies to Mona Graham's marriage to Karl Malden.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person with various details like their name, spouse (if applicable), number of children, etc. So I should probably look for Mona Graham's entry first because she's mentioned in the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find Mona Graham. Once I locate her row, I can check the relevant columns. The important columns here are likely \"Spouse\" and perhaps \"Years of Marriage,\" but since that column isn't explicitly listed, maybe it's inferred from other data or perhaps it's not directly provided.\n\nWait, the columns in the table include Name, Spouse, Children, etc. So for Mona Graham, her spouse is Karl Malden. Now, I need to see if their marriage lasted 71 years. Since there's no explicit \"Years of Marriage\" column, maybe that information isn't directly available. Alternatively, perhaps it's implied or can be calculated based on birth years, but that might not be feasible here.\n\nBut wait, the instruction mentions checking each condition against the table. The first condition is the longest length of marriage being 71 years. So I need to confirm if any other marriages in the table exceed 71 years, which would mean Mona Graham's isn't the longest. If no one has a longer marriage than 71 years, then perhaps it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't have enough data for some people, like birth years, so we can't calculate the exact duration. That could complicate things because without knowing when they got married and when they died, we can't determine how long their marriage was.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"71 year,\" which is a whole number. Maybe it's an approximation or based on some other data. Since I'm supposed to check against the table, perhaps I need to look for any row where the spouse's marriage duration is 71 years. But since the table doesn't provide that information, maybe the claim is false because there's no way to confirm from the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes a \"Years of Marriage\" column, but looking back, I don't see that in the columns listed. So without knowing how long Mona Graham was married, it's impossible to verify if it was 71 years.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says the longest is 71 years between Mona and Karl. But since the table doesn't provide the actual duration, maybe there's no way to confirm, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table does have a \"Years of Marriage\" column that I missed. Let me check again. No, the columns are Name, Spouse, Children, etc., so without knowing their exact years together, I can't verify the 71-year figure.\n\nTherefore, since the necessary information to confirm the claim isn't present in the table, the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Spouse\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Children\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau all die before the year 2000.\" So I'll go through each person one by one.\n\nStarting with Jill Ireland. Looking at the table, I have to search for her name. Scanning down, I see that Jill Ireland is not listed in any of the rows provided. Since she's not there, I can't confirm whether she died before 2000 or not. This might mean that the claim isn't fully supported by the given data.\n\nNext, Judy Garland. Checking the table again, Judy Garland is also missing. There's no row with her name, so similar to Jill Ireland, I don't have information about her death date from the table.\n\nNow, Walter Matthau. Looking through the rows, I find that Walter Matthau is in row 23 (if we start counting from 0). In his row, it says \"Walter Matthau\" and under the \"Deaths\" column, it mentions \"May 20, 1989\" at age 42. Since 1989 is before 2000, he did die before that year.\n\nSo, out of the three people in the claim, only Walter Matthau's death date is provided and it's before 2000. However, since Jill Ireland and Judy Garland aren't in the table, their deaths can't be verified.

Let me start by identifying who each pair refers to.\n\n1. **John Wayne and Pilar Wayne**: Looking through the table, I see that there's a row for Pilar Wayne (Row 33) and John Wayne (Row 36). So these are the two people in question.\n\n2. **Gene Rowlands and John Cassavetes**: Gene Rowlands is at Row 40, and John Cassavetes is at Row 41. They're another pair.\n\nNext, I'll need to look at the 'Children' column for each of these individuals to see how many children they have.\n\n- For John Wayne (Row 36), under 'Children', it says \"none\". So he doesn't have any children.\n- Pilar Wayne (Row 33) also has \"none\" in the 'Children' column, so she doesn't have any either. That means together, they have no children.\n\nNow, checking Gene Rowlands (Row 40): It mentions that she and John Cassavetes have three children.

Let me go through each row.\n\nLooking at row 25, it says Gloria Stuart's spouse is Arthur Sheekman, and she died in 2010 from Alzheimer's. So that's where Arthur Sheekman is mentioned. Now, looking at his death details: August 4, 2005, but I don't see the age there.\n\nNext, I need to find Charles Alden Black. His entry is row 30. Shirley Temple's spouse is Charles Alden Black, and he died on August 4, 2005 as well, from bone marrow disease. Again, his death date matches August 4, 2005.\n\nWait, but the claim says they both die at the same age. So I need to check their ages at death. Looking back, Arthur Sheekman's row (row 25) doesn't specify his age when he died. On the other hand, Charles Alden Black's row (row 30) mentions August 4, 2005, but again, no age is provided.\n\nHmm, so if both died on the same date, August 4, 2005, but without their ages at death being specified in the table, I can't confirm they were the same age. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's insufficient data to verify their ages.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Arthur Sheekman is mentioned in row 25 as Gloria Stuart's spouse who died on January 12, 1978 from Alzheimer's, but that's different from August 4, 2005. Wait no, the claim says they both died on August 4, 2005. So maybe I'm confusing rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, row 25 is Gloria Stuart, not Arthur Sheekman. The correct row for Arthur Sheekman would be where he's a spouse or individual. Let me look through each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 30: Gloria Stuart died in 2010 from Alzheimer's. Her spouse was Arthur Sheekman who died on January 12, 1978. Wait, that doesn't match August 4, 2005.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up rows. Let me go row by row:\n\nRow 25: Gloria Stuart (died in 2010) married to Arthur Sheekman, who died in 1978. So that can't be the ones dying in 2005.\n\nRow 30: Shirley Temple's spouse is Charles Alden Black, who died on August 4, 2005 from bone marrow disease. So he died in 2005.\n\nWait, but Arthur Sheekman isn't mentioned as dying in 2005. Maybe I need to look elsewhere. Let me check the rows again.\n\nLooking at row 33: Trish Van Devere's spouse is George C. Scott, who died in 1999. Not relevant.\n\nRow 34: Robert Wagner's wife was Natalie Wood, but that's not Arthur Sheekman or Charles Alden Black.\n\nRow 35: Pilar Wayne's husband John Wayne died in 1979. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check each individual:\n\n- Arthur Sheekman is mentioned as Gloria Stuart's spouse (row 30), who died on January 12, 1978 at age 76 from Alzheimer's.\n\n- Charles Alden Black is Shirley Temple's spouse (row 28), who also died on August 4, 2005 at age 86 from bone marrow disease.\n\nWait, but the claim says both Arthur Sheekman and Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005. But according to the table, Arthur Sheekman died in 1978, not 2005. So the claim is incorrect because they didn't die at the same time or same age.\n\nWait no, I'm getting confused. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at row 28: Shirley Temple's spouse was Charles Alden Black, who died on August 4, 2005 (age 86). That's correct.\n\nLooking for Arthur Sheekman: He is mentioned in row 30 as the spouse of Gloria Stuart, who died on January 12, 1978. So he died in 1978 at age 76.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both Arthur Sheekman and Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005 is false because only Charles Alden Black died then, not Arthur Sheekman.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Arthur Sheekman and Charles Alden Black both die on August 4, 2005. However, according to the table:\n\n- Arthur Sheekman died in 1978.\n- Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005.\n\nThus, only one person died on that date, making the claim incorrect.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify Arthur Sheekman: He is mentioned as the spouse of Gloria Stuart (row 30), who died in 1978.\n2. Identify Charles Alden Black: He is Shirley Temple's spouse (row 28), dying on August 4, 2005.\n3. Compare death dates: Only Charles Alden Black dies on August 4, 2005; Arthur Sheekman did not.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false because only Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005, while Arthur Sheekman passed away earlier in 1978.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"neither john wayne or gilda radner die of any kind of cancer\" is true based on the table provided. Let me start by looking at the table and understanding what information it has.\n\nFirst, I'll search for John Wayne in the table. Scanning through each row's 'Name' column... there's a \"pilar wayne\" and \"john wayne\". Wait, so John Wayne is listed as one of the names, but the row index might be important here. Let me check: the last few rows have entries like Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood, Pilar Wayne, John Wayne, Gene Wilder, Gilda Radner. So John Wayne is in the 25th row (counting from 0, it's row index 33). \n\nNow, looking at his death details: he died on November 29, 1981. The cause of death was accidental drowning, and he remarried after that. There's no mention of cancer as a cause of death for John Wayne. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check Gilda Radner. Looking through the 'Name' column again... there's Gene Wilder listed with Gilda Radner. Wait, so Gilda Radner is in row 34. Let me check her details: she died on May 20, 1989 from ovarian cancer, and she remarried in 1991. So yes, Gilda Radner did die of cancer.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"neither John Wayne nor Gilda Radner die of any kind of cancer.\" But according to the table, Gilda Radner did die of cancer (ovarian cancer), while John Wayne didn't. So the claim is saying neither died of cancer, which would be false because Gilda Radner did.\n\nBut let me double-check the exact wording of the claim. It says \"neither... or...\", so if either one dies of cancer, the claim is false. Since Gilda Radner did, the claim is false.\n\nWait, no, wait: the claim is asserting that neither died of any kind of cancer. So if even one of them didn't die of cancer, but the other did, then the claim is still incorrect because Gilda Radner did. So regardless of John Wayne not having cancer, since Gilda Radner did, the overall statement is false.\n\nSo I need to find which cells are relevant for this verification. For John Wayne, his row is 33 and the columns would be 'Name', 'Death Date', 'Cause of Death', 'Marital Status After Death'. Because we're interested in whether he died of cancer or not.\n\nFor Gilda Radner, she's in row 34 with similar columns: 'Name' (to confirm it's her), 'Death Date', 'Cause of Death' (which is ovarian cancer), and 'Marital Status After Death'.\n\nWait, but the table might list \"gene wilder\" as the person who married Gilda Radner. So I should verify Gilda Radner's cause of death specifically.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- For John Wayne: row 33, columns Name, Death Date, Cause of Death, Marital Status After Death.\n- For Gilda Radner: row 34, columns Name, Death Date, Cause of Death, Marital Status After Death.\n\nWait, but the claim is about both not dying of cancer. So for John Wayne, checking his cause of death would confirm he didn't have cancer. For Gilda Radner, checking her cause confirms she did, which makes the claim false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are these two people's rows in their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Gilda Radner died of ovarian cancer, while John Wayne did not die of any kind of cancer. The relevant cells include details about both individuals' causes of death.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Death Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Cause of Death\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Marital Status After Death\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Death Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Cause of Death\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Marital Status After Death\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim that Mona Graham and Karl Malden have one of the shortest marriages at just 71 years is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that their marriage was very short, specifically only 71 years. So, I need to find out how long they were married.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person and their spouse or partner. The columns relevant here would be \"Spouse\" and \"Years Married.\" But wait, actually, the columns might vary depending on how the data is structured. Let me check the table structure again.\n\nWait, the user provided a JSON object with an array of people, each having details like Name, Spouse, Years Married, etc. So, for Mona Graham, I need to find her row and then look at the years she was married to Karl Malden.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the list of names to find Mona Graham. Here's her entry:\n\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Mona Graham\",\n  \"Spouse\": \"Karl Malden\",\n  \"Years Married\": \"71\",\n  \"Children\": \"2\",\n  \"Alive\": false\n}\n\nSo, from this, it looks like their marriage lasted exactly 71 years. The claim says they have one of the shortest marriages at just 71 years. That seems to align with what's in the table.\n\nNow, to be thorough, I should check if there are any other relevant data points that might affect this conclusion. For example, checking if there are any couples in the table who were married for a shorter time than 71 years. Let me quickly scan through some of the other entries:\n\nLooking at Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood: They were married for 5 years first time and then 9 years second time, so total of about 14-18 years depending on interpretation.\n\nCatherine Scorsese and Charles Scorsese: Married for 60 years.\n\nGloria Stuart and Arthur Sheekman: Married for 44 years.\n\nJames Stewart and Gloria Mclean: 45 years.\n\nAlma Reville and Alfred Hitchcock: 54 years.\n\nGene Wilder and Gilda Radner: 5 years.\n\nDana Reeve and Christopher Reeve: 12 years.\n\nTrish Van Devere and George C. Scott: 27 years.\n\nPilar Wayne and John Wayne: 25 years.\n\nShirley Temple: Married for 55 years.\n\nLooking at these, the shortest marriage seems to be Dana Reeve and Christopher Reeve with 12 years, but wait, no\u2014wait, Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner were only married for 5 years. So that's shorter than 71. But Mona Graham and Karl Malden have 71, which is longer than these.\n\nWait, hold on. The claim says \"one of the shortest.\" If there are others with shorter marriages, then maybe the claim isn't fully accurate. For instance, Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner had a 5-year marriage, which is shorter than 71. So does that make Mona Graham's marriage not one of the shortest?\n\nWait, but the claim says \"one of the shortest,\" implying it's among the very shortest, perhaps the shortest. But if there are others with even shorter marriages, then the claim might be incorrect.\n\nBut looking back at the table, is 71 indeed the shortest? Let me check all entries again.\n\n- Mona Graham: 71 years.\n- Gene Wilder: 5 years.\n- Robert Wagner: 5 and 9 years (so first time 5).\n- Dana Reeve: 12 years.\n- Trish Van Devere: 27 years.\n- James Stewart: 45 years.\n- Pilar Wayne: 25 years.\n- Catherine Scorsese: 60 years.\n- Gl\u00f3ria Stuart: 44 years.\n- Alma Reville: 54 years.\n- Gena Rowlands: 35 years.\n- Roman Polanski: 1 year, but that's fetal death, not a marriage after birth.\n- Ryan O'Neal: 18 and 8 years (so first time 18).\n- John Cassavetes: Not sure, but his spouse is Gena Rowlands who was married for 35 years.\nWait, perhaps I need to check the exact wording. The claim is about Mona Graham and Karl Malden having one of the shortest marriages at just 71 years.\n\nBut looking at Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner, their marriage lasted only 5 years, which is shorter than 71. So if that's the case, then Mona's 71 years isn't the shortest; someone else has a shorter marriage.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be false because there exists a couple with an even shorter marriage.\n\nBut wait, in the table, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate were married for only about a year before her death. However, since Sharon was pregnant at the time of their marriage and died shortly after, it's not clear if that counts as a full year or just a few months. The table lists \"Years Married\" as \"1,\" so perhaps that's considered one year.\n\nSo Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate: 1 year.\n\nThat would make their marriage even shorter than Gene Wilder's 5 years. Therefore, Mona Graham and Karl Malden at 71 years would not be among the shortest marriages; there are couples with less than 71 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there are other marriages that were shorter.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Mona Graham and Karl Malden have one of the shortest marriages at just 71 years is inaccurate. While their marriage indeed lasted 71 years, there are other couples in the table who were married for even shorter durations. Notably, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate were married for approximately one year, which is shorter than 71 years. Additionally, Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner's five-year marriage also falls below 71 years. Therefore, the claim does not hold as Mona Graham's marriage is not among the shortest documented in the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect. Mona Graham and Karl Malden's marriage was not one of the shortest; other couples had shorter marriages.",
