    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It specifies a year (1986), two columns (\"us dance\" and \"us r&b\"), and their respective values (6 for us dance and 9 for us r&b).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's an entry in 1986 where \"us dance\" is 6 when \"us r&b\" is 9. Let me go through each row of the data for 1986.\n\nThe first data row for 1986 has values:\n- year: 1986\n- title: \"under the influence\"\n- us: 56\n- us r&b: 9\n- us dance: 6\n\nThis seems relevant because in 1986, \"us dance\" is 6 and \"us r&b\" is 9. So this row directly matches the claim's conditions.\n\nThe second data row for 1986:\n- year: 1986\n- title: \"animals\"\n- us: -\n- us r&b: -\n- us dance: -\n\nHere, both \"us\", \"us r&b\", and \"us dance\" have \"-\", which likely indicates missing data. So this row isn't relevant because it doesn't meet the criteria for either value.\n\nSince there's at least one row in 1986 that satisfies the conditions of the claim (the first row), the claim is TRUE. I should also note which specific cells are relevant. The \"row_index\" for this matching row is 2 (since rows start at 0). Therefore, the relevant_cells include the row index and column names for both columns in question.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is TRUE with the relevant cells pointing to row 2 for both \"us dance\" and \"us r&b\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\". So, the user is making a statement about a specific data point in the table related to \"Under The Influence,\" which should be 56 in the US charts for both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- Columns: year, title, us, us r&b, us dance\n- Data rows: Each row has the year, song title, US chart position, US R&B chart position, and US Dance chart position.\n\nNow, I need to locate \"Under The Influence\" in the table. Scanning through the titles, I see:\n\n1. 1984 - pretty mess\n2. 1985 - mechanical emotion\n3. 1986 - under the influence (row index 2)\n4. 1986 - animals\n5. 1988 - undress\n\nSo, \"Under The Influence\" is in row index 2 of the data array, specifically at year 1986.\n\nNow, checking the US chart position for that song: according to the table, it's 56.\n\nThe claim mentions this specific value: 56 in the US charts for both 1985 and 1986. Wait a minute, that seems off because \"Under The Influence\" is from 1986, not 1985.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 0: 1984 - pretty mess\n- Row 1: 1985 - mechanical emotion (US position 107)\n- Row 2: 1986 - under the influence (US position 56)\n- Row 3: 1986 - animals (no US data)\n- Row 4: 1988 - undress (no US data)\n\nSo, the song \"Under The Influence\" is only listed for 1986 with a US position of 56. There's no entry in 1985 for this song. Therefore, claiming that there was a chart position at 56 in the US both in 1985 and 1986 is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The claim says \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\" So it's implying that for both years, there was a position of 56. But looking at the table, \"Under The Influence\" is only present in 1986 with 56. There's no such entry for 1985.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because \"Under The Influence\" didn't chart in 1985. It was only in 1986. So the data doesn't support the claim for both years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Under The Influence\" reached number 56 on the US charts in both 1985 and 1986, which isn't supported by the table. The song is only listed for 1986, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
