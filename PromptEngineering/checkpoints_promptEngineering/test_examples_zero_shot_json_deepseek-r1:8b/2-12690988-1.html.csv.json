    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"on september 10 , 2013 , the result be 3 - 2\". So I'm looking for a match where the date is September 10, 2013, and the result is exactly \"3 - 2\".\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are goal, date, score, result, and competition. Each row represents a different event.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: The date is \"24 march 2007\", which doesn't match September 10, 2013. So this row can be ignored.\n2. Second row: Date is \"3 march 2010\". Also not matching the claim's date. So skip this.\n3. Third row: Date is \"9 july 2011\". Not September 2013. Moving on.\n4. Fourth row: Date is \"22 may 2013\". That's May, so it doesn't match September. Next.\n5. Fifth row: The date here is \"10 september 2013\", which matches the claim's date.\n\nNow, looking at this fifth row, let's check the result column. It says \"3 - 2\". Wait, but in the score column for this row, it's also \"3 - 2\". So both score and result are \"3 - 2\".\n\nWait a minute, the claim is about the result being \"3 - 2\", so that matches with this fifth row. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data point.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other rows that might match. Since all other dates don't match September 10, 2013, only the fifth row is relevant. So the relevant columns here are both \"score\" and \"result\".\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we check each row for a match in date and result.\n\nThe claim specifies September 10, 2013, and a result of \"3 - 2\". The fifth row matches both criteria, supporting the claim.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:** Both score and result columns of the fifth row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "goal for friendly competition be less than 3",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in friendly competitions, the goal (which I assume refers to the score) should be less than 3. So, for each game listed in the table where the competition is \"friendly,\" I need to check if the goal (score) was less than 3.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. The data has five rows, each representing a different match.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Goal: 1\n- Date: \"24 march 2007\"\n- Score: \"3 - 1\" (so the goals are 3 and 1)\n- Result: \"3 - 1\"\n- Competition: \"friendly\"\n\nSince the competition is friendly, I check the goal. The score was 3-1, which means the total goals scored by both teams were 4 (3 + 1). But wait, does the claim refer to each team's goal or the total? The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says \"goal for friendly,\" so it might mean the goal (as in one team's score) or the total goals. I think in football/soccer terms, when they say the score is 3-1, the goal here refers to the first part, which would be 3 goals. But maybe the claim is about each team scoring less than 3? Or perhaps it's about the total goals.\n\nWait, but looking at the claim again: \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3.\" So maybe it's referring to the total number of goals in the match being less than 3. Let me check that.\n\nIn row 0, the score is 3-1, so total goals are 4 (3 + 1), which is more than 3. So this doesn't satisfy the claim if we're talking about total goals.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's referring to each team scoring less than 3. The first team scored 3, which is not less than 3. So regardless of interpretation, row 0 doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 1:\n- Goal: 2\n- Date: \"3 march 2010\"\n- Score: \"1 - 2\" (so total goals are 3)\n- Result: \"1 - 2\"\n- Competition: \"friendly\"\n\nAgain, competition is friendly. If considering total goals, it's 3, which is not less than 3. So doesn't satisfy.\n\nRow 2:\n- Goal: 3\n- Date: \"9 july 2011\"\n- Score: \"1 - 0\" (total goals 1)\n- Result: \"1 - 0\"\n- Competition: \"2011 copa am\u00e9rica\"\n\nCompetition is Copa Am\u00e9rica, not friendly. So this row doesn't apply.\n\nRow 3:\n- Goal: 4\n- Date: \"22 may 2013\"\n- Score: \"1 - 1\" (total goals 2)\n- Result: \"2 - 1\"\n- Competition: \"friendly\"\n\nCompetition is friendly. Total goals are 2, which is less than 3. So this row supports the claim.\n\nRow 4:\n- Goal: 5\n- Date: \"10 september 2013\"\n- Score: \"2 - 1\" (total goals 3)\n- Result: \"3 - 2\"\n- Competition: \"2014 world cup qualifier\"\n\nCompetition is a World Cup qualifier, not friendly. So doesn't apply.\n\nSo in the data, only row 3's competition is friendly and the total goals are less than 3. Therefore, there's at least one instance where this is true. But wait, does the claim require that all friendly competitions have goals less than 3? Or just that in some friendly competitions, it's the case?\n\nThe claim says \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3.\" It doesn't specify whether it's universally or existentially quantified. Since the instruction is to check if the claim is TRUE based on the table, I think we need to see if there exists at least one friendly match in the table where the goal (total) is less than 3.\n\nIn row 3, that's true. So the claim is TRUE because there is a case where it holds. But wait, actually, let me double-check. The claim is phrased as \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3.\" Maybe it's implying that all friendly competitions have this, or just some.\n\nLooking back at the instructions: it says to check if fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise FALSE. So if there exists a row where the condition holds, then it's TRUE because the claim isn't claiming it's always true, but perhaps that in friendly matches, sometimes goals are less than 3. Or maybe the claim is more about each friendly match having goals less than 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the claim again: \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3.\" It could be interpreted as in friendly competitions, the goal (score) is less than 3. So if any of those have it, then it's TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it refers to each game in a friendly competition having goals less than 3 by both teams. But I think more likely, it's about the total goals per match being less than 3.\n\nIn row 3, total goals are 2 < 3, so it satisfies. Therefore, since there is at least one friendly match where the goal (total) is less than 3, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but in the first row, the score was 3-1, which is 4 total goals. So that's not less than 3. The second row had 1-2, total goals 3, so equal to 3, not less than. Third row was 1-0, but it's Copa Am\u00e9rica. Fourth row: friendly with 1-1 (total goals 2). So yes, row 4 is the only one that meets the condition.\n\nTherefore, since there exists at least one friendly match where the total goal is less than 3, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in friendly competitions, the goal (interpreted as total goals scored in the match) should be less than 3. By examining each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Friendly competition, score 3-1 (total 4 goals), does not satisfy.\n- **Row 1**: Friendly competition, score 1-2 (total 3 goals), does not satisfy.\n- **Row 2**: Not a friendly competition.\n- **Row 3**: Friendly competition, score 1-1 (total 2 goals), satisfies the condition.\n- **Row 4**: Not a friendly competition.\n\nSince there is at least one instance where the total goal in a friendly competition is less than 3, the claim holds TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's saying that whenever a goal is larger than 4 (I assume this refers to the 'score' column), the result will be 3-1.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: goal, date, score, result, competition. The data has five rows, each representing a match with these details.\n\nSo I need to check for any row where the 'goal' is greater than 4 and see if the corresponding 'result' is \"3 - 1\". \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: goal=1, score=\"3 - 1\", result=\"3 - 1\". Here, goal is 1 which is not larger than 4. So this doesn't apply.\n\nRow 1: goal=2, score=\"1 - 2\", result=\"1 - 2\". Goal is 2, again less than 4. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: goal=3, score=\"1 - 0\", result=\"1 - 0\". Goal is 3 <4. Doesn't apply.\n\nRow 3: goal=4, score=\"1 - 1\", result=\"2 - 1\". Goal is exactly 4. The claim says 'larger than 4', so this isn't applicable either.\n\nRow 4: goal=5, score=\"2 - 1\", result=\"3 - 2\". Here, the goal is 5 which is larger than 4. What's the result? It's \"3 - 2\". So it's not equal to \"3 - 1\".\n\nSo in this table, there are no rows where the goal is greater than 4 and the result is \"3 - 1\". The claim would require that whenever a goal is larger than 4, the result must be 3-1. But since none of those exist, the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. And for relevant cells, we need to list all rows where the 'goal' is >4 and check their results. In this case, only row 4 meets that condition, so it's the only relevant cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when a goal is larger than 4, the result should be \"3 - 1\". However, in the provided table, there are no such instances where the goal exceeds 4 with the result being \"3 - 1\".\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The claim refers to 'goal' and 'result'. These correspond to columns in the table.\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Goal >4:** \n   - Only row 4 has a goal of 5, which is greater than 4.\n   \n3. **Evaluate Result for Goal >4:**\n   - In row 4, the result is \"3 - 2\", not \"3 - 1\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since no instance supports the claim, it's deemed FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:** Only row 4 where goal is 5 needs to be checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
