The claim is about a specific match in round r6 replay where the home/away status was h (home), and the result was 1-0.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see what each one represents. The columns are: round, kick off, opponents, h / a, result, attendance, and report.\n\nThe claim mentions \"round r6 replay\" with \"h / a\" as home and the result being 1-0. So I need to find the row that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at each row in the data:\n\nRow 0: round r3, so not r6.\nRow 1: round r3 replay, still not r6.\nRow 2: round r4, nope.\nRow 3: round r4 replay, not it.\nRow 4: round r5, moving on.\nRow 5: round r6. This is the one we're interested in. But wait, row 5 has \"h / a\" as 'a' (away). The claim says h / a is h, so this isn't matching.\nRow 6: round r6 replay. Now, checking the \"h / a\" column here. It says 'h', which matches. The result is \"1 - 0\", which also matches.\n\nSo the relevant row is row index 6. The columns to check are \"round\", \"h / a\", and \"result\".\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer. The answer should be \"TRUE\" because all aspects of the claim are satisfied in this row. The relevant cells are the ones at row 6 for round, h/a, and result.\n\nWait, but looking back, the columns might not have 'round' as a string; maybe it's better to use the column names as they are. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row index 6, check \"h / a\" and \"result\".\n\nSo in the JSON, I need to list each cell that is relevant. Therefore, the relevant_cells will include the row index (6) and column name for each of those three columns: \"round\", \"h / a\", and \"result\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"h / a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Opponents are Norwich City, away (a), result is 0-0.\n- Fourth row: r4 replay, Jan 31, 1990. So the main r4 was on Jan 28.\n\nWait, so the main round r4 kick off was on January 28, not 29th.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"1990 - 01 - 28 be the kickoff date for the round of r4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that January 28th, 1990, was the kick-off date for Round 4 (r4). I'll need to check if there's a match in the table where r4 occurred on that date with Swansea City as the opponent or Norwich City? Wait, looking at the data, the third row is r3 and the fourth is r3 replay. Then r4 is the fifth row.\n\nWait, let me look at the table again. The columns are round, kick off, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, report. The rows have data for each match. So, I need to find a row where the round is r4 and the kick off date matches 1990-01-28.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Row 0: r3, 1990-01-06, Swansea City, a, 0-0, 16098, mr\n- Row 1: r3 replay, 1990-01-09, Swansea City, h, 8-0, 29194, mr\n- Row 2: r4, 1990-01-28, Norwich City, a, 0-0, 23152, mr\n- Row 3: r4 replay, 1990-01-31, Norwich City, h, 3-1, 29339, mr\n- Row 4: r5, 1990-02-17, Southampton, h, 3-0, 35961, mr\n- And so on.\n\nSo, row index 2 is for r4 with the kick off date of 1990-01-28. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nWait, but the opponents in that row are Norwich City, not Swansea City. The claim doesn't specify who the opponent was, just the date and round. So as long as it's r4 on that date, regardless of the opponent, the claim is true?\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the round of r4\", so perhaps it's about the existence of a match in r4 on that date, regardless of the opponent. Since there is indeed an r4 match on 1990-01-28, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row index for this data is 2 (since it's zero-indexed). The columns involved are \"round\" and \"kick off\". So the cells at row_index=2, column_name=\"round\" and \"kick off\".\n\nWait, in the table, each row has all seven columns. So for row 2, the round is r4, kick off is 1990-01-28. So both these columns are relevant to verify the claim.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include both: {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"round\"} and {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"kick off\"}\n\nThat makes sense because those two pieces of data directly support the claim that r4 had a kick off on 1990-01-28.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the 1990 - 01 - 28 kick off date have a round value of r4.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key parts are:\n1. \"1990 - 01 - 28\" \u2013 this is a specific date.\n2. \"kick off date\" \u2013 refers to when a match was scheduled.\n3. \"have a round value of r4\" \u2013 implies that for that particular date, the 'round' column has the value 'r4.'\n\nSo I need to look into the table and check if there's an entry where the date is \"1990 - 01 - 28\" and the 'round' value is 'r4'.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: round, kick off, opponents, h / a, result, attendance, report.\n- The data rows have various entries for each column.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match the date \"1990 - 01 - 28.\"\n\nStarting with row 2 (since row indices start at 0):\n- Row 2: kick off is \"1990 - 01 - 06\", which doesn't match.\n- Next, row 3: kick off is \"1990 - 01 - 09\" \u2013 nope.\n- Then row 4: \"1990 - 01 - 28\". Oh, this matches the date in the claim.\n\nSo now, for row 4 (which is index 2 if we start counting from 0?), wait no. Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, the data array has 8 elements, so rows are from 0 to 7. So row 3 is \"1990 - 01 - 28\"? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n- Row 0: r3, date \"1990 - 01 - 06\"\n- Row 1: r3 replay, date \"1990 - 01 - 09\"\n- Row 2: r4, date \"1990 - 01 - 28\"\nYes, so row index is 2 for that particular entry.\n\nNow, in this row, what's the value of the 'round' column? The first element in each row is the 'round' value. So for row 2 (index 2), it's \"r4\".\n\nSo yes, for the date \"1990 - 01 - 28\", the round value is indeed r4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the specific cell where the date matches and the 'round' column.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n- The 'kick off' column has the date.\n- The 'round' column has the value.\n\nSo in row 2 (index 2), the 'kick off' is \"1990 - 01 - 28\" and the 'round' is \"r4\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row_index 2 for both 'kick off' and 'round'.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions the kick off date having a round value of r4. So I think it's two separate cells: one where the kick off date is that specific date and another where the round is r4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the cell in the 'round' column for that row is relevant because it directly shows the value.\n\nBut the claim connects both: the 1990-01-28 kick off has a round of r4. So I think we need to look at the 'kick off' date and the 'round' value for that particular entry.\n\nSo, two cells: one under 'kick off' for that row (row index 2) and the other under 'round' in the same row.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about the kick off date having a round of r4. So it's saying that when you look at the kick off date \"1990 -01-28\", its corresponding round value is r4.\n\nTherefore, to verify this, we need to check both columns: 'kick off' and 'round'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index 2, column_name 'kick off'\n- row_index 2, column_name 'round'\n\nBecause these two cells together confirm that for the kick off date in question, the round value is r4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the 'round' cell is needed because once you know it's row 2, but perhaps not. The instructions say to check each condition against the table, so I think both columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that on \"1990 - 01 - 28,\" the kick off date has a round value of r4. By locating this date in the 'kick off' column and confirming the corresponding 'round' is r4, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the kick off date be 1990 - 01 - 28 for the round value of r4 and result 8 - 0.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if in the table there is a row where the 'round' is r4, the 'kick off' date is 1990-01-28, and the 'result' is 8-0.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns include round, kick off, opponents, h/a (which I think stands for home or away), result, attendance, and report.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match all three conditions: round r4, kick off date 1990-01-28, and result 8-0.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Round: r3\n- Kick off: 1990-01-06\n- Result: 0-0\nDoesn't match.\n\nSecond row:\n- Round: r3 replay\n- Kick off: 1990-01-09\n- Result: 8-0\nNot r4, so no.\n\nThird row:\n- Round: r4\n- Kick off: 1990-01-28\n- Opponents: Norwich City\n- h/a: a (away)\n- Result: 0-0\nHmm, the result here is 0-0, not 8-0. So it doesn't match.\n\nFourth row:\n- Round: r4 replay\n- Kick off: 1990-01-31\n- Result: 3-1\nNope, not the same as 8-0.\n\nFifth row:\n- Round: r5\n- Kick off: 1990-02-17\nNot relevant since round is r5.\n\nSixth and seventh rows are for r6 and r6 replay.\n\nEighth row:\n- Round: sf (maybe stands for semi-finals?)\n- Kick off: 1990-04-08\nNot r4, so irrelevant.\n\nSo, in the table, the only row that has 'round' as r4 is the third one. Let me check its details again:\n- round: r4\n- kick off: 1990-01-28\n- result: 0-0\n\nThe claim says the result should be 8-0, but it's actually 0-0 here. Therefore, this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row carefully. Sometimes there are replays or different rounds that might have the same date or similar results.\n\nLooking again at the third row:\n- round: r4\n- kick off: 1990-01-28\n- result: 0-0\n\nNo, it's not 8-0. The second row has a result of 8-0 but that's for r3 replay, not r4.\n\nIs there any other row where 'round' is r4 and the result is 8-0? Let me see:\n\nThe third row is r4 with 0-0.\nThe fourth row is r4 replay with 3-1. So no, there isn't another r4 game with 8-0 as a result.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because although there's an r4 game on 1990-01-28, the result isn't 8-0 but 0-0 instead.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n]}",
