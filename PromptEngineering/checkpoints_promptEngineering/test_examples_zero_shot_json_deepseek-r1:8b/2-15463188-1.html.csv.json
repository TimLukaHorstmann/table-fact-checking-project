    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Jessica Quinones is true based on the provided table. The claim states: \"jessica quinone (26) play for far eastern in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three key pieces of information:\n\n1. The name: \"Jessica Quinone\"\n2. Her number: 26\n3. She played for \"Far Eastern\" during the 2012 season.\n\nI need to cross-check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: name, position, number, school/club team, season, and acquisition via. The data is a list of rows, each representing a player.\n\nFirst, I'll search for Jessica Quinone in the 'name' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: jhofel morales\n- Row 1: julieta makidato\n- Row 2: hermies ploma\n- Row 3: judy - ann ramirez\n- Row 4: rosalyn limos\n- Row 5: regine galabo\n- Row 6: joyce guio\n- Row 7: elaine francisco\n- Row 8: jessica quinones\n\nYes, Jessica Quinone is in row 8. Now, let's check her details.\n\nIn row 8, the name matches, so that's good. Next, her position is guard, number is 26, school/club team is far eastern, season is 2012, and acquisition via is rookie draft.\n\nThe claim says she plays for \"far eastern,\" which aligns with the 'school / club team' column in row 8. The number matches as well: 26. The season is also mentioned as 2012, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, all three aspects of the claim are supported by the data in row 8, columns 'number', 'school / club team', and implicitly 'season'. Since there's no discrepancy here, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"jessica quinone (26) play for far eastern in 2012,\" I cross-referenced each component with the table. Jessica Quinones is indeed listed as a guard with number 26 from the Far Eastern team during the 2012 season. All provided details match the table's data, confirming the claim's accuracy.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"in 2012, julieta makidato play for cebu.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant row in the table where \"julieta makidato\" is listed. Looking at the data, there are multiple players with different names, positions, and other details. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: jhofel morales\n- Row 2: julieta makidato\n- Row 3: hermies ploma\n- Row 4: judy - ann ramirez\n- Row 5: rosalyn limos\n- Row 6: regine galabo\n- Row 7: joyce guio\n- Row 8: elaine francisco\n- Row 9: jessica quinones\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 1 (since it's zero-based? Wait, no\u2014the rows are starting from 0. So row 1 is index 1. Yes.\n\nNow, looking at the columns provided: name, position, number, school/club team, season, acquisition via.\n\nThe claim mentions \"julieta makidato play for cebu\" in 2012. So I need to check the 'name' and 'school/club team' columns for this row.\n\nIn row 1 (index 1), the name is \"julieta makidato.\" The 'school / club team' column has \"cebu.\"\n\nAdditionally, the season is listed as 2012, which matches the claim's year. So all relevant information is present here.\n\nNow, checking if the claim is supported: Yes, because in row 1 (index 1), julieta makidato plays for cebu during the 2012 season. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nSo, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns are 'name' and 'school / club team.' So row_index is 1 for julieta makidato, and the columns are \"name\" and \"school / club team.\" That means two cells: name at index 1 and school/club team also at index 1.\n\nWait, but in the JSON structure, each relevant cell should be a separate object with row_index and column_name. So for this case, two cells: one at row 1, column \"name,\" and another at row 1, column \"school / club team.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant_cells list includes both these cells.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"in the 2012 season jessica quinone (26) play for a team called mcgill.\" So I'm looking to see if Jessica Quinones was with McGill in the 2012 season.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with columns: name, position, number, school/club team, season, acquisition via. The data is an array of arrays, each representing a player's details.\n\nI need to search for Jessica Quinones in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: jhofel morales - not her.\n2. Second row: julieta makidato - nope.\n3. Third: hermies ploma - no.\n4. Fourth: judy-ann ramirez - nope.\n5. Fifth: rosalyn limos - no.\n6. Sixth: regine galabo - not Jessica.\n7. Seventh row: joyce guio - still not.\n8. Eighth: elaine francisco - nope.\n9. Ninth row: jessica quinones.\n\nAh, here's the one: jessica quinones. Now, let's check her details. Her position is guard, number 26. School/club team is far eastern. Season is 2012. Acquisition via is rookie draft.\n\nWait, the claim says she plays for a team called mcgill. But in the table, under school/club team, it's \"far eastern\" for Jessica Quinones. So McGill isn't listed there. Did I miss something? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at other rows: row 7 is joyce guio, and her school is mcgill. So Joyce plays for McGill, but that's a different person. The claim mentions jessica quinone (probably a typo for quinones) playing for McGill. But according to the table, Jessica Quinones is with far eastern.\n\nWait, could it be a mistake? Or maybe I misread. Let me check each column for the relevant row. For the ninth row:\n\n- name: jessica quinones\n- position: guard\n- number: 26\n- school/club team: far eastern\n- season: 2012\n- acquisition via: rookie draft\n\nSo, in this case, the claim says she plays for McGill, but her school is far eastern. Therefore, the claim is false because according to the table, she's with far eastern, not McGill.\n\nWait, but in another row, joyce guio is with mcgill. So perhaps there's confusion between the two players. But the claim specifically mentions jessica quinones, so I have to check her details.\n\nSo Jessica Quinones is with far eastern, not McGill. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jessica Quinones played for McGill in the 2012 season, but according to the table, she was with the Far Eastern team.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row 8 (0-indexed), column \"school / club team\"  \n- Row 8, column \"name\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
