    "claim": "black ice be release in 6 country in 2008",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Black Ice was released in 6 countries in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-check it with the data provided.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Black Ice.\" From my knowledge, Black Ice is an album by the band Snow Patrol, released in late 2008. So I need to check if this album was indeed released in six different countries during that year.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a country along with details like release date and format. The columns are: country, date, label, format, and catalogue no. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: Country - Europe, Date - 17 October 2008, Label - Columbia, Format - CD, Double LP, Catalogue No - 88697392232.\n   - I know that \"Black Ice\" was released in Europe, so this is relevant.\n\n2. **Second Row**: Australia, 18 Oct 2008, Sony Music, CD, Catalogue No 88697392382.\n   - Australia is one of the countries mentioned. So yes, it's relevant.\n\n3. **Third Row**: United Kingdom, 20 Oct 2008, Columbia, CD, Double LP. Catalogue same as first row.\n   - UK release is part of the claim, so this is relevant.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: UK again, but a different date in December. Format is CD (limited edition steel box). Catalogue No is different too.\n   - Even though it's the same country, the different catalogue number might indicate a special edition or re-release? But the main release was earlier in October, so maybe this isn't part of the initial release.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: United States, 20 Oct 2008, Columbia, CD, Catalogue No 88697338292.\n   - US release is mentioned, relevant to the claim.\n\n6. **Sixth Row**: Japan, 22 Oct 2008, Sony Music, CD, Catalogue No SICP - 2055.\n   - Japan is another country where \"Black Ice\" was released, so this is relevant.\n\n7. **Seventh Row**: Germany, 5 Dec 2008, Columbia, CD (limited edition steel box), same catalogue as fourth row.\n   - Germany is another country, but again, a later release. Maybe not the main release date.\n\n8. **Eighth Row**: Global iTunes release on 19 Nov 2012, format digital download, same US catalogue.\n   - iTunes release is global, but the claim refers to six countries in 2008. This might be a different release or a special edition.\n\nNow, compiling which countries are listed and whether they fall within 2008. The relevant rows based on country and date:\n\n- Europe (17 Oct 2008)\n- Australia (18 Oct 2008)\n- UK (20 Oct 2008)\n- US (20 Oct 2008)\n- Japan (22 Oct 2008)\n\nThat's five countries so far. Then Germany was released in December, but that's after the main release date. The eighth row is iTunes, which might be a separate release or not part of the physical album.\n\nWait, does \"global (itunes)\" count as a country? Maybe it's considered a sixth country, but I'm not sure if Italy, France, etc., are included in the data. From the table, only the countries listed above are present besides Germany and Global iTunes.\n\nSo maybe the claim is referring to six specific countries where \"Black Ice\" was released. If the data shows five main releases (Europe, Australia, UK, US, Japan) plus Germany, that's six. But if Germany's release is considered a separate one after the main 2008 releases, then perhaps it's not part of the initial release wave.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eighth row doesn't count as a country but as a distribution method (iTunes globally), which could be a sixth country if considering digital sales across all regions. But I'm not sure if that's how the claim interprets it.\n\nLooking back at the table, there are eight rows, each representing different releases in various countries and formats. The key is to count how many times \"Black Ice\" was released in six countries in 2008.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Europe (Oct 2008)\n- Australia (Oct 2008)\n- UK (Oct 2008)\n- US (Oct 2008)\n- Japan (Oct 2008)\n- Germany (Dec 2008)\n\nThat's six countries, even if some are in December. So if the claim is about six countries releasing it in 2008, regardless of the exact month, then it would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but \"Black Ice\" was actually released on 21 October 2008 by Columbia Records, so maybe the data reflects that. The table shows multiple releases across different regions in 2008 and beyond.\n\nI think the relevant cells are all rows where the country is listed and the date is 2008. So:\n\n- Row 0: Europe - 17 Oct 08\n- Row1: Australia -18 Oct 08\n- Row2: UK -20 Oct 08\n- Row3: UK again, but different date (Dec 08)\n- Row4: US -20 Oct 08\n- Row5: Japan -22 Oct 08\n- Row6: Germany -5 Dec 08\n- Row7: Global iTunes -19 Nov 12\n\nSo rows 0 to 6 (excluding row7) are in 2008. The countries involved are Europe, Australia, UK, US, Japan, and Germany\u2014total of six.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are six country releases in 2008 as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"Black Ice was released in 6 countries in 2008\" is supported by the data provided. The relevant rows indicate that \"Black Ice\" was released in six different countries during 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the album Black Ice was first released in Europe\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. It has columns: country, date, label, format, and catalogue no. Each row represents a different release. The claim is specifically about the album Black Ice's first release in Europe, so I need to find any relevant data that ties the album to its European release.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"europe\" as the country with a date of 17 October 2008, label \"columbia\", format \"cd , double lp\", and catalogue no \"88697392232\".\n2. The other rows are for Australia, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Germany, and Global (iTunes), each with their respective dates and formats.\n\nI notice that the first row is Europe's release of Black Ice on CD and Double LP. The format includes both CD and double LP, which suggests it was a significant release. There's no other row for Europe except this one, so it seems like this is indeed Europe's initial release date.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that \"Black Ice\" isn't released elsewhere earlier or in a different format. However, since the claim is about the first release, and Europe has the earliest date (17 Oct 2008), which is before other countries' dates in October 2008, this strengthens the claim.\n\nAlso, the catalogue numbers might help, but they all look unique per region. Since Europe's entry is the only one for that country, it likely means that was the first release there.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the album Black Ice was indeed first released in Europe on 17 October 2008 by Columbia with a specific format.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"label\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"format\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the black ice limit edition steel box set be first release in the uk and later in germany\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two countries: UK and Germany. It says that the release happened first in the UK and then later in Germany. Also, it specifies a product: \"black ice limit edition steel box set.\" So I need to find if such a release exists for these two countries according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has information about country, date, label, format, and catalogue number. The columns are country, date, label, format, and catalogue no.\n\nI'll start by checking each row to see if any mention \"black ice\" or refer to a specific product that might be the box set in question. Wait, in the table, I don't see any entries that directly say \"black ice.\" So maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the label or format includes details about the box set.\n\nWait, looking at row 3: country is UK, date is 20 October 2008, label is Columbia, format is CD, and catalogue no is 88697338292. Then row 4 is also UK but a different date and a more specific format: \"cd (limited edition steel - box).\" So that's the UK release with a limited edition steel box.\n\nRow 6 is Germany, same as row 4's label and format, but catalogue no is slightly different. Row 7 is global iTunes release in November 2012, but not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, so the claim says the black ice set was first released in the UK and then Germany. From the table, I see that there are two entries for UK and Germany with the steel box format. But the term \"black ice\" isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the labels or formats.\n\nLooking at the formats column: row 4 has \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\" which suggests a special edition, but it's not labeled as black ice. The claim specifically mentions \"black ice,\" so if that term isn't present in any of the data points, then the claim might be false.\n\nBut perhaps \"black ice\" is part of the label or another field. Let me check each row again. None of the labels mention \"black ice.\" So maybe the format includes it? No, the formats are things like CD, digital download, etc., and in row 4, it's a specific type but not black ice.\n\nSo if there's no data supporting that the product is called or referred to as \"black ice limit edition steel box set,\" then the claim is false. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"black ice.\" Maybe it's part of the catalogue number? Let me check the catalogue numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3: 88697338292\nRow 4: 88697417452\nRow 6: 886974174523 (same as previous with an extra digit, maybe a typo)\nRow 7: 88697338292 again\n\nNone of these match \"black ice\" or any variation. So without any reference to \"black ice\" in the table, the claim can't be fully supported.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is FALSE because there's no evidence in the provided data that such a product exists as described.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"black ice be release globally on itunes 4 year after its original release\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions \"Black Ice\" being released globally on iTunes four years after its original release. So I should check when \"Black Ice\" was originally released and when it became available on iTunes globally.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different country or region with details like date, label, format, etc. The relevant columns here are \"country\", \"date\", \"label\", \"format\", and \"catalogue no\". \n\nThe original release of \"Black Ice\" would likely be in one of the countries listed, probably where the album was first released physically. From the table, I see entries for countries like Europe, Australia, the United Kingdom, etc., with dates ranging from October 2008 to December 2008. Since \"Black Ice\" is a major release, it's reasonable to assume that its original release date would be around mid-October 2008.\n\nNext, looking for when it was released globally on iTunes. There's a row labeled \"global (itunes)\" with a date of 19 November 2012 and the format as digital download. The catalogue number here is 88697338292. Comparing this to other entries, I notice that some countries have similar catalogue numbers, like the United States and Japan.\n\nThe claim states it was released four years after its original release. If we take the original release date as October 2008, adding four years would bring us to around October 2012. The iTunes global release is in November 2012, which aligns with the timeline mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, checking for any discrepancies: All countries have different dates and formats except where the album was released by Columbia. The \"global (itunes)\" entry matches the catalogue number used elsewhere, suggesting it's part of the same release campaign.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the original release date of \"Black Ice\" around October 2008 and its global iTunes release in November 2012, which is approximately four years later.

The formats mentioned are LP, CD, and digital download, along with specific details like \"cd , double lp\" or \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\". \n\nI need to check if 'black ice' appears as a release in the table. Scanning through the data:\n\n- First row: label is columbia, but no mention of black ice.\n- Second row: sony music, nothing about black ice.\n- Third row: united kingdom, columbia, format includes \"cd , double lp\" \u2014 but is this for black ice?\n- Fourth row: same country and label, mentions limited edition steel box \u2014 again, not specifying a title.\n- Fifth row: united states, columbia, CD only; no title mentioned.\n- Sixth row: japan, sony music, CD; no title.\n- Seventh row: germany, columbia, mentions the steel box format, but without a title.\n- Eighth row: global itunes, digital download; catalogue number matches some entries but again, no title.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.

Similarly, other entries list labels like sony music and columbia without specifying a title. The claim refers to 'black ice' being released in various formats.\n\nI don't see any row where 'black ice' is listed as the label or artist. Instead, the artists are columbia, sony music, etc., which might be record labels themselves, not the albums or releases.\n\nSo, unless there's a row that directly mentions 'black ice' as part of the release details, the claim isn't supported.

First, I should understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is about the release order of the album \"Black Ice\" between two countries: the U.S. and Japan. It states that the U.S. release happened after the Japanese release. To verify this, I'll need to look for entries in the table related to both countries and their respective release dates.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different country where the album was released. The relevant columns here are \"country\", \"date\", and possibly \"label\" if needed, but mainly date and country.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Europe**: Not relevant to U.S. or Japan.\n2. **Australia**: Also not relevant.\n3. **United Kingdom**: Same as above.\n4. **United States**: This is our first relevant row since it's about the U.S. release date. The date here is \"20 october 2008\".\n5. **Japan**: This is another relevant row for the Japanese release. The date is \"22 october 2008\".\n6. **Germany**: Irrelevant.\n7. **Global (iTunes)**: This might refer to a digital release, but it's not specific to Japan, so I'm not sure if it affects our claim.\n\nNow, comparing the dates for the U.S. and Japan:\n\n- The U.S. release date is October 20, 2008.\n- The Japanese release date is October 22, 2008.\n\nWait, that means Japan released the album a few days after the U.S. So the claim says it was released in the U.S. after Japan, but according to the dates, Japan actually came a few days later. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because the U.S. release happened before Japan's.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other entries that might change this. The global iTunes release is on November 19, 2012, which is much later than both countries. But since the claim doesn't mention that, it's not relevant here. Also, the United States has a catalogue number of 88697338292, and Japan has \"sicp - 2055\". No issues there.\n\nSo, the key cells to consider are:\n\n- For the U.S., row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0). Columns: country, date.\n- For Japan, row index 5.

Global (iTunes) - Columbia\n\nHmm, none of these labels mention \"Black Ice.\" So that's a red flag because the claim says it's released by Columbia, but the label in the relevant row is listed as \"global (itunes)\" with the album being from Columbia.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim might be about an album named \"Black Ice\" by Columbia being the first release on iTunes globally. So maybe the data needs to show a release of \"Black Ice\" in some capacity.\n\nLooking again at the data:\n\nIn the row where country is \"global (itunes)\" and date is November 19, 2012, the label is Columbia, and the format is digital download. The catalogue no is 88697338292. So this seems to be a release by Columbia on iTunes, but not named \"Black Ice.\"\n\nSince none of the rows have \"Black Ice\" as the label or any indication that an album by that name was released, especially in the global (iTunes) row, I think the claim is false.\n\nNow, considering the relevant cells. The claim mentions \"itunes, internationally,\" so the 'country' and 'label' columns would be relevant. Specifically, looking at the global (itunes) row, which is row 7 with country as \"global ( itunes )\" and label as \"columbia.\" So I should extract those cells.\n\nWait, but actually, the claim says \"black ice,\" so perhaps if there was a row where the label is \"Black Ice,\" that would be relevant. Since none exist, maybe the only relevant cell is the global iTunes release, which doesn't mention \"Black Ice.\"\n\nSo, to check, I need to see if \"Black Ice\" is released on iTunes globally. Since it's not listed anywhere in the table, the claim must be false.\n\nBut wait another thought: Maybe \"Black Ice\" refers to an album or single by Columbia that was first released on iTunes internationally. So perhaps the row where country is global (itunes) could be relevant, but without the label being \"Black Ice,\" it's unclear. But since the label is \"columbia,\" and \"black ice\" isn't listed as a label, it doesn't support the claim.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the claim is false because there's no row indicating the release of \"Black Ice\" on iTunes internationally.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"label\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"black ice catalog number in germany have only 4 digit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"black ice\" refers to a specific album, I believe. The claim is about the catalog numbers (also known as catalogue numbers) in Germany for this album. It's stating that these catalog numbers have only four digits.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: country, date, label, format, and catalogue no. My task is to check each row related to Germany to see if their \"catalogue no\" field meets the condition of having exactly four digits.\n\nI'll start by locating all rows where the country is Germany. Scanning through the data:\n\n1. The first relevant row is index 3: [\"germany\", \"5 december 2008\", \"columbia\", \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\", \"88697417452\"]\n2. The next one is index 6: [\"global ( itunes )\", \"19 november 2012\", \"columbia\", \"digital download\", \"88697338292\"]\n\nWait, actually, the row indices start from 0. Let me correct that:\n\n- Row index 3: Germany with catalogue number 88697417452\n- Row index 6: Germany with catalogue number 886974174523\n\nWait no, looking again, I see that in the table, the rows for Germany are at indexes 3 and 6? Let me count properly. The data array is:\n\n0: europe\n1: australia\n2: united kingdom\n3: united kingdom\n4: united states\n5: japan\n6: germany\n7: global (itunes)\n\nSo yes, row index 6 is Germany.\n\nNow, checking the catalogue numbers for these rows.\n\nFor row 3 (index 3): The catalogue number is \"88697417452\". Let's count the digits. It starts with 88, which is two digits, followed by 6974... Wait, but I should just count each digit one by one. So:\n\n8-8-6-9-7-4-1-7-4-5-2.\n\nThat's 11 digits in total.\n\nNext, for row 6 (index 6): The catalogue number is \"88697338292\". Let me count: 8-8-6-9-7-3-3-8-2-9-2. That's also 11 digits.\n\nWait a minute, both have 11 digits, not four. So that would mean the claim that they have only four digits is FALSE because both have eleven digits each.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me double-check the data rows:\n\nLooking at row index 6 (Germany):\n\nThe \"catalogue no\" is written as \"886974174523\". Wait, but looking back at the table, in the given JSON, the last row under germany has \"catalogue no\" as \"88697417452\". Hmm, wait no\u2014let me check again.\n\nIn the JSON provided:\n\n- The sixth data row (index 5) is japan: catalogue no is \"sicp - 2055\"\n- The seventh data row (index 6): germany, catalogue no is \"886974174523\"\n\nWait, no, in the table as given, the germany row is index 6 with catalogue no \"88697417452\" or \"886974174523\"? Let me check.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow 0: europe\nRow 1: australia\nRow 2: united kingdom\nRow 3: united kingdom\nRow 4: united states\nRow 5: japan\nRow 6: germany\nRow 7: global (itunes)\n\nSo for row 6, the \"catalogue no\" is \"88697417452\"\n\nWait, but in the data array, it's:\n\n[\n  [\n    \"europe\",\n    \"17 october 2008\",\n    \"columbia\",\n    \"cd , double lp\",\n    \"88697392232\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"australia\",\n    \"18 october 2008\",\n    \"sony music\",\n    \"cd\",\n    \"88697392382\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"united kingdom\",\n    \"20 october 2008\",\n    \"columbia\",\n    \"cd\",\n    \"88697338292\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"united kingdom\",\n    \"1 december 2008\",\n    \"columbia\",\n    \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\",\n    \"88697417452\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"united states\",\n    \"20 october 2008\",\n    \"columbia\",\n    \"cd\",\n    \"88697338292\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"japan\",\n    \"22 october 2008\",\n    \"sony music\",\n    \"cd\",\n    \"sicp - 2055\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"germany\",\n    \"5 december 2008\",\n    \"columbia\",\n    \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\",\n    \"88697417452\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"global ( itunes )\",\n    \"19 november 2012\",\n    \"columbia\",\n    \"digital download\",\n    \"88697338292\"\n  ]\n]\n\nSo, for Germany, the catalogue no is at index 6: \"88697417452\"\n\nThat's an 11-digit number. Similarly, the global (itunes) row has \"88697338292\", also 11 digits.\n\nTherefore, both have 11 digits in their catalogue numbers. So the claim that they have only four digits is incorrect; hence, it's FALSE.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014did I misread something? Let me check again. The claim says \"black ice catalog number in germany have only 4 digit\". So, assuming black ice refers to an album by Coldplay, for example, which has various releases with different catalogue numbers. But in the table provided, we're looking at the 'catalogue no' field.\n\nIn the given data, both Germany's catalogue numbers are 11 digits long, not four. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"black ice\" catalog number in Germany has only four digits. However, upon examining the relevant rows, the \"catalogue no\" for Germany is '88697417452', which is an 11-digit number, and another entry (for global iTunes) is also 11 digits. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"catalogue no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"black ice be never release as an lp , only as a cd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nThe claim seems to suggest that the album \"Black Ice\" (assuming that's what's being referred to here) was never released as an LP but only as a CD. So I need to check if this is supported by the information provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various countries, dates, labels, formats, and catalogue numbers. The columns are country, date, label, format, and catalogue no. Now, I should look for any rows where \"Black Ice\" might be mentioned as a label or something related to the format (LP vs CD).\n\nWait, but in the table, I don't see an entry with the label \"Black Ice\". The labels listed are Columbia, Sony Music, etc. So maybe the claim is referring to a specific album released by these labels? Or perhaps the term \"black ice\" refers to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about whether any of these releases were on LP format. Let's look at the 'format' column. The formats listed are \"cd\", \"cd , double lp\", \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\", and \"digital download\". I don't see an entry where the format is specifically \"LP\" or \"vinyl\".\n\nSo, in the table provided, none of the entries have \"lp\" as a format. The closest is \"cd , double lp\", which might indicate that some releases had both CD and LP versions, but according to the claim, it was never released as an LP only as CD.\n\nBut wait, the user's claim says \"black ice be never release as an lp , only as a cd\". If \"black ice\" isn't listed in any row's label column, then maybe the table doesn't have that information. Therefore, there's no data to support or refute the claim about \"Black Ice\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Black Ice\" refers to a specific album from one of these labels, like Columbia. For example, looking at the first row: label is Columbia, format is \"cd , double lp\". So they have both CD and LP versions? But according to the claim, it was never released as an LP only as a CD. If that's the case, then perhaps the claim is not supported by this table because in one of the entries, there is an LP version.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"Black Ice\" is the album being referred to. The labels are Columbia and Sony Music, which might be associated with \"Black Ice\", but without explicit mention in the label column, it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: the claim is about whether any release was as an LP. Looking at the 'format' column, there's one entry that says \"cd , double lp\". This suggests that at least some releases had both CD and LP versions. If \"Black Ice\" is that album, then the claim would be FALSE because it was released as both CD and LP.\n\nHowever, since the table doesn't specify which album corresponds to each release, I can't definitively say whether any of them are \"Black Ice\". Without knowing which label or catalogue number corresponds to \"Black Ice\", I can't verify if they were released on LP.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given in the table, there's no evidence supporting the claim that \"Black Ice\" was never released as an LP. The format data shows some releases had both CD and LP versions, but without knowing if it's \"Black Ice\", the claim can't be fully supported or refuted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any row has a label that could be \"Black Ice\". Scanning through the labels: Columbia, Sony Music, etc. No mention of Black Ice. So maybe the claim is about another album entirely not listed here.\n\nIn that case, since none of the entries in the table relate to \"Black Ice\", there's no data to support or contradict the claim. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because the information provided doesn't back up the statement.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"black ice\" was never released as an LP but only as a CD. However, the table does not contain any entries for \"Black Ice\". The formats listed include both CD and LP versions in some cases, but without knowing if it pertains to \"Black Ice\", the claim can't be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
