    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a certain claim about a table is true or false. The table is in JSON format and has several columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. There are 14 rows of data. \n\nThe claim I need to check is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field , yona.\" Hmm, I think the user might have meant \"played\" instead of \"be play,\" but maybe that's just a typo.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what part of the table relates to this claim. The claim is about an event: 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier, which was held at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona. So I need to find a row in the table where the competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" and the venue is \"leo palace resort soccer field , yona.\"\n\nLooking at the data, I'll go through each row to check for these values. Let me start scanning:\n\nRow 0: Competition is \"2006 afc challenge cup,\" so not this one.\n\nRow 1: Same as row 0, so no.\n\nRow 2: 2007 Hong Kong - Macau Interport, different competition.\n\nRow 3: 2008 East Asian Championship Qualifier, venue in Macau.\n\nRow 4: 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifier in Bangkok.\n\nRow 5: Also 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifier, same as above.\n\nRow 6: 2008 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier in Phnom Penh.\n\nRow 7: 2008 East Asian Football Championship Qualifier.\n\nRow 8: 2010 East Asian Football Championship Qualifier.\n\nRow 9: Same competition but different scores.\n\nRow 10: 2010 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier.\n\nRow 11: Also 2010 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier.\n\nRow 12: 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier, venue in Yona. Wait, that's a match.\n\nWait, let me check row 12: date is \"20 july 2012,\" venue is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona, competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier.\" Hmm, but the claim is about 2013, so this seems relevant. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, row 12's competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" and venue matches Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona. So that would mean that in 2012, they played a qualifying match for the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup at that venue.\n\nBut the claim says \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field , yona.\" So it's about the entire competition being played there. Let me check if any row has both competition as 2013 EAFF and venue as Leo Palace.\n\nWait, looking through all rows, I don't see another row that matches both 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier and Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona. The only one is row 12, but it's for the 2013 competition with a date in 2012. That might be a bit confusing because qualifiers are usually before the main tournament.\n\nBut regardless of the exact timing, the key point is that there was at least one match in the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier held at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona. Therefore, the claim's statement that this qualifier was played there would be true because there's a corresponding row in the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the competition is listed as \"2013 eaff east asian cup\" or just \"eaff east asian cup.\" In the table, for example, row 12 says \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier,\" which matches exactly. So yes, it's correct.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there exists a match in the table that fits both the competition and venue mentioned.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier be play in Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly needs to be checked.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim and identify the key elements. The main points here are:\n\n1. **Event**: 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\n2. **Venue**: Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila\n\nNow, I'll check the table provided to see if there's a match that fits these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. So, for each row, I need to see if the competition is \"2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\" and the venue matches \"Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n- **Row 0**: Competition is \"2006 AFC Challenge Cup\". Not matching.\n- **Row 1**: Same as above. Not matching.\n- **Rows 2 to 5**: These are in 2007 and 2008, competitions don't match.\n- **Rows 6 to 10**: These are for 2009, but again, not the right competition year.\n- **Row 11**: Competition is \"2010 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier\". Not our target.\n- **Rows 12,13,14**: Still 2010 competitions. No match.\n- **Row 15**: \"2012 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\" \u2013 close but not 2013.\n- **Row 16 and 17**: Different years and competitions.\n- **Row 18**: \"2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\". Now, check the venue: \"leo palace resort soccer field , yona\". Doesn't match Rizal Memorial Stadium.\n- **Rows 19 and 20**: Not matching.\n\nWait a minute, in row 25 (index 19), the competition is \"2012 Philippine Peace Cup\", which is different. So none of the rows have both the correct competition and venue as per the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. The user's claim is about the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier being played in Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila. Looking through all the rows, I don't see any entry where both \"2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\" and \"Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila\" appear together.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
