    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"Denny Hulme be the driver at Anderstorp in 1973\" is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Denny Hulme was the driver during the race held at Anderstorp in the year 1973. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where \"driver\" is Denny Hulme, \"location\" is Anderstorp, and \"year\" is 1973.\n\nLet me look at the table structure. The columns are: year, driver, constructor, location, report. The data rows follow these columns.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find a match.\n\nRow 0: year=1978, driver=niki lauda... Not matching.\nRow 1: 1977, jacques laffite... No.\nRow 2: 1976, jody scheckter... Nope.\nRow 3: 1975, niki lauda... Still not Denny Hulme.\nRow 4: 1974, jody scheckter again. Not our guy.\nRow 5: 1973, denny hulme... Okay, location is Anderstorp? Let me check the \"location\" column for this row. It says \"anderstorp\". Yes! So, in 1973, Denny Hulme was the driver at Anderstorp.\n\nWait, but I should also ensure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. Let me check other rows to make sure there's only one occurrence of Denny Hulme and that it matches the year and location.\n\nLooking further down, row 14: 1949 has b bira as driver. Then rows from 1953 onwards don't have Denny Hulme. So, it seems like only row 5 has Denny Hulme as the driver at Anderstorp in 1973.\n\nAlso, there's a note that in 1972-1968, the race wasn't held, so no conflicts there.\n\nTherefore, all conditions of the claim are met in row 5.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Denny Hulme be the driver at Anderstorp in 1973,\" we check the table for a matching year, driver name, and location. The relevant cell is found in row 5 (index 5) under the \"driver\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
