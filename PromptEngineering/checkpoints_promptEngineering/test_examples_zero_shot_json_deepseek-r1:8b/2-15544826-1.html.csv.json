    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Greg Pursley's average start in 2010 being 1.4 higher than in 2011 is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"Greg Pursley's average start in 2010 be 1.4 higher than in 2011.\" So, I need to find out two things: the average start for 2010 and the average start for 2011. Then, check if the difference is exactly 1.4.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a JSON with \"columns\" listing all the metrics, and \"data\" which are the rows. Each row represents a different year, among others. So, I need to identify the relevant columns for this claim. The columns related here would be 'avg start' since that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I'll check each row for the years 2010 and 2011.\n\nStarting with 2010: Looking through the data rows, I see a row where year is 2010. The relevant column is \"avg start\", which in this row is 4.7. So that's Greg Pursley's average start in 2010.\n\nNext, for 2011: I need to find the row with the year 2011 and extract the avg start value. In the table, the 2011 row has an avg start of 3.3.\n\nNow, calculate the difference between these two averages: 4.7 (2010) minus 3.3 (2011). That equals 1.4. So yes, there's a 1.4 increase from 2010 to 2011 in average start.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in 2010 be 1.4 higher than in 2011.\" So it's phrased correctly because 2010's avg is higher by 1.4. That matches the data perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. The relevant cells are the 2010 row's \"avg start\" and the 2011 row's \"avg start\". Their respective indices can be found as row 5 for 2010 (since indexing starts at 0) and row 6 for 2011.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I need to extract these cells. The answer should be TRUE because the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"avg start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"avg start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"greg pursley have no win prior to the year 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The name mentioned is \"greg pursley.\" Since the table includes data about races and wins, it seems like we're talking about a motorsport driver, possibly someone like Greg Pursey or another similar name, but I'll assume it's referring to Greg Pursey.\n\nThe claim says that before 2008, Greg Pursley had no wins. So I need to check the table for any data related to Greg Pursey and his performance in races prior to 2008. If there are any wins recorded in years before 2008, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns include \"year,\" \"races,\" \"wins,\" etc. The data rows go from 1999 up to 2012. So I'm focusing on rows where the year is less than 2008. That would be the first row (1999) and possibly others before 2008, but looking at the table, the next years are 2002, 2007, 2008, etc.\n\nWait, in the data provided, the years listed are 1999, 2002, 2007, 2008, up to 2012. So before 2008 would be 1999, 2002, and 2007. Let me check each of these rows to see if Greg Pursey had any wins.\n\nBut wait, the first data row is for 1999 with 0 wins. Then in 2002, it's still 0. In 2007, it's also 0. So up until 2008, he didn't have any wins. Now, looking at the years from 2009 onwards, the wins start to appear: in 2009, it's 1 win; in 2010, 2 wins; and so on.\n\nBut the claim is about prior to 2008, meaning before 2008, so up to and including 2007. So even if 2008 had a win, that would be in or after 2008, which wouldn't affect the claim. Wait, no: 2008's data has 0 wins as well.\n\nSo, checking each relevant row:\n\n- 1999: 0 wins\n- 2002: 0 wins\n- 2007: 0 wins\n\nNo wins in any of these years. Therefore, it seems that Greg Pursley did not have any wins before 2008, which would make the claim TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to ensure there are no other years before 2008 with data. Looking at the table, the rows provided start from 1999 and go up by a few years each time. So between 1999 and 2007, Greg has 0 wins in those years. Therefore, he didn't have any wins prior to 2008.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that \"greg pursley\" could be referring to another person? The table doesn't specify the name of the driver; it's just a data table with years and statistics. So perhaps I'm assuming it's about Greg Pursey, but maybe it's someone else. However, without more context, I have to go by the claim as given.\n\nSo if the claim is that Greg Pursley had no wins before 2008, and according to the table, in those years (1999, 2002, 2007) he indeed has 0 wins, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones that show the number of wins Greg Pursey had before 2008. Since all entries for years prior to 2008 (1999, 2002, and 2007) have 0 wins, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Greg Pursley placing in the top 5 the most times in 2011 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim are relevant to the data in the table. The columns mentioned in the table include \"year\", \"races\", \"wins\", \"top 5\", and \"poles\". Since the claim is about placing in the top 5, the \"top 5\" column is definitely important.\n\nLooking at the rows, each row corresponds to a different year. The claim specifies 2011, so I should find the row for that year. Scanning through the data, I see there's a row with the year 2011.\n\nNext, I need to check the \"top 5\" value for 2011. From the table, in 2011, the \"top 5\" is listed as 12. Wait, but wait\u2014the claim says \"placing the in the top 5\". Hmm, that might be a typo or misinterpretation. Maybe it's about how often he was in the top 5 positions.\n\nWait, no, the table shows \"top 5\" as the count of times he finished in the top 5. So for 2011, it's 12. That seems high. Let me check other years to see if this is the highest.\n\nLooking at all the rows: 1999 has 0, 2002 has 5, 2007 has 0, 2008 has 0, 2009 has 11, 2010 has 7, 2011 has 12, and 2012 has 9. So yes, 2011 does have the highest number of top 5 finishes at 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Greg Pursley did place in the top 5 more times than any other year shown in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the data provided. In the year 2011, Greg Pursley had the highest number of top 5 finishes compared to other years listed.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"top 5\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"greg pursley rank higher in 2002 than 2007\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table. The relevant columns here are \"year,\" \"races,\" and \"season rank.\" The claim mentions both 2002 and 2007, so I should focus on those two years.\n\nNext, I need to locate Greg Pursley's data for these specific years. Each row represents a different year, so the first step is to find which rows correspond to 2002 and 2007.\n\nLooking at the \"year\" column:\n- The first entry is 1999, not relevant.\n- The second entry is 2002, that's one of our target years.\n- The third is 2007, another target year.\n- The rest are beyond 2012, so I can ignore them for this claim.\n\nNow, focusing on the 2002 and 2007 rows. Let me extract their season ranks:\n- In 2002, Greg Pursley's season rank is \"9th.\"\n- In 2007, his season rank is \"69th.\"\n\nThe claim says that in 2002, his rank was higher than in 2007. So I need to compare these two ranks. \n\nNow, a lower numerical value indicates a higher position. For example, \"1st\" is higher than \"2nd.\" Similarly, \"9th\" is higher (better) than \"69th.\"\n\nSo, 9th is indeed higher than 69th. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nTo make sure I'm thorough, I should also check if there's any other data that might affect this comparison. The table includes other columns like races, wins, top 5, etc., but since those don't relate directly to the ranking position, they aren't necessary for verifying the season rank comparison. So, only the \"season rank\" column is relevant here.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- For 2002: row index 1 (since rows start at 0), and column \"season rank.\"\n- For 2007: row index 2, same column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Greg Pursley's worst ranking be in the year 2007\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"worst ranking\" likely refers to the lowest position (or rank) that Greg Pursley achieved in a particular year. The claim specifies that his worst ranking was in 2007. So, I need to check if 2007 is indeed his worst year in terms of rank.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns: year, races, wins, top5, top10, poles, avg start, avg finish, season rank. The rows represent different years, from 1999 onwards. Each row has data corresponding to a specific year.\n\nI need to find Greg Pursley's ranking each year and determine which is the worst (lowest) among them. Let me look at each relevant year: 1999, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In 1999, his season rank was 64th.\n- In 2002, he improved to 9th.\n- In 2007, it dropped to 69th.\n- 2008: 32nd.\n- 2009: 3rd (much better).\n- 2010: 5th.\n- 2011: He had a season rank of 1st, which is the best so far.\n- 2012: 2nd.\n\nNow, comparing these ranks: 64th in '99, 9th in '02, 69th in '07, 32nd in '08, and so on. The lowest (worst) rank here seems to be 69th in 2007. So the claim that his worst ranking was in 2007 appears to be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting \"worst ranking\" correctly. It's possible that some columns might influence this. For example, races, wins, top5, etc., but season rank is a direct indicator of overall position for the year. So yes, looking at season rank is the right approach.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, Greg Pursley's worst ranking occurred in 2007, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"Greg Pursley's worst ranking be in the year 2007\" is true, we need to examine the 'season rank' column for each relevant year. The season rank indicates the overall position for that year, with lower numbers representing better positions.\n\n- **2007**: 69th (lowest among all years)\n- **1999**: 64th\n- **2002**: 9th\n- **2008**: 32nd\n- **2009**: 3rd\n- **2010**: 5th\n- **2011**: 1st\n- **2012**: 2nd\n\nSince the lowest rank (69th) is indeed in 2007, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The name \"greg pursley\" might be a typo for \"Greg Pursey,\" but assuming it's correct as per the claim, I need to see if he had any victories after 2008. So, the focus is on the years 2009 onwards.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year and various statistics about races, wins, top 5 finishes, etc. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"year,\" \"wins,\" and possibly others if needed. But since the claim is specifically about victories after 2008, I should focus on rows where the year is 2009 or later.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **2009**: Wins column has a value of 1. So, Greg Pursey won at least one race in 2009.\n2. **2010**: Wins are 2, so he had two victories that year.\n3. **2011**: Wins are 6, meaning six wins in that year.\n4. **2012**: Wins are 2 again.\n\nAll these years (2009-2012) fall after 2008. The claim states that there are no victories after 2008, but the table clearly shows that in each of those years, he had multiple wins. Therefore, the claim is false because Greg Pursey did have victories after 2008.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. Each relevant cell should be identified by its row index and column name.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n- \"year\": all rows from 2009 onwards.\n- \"wins\": same as above, since each of those years has a positive number.\n\nSo, for each year starting from 2009 up to 2012, I'll need to include their respective \"wins\" columns. That would be row indices 4 (2009), 5 (2010), 6 (2011), and 7 (2012) with the column name \"wins.\"\n\nI should list these as relevant cells because they directly contradict the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Greg Pursey had victories in each year from 2009 to 2012, which are after 2008.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"greg pursley score lower in 2002 than in 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two years: 2002 and 2007. It also refers to \"score.\" Looking at the table columns, the relevant columns for scoring might be \"wins,\" \"top 5,\" \"top 10,\" \"poles,\" etc. But since it's about a driver named Greg Pursley, I need to find his corresponding data in the table.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't have any information about drivers' names; it just lists years and various statistics. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each row represents a different driver's performance across seasons? Or is this a specific driver's career data? The column headers are \"year,\" \"races,\" \"wins,\" etc., so each row might be a driver's performance in that particular year.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the table structure, it seems like each sub-array under \"data\" represents a different year. For example, the first sub-array is for 1999, the next for 2002, then 2007, and so on. So each row corresponds to a specific year, not a driver.\n\nBut that can't be right because how would we know which driver's data it is? Maybe the table is for a single driver across multiple years. Let me check the number of rows: there are 8 rows, spanning from 1999 to 2012 in some jumps. For example, 1999, then 2002, 2007, 2008, etc. So it's possible that each row represents a different year for the same driver.\n\nSo if we're considering Greg Pursley, perhaps his performance in 2002 and 2007 is what's being compared here.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"greg pursley score lower in 2002 than in 2007.\" So I need to compare his scores (whatever that means) between these two years. But which columns represent his score? Maybe \"wins,\" \"top 5,\" \"top 10,\" or \"poles\"?\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"score,\" which might be a specific metric. However, in racing, points are often accumulated based on finishes, so maybe it's a cumulative score. Alternatively, \"score\" could refer to poles (leading laps), top fives, or wins.\n\nBut looking at the columns, I see \"poles,\" \"avg start,\" \"avg finish,\" etc., but no direct column named \"score.\" So perhaps \"score\" is derived from the number of wins or points accumulated across races. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific metric like points earned, which isn't directly listed.\n\nWait, in the table, for 2002, under \"races,\" it's 10, and \"wins\" are 0, top 5 is 2, top 10 is 5, poles are 0. For 2007, races are 1, wins 0, etc. So maybe the score is calculated based on these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"score\" refers to the driver's finishing position or their average finish. The claim mentions that Greg Pursley's score in 2002 was lower than in 2007. If we consider \"avg finish,\" let's check:\n\nIn 2002, avg finish is 10.2.\nIn 2007, avg finish is 29.0.\n\nSo 10.2 is lower (better) than 29.0. So if the score refers to average finish, then his score in 2002 was indeed lower (better) than in 2007. That would make the claim TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if \"score\" refers to wins: he had 0 wins in 2002 and 0 in 2007. So that wouldn't explain a difference.\n\nIf \"score\" is top 10 finishes: in 2002, it's 5; in 2007, it's 0. So lower would mean worse, but the claim says lower (better). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total points or some cumulative score. But without a direct column for that, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\nFor 2002:\nyear: 2002,\nraces:10,\nwins:0,\ntop5:2,\ntop10:5,\npoles:0,\navg start:9.2,\navg finish:10.2,\nseason rank:\"9th\"\n\nFor 2007:\nyear:2007,\nraces:1,\nwins:0,\ntop5:0,\ntop10:0,\npoles:0,\navg start:22.0,\navg finish:29.0,\nseason rank:\"69th\"\n\nSo in 2002, he had a better average finish (lower number) compared to 2007. So if \"score\" is based on finishing position, then yes, his score was lower (better) in 2002 than in 2007.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"greg pursley score lower in 2002 than in 2007.\" If we take \"lower\" as a worse finish, but in reality, lower numbers are better. So if avg finish is lower, that's better, so his score (finishing) was better in 2002.\n\nSo the claim is stating that his score in 2002 was lower than in 2007. If we interpret \"lower\" as numerically lower, then it's TRUE because 10.2 < 29.0.\n\nAlternatively, if \"lower\" means worse (like finishing further back), but usually, lower numerical values indicate better positions. So I think the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Greg Pursley's score in 2002 was lower than in 2007. By comparing their average finishes, which are 10.2 and 29.0 respectively, it's clear that 10.2 is indeed lower (better) than 29.0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg finish\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg finish\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Greg Pursley's average start in 2010 being 1.4 lower than in 2011 is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns and rows are relevant. The claim mentions \"average start,\" so I'll focus on that column. Looking at the table's columns, I see that there's a column named \"avg start.\" So, that's definitely relevant. Each row represents a different year, so I need to check for both 2010 and 2011.\n\nNext, I should locate the rows corresponding to 2010 and 2011 in the data. The table's data array has several entries; I'll count them out. The first entry is 1999, then 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. So, 2010 is the sixth row (index 6) and 2011 is the seventh row (index 7).\n\nNow, I'll extract the \"avg start\" values for these two rows. For 2010, it's listed as 4.7, and for 2011, it's 3.3. The claim states that the average start in 2010 is 1.4 lower than in 2011. To verify this, I'll calculate the difference between the two averages.\n\nSo, 4.7 (2010) minus 3.3 (2011) equals 1.4. That means yes, Greg Pursley's average start in 2010 was indeed 1.4 lower than in 2011. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note down which exact cells are relevant for the answer. The \"avg start\" column is key here, and specifically rows 6 (2010) and 7 (2011). So, I'll list those as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"avg start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"avg start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Greg Pursley's rank in the top 5 is correct based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"greg pursley rank in the top 5 the least amount of time in 2011.\" So, I need to check if Greg Pursley was ranked in the top 5 for the least amount of time during the 2011 season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. The columns related to ranking would be \"year,\" \"races,\" \"wins,\" \"top 5,\" and \"season rank.\" But since we're focusing on 2011, I should look at the 2011 row.\n\nIn 2011, Greg Pursley had 14 races. Out of those, he won 6 races, which is a win, so that's a top position. The \"top 5\" column shows 12, meaning he finished in the top 5 in 12 races. Wait, but since he won 6 races, those would also count towards being in the top 5 because finishing first is better than fifth.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The \"wins\" column indicates how many times he won. So if he won 6 races, that's separate from his finishes in other races. So for each race, he can be either a winner or finish elsewhere. The \"top 5\" counts how many times he finished in the top 5 (including wins).\n\nSo in 2011, Greg had 14 races: he won 6 of them and finished in the top 5 in 12 races. That means he was in the top 5 for those 12 races, which is a significant number.\n\nNow, the claim says that his rank in the top 5 was the least amount of time in 2011. Wait, no\u2014actually, it's about how much time he was in the top 5. Since the \"top 5\" counts the number of times he finished there, including wins, if he was in the top 5 for a lot of races, then his time in the top 5 wasn't minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check: Greg's total top 5 finishes were 12 out of 14 races. That means he was in the top 5 more often than not. So saying he was in the top 5 the least amount of time isn't correct because it's actually a high number, not low.\n\nAlternatively, if \"least amount of time\" refers to how many positions higher he was each time, but that doesn't seem right because the data shows the count of finishes, not their exact positions beyond being in the top 5.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim seems to be incorrect. Greg Pursley was actually in the top 5 for a significant number of races in 2011, which is more than the least amount of time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Greg Pursley's rank in the top 5 was achieved the least amount of time in 2011 is false. The data shows he had 12 finishes in the top 5 out of 14 races, indicating a high number of top 5 placements.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"top 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the best ranking of greg pursley be in the year 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should identify what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe term \"best ranking\" likely refers to the highest position (or rank) that Greg Pursley achieved in a given year. The claim specifically mentions the year 2007, so I should look for his performance in that specific year.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related to each row include \"year,\" \"races,\" \"wins,\" \"top 5,\" \"top 10,\" \"poles,\" \"avg start,\" \"avg finish,\" and \"season rank.\" The \"season rank\" column probably indicates his overall ranking for that season. \n\nI need to find Greg Pursley's data in the year 2007. Scanning through the rows, I see a row with year 2007. In that row, under \"races\" it says 1. Then \"wins\" is 0, and so on. The last column is \"season rank,\" which for 2007 is \"69th.\" \n\nSo in 2007, Greg Pursley's season rank was 69th. The claim states his best ranking was in 2007. If the best ranking refers to the highest position, then 69th isn't particularly high. However, maybe there's a misunderstanding here\u2014if \"best ranking\" refers to a single race result, but that seems unlikely as the term usually pertains to overall performance.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"best ranking.\" It could mean the best (highest) rank he achieved in any race during that season. Looking at other columns like \"avg start\" and \"avg finish,\" which are 22.0 and 29.0 respectively for 2007, suggesting he started further back and finished even lower on average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"best ranking\" refers to the highest season rank. In that case, his season rank in 2007 was 69th, which is not better than other years. For example, in 2011, it's 1st, which would be a much higher (better) ranking. So if the claim says his best ranking was in 2007 but he actually achieved a better ranking later, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"the best ranking of Greg Pursley be in the year 2007.\" If his best overall season rank was in 2011 (1st), which is better than 2007's 69th, then the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm looking at the correct columns and rows. The relevant cells would be row_index 5 (since it's 0-based; the 2007 row is index 2? Wait no, let me count: \n\nRows are for years 1999 (index 0), 2002 (1), 2007 (2), 2008 (3), 2009 (4), 2010 (5), 2011 (6), 2012 (7). So the 2007 row is index 2.\n\nIn that row, \"season rank\" is \"69th.\" Therefore, the relevant cells are column_name \"season rank\" at row_index 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Greg Pursley's best ranking was in 2007. However, examining the table shows his season rank for 2007 was 69th, which isn't the highest he achieved (he ranked 1st in 2011). Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
