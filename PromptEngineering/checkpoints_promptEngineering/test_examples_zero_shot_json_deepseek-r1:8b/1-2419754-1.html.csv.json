    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 2 institutions located within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left.\n\nThe claim is about two things: 1) institutions located in Ohio, and 2) their membership in the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So I need to find rows where the location is Ohio and see if these institutions are part of the GMC.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\nRow 0: University of Cincinnati - location is Cincinnati, OH. Type is public. I don't know if they're in GMC, but maybe?\n\nRow 1: University of Dayton - location is Dayton, OH. Private. Not sure about GMC.\n\nRows 2-5: DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, St. Louis \u2014 none are Ohio locations.\n\nSo only rows 0 and 1 are in Ohio.\n\nNow, I need to check if these two institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference. From general knowledge, the GMC includes universities like University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton. Both of them are listed in the table as being founded in 1819 and 1850 respectively. Since both are in Ohio, that's two institutions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by these two rows. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 1 for the 'location' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" Wait, there's a typo here. It should probably say \"are\" instead of \"be\". So the corrected claim would be \"5 out of the 6 institutions that are in the Great Midwest Conference joined the conference in 1991.\"\n\nNow, I need to verify this by looking at the table provided. Let me first look at the columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left.\n\nThe claim is about when institutions joined the conference in 1991, so the relevant column for joining date would be \"joined\". Each row represents an institution, so I need to check each of them to see if they joined in 1991.\n\nNext, I should figure out which institutions are part of the Great Midwest Conference. From the data, let's list all the institutions:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati\n2. University of Dayton\n3. DePaul University\n4. Marquette University\n5. University of Memphis\n6. Saint Louis University\n\nWait, I'm not sure if these are all part of the same conference. The Great Midwest Conference might have multiple members, but perhaps only some of them joined in 1991.\n\nLooking at the \"joined\" column:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1991\n- University of Dayton: 1993\n- DePaul University: 1991\n- Marquette University: 1991\n- University of Memphis: 1991\n- Saint Louis University: 1991\n\nSo, all except University of Dayton joined in 1991. That's five institutions (Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, Saint Louis) joining in 1991.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"5 out of the 6 institutions in the Great Midwest Conference joined in 1991\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need each row where \"joined\" is 1991. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 0 (University of Cincinnati): joined=1991\n- Row 2 (DePaul University): joined=1991\n- Row 3 (Marquette University): joined=1991\n- Row 4 (University of Memphis): joined=1991\n- Row 5 (Saint Louis University): joined=1991\n\nWait, but the rows are from 0 to 5. So row indices 0,2,3,4,5 have \"joined\" as 1991.\n\nHowever, the claim refers to six institutions. But in the table, there are six entries. Wait, the user didn't specify which conference these are part of, but perhaps the Great Midwest Conference includes all six? If that's the case, then five out of six joined in 1991.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be rows 0,2,3,4,5 because their \"joined\" year is 1991. The only one not joining in 1991 is row 1 (University of Dayton) which joined in 1993.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE and the relevant cells are those with row indices 0,2,3,4,5 in the \"joined\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be TRUE as five out of six institutions joined the conference in 1991. The relevant rows are identified by their indices where the joined year matches 1991.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"there be 2 public institution that be member of the great midwest conference.\" Hmm, first, I need to understand what each part of this means.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left. The claim is about public institutions being members of the Great Midwest Conference. So, my task is to check how many public institutions in the table are part of this conference.\n\nWait, I should probably know what the Great Midwest Conference includes. From my knowledge, the Great Midwest Conference (GMC) is a college football conference, and it's part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). It has several member schools, including some public universities. But in the table provided, each institution might or might not be in this conference.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't explicitly mention whether each institution is part of any specific conference. So, how can I verify that? The columns given are just institutional details like location and type (public vs private). There's no conference affiliation mentioned. So maybe the table isn't sufficient to confirm the claim.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way the data is structured might give a hint. Let me check each row in the table to see if any have information that could be related to conference membership. The \"joined\" and \"left\" columns indicate when they joined or left an organization, which could be a conference. Maybe that's relevant.\n\nSo for each public institution, I need to look at their \"joined\" year. If it's around the time when the Great Midwest Conference was established, maybe they're part of it. But actually, without knowing what specific years those institutions joined the GMC, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"member\" refers to being a current member now, not just historical data. So if their \"joined\" year is recent enough, or if they are still active members as per the table's last updated date (which I don't know), but since the data only goes up to 1995 for \"left,\" maybe the institutions that joined in the early '90s and didn't leave are current members.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Founded 1819, public, joined 1991.\n2. University of Dayton: Founded 1850, private, joined 1993.\n3. DePaul University: Founded 1898, private, joined 1991.\n4. Marquette University: Founded 1881, private, joined 1991.\n5. University of Memphis: Founded 1912, public, joined 1991.\n6. Saint Louis University: Founded 1818, private, joined 1991.\n\nSo the public institutions are Cincinnati and Memphis, both joined in 1991. Now, I need to check if these two universities are indeed members of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nWait, from what I know, both the University of Cincinnati and the University of Memphis are part of the American Athletic Conference (AAC), which is a successor to the Big East Conference. The AAC includes schools like UCF, Tulsa, Temple, etc., but not sure about Cincinnati and Memphis. Alternatively, maybe they're in different conferences.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the Great Midwest Conference might be a Division II conference now, while these universities are D-I. So perhaps the term \"member\" in the claim refers to a specific time or context that isn't captured here.\n\nBut given that the table only shows joined and left years as 1991-1995, maybe that's the timeframe for conference changes. If both Cincinnati and Memphis joined the GMC around 1991 and didn't leave until 1995, they might still be members. But I'm not entirely sure if these specific universities are part of the Great Midwest Conference or another conference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is a general statement about the number of public institutions that are currently members, regardless of their actual status. So in the table, there are two public institutions (Cincinnati and Memphis). If both are indeed members of the GMC now, then the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nBut without external knowledge, I can't confirm whether these two are in the GMC or not. The table doesn't provide conference information, only location, type, enrollment, etc. So based solely on the data given, there are two public institutions (Cincinnati and Memphis) with their \"joined\" year as 1991.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"member of the great midwest conference.\" If the term \"member\" refers to being part of it currently or historically, then if they joined in 1991 and didn't leave by 1995, they might still be members. So maybe it's correct that there are two public institutions (Cincinnati and Memphis) as members.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain because the table doesn't explicitly mention conference affiliations, only when they joined or left organizations. Therefore, without knowing their current status, I can't confirm if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on this data alone.\n\nWait, but maybe \"joined\" refers to joining a conference at that time, and if they didn't leave until 1995, then as of now (assuming 2023), they might still be members. So if both Cincinnati and Memphis are in the GMC as of today, then the claim is TRUE because there are two public institutions.\n\nBut I'm not sure about their current memberships. For example, the University of Cincinnati is part of the AAC, and Memphis is also in the AAC now. So they might not be in the Great Midwest Conference anymore. That would make the claim FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"great midwest conference\" refers to a different context or time period. Without knowing for sure, I can't be certain.\n\nBut according to the table, there are two public institutions (Cincinnati and Memphis) that joined around 1991. If they're still members now, then the claim is TRUE; if not, it's FALSE.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide their current status beyond 1995, perhaps we can only go by the data given. Therefore, the relevant cells would be those indicating public institutions (Cincinnati and Memphis) with their joined years, which are in row index 0 and 4 respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about whether there are two public institutions that are members of the Great Midwest Conference. From the table, both the University of Cincinnati (row 0) and the University of Memphis (row 4) are public and joined the conference in 1991. If they are still current members as of now, the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE. However, based solely on the data provided, we can only confirm that there are two public institutions with the relevant details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"University of Cincinnati have 27572 more student enroll than Saint Louis University.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate both universities in the table. Let's see: the first row is University of Cincinnati with an enrollment number of 41357. The last row is Saint Louis University with an enrollment of 13785.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check the \"enrollment\" column for both schools because that directly relates to the number of students enrolled. So the relevant cells are for the row indices 0 and 5 (since it's zero-indexed) in the \"enrollment\" column.\n\nCalculating the difference: 41357 minus 13785 equals 27572, which matches the claim exactly.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"3 of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions three members of the Great Midwest Conference that were founded before 1860. So my first step is to figure out which universities in the table are part of the Great Midwest Conference and then check their founding dates.\n\nLooking at the table, the institutions listed are:\n1. University of Cincinnati\n2. University of Dayton\n3. DePaul University\n4. Marquette University\n5. University of Memphis\n6. Saint Louis University\n\nI need to confirm if these are members of the Great Midwest Conference. From my general knowledge, I think DePaul, Marquette, and others might be part of it, but I'm not entirely sure about all six. However, since the claim refers to \"the member\" plural, implying more than one, I should check each university's membership in the conference.\n\nAssuming that all six are indeed members (though I might need to verify that), next I need to look at their founding years. The claim specifies before 1860, so any university founded in or after 1860 wouldn't count.\n\nLooking at the \"founded\" column:\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819\n- University of Dayton: 1850\n- DePaul University: 1898\n- Marquette University: 1881\n- University of Memphis: 1912\n- Saint Louis University: 1818\n\nSo, the universities founded before 1860 are:\n1. University of Cincinnati (1819)\n2. Saint Louis University (1818)\n\nWait, that's only two. The claim says three. So unless I'm missing another university in the table that is part of the Great Midwest Conference and was founded before 1860, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I misremembered some of the conference members. For example, University of Memphis might not be a member, or perhaps another institution from the list isn't part of the conference. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my initial assumption about membership.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about three universities in the table that were founded before 1860, regardless of conference membership, but I think the wording implies they are members of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nWait, another angle: if only two universities from the list were founded before 1860, then the claim that three were would be FALSE. But perhaps I missed one. Let me check each again:\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati: 1819 \u2013 yes\nSaint Louis University: 1818 \u2013 yes\nAre there any others? Dayton is 1850, which is just after 1860? Wait, no, 1850 is before 1860. So that's three: Cincinnati (1819), Saint Louis (1818), and Dayton (1850). But wait, 1850 is still before 1860.\n\nWait, but 1850 is before 1860, so that would make it the third university. So that's three: Cincinnati, Saint Louis, and Dayton.\n\nSo in the table:\n- University of Cincinnati: founded 1819\n- University of Dayton: founded 1850\n- Saint Louis University: founded 1818\n\nThat makes three universities from the Great Midwest Conference (assuming all six are members) that were founded before 1860. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but the table shows both public and private institutions. But since the claim doesn't specify type, it's just about the founding date.\n\nSo relevant cells would be the rows for University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, and Saint Louis University, each checking their \"founded\" year.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we first identify the relevant universities in the table that are part of the Great Midwest Conference. Then, we check if three of them were founded before 1860.\n\n1. **University of Cincinnati**: Founded in 1819 (before 1860).\n2. **University of Dayton**: Founded in 1850 (before 1860).\n3. **Saint Louis University**: Founded in 1818 (before 1860).\n\nThese three universities meet the condition, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's stating that there's only one university in Ohio that's part of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). \n\nLooking at the table, I see the columns are: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left.\n\nI need to focus on the 'location' column because the claim is about institutions located in Ohio. So, any row where \"location\" includes \"Ohio\" would be relevant.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the data:\n\n1. First row: location is \"cincinnati , ohio\". So this is a university in Ohio.\n2. Second row: location is \"dayton , ohio\". Another one in Ohio.\n3. Third row: Chicago, Illinois \u2013 not Ohio.\n4. Fourth row: Milwaukee, Wisconsin \u2013 nope.\n5. Fifth row: Memphis, Tennessee \u2013 no.\n6. Sixth row: St. Louis, Missouri \u2013 no.\n\nSo there are two institutions in the table that are located in Ohio: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton.\n\nNow, checking if only one is a member of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). But wait, I don't see any column in the table that lists conference affiliations. The columns provided are about each institution's details but not their current or historical conferences.\n\nSo, without information on which conferences these institutions belong to, I can't verify if only one is in GMC. Therefore, the claim might be based on an assumption not supported by the data given.\n\nWait, perhaps 'type' refers to public vs private. Maybe that's a clue? The second row for Dayton is \"private\", but Cincinnati is \"public.\" But conference membership isn't indicated here.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data in the table about conferences or memberships, I can't confirm if only one Ohio institution is part of GMC.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination. The claim says: \"all 6 institution join the great midwest conference at the same time in 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I should look into each institution's data and see when they joined. From the table, each row represents an institution with various details including their nickname, location, founding year, type, enrollment numbers, and when they joined and left.\n\nThe key columns here are \"joined\" because that's directly related to when they might have joined a conference. The claim mentions 1991 as the year they all joined together, so I should check each institution's \"joined\" year.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Joined in 1991.\n2. University of Dayton: Joined in 1993.\n3. DePaul University: Joined in 1991.\n4. Marquette University: Joined in 1991.\n5. University of Memphis: Joined in 1991.\n6. Saint Louis University: Joined in 1991.\n\nWait, so the first five institutions joined in 1991 except for the University of Dayton, which joined in 1993. The claim says all 6 joined in 1991, but that's not true because Dayton joined a year later. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: For each institution, I need their row index and the \"joined\" column since that's where the discrepancy lies. Specifically, Saint Louis University (row 5) joined in 1991, so it supports the claim. But the University of Dayton (row 1) joined in 1993, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, both rows should be included as they show whether each institution met the condition or not.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about all six joining at the same time in 1991. So for each row, if their \"joined\" year is 1991, that's relevant. If it's different, like 1993, then it's a counterexample. Therefore, the relevant cells would be the \"joined\" column for each row because only some of them match the claim.\n\nBut in the instructions, they want to include all rows where the information is relevant. So for this case, since five institutions joined in 1991 and one didn't, I should mark each \"joined\" cell as relevant because they show whether they joined in that year or not. Alternatively, maybe only those that joined in 1991 are relevant because they support the claim, while those who didn't (like Dayton) disprove it. So perhaps only rows where \"joined\" is 1991 are relevant to support the claim.\n\nWait, let me think again. The task is to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant. The condition here is whether all six joined the conference at the same time in 1991. So for each institution, their \"joined\" year is important. If it's 1991, that supports the claim; if not, it doesn't.\n\nSo, to verify the claim fully, I need to check each institution's \"joined\" value. Therefore, all rows have a relevant cell in the \"joined\" column because that's where the claim's condition is checked. So each row has a \"row_index\" and \"column_name\": \"joined\".\n\nThus, for each row, their \"joined\" value is part of verifying the claim. So the relevant_cells would be all six entries in the \"joined\" column.\n\nBut wait, maybe only those that are 1991 are relevant because they support the claim, while others might not be as relevant. However, according to the instructions, I need to include any cell where a condition is checked. Since the claim's condition is about whether each institution joined in 1991, checking each \"joined\" value is necessary.\n\nTherefore, all six rows have their \"joined\" column as relevant because it directly addresses whether they joined at that time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all six institutions joined the Great Midwest Conference in 1991. By examining the table, we see that five institutions joined in 1991 (University of Cincinnati, DePaul University, Marquette University, University of Memphis, and Saint Louis University), while the University of Dayton joined in 1993.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"only private institutions be member of the great midwest conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that only private institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So, my goal is to check each institution listed in the table and see if they are part of the GMC and whether they are private or not.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five institutions: University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, DePaul University, Marquette University, and Saint Louis University. Each row has several columns, including \"type\" which can be either \"public\" or \"private.\"\n\nI need to check for each institution two things:\n1. Is the institution a member of the Great Midwest Conference?\n2. What type is it (public or private)?\n\nBut wait, I realize that the table doesn't explicitly mention the conferences each institution is part of. It only provides details like location, founding year, and type. So, perhaps I need to infer based on the claim's context.\n\nThe claim refers to \"the great midwest conference,\" which I believe is a real organization or group of institutions. However, without the table providing the membership details, my approach might be flawed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the term \"member\" here refers to being part of some group or conference, but since the table doesn't list conferences, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that only private institutions are members of the GMC. So regardless of whether these specific institutions are in the GMC, the claim is about the type (private) and membership. But without knowing the actual members, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is a list of all GMC members, so I need to check if all listed institutions are indeed private. But looking at the \"type\" column:\n- University of Cincinnati: public\n- University of Dayton: private\n- DePaul University: private\n- Marquette University: private\n- Saint Louis University: private\n\nSo out of these five, one is public (University of Cincinnati) and four are private. If the claim says \"only private,\" but there's at least one public institution in the list, then the claim would be false because it's not true that only private institutions are members; some public ones are also included.\n\nBut wait, I'm assuming that the table is the full list of GMC members. However, I don't know if these five are all or just a subset. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the claim is about whether in this table, any public institution is part of the GMC.\n\nWait, maybe the question is whether, among the institutions listed in the table, only private ones are part of some conference (GMC). But since University of Cincinnati is public and presumably part of a conference (maybe not GMC), then the claim would be false because it's not that only private ones are members; at least one public is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all GMC members, in which case having a public institution makes the claim false. So I think the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's at least one public institution (University of Cincinnati) that is a member of the conference, contradicting the claim that only private institutions are members.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: for each row where the type is \"public,\" we need to note their column details. Specifically, looking for \"type\" and possibly other info.\n\nIn the table:\n- Row 0: University of Cincinnati, public\n- Row 1: Dayton, private\n- Row 2: DePaul, private\n- Row 3: Marquette, private\n- Row 4: Saint Louis, private\n\nSo only row 0 is public. Therefore, the relevant cells would be column \"type\" in that row.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because there's at least one public institution (U of Cincinnati) that is a member of the conference, which contradicts the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrollment as saint louis university.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify where in the table these two universities are located. Let's look at the data rows.\n\nIn the first row, it's the University of Cincinnati. Their enrollment is listed as 41357. Then, looking for Saint Louis University, that's in the fifth row, right? Wait, no, let me check again. The rows are:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: enrollment 41357\n2. University of Dayton: 11186\n3. DePaul University: 24966\n4. Marquette University: 12002\n5. University of Memphis: 22365\n6. Saint Louis University: 13785\n\nWait, no. Wait, the order in the data array is:\n\nRow 0: U of Cincinnati\nRow 1: U of Dayton\nRow 2: DePaul\nRow 3: Marquette\nRow 4: U of Memphis\nRow 5: Saint Louis\n\nSo, the fifth row (index 5) is Saint Louis with enrollment 13785. \n\nThe claim compares the University of Cincinnati's enrollment to Saint Louis'. So I need to check if both have the same number. \n\nUniversity of Cincinnati has 41,357 students enrolled. Saint Louis has 13,785. These numbers are quite different\u201441k vs 13k. So they don't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the University of Cincinnati's enrollment (41357) does not equal Saint Louis University's enrollment (13785).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"More than half of the members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what data I have in the table. Let me look at the columns. They include institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left. So the key here is probably the \"founded\" column because it tells when each school was established.\n\nThe claim is about the Great Midwest Conference. Wait, but looking at the data, I don't see any information about the conference itself. The table lists universities with their details but doesn't mention conferences or when they joined a conference like the Great Midwest Conference. So maybe the \"joined\" column is relevant here because it might indicate when each institution became part of the conference.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the founding dates of the institutions relative to 1860. So I need to check how many schools were founded before 1860 and compare that number to half of the total members in the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nBut wait, do I know which universities are part of the Great Midwest Conference? The table lists several universities: University of Cincinnati, Dayton, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, and Saint Louis. Are all these part of the Great Midwest Conference?\n\nAssuming they are part of the conference, let's see their founding dates. Looking at each row:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati was founded in 1819.\n2. University of Dayton in 1850.\n3. DePaul in 1898.\n4. Marquette in 1881.\n5. Memphis in 1912.\n6. Saint Louis in 1818.\n\nNow, let's count how many were founded before 1860. Cincinnati (1819) and Saint Louis (1818) are both before 1860. Dayton is 1850, which is also before 1860 because 1850 < 1860? Wait, no, 1850 is less than 1860, so that's three schools: Cincinnati, Dayton, and Saint Louis.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the years:\n\n- 1819: yes, before 1860.\n- 1850: yes, before 1860.\n- 1898: after 1860.\n- 1881: after 1860.\n- 1912: after.\n- 1818: before.\n\nSo that's three schools (Cincinnati, Dayton, Saint Louis) founded before 1860. Now, how many are in the Great Midwest Conference? The table has six universities listed, but I'm not sure if all of them are part of the conference. For example, DePaul and Marquette might be part of different conferences now, like the Big East or Horizon League.\n\nBut assuming that all six are part of the Great Midwest Conference, then more than half would mean more than 3 out of 6, so at least 4. But only three were founded before 1860. So in that case, it's not more than half, which is three out of six.\n\nWait, but if the Great Midwest Conference actually includes all these schools, then three are before 1860 and three after or equal (like Dayton is 1850, which is just before 1860). Wait, no: 1850 is before 1860. So in that case, three out of six.\n\nBut wait, is the University of Dayton considered part of the Great Midwest Conference? I think I might be confusing the conferences. The Great Midwest Conference was probably a different name or part of history. Maybe it's better to think about this as a hypothetical scenario where these universities are indeed members.\n\nSo if there are six members, and three were founded before 1860, that's exactly half, not more than half. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not more than half but exactly half.\n\nWait, no: 3 out of 6 is exactly half, so \"more than half\" would require at least four. So if only three were founded before 1860, then the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the founding dates again:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819\n- University of Dayton: 1850\n- DePaul: 1898\n- Marquette: 1881\n- Memphis: 1912\n- Saint Louis: 1818\n\nSo yes, three were founded before 1860.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"more than half.\" So if there are six members, more than half is four or more. Three is less than that. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we first identify relevant cells in the table. The claim refers to the Great Midwest Conference and the founding dates of its members before 1860.\n\n- **Relevant Columns**: \"founded\"\n- **Relevant Data**: We look at each institution's founding year to check if it was established before 1860.\n\nNext, we analyze the data:\n\n1. **University of Cincinnati (1819)**: Founded in 1819 (before 1860).\n2. **University of Dayton (1850)**: Founded in 1850 (before 1860).\n3. **DePaul University (1898)**: Founded after 1860.\n4. **Marquette University (1881)**: Founded after 1860.\n5. **University of Memphis (1912)**: Founded after 1860.\n6. **Saint Louis University (1818)**: Founded in 1818 (before 1860).\n\nFrom this, three universities were founded before 1860 out of a total of six.
