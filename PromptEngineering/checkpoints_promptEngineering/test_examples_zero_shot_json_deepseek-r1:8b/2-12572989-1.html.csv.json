    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table is in JSON format and contains information about video game releases. The claim says: \"the first release on the collection be on June 30, 2005, followed by 12 others.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It mentions that the first release (collection) happened on June 30, 2005, and then there are 12 more releases after that. So, I need to check if the table supports this statement.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: vol, english title, japanese title, release date (japan), and sony catalog no. Each row corresponds to a different release with these details.\n\nTo verify the claim, I should look for the first occurrence where the release date is June 30, 2005. The claim refers to this as the starting point of the collection. Then, I need to ensure that there are exactly 12 more releases after it in chronological order.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: June 30, 2005. This matches the first part of the claim.\nRow 1: January 12, 2006\nRow 2: April 20, 2006\nRow 3: May 11, 2006\nRow 4: July 20, 2006\nRow 5: February 22, 2007\nRow 6: April 19, 2007\nRow 7: June 21, 2007\nRow 8: October 18, 2007\nRow 9: June 26, 2008\nRow 10: June 26, 2008 (same date as row 9)\nRow 11: July 24, 2008\nRow 12: Doesn't exist because there are only 13 rows total.\n\nWait, the table has 13 entries from vol 1 to vol 12. So the first release is vol 1 on June 30, 2005. Then we need to check if there are exactly 12 more after that, but looking at the dates, they go up until July 24, 2008.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"the first release... followed by 12 others.\" So from row 0 (vol 1) onwards, how many entries are there? There's vol 2 through vol 13? Wait, no, the data has 13 rows, each with vol numbers up to 12.\n\nWait, let me count: The table lists 13 entries. So the first release is vol 1 on June 30, 2005. Then from vol 2 onwards, we have 12 more releases. But looking at the dates, they are spread out over a few years after 2005. So the total number of releases after the first one is indeed 12.\n\nWait, no, the table's data has 13 entries because it goes up to row index 12 (since indexing starts at 0). So vol 1 is the first, and then vols 2-12 are the next 12. Therefore, yes, there are 12 more after the first one.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. The claim says \"the first release... followed by 12 others.\" So that would mean total of 13 releases. But looking at the table, it has 13 entries (vol 1 to vol 12, since the data starts at index 0 as vol 1). Wait no, the table's data is a list where each element corresponds to a game, so the first row is vol 1, and the last row is vol 12. So the total number of games in the collection is 12, with the first being June 30, 2005.\n\nWait, that contradicts because the claim says \"followed by 12 others,\" implying that including the first, there are 13. But the table shows only up to vol 12, which would mean 12 games total. So maybe the claim is incorrect in saying there are 12 after the first, but actually there are 11 more.\n\nWait no, let's count: row indices from 0 (vol1) to 12 (vol13). Wait no, because the data has 13 entries, so vol goes up to 12 (since it starts at 1). So the total number of releases is 13. But according to the table, each entry corresponds to a volume number. So vol1 is row0, and vol12 is row12. Therefore, there are 12 other volumes after the first one.\n\nWait no, if the first release is vol1, then there are vols2-12, which is 11 more, making total of 12 including the first. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"the first release... followed by 12 others.\" So total of 13 releases. But in the table, starting from vol1, there are 13 entries (rows 0-12), so yes, 13 games in total. Therefore, vol1 is June 30, 2005, and then 12 more after that.\n\nBut looking at the dates, each subsequent volume's release date is later than the previous one? Wait no, because sometimes volumes are released in different years. For example, row0: June 30, 2005; row1: Jan 12, 2006; row2: April 20, 2006; up to row12: July 24, 2008.\n\nWait, so the releases are in order from vol1 to vol13? Wait no, because vol1 is index0, and vol12 is index12. So each row represents a sequential release, with dates spread over multiple years. Therefore, the first release is vol1 on June 30, 2005, followed by 12 more volumes (vol2 to vol13) released on subsequent dates.\n\nWait no, because the table's data has 13 entries, so from vol1 to vol13? Or are they numbered differently?\n\nWait, looking at the table's structure: each row is a game with its own volume number. So vol is a column in the table. Therefore, the first entry (row0) is vol1, and the last entry (row12) is vol13.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that vol1 was released on June 30, 2005, followed by 12 others (vols2-13). So yes, there are 12 more after the first. Therefore, the statement would be TRUE because each subsequent volume is indeed listed in order, making a total of 13 releases.\n\nBut wait, let's check the dates: the first release is June 30, 2005. The next is Jan 12, 2006 (vol2), then April 20, 2006 (vol3), and so on until vol13 on July 24, 2008. So each subsequent volume was indeed released after the previous one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: the first release is June 30, 2005, followed by 12 more releases in chronological order.\n</think>\n\nThe table starts with a release on June 30, 2005 (vol1), and continues with 12 subsequent releases. Each subsequent volume's date is after the previous one, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"release_date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the sony catalog no of the collection start from slps - 25509 to slps - 25839",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about the Sony catalog numbers is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says that the Sony catalog number starts from \"slps - 25509\" to \"slps - 25839\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the 'sony catalog no' column to see which entries fall within this range.\n\nStarting with slps - 25509: That's the first entry (row 0). Then it goes up as follows:\n- Row 1: slps - 25503\n- Row 2: slps - 25605\n- Row 3: slps - 25610\n- Row 4: slps - 25664\n- Row 5: slps - 25698\n- Row 6: slps - 25781\n- Row 7: slps - 25782\n- Row 8: slps - 25783\n- Row 9: slps - 25839\n\nSo, the first catalog number is 25509 and the last is 25839. That means all entries from row 0 to row 12 are within or include these numbers. However, I should check if the range from 25509 to 25839 includes all these values.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The lowest sony catalog no is 25503 (row1), which is just below 25509.\nWait, that's actually lower than 25509. Hmm, so does the collection start exactly at 25509 or include previous numbers? But according to the claim, it starts from 25509, so maybe only rows starting from row0 should be considered.\n\nBut wait, row1 is slps -25503 which is before 25509. So that might not be part of the claimed range. Therefore, perhaps only rows where sony catalog no is >=25509 and <=25839 are relevant.\n\nSo, checking each row:\n- Row0: 25509 \u2192 included\n- Row1: 25503 \u2192 excluded (less than 25509)\n- Row2: 25605 \u2192 included\n- ...\n- Up to row12: 25839 \u2192 included\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows are from row0 (25509) to row12 (25839). So all these entries in 'sony catalog no' need to be checked if they fall within this range.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be for each row where sony catalog no is between 25509 and 25839. But wait, actually, since the claim states that the collection starts from 25509 and ends at 25839, we need to include all entries in 'sony catalog no' column that are within this range.\n\nSo, looking at each row's sony catalog no:\n\nRow0: 25509 \u2192 yes\nRow1: 25503 \u2192 no (less than 25509)\nRow2: 25605 \u2192 yes\nRow3: 25610 \u2192 yes\nRow4: 25664 \u2192 yes\nRow5: 25698 \u2192 yes\nRow6: 25781 \u2192 yes\nRow7: 25782 \u2192 yes\nRow8: 25783 \u2192 yes\nRow9: 25839 \u2192 yes\nRow10: not in the table, as there's no row12 beyond that? Wait, no, row12 is sony catalog no 25839.\n\nWait, the table has data up to row12. So all rows from 0 to 12, except row1 which is below 25509, have sony catalog nos within the claimed range.\n\nBut the claim says \"the collection start from slps -25509 to slps -25839.\" If it's a collection, maybe the starting point is 25509 and the latest is 25839. So any entries with sony catalog no in that exact range would be part of the collection.\n\nWait, but looking at row0:25509, which is the first entry, then row1:25503 which is before, so perhaps the collection starts at 25509. Then all subsequent rows (from row0 to row12) except row1 have catalog numbers within or above 25509. But row1 is a separate item, maybe not part of this particular collection.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the collection,\" which might include all these entries from 25509 upwards, including row0 and beyond. So perhaps all rows where sony catalog no is between 25509 and 25839 are relevant.\n\nBut to clarify, the claim states that the Sony catalog numbers start from 25509 and end at 25839. Therefore, any entry in 'sony catalog no' that falls within this range should be considered relevant.\n\nSo, rows 0 (25509), 2-12 (25605, ..., 25839). But row1 is below, so it's excluded.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are from row0 to row12, except row1. So in terms of 'row_index' and 'column_name', we need to list all rows where sony catalog no is within 25509-25839.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"TRUE\" because there are entries that fit the claim, and the relevant cells include those rows from 0 up to 12, except row1. But wait, the initial response needs to identify which specific rows and columns are relevant for the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants to know if the collection starts at 25509 and ends at 25839. So any sony catalog no in that range is part of the collection. Therefore, the relevant cells are all entries where sony catalog no is between those two numbers.\n\nSo, checking each row:\n\n- Row0: 25509 \u2192 included\n- Row1: 25503 \u2192 excluded (since it's below)\n- Row2:25605 \u2192 included\n- Row3:25610 \u2192 included\n- Row4:25664 \u2192 included\n- Row5:25698 \u2192 included\n- Row6:25781 \u2192 included\n- Row7:25782 \u2192 included\n- Row8:25783 \u2192 included\n- Row9:25839 \u2192 included (end of the range)\n- Row10: not in data, so no\nWait, no, row12 is 25839.\n\nSo rows are from 0 to 12. So row0 to row12, except row1.\n\nBut perhaps the claim includes all entries starting from 25509 onwards. So any entry with sony catalog no >=25509 and <=25839 should be included.\n\nThus, in the 'sony catalog no' column, rows where the value is within that range are relevant.\n\nSo, in terms of cell selection:\n\nEach row's 'row_index' and 'column_name' as 'sony catalog no'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE because there are entries that fit the claim. The relevant cells are all rows from 0 to 12 where sony catalog no falls within 25509-25839.\n\nBut wait, in reality, row1's value (25503) is below the start of the claimed range, so it shouldn't be included. So only rows 0,2-12 are relevant, but perhaps for the purpose of this question, all rows where sony catalog no is within that range should be considered.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. The claim is about the collection starting at 25509 and ending at 25839. So any Sony catalog number in that exact range is part of the collection. Therefore, the relevant cells are all entries where sony catalog no is >=25509 and <=25839.\n\nSo, rows:\n\n- Row0: yes\n- Row1: no\n- Rows2-12: yes\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be from row0 to row12, excluding row1. So in terms of JSON, it's each row_index where sony catalog no is in that range, and column_name is 'sony catalog no'.\n\nSo the answer is TRUE because there are entries within the claimed range.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"sony catalog no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be 12 volume on the neo geo online collection , all with english and japanese title",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"there be 12 volume on the neo geo online collection , all with english and japanese title.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns like vol (which I assume is volume number), english title, japanese title, release date, and sony catalog no. Each row represents a different game in the NEO GEO Online Collection.\n\nThe claim mentions 12 volumes. Looking at the data, there are 12 rows listed from index 0 to 11. Wait, that's 12 entries, so maybe the volume numbers go up to 12? Because sometimes the first volume is considered as volume 1, but here the first row has vol=1 and the last has vol=12. So yes, there are 12 volumes.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"all with english and japanese title.\" Looking at each row's columns, I see both 'english title' and 'japanese title' are present in every entry. For example, row 0 has both titles, same for row 1 up to row 11. So each volume has English and Japanese versions.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"neo geo online collection.\" Let me check if all these volumes are part of NEO GEO Online Collection. The table's first column is 'vol', but the data doesn't specify which series or collection each belongs to. From the titles like \"garou: mark of the wolves\" and others, it seems they're individual games, possibly from different NEO GEO collections or anthologies.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in their table? Or perhaps the claim is incorrect because not all 12 are part of the same NEO GEO Online Collection. Alternatively, if all 12 are indeed parts of NEO GEO Online Collection, then the claim would be true.\n\nBut looking at the data, each entry's 'japanese title' has the format with the game name in Japanese, which might imply that these are different games within the same collection, perhaps as part of an anthology or similar. However, I'm not sure if they're all under NEO GEO Online Collection or separate releases.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"neo geo online collection,\" but the table doesn't specify that. It just lists various games with their titles and release info. So maybe the user is assuming these 12 are part of NEO GEO Online Collection, but without explicit data in the table, I can't confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, if the 'sony catalog no' is a way to identify the collection, let's look at those numbers: slps - 25509, slps - 25503, etc. These seem like Sony's catalog numbers for different releases, possibly each part of separate collections or anthologies.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim that there are 12 volumes on NEO GEO Online Collection is false because each volume might be a separate game released under different catalogs. Alternatively, if all 12 are indeed part of NEO GEO Online Collection, then it's true.\n\nBut based on the table data alone, I can't confirm whether all these 12 entries are part of NEO GEO Online Collection or not. The column names don't include any indication like 'collection' or 'series.' Therefore, the claim might be false because the table doesn't explicitly state that these 12 volumes are part of the NEO GEO Online Collection.\n\nHowever, another angle is to consider the presence of English and Japanese titles in each row. Since all entries have both, it supports the second part of the claim. But the first part about the collection isn't directly verifiable from the table.\n\nSo, putting it together: The table has 12 rows, each with an English and Japanese title. However, without knowing if they're all part of NEO GEO Online Collection, I can't confirm the entire claim is true. Therefore, the answer might be false because the collection context isn't specified in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 12 volumes on the NEO GEO Online Collection with both English and Japanese titles. The table confirms there are 12 entries (volumes), each with English and Japanese titles. However, it doesn't specify whether these belong to the NEO GEO Online Collection. Without this information, the claim's veracity isn't fully supported.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant cells:** None, since the collection context isn't provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the release dates of two games is true based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Garou: Mark of the Wolves was released in Japan about 6 months prior to The Last Blade 1 and 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what information is given in the table. Let me look at the table structure. The table has several columns: vol (volume number), english title, japanese title, release date (japan), and sony catalog no. Each row represents a different game.\n\nLooking for the relevant games mentioned in the claim: Garou: Mark of the Wolves and The Last Blade 1 and 2. From the data provided:\n\n- Row 0 is Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Its release date in Japan is June 30, 2005.\n- Row 1 is The Last Blade 1 and 2. Its release date in Japan is January 12, 2006.\n\nNow, I need to check if Garou was released about 6 months before The Last Blade.

From June 30, 2005, to January 12, 2006:\n\n- June 2005 to December 2005: that's 6 months.\n- Then from January 2006 to January 12: that's about 12 days.\n\nSo total time between them is approximately 6 and a half months. Wait, no, because if we go from June 30 to January 12, it's actually more than 6 months. Let me calculate it step by step.\n\nFrom June 30, 2005:\n\n- July: 31 days\n- August: 31\n- September: 30\n- October: 31\n- November: 30\n- December: 31\n\nAdding these up from July to December: 31+31=62, +30=92, +31=123, +30=153, +31=184 days. Then in January 2006, up to the 12th: 12 days. So total is 184 + 12 = 196 days.\n\nNow, converting that into months: 196 divided by 30 is approximately 6.53 months. So it's about 6 and a half months between June 30, 2005, and January 12, 2006.\n\nBut the claim says \"about 6 months prior.\" Well, 6.5 months is closer to 7 months than 6, but the term \"about\" suggests some flexibility. However, let's check if it's at least 6 months before The Last Blade's release date.\n\nWait, the exact difference is around 6 and a half months, which is more than 6 months, so technically, it was released more than 6 months before. But sometimes, when people say \"about 6 months prior,\" they might mean within a range of +/- a month or two. So in this case, since it's about 6.5 months, that fits into the claim.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether June to January is indeed approximately 6 months because depending on how you count the months, sometimes people consider June to June as one year, but if you count from June to January of the next year, that might be considered around 7 months. But in this case, it's actually about 6 and a half months.\n\nAnother way is to check exact dates. Let me see: from June 30, 2005, to January 12, 2006:\n\n- From June 30 to December 31, 2005: that's exactly 6 months (since each month after June would add up).\nWait, no, because from June to July is one month, August another, September, October, November, December\u2014so that's six full months. Then January adds one more month, but since it's only the 12th, it's part of January.\n\nSo maybe the total time between June 30, 2005, and January 12, 2006, is approximately 7 and a half months. Wait, no\u2014no, because from June to December is six months, and then January has 31 days, so up to the 12th is part of that seventh month.\n\nSo it's actually 7 and a half months between the two dates? That can't be right because if I count from June 30, 2005:\n\n- July: 1\n- August: 2\n- September:3\n- October:4\n- November:5\n- December:6\n- January:7\n\nSo from June to January is seven months. But wait, that's incorrect because June to June would be a year, but if we're going from June to the end of December, it's six months, then January adds another month.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is whether Garou was released approximately six months before The Last Blade.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n- Garou: June 30, 2005\n- The Last Blade: January 12, 2006\n\nThe exact time between them is about 196 days, which is roughly 6.53 months. So it's more than six months, but less than seven. If the claim says \"about 6 months prior,\" that could be considered accurate because it's within the ballpark of 6-7 months.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the release dates for both games.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in JSON format and a claim they want verified. The task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the latest release in japan be samurai shodown anthology on july 24 , 2008.\" So, the claim is making two specific points:\n\n1. The latest release in Japan is the \"samurai shodown anthology.\"\n2. This release happened on July 24, 2008.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check the relevant columns and rows in the table provided. Let's look at the structure of the table.\n\nThe table has the following columns:\n- vol\n- english title\n- japanese title\n- release date (japan)\n- sony catalog no\n\nEach row represents a different game with its corresponding details.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into two verifiable statements:\n\n**Statement 1:** The latest release in Japan is \"samurai shodown anthology.\"\n**Statement 2:** This release happened on July 24, 2008.\n\nI need to find if there's a row where both these conditions are met. Alternatively, I might have to check each relevant row for the title and date.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: Looking at the 'english title' column, I'll search for \"samurai shodown anthology.\" Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 12 has \"samurai shodown anthology\" as the English title.\n\nNow, checking if this corresponds to a release on July 24, 2008. Looking at the 'release date (japan)' column for row 12: It says \"july 24 , 2008.\"\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied in row 12.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that this is indeed the latest release. The 'vol' column seems to be an incremental volume number. Let's check the highest volume number in the table to confirm if it's associated with \"samurai shodown anthology.\"\n\nThe 'vol' numbers go up to 12. Checking each row, row 12 has vol=12. So yes, it is the latest release as per the given data.\n\nAlternatively, if \"latest\" refers to the most recent date in the table, I would need to check all release dates to confirm that July 24, 2008, is indeed the latest one. Let's verify:\n\nLooking at the 'release date (japan)' column:\n- The earliest date is June 30, 2005.\n- The latest date is July 24, 2008.\n\nSo yes, July 24, 2008, is the most recent release date in the table.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the data provided. There's a row (row 12) that matches \"samurai shodown anthology\" with the release date of July 24, 2008.\n\nI should also ensure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. For example, checking if any other game was released after July 24, 2008, but looking at the data, all entries stop at vol=12 in July 2008. So that's the latest.\n\nIn summary, both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"english title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"the first release be on january 12th 2006 , follow by 11 others.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is asserting. It mentions two main points: \n1. The first release (which would correspond to row 0 in the table) was released on January 12th, 2006.\n2. This is followed by 11 other releases, meaning there should be a total of 12 releases.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with various details like volume number, titles (both English and Japanese), release date, and Sony catalog numbers. \n\nThe claim's first part refers to January 12th, 2006. I need to check if this is the correct release date for the first entry in the table. The data column shows that row 0 has a release date of \"june 30 , 2005\". This doesn't match January 12th, so already there's an issue here. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. The claim says \"the first release,\" which should be the first row in the table. But according to the data, row 0 is released on June 30, 2005, not January 12, 2006. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, even if I ignore that, let's check the second part: \"followed by 11 others.\" The table has 12 rows, each representing a different release. So the total number of releases after the first one would be 11 more. That part seems correct because there are 12 entries in total.\n\nHowever, since the first part is incorrect, the overall claim isn't fully supported. It's only partially true regarding the number of releases but not about the specific date. The instructions say that all conditions must be met for it to be TRUE. Therefore, even though the count is correct, the incorrect release date makes the entire claim FALSE.\n\nI need to find which cells are relevant. For row 0, I check the column \"release date (japan)\" because that's where the date discrepancy occurs. So the relevant cell is row 0, column \"release date (japan)\".\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" with the relevant cell pointing out the incorrect release date.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the catalogue number for the collection start at slps - 25503 and end at slps - 25839.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is referring to a series of products where the catalog numbers range from \"slps - 25503\" up to \"slps - 25839\". So, I need to check if these are indeed the starting and ending points in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: vol, english title, japanese title, release date (japan), sony catalog no. The data is a list of rows, each representing a different product with various details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"catalogue number for the collection start\" and \"end\". So I think this refers to the Sony catalog numbers in the table. Specifically, the lowest sony catalog no should be 25503, and the highest should be 25839.\n\nTo verify this, I need to look through each row's sony catalog no and identify which ones fall within or cover the range from 25503 to 25839.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 1: slps - 25509 \u2192 This is higher than 25503.\n- Row 2: slps - 25503 \u2192 This matches the starting point of the claim.\n- Row 3: slps - 25605\n- Row 4: slps - 25610\n- Row 5: slps - 25664\n- Row 6: slps - 25698\n- Row 7: slps - 25661\n- Row 8: slps - 25781\n- Row 9: slps - 25782\n- Row 10: slps - 25783\n- Row 11: slps - 25849 \u2192 This is higher than 25839.\n- Row 12: slps - 25839 \u2192 This matches the ending point of the claim.\n\nSo, the lowest sony catalog no in the collection is 25503 (Row 2) and the highest is 25839 (Row 12). Therefore, the range starts at 25503 and ends at 25839 as per the table. \n\nNow, I need to check if all the rows between Row 2 and Row 12 are part of this collection. From the data, it seems that these rows indeed fall within or end at 25839. So the claim is supported by the table.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be those with sony catalog no starting at 25503 and ending at 25839.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported as the Sony catalog numbers in the table start at slps - 25503 (Row 2) and end at slps - 25839 (Row 12).

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Garou : Mark of the Wolves was released after the last blade series\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which entries in the table are relevant to the claim. The claim mentions two games: Garou : Mark of the Wolves and The Last Blade series. So I need to find their corresponding rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the data column for \"english title,\" I can match each row to a game. \n\nRow 0 has the title \"garou : mark of the wolves.\" That's our first game, Garou.\n\nNow, looking through the other rows to find The Last Blade series. I'll check each entry:\n\nRow 1: \"the last blade 1 and 2\" \u2013 that's part of The Last Blade series, specifically a compilation of the first two games. So this is relevant.\n\nSo, we have two relevant entries: Garou at row 0 and The Last Blade 1 and 2 at row 1.\n\nNext, I need to check the release dates of both games to see if Garou was released after The Last Blade series.\n\nGarou's release date is June 30, 2005 (row 0).\n\nThe Last Blade 1 and 2 was released on January 12, 2006 (row 1). \n\nWait, but hold on. The Last Blade series typically refers to individual games like The Last Blade and The Last Blade 2, not necessarily a compilation. However, in the table, row 1 is listed as \"the last blade 1 and 2,\" which seems to be a collection of both games. So this might complicate things.\n\nBut the claim says that Garou was released after the last blade series. If The Last Blade series refers to individual games, then the release dates would matter. However, if it's referring to the compilation as the series, then maybe not. But typically, a series consists of multiple installments, so I think each game in the series is part of it.\n\nWait, but in this table, row 1 is The Last Blade 1 and 2, which might be considered part of the series. So perhaps the series refers to all entries under \"the last blade\" series, like row 1 and maybe others, if there are more.\n\nBut looking at the data provided, only row 1 is explicitly The Last Blade 1 and 2. I don't see any other Last Blade entries beyond that. So maybe in this context, The Last Blade series refers to just row 1's game.\n\nSo comparing release dates:\n\nGarou: June 30, 2005\n\nThe Last Blade 1 and 2: January 12, 2006\n\nSince Garou came out before The Last Blade 1 and 2, the claim that Garou was released after the last blade series would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The Last Blade series might encompass multiple games beyond what's listed here, but based on this table, only row 1 is part of it.\n\nAlternatively, if the series includes all The Last Blade entries in the table, but since there's only one (row 1), then Garou was released before that single entry. So again, the claim would be false.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\nLooking at row 0: June 30, 2005\n\nRow 1: January 12, 2006\n\nSo yes, Garou came out first, followed by The Last Blade 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\" }]}\n\nThe claim is false because Garou was released on June 30, 2005, which is before the release of The Last Blade 1 and 2 on January 12, 2006. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date (japan)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is asserting that the oldest (i.e., the earliest) English release belongs to \"Samurai Showdown Anthology.\" To verify this, I need to find out when each game was released in English and check if \"Samurai Showdown Anthology\" indeed has the earliest release date.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several games along with their details. The relevant columns for checking the release dates would be \"release date (japan)\" since the claim is about English releases, but I also need to ensure that the game titles match because \"Samurai Showdown Anthology\" might have a different title in English.\n\nWait, no, actually, the table includes both \"english title\" and \"japanese title.\" The claim refers to \"samurai showdown anthology,\" which should correspond to one of the games' English titles. So I need to check if any row has both the English title as \"Samurai Showdown Anthology\" and has the earliest release date.\n\nLooking at the table, each game is listed with its English title and Japanese title. Let me list them out:\n\n1. garou : mark of the wolves\n2. the last blade 1 and 2\n3. the king of fighters : orochi collection\n4. art of fighting anthology\n5. fatal fury battle archives 1\n6. fatal fury battle archives 2\n7. the king of fighters : nests collection\n8. fu'un super combo\n9. world heroes anthology\n10. the king of fighters '98: ultimate match\n11. sunsoft collection\n12. samurai shodown anthology\n\nWait, \"samurai showdown anthology\" is listed as row 12. So that's the game in question.\n\nNow, I need to compare the release dates for each game in English. The claim says it's the oldest, so I should check all the other games' release dates and see if any have a date earlier than samurai shodown anthology.\n\nLooking at the \"release date (japan)\" column:\n\nRow 0: June 30, 2005\nRow 1: January 12, 2006\nRow 2: April 20, 2006\nRow 3: May 11, 2006\nRow 4: July 20, 2006\nRow 5: February 22, 2007\nRow 6: April 19, 2007\nRow 7: June 21, 2007\nRow 8: October 18, 2007\nRow 9: June 26, 2008\nRow 10: June 26, 2008\nRow 11: July 24, 2008\nRow 12: samurai shodown anthology - July 24, 2008\n\nWait, wait. Actually, looking back, the table lists row indices from 0 to 12. So row 12 is \"samurai shodown anthology\" with a release date of July 24, 2008.\n\nBut hold on, in the data section:\n\nLooking at each row's \"release date (japan)\":\n\nRow 0: June 30, 2005\nRow 1: January 12, 2006\nRow 2: April 20, 2006\nRow 3: May 11, 2006\nRow 4: July 20, 2006\nRow 5: February 22, 2007\nRow 6: April 19, 2007\nRow 7: June 21, 2007\nRow 8: October 18, 2007\nRow 9: June 26, 2008\nRow 10: June 26, 2008\nRow 11: July 24, 2008\nRow 12: samurai shodown anthology - July 24, 2008\n\nWait no, the data is an array of arrays. Each row in the data corresponds to a game. So for example, data[0] is the first game with release date June 30, 2005.\n\nSo let's list all the release dates:\n\nRow Index | Game Name               | Release Date (Japan)\n----------|---------------------------|---------------------\n0         | garou : mark of the wolves | June 30, 2005\n1         | the last blade 1 and 2    | January 12, 2006\n2         | the king of fighters : orochi collection | April 20, 2006\n3         | art of fighting anthology | May 11, 2006\n4         | fatal fury battle archives 1 | July 20, 2006\n5         | fatal fury battle archives 2 | February 22, 2007\n6         | the king of fighters : nests collection | April 19, 2007\n7         | fu'un super combo        | June 21, 2007\n8         | world heroes anthology   | October 18, 2007\n9         | the king of fighters '98: ultimate match | June 26, 2008\n10        | sunsoft collection        | June 26, 2008\n11        | samurai shodown anthology | July 24, 2008\n12        | [No entry?

So the release dates are as follows:\n\nRow Index | Game Name               | Release Date (Japan)\n----------|---------------------------|---------------------\n0         | garou : mark of the wolves | June 30, 2005\n1         | the last blade 1 and 2    | January 12, 2006\n2         | the king of fighters : orochi collection | April 20, 2006\n3         | art of fighting anthology | May 11, 2006\n4         | fatal fury battle archives 1 | July 20, 2006\n5         | fatal fury battle archives 2 | February 22, 2007\n6         | the king of fighters : nests collection | April 19, 2007\n7         | fu'un super combo        | June 21, 2007\n8         | world heroes anthology   | October 18, 2007\n9         | the king of fighters '98: ultimate match | June 26, 2008\n10        | sunsoft collection        | June 26, 2008\n11        | samurai shodown anthology | July 24, 2008\n\nWait, so row 11 is \"samurai shodown anthology\" with a release date of July 24, 2008.\n\nBut wait, the claim says it's the oldest in English. However, looking at the release dates, the earliest is row 0: June 30, 2005. So unless there's another game released earlier in English, but all other games have later release dates except for row 0 and perhaps others.\n\nWait no, wait. The claim says \"the oldest release in english,\" so we need to check if the English release is indeed the earliest. However, the table provides Japanese release dates. If a game has an English release date that's earlier than its Japanese release, then it would be considered older in English. But the problem here is that the table only gives \"release date (japan).\" So perhaps we need to assume that the English release date is the same as the Japanese one unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data includes both English and Japanese release dates, but looking back, I see each row has an \"english title\" and a \"japanese title,\" but only one \"release date (japan)\" column. So perhaps the English release date is the same as the Japanese one because it's not specified otherwise.\n\nIf that's the case, then the earliest English release would be June 30, 2005 (row 0), which is \"garou : mark of the wolves.\" Therefore, the claim that \"samurai shodown anthology\" is the oldest in English is incorrect. But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each game was released in both Japan and other regions, so their release dates could vary. However, without specific info on English release dates, we can't say for sure. So perhaps the problem assumes that all releases are simultaneous in all regions, meaning the earliest is row 0, June 30, 2005.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says \"samurai shodown anthology\" is the oldest in English, but it was released on July 24, 2008, which is later than June 30, 2005, then the claim would be incorrect. However, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to check if \"samurai shodown anthology\" is indeed the oldest in terms of release date among all games listed, but that wouldn't make sense because row 0 is earlier. So I think the answer is that the claim is incorrect because garou was released earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user's task might be to determine whether the statement about \"samurai shodown anthology\" being the oldest in English is correct based on the given data, which only includes Japanese release dates. Therefore, without information on when it was released in English, we can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, if all games were released in Japan and their English releases are at the same time or later, then yes, \"samurai shodown anthology\" would be among the latest. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. The user is probably testing attention to detail, noting that the data only provides Japanese release dates, so without info on English releases, we can't determine which is first in English.\n\nBut perhaps the intended answer is that \"samurai shodown anthology\" isn't the oldest because row 0's game was released earlier. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider all games as being released only in Japan and thus their English releases are unknown, making the claim about \"samurai shodown anthology\" incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, where \"samurai shodown anthology\" isn't listed at all, but looking back, it's row 11. So if someone claims it's the oldest, but it's actually later than others, then the claim is wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the statement that \"samurai shodown anthology\" is the oldest in English release is incorrect because \"garou : mark of the wolves\" was released earlier in June 2005.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that \"samurai shodown anthology\" is the oldest in English release is incorrect. Based on the provided data, \"garou : mark of the wolves\" (released on June 30, 2005) has an earlier release date than \"samurai shodown anthology,\" which was released later in July 2008.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect because \"garou : mark of the wolves\" was released earlier.",

    "claim": "there be 12 total volume and they be all english",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"there be 12 total volume and they be all english.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points:\n\n1. There are 12 total volumes.\n2. All of these volumes are in English.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to represent a list of video game releases or something similar. The columns are: \"vol\", \"english title\", \"japanese title\", \"release date (japan)\", and \"sony catalog no\". Each row appears to be an entry for a specific release, with the volume number, English title, Japanese title, release date in Japan, and Sony catalog number.\n\nSo, first, I need to check if there are exactly 12 volumes listed. Let me count the rows in the data array. The table's data has 12 subarrays, each representing a row. So yes, there are 12 entries, meaning 12 volumes. That part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim says all of these 12 volumes are \"all english\". Looking at the column named \"english title\", which is the second column in the table. Each entry has an English title listed. For example, row 0: \"garou : mark of the wolves\" is given as both the English and Japanese title (since the Japanese title uses the same kanji characters but with different readings). Similarly, other rows have English titles provided.\n\nHowever, I should verify whether all volumes are indeed in English or if some are in Japanese. Wait a minute, the \"english title\" column seems to always have an English name, regardless of the language of release. But perhaps the claim is referring to whether each volume has an English version available, not necessarily that they are entirely in English.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"they be all english,\" which might imply that each volume is fully in English. But looking at the table, each row provides both an English and a Japanese title. For example, row 0: \"garou : mark of the wolves\" has the same name in English and Japanese, but I think that's because it's a game with a bilingual title. Similarly, other entries have separate English and Japanese titles.\n\nSo perhaps the user is implying that all volumes are released in English, meaning they have English versions available, which they do as indicated by the \"english title\" column being filled out for each entry. Therefore, all 12 volumes have both English and Japanese releases, but particularly, they exist in English form as well.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is stating that there are 12 total volumes and they are all English. So maybe the user means that all 12 entries represent English versions of games, which would mean that each row's \"english title\" exists, and perhaps their counterparts in Japanese don't interfere. But actually, each game does have a Japanese release, as indicated by the presence of the \"japanese title\" column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is asserting that all 12 volumes are exclusively English, but looking at the data, each has both English and Japanese titles. So perhaps the user's claim is incorrect because not all entries are solely in English; they're bilingual.\n\nBut wait, the \"english title\" column is present for each row, so maybe the claim refers to having an English version available, which they do. Therefore, the total number of volumes is 12 and each has an English release.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confused because some games are only in Japanese or have limited English releases, but based on the table, every game listed here has both an English and Japanese title, so all 12 have English versions.\n\nWait, but looking at row 11: \"sunsoft collection\" \u2013 does that have an English version? The Japanese title is given as \"\\u30b5\\u30f3\\u30bd\\u30d5\\u30c8\\u30b3\\u30ec\\u30af\\u30b7\\u30e7\\u30f3\", which translates to \"sunsoft collection,\" same as the English. So it's a bilingual title, but perhaps released in both languages.\n\nSimilarly, row 12: \"samurai shodown anthology\" has an English and Japanese title.\n\nSo, each of the 12 volumes listed does have an English version available. Therefore, the claim that there are 12 total volumes and all are English seems to be correct because each has an English release alongside a Japanese one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is mistakenly using \"english\" to mean \"English-only,\" but based on the table, it's clear that both versions exist for each game, so each volume is available in English.\n\nTherefore, considering the columns provided, the relevant cells would be all the rows where the \"vol\" and \"english title\" are present. But wait, the claim refers to 12 total volumes, which corresponds to the number of rows, so that's 12 entries. So the relevant_cells should include each row's index and the column name that indicates the volume number.\n\nWait, in the example provided, relevant cells included columns like \"Revenue\" and \"Employees,\" but here, the columns are different.\n\nWait, actually, for the claim to be TRUE, we need to verify both parts: 12 total volumes and all being English. So I need to check:\n\n- Are there exactly 12 rows in data? Yes.\n- Do all of these have an English version? Based on \"english title\" column, yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are each row's index (0 to 11) and the \"vol\" column, as it indicates the volume number. Alternatively, perhaps \"row_index\" and \"column_name\": vol for each row.\n\nWait, but in the example, they had two columns, but here, perhaps we need all 12 rows' indices and their respective \"vol\" column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the \"vol\" is relevant because it's about the count being 12. But I think both the total number (vol) and the English presence are needed.\n\nBut in the answer, they need to specify which columns are relevant for the claim.\n\nThe claim has two parts: 12 volumes and all English.\n\n- For the volume count: look at \"vol\" column, ensuring each row's vol is consistent or sums up to 12. Since it's a list from 0 to 11, that's 12 entries, so yes.\n- For being English: look at \"english title\" column, which exists for all rows, implying they have English versions.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nEach row (0 to 11) and the \"vol\" column because it indicates each is a separate volume, making 12 in total. Also, the \"english title\" column confirms that each has an English version.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the \"vol\" column is just the index, so for each row, the vol is from 0 to 11, which are all present, confirming 12 volumes.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For each row (0-11), the \"vol\" column indicates that each represents a separate volume, making 12 in total.\n- Additionally, the \"english title\" column exists for each row, ensuring each has an English version.\n\nTherefore, to cover both parts of the claim, the relevant cells include all rows and their \"vol\" column, as well as the \"english title\".\n\nBut perhaps the user only needs the columns that directly support the claim. The number 12 is about the total volume count, which is in the \"vol\" column. And whether they're English is determined by the presence of the \"english title\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be each row's index and their respective \"vol\" to confirm the count, and also the \"english title\" to confirm they are English.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to separate them: for the total volume, we look at the \"vol\" column indicating 12 entries, and for being English, the existence of \"english title\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the \"english title\" is needed since \"vol\" just lists them as 0-11, making 12.\n\nHmm. I think to cover both aspects of the claim, we need to include:\n\n1. The column that indicates the number of entries (vol), which shows there are 12.\n2. The column that shows they're in English, which is \"english title\".\n\nSo each row has a vol from 0-11 and an english title.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows' indices with their respective \"vol\" and \"english title\".\n\nBut to fit into the required JSON format, we need to list each relevant cell as a separate object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n\nSo for each row from 0 to 11, include both \"vol\" and \"english title\". Wait, but that would be two columns per row. However, the example given only had two columns across multiple rows.\n\nWait no, the example included two cells, one from each row. Here, we need to consider that for each of the 12 rows, the relevant columns are both \"vol\" and \"english title\". So that's 12*2=24 cells? That seems excessive.\n\nBut looking back at the question: You are tasked with determining if the statement is true, which requires verifying two things: the count (using vol) and the language (using english title).\n\nTherefore, the relevant data points are:\n\n- For each row, their \"vol\" value to ensure there are 12 distinct entries.\n- For each row, their \"english_title\" value to confirm they have an English version.\n\nBut including all of these might not be necessary; perhaps just one column per aspect is needed. Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to include the columns that directly contribute to each part: vol for count and english title for language.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- All rows' \"vol\" to confirm 12 entries.\n- All rows' \"english_title\" to confirm English versions.\n\nBut in terms of cells, we need to list them as individual objects. So that would be 24 objects (12 rows * 2 columns each). But I think the example had multiple cells across different rows for two columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only one column per aspect is needed: vol for count and english title for English version.\n\nTherefore, in the answer, to confirm that there are 12 volumes, we list all rows with their \"vol\" (though perhaps just indicating that \"vol\" spans from 0-11, so 12 entries). And to confirm they're English, each row's \"english_title\".\n\nBut since we can't provide an image, maybe the answer expects only the relevant columns per aspect.\n\nWait, but in the example, two cells were provided: one for \"employees\" and one for \"sales\". Here, perhaps:\n\n- To show there are 12 entries: list all rows with their \"vol\" (columns).\n- To show they're English: list all rows with their \"english_title\".\n\nBut perhaps it's redundant because each row has both. So including all 24 cells is too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the first and last row to indicate start and end, but that might not be sufficient.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the safest approach is to include for each row, the columns \"vol\" and \"english_title\". But considering the system's limitations in response length, perhaps only the necessary ones are included.\n\nBut since it's a text-based response, we can list them all. So:\n\nEach row from 0 to 11 has both \"vol\" and \"english_title\".\n\nSo for each row i from 0 to 11:\n\n{ \"row_index\": i, \"column_name\": \"vol\" },\n{ \"row_index\": i, \"column_name\": \"english_title\" }\n\nBut that's 24 objects. Maybe the system expects each relevant column per aspect across all rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just including one row for each aspect is enough, but I think not.\n\nGiven this, to accurately answer the question and provide evidence for both parts of the claim (12 volumes and English versions), we need to include all relevant cells that support these claims. Therefore, for each row, the \"vol\" indicates they are part of the 12-volume set, and the \"english_title\" confirms they have an English version.\n\nThus, in the JSON response, we'll list each row's index along with both columns.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the statement is true, we need to verify two aspects: the total number of volumes (12) and whether each volume has an English version. The relevant data points are provided by examining specific columns in each row.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement is **TRUE**, as there are exactly 12 volumes listed, and each volume has an English title.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 0,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 0 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 0\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 1 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 1\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 2 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 2\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 3 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 3\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 4 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 4\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 5 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 5\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 6,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 6 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 6\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 7,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 7 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 7\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 8,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 8 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 8\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 9,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 9 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 9\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 10,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 10 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 10\" }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 11,\n        \"columns\": [\n            { \"name\": \"vol\", \"value\": 11 },\n            { \"name\": \"english_title\", \"value\": \"Title 11\" }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```",
