    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions provided. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"game 82 after date 7 have a score of 2 - 3\". So, the claim is about game number 82, specifically looking at its score when the date was 7 (or later?). I think it means that on or after date 7, game 82 had a score of 2-3.\n\nNow, let's look at the table provided. The table has columns: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location / attendance, and record. The data rows correspond to different games with their respective details.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that support this claim. So, I should locate game 82 in the table. Let's scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Game 77\n- Row 1: Game 78\n- Row 2: Game 79\n- Row 3: Game 80\n- Row 4: Game 81\n- Row 5: Game 82\n\nGot it, game 82 is in the last row. Now, I need to check when the date was 7 or after for this game. The 'date' column has values like 1,3,4,7,9,11. So, game 82's date is 11.\n\nWait, the claim says \"after date 7,\" which probably means games where the date is 7 or later. So, game 82's date is 11, which is after 7, so it qualifies.\n\nNow, what's the score for game 82? Looking at the 'score' column: \"2 - 3\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are satisfied: game 82 occurred on date 11 (after 7) and had a score of 2-3. So, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant columns for the claim are 'game' and 'score'. For game 82, it's row index 5, column 'game', value 82. For the score, it's row index 5, column 'score', value \"2 - 3\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 5 (since that's where game 82 is), columns 'game' and 'score'.\n\nPutting this together in the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Game 82 occurred on date 11, which is after date 7, and its score was 2-3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"pittsburgh penguin be the opponent at the mellon arena 17132 fan in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. Let's see, it mentions three things: the opponent, the location (mellon arena with a specific attendance), and possibly the game details.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location / attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe claim is about the Pittsburgh Penguins being the opponent when they played at Mellon Arena with 17132 fans in attendance. So I need to find a row where the opponent is \"pittsburgh penguins\" and the location/attendance matches \"mellon arena - 17132.\"\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins, location is Mellon Arena - 17132. That seems to fit exactly.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other instances. Row 1: opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning at Prudential Center with different attendance. So only row 0 matches both the opponent and location.\n\nTherefore, since there's a matching row, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells would be row index 0 for column \"opponent\" and also column \"location / attendance.\"\n\nSo I need to list these two columns as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in row 0 where opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins and location/attendance matches Mellon Arena - 17132.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the score , 3 - 2 , be on date 4 after game 78.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. Let's look at the components:\n\n1. **Score**: The claim mentions \"3 - 2.\" Looking at the table, the \"score\" column lists results like \"1 - 6,\" \"4 - 5 (ot),\" etc. So, \"3 - 2\" must be one of these entries.\n\n2. **Date**: The claim refers to \"date 4.\" I need to check if there's a row where the date is indicated as 4.\n\n3. **Game**: It mentions \"after game 78.\" In the table, each row has a \"game\" number. So, game 78 should be present.\n\nNow, let's examine the table data:\n\n- The table has rows indexed from 0 to 5.\n- Each row contains details for different games: 77, 78, 79, etc.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n- Row 0: Game 77\n- Row 1: Game 78\n\nSo, game 78 is in row index 1. Now, check the other parts of the claim.\n\nThe score \"3 - 2\" should be found in the \"score\" column for game 78. Checking row 1:\n- The score listed is \"4 - 5 (ot).\" Hmm, that doesn't match \"3 - 2.\"\n\nAdditionally, looking for a date of 4: In the table, the \"date\" column has values like 1, 3, 4, 7, etc. So, date 4 does exist in row 2 (game 79) and row 5 (game 82). But wait, the claim is about game 78.\n\nIn row 1 (game 78), the date is not mentioned because the first column is \"game,\" then \"date.\" Wait, looking at the table structure again: columns are \"game,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" etc. So in row 1, game 78's date is listed as 3.\n\nTherefore, for game 78, the score is \"4 - 5 (ot),\" not \"3 - 2.\" Also, the date is 3, not 4. Hence, the claim seems to be incorrect because both the score and date don't match what's stated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread something. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Game 78 (row 1): opponent Tampa Bay Lightning, score \"4 - 5 (ot),\" date 3, location/prudential center with attendance 17625.\n- So, no, the score isn't \"3 - 2\" here.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues: the score doesn't match, and the date is incorrect. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if game 78 had a score of \"3 - 2\" on date 4. However:\n\n- **Game 78** (row index 1) has a score of \"4 - 5 (ot)\" and occurred on date 3.\n- The score \"3 - 2\" doesn't exist in the table for game 78 or any other relevant game.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game with a score of 4 - 5 that goes into overtime was held at the prudential center and had 17625 attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for a game in the table where the score is exactly \"4 - 5\" and it resulted in an overtime decision. Overtime is indicated by \"(ot)\" or \"(so)\" as seen in the data. In this case, the claim mentions \"(ot)\", so I need to find a row with that notation.\n\nLooking at each game in the table:\n\n1. Game 77: Score \"1 - 6\" \u2014 doesn't match.\n2. Game 78: Score \"4 - 5 (ot)\" \u2014 this matches both criteria: score is 4-5 and it's overtime.\n3. Game 79: 3 - 2 \u2014 no.\n4.

Looking at the data for game 78:\n\n- The location/attendance is \"prudential center - 17625\". That's a match.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.

The claim says: \"the location / attendance be mellon arena - 17132 for the game against opponent buffalo sabre.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into its components. It mentions three specific things: the location/attendance is Mellon Arena with a number of 17132, and the opponent is Buffalo Sabres.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns are game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. \n\nI should look for rows where the opponent is \"buffalo sabres.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is pittsburgh penguins\n- Row 1: Tampa Bay Lightning\n- Row 2: Buffalo Sabres\n- Row 3: Toronto Maple Leafs\n- Row 4: Ottawa Senators\n- Row 5: Carolina Hurricanes\n\nSo, the opponent \"buffalo sabres\" is in row index 2. Now I need to check if the location/attendance for that game is Mellon Arena - 17132.\n\nLooking at row 2's data:\n- game:78\n- date:4\n- opponent:tampa bay lightning? Wait no, in the table, it says \"buffalo sabres\" as the third element. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the second row (row index 1) is Tampa Bay Lightning, and row 2 is Buffalo Sabres. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 0: game 77, opponent penguins\nRow 1: game78, opponent tampa bay\nRow 2: game79, opponent sabres\nYes, so row 2 is the game against Buffalo Sabres.\n\nNow check the location/attendance for this row. In row 2, it's hsbc arena - 18690. So the location is not Mellon Arena but HSBC Arena. The claim says Mellon Arena -17132, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the location doesn't match. Also, I need to identify the relevant cells that confirm this. The relevant columns are \"opponent\" and \"location / attendance.\" For the opponent, it's row 2, column \"opponent\"; for the location, same row, same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row 2, column opponent\n- row 2, column location/attendance\n\nWait, but in the claim, the opponent is correctly stated as Buffalo Sabres. So that part matches, but the location does not.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"final score of the game 82 hold before date 7 be 2 - 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim and see how it matches with the data.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location / attendance, record. Each row represents a different game with specific details filled in each column.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 82\". So I need to look at the row where game is 82. Looking through the data, the last row is game 82, which has the following values:\n- game: 82\n- date: 11 (I think this might be the day of the month, but not sure if it's day or month)\n- opponent: carolina hurricanes\n- score: 2 - 3\n- decision: brodeur\n- location/attendance: prudential center - 17625\n- record: 51 - 27 - 4\n\nWait, the claim says \"hold before date 7\". So I think this means that the game happened on day 7. Let me check the 'date' column for game 82. The date is 11, which likely refers to November (if it's a month) or maybe just the day? But 11 isn't 7, so there might be confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the date format. Maybe in the table, \"date\" is the day of the month, and \"location / attendance\" includes the month abbreviation as well. For example, looking at other rows: game 77 was on date 1, location Mellon Arena - 17132. The month isn't specified, but maybe it's implicit. If game 82 took place on November 11th (month 11), then day 7 in November would be November 7th. But the claim is about a game that happened before date 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"date\" refers to the day of the month, and if the game was on the 11th, it didn't happen before the 7th. Therefore, the final score for game 82 would not be relevant because the game hadn't occurred yet by date 7. But wait, that might not make sense because each game is a separate event.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"final score of the game 82 hold before date 7\". So it's about the state of the game before November 7th. If the game took place after November 7th (like on November 11th), then as of November 7th, that game hasn't happened yet. Therefore, there wouldn't be a score yet.\n\nBut looking at the data, for game 82, the date is 11, which could be November. If it's the 11th, and the claim is about before date 7 (November 7), then by November 7th, game 82 hasn't occurred. So perhaps the final score isn't recorded yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'date' refers to something else. Wait, let me check other rows. For example, game 77: date 1. If that's January 1st or month 1 (January), then date 7 would be July 7th. But in the table, I don't see months mentioned, just numbers. So perhaps 'date' is just the day of the month, without the month.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Maybe \"game 82 hold before date 7\" refers to whether game 82 took place on or after date 7. If the date for game 82 is 11 (day 11), then it's after date 7, so as of date 7, the final score wouldn't have happened yet.\n\nBut looking at the 'score' column for game 82, it's 2 - 3. So if the claim is about the state before date 7, and the game was on date 11, then as of date 7, the game hadn't occurred, so there wouldn't be a score yet.\n\nWait, but in the table, the 'score' for game 82 is already filled in as 2-3. So perhaps that implies that the game took place before November 7th? But if the game was on November 11th, then it's after date 7, so maybe the score isn't recorded yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about the \"final score\" of game 82 before a certain date. If game 82 hasn't happened by that date, there wouldn't be a final score yet. Therefore, the statement would be false because as of date 7, game 82 hadn't occurred, so its final score wasn't established.\n\nBut wait, in the table, the 'score' for game 82 is already present. So perhaps the date refers to something else, like the attendance or location's capacity? Or maybe it's a typo and should be \"day\" instead of \"date\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'date' refers to the day in terms of the season, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: the claim is about the final score before date 7. So if game 82 occurred after date 7, then as of that date, there wouldn't be a score yet. Therefore, the claim would be incorrect because the game hadn't happened by then, so the score wasn't recorded.\n\nBut in the table, game 82's score is already 2-3, which suggests it had occurred. So maybe the 'date' for game 82 is after date 7, but the score was still recorded as of the data entry time, which might not necessarily align with when the game took place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"hold before date 7\" refers to something else, like a player's holding or possession stats before that date. But in this context, it's about the final score.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline:\n\n- Claim: Final score of game 82 before date 7 is 2 - 3.\n- Game 82: row with game number 82, score 2-3.\n- Date for game 82: 11 (day?), which could be November 11th or day 11.\n\nIf the 'date' refers to November 11th and \"before date 7\" refers to before November 7th, then by November 7th, game 82 hasn't happened yet. Therefore, there's no final score recorded as of that date.\n\nAlternatively, if \"date\" is just a day without month, then game 82 was on the 11th, which is after the 7th, so as of the 7th, the game had not occurred, so the score wouldn't be known yet.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be FALSE because by date 7, game 82 hadn't happened, and thus there wasn't a final score recorded for it yet.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether the final score of Game 82, which is 2-3, was recorded before a certain date. Based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Game Details**: \n   - Game 82 has a final score of 2-3.\n   - The date associated with this game is listed as \"11.\"\n\n2. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim states that the final score was recorded before \"date 7.\"\n   - If \"date\" refers to a specific point in time (e.g., November 7th), and Game 82's date is November 11th, then by November 7th, the game had not yet occurred. Therefore, as of that date, there would be no final score recorded for Game 82.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Game 82 took place after \"date 7,\" the claim that its final score was known before that date is incorrect.\n\n**Answer**: The statement is false because Game 82 had not occurred by date 7, so its final score wasn't recorded yet.",

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"final score against the opponent tampa bay lightning be 5 - 4 (ot)\". So, this is making a statement about a specific game where the team played against Tampa Bay Lightning and the final score was 5-4 in overtime.\n\nNow, I need to check the table provided. The table has several columns: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game with corresponding data.\n\nMy task is to find out which rows are relevant. So, I should filter the rows where the opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning because that's directly mentioned in the claim. Looking at the table's data:\n\n- The first row has an opponent of \"pittsburgh penguins\".\n- The second row has \"tampa bay lightning\" as the opponent.\n- Then, Buffalo Sabres, Toronto Maple Leafs, Ottawa Senators, and Carolina Hurricanes follow.\n\nSo, only the second row is relevant because it's against Tampa Bay Lightning. Now, looking at that row:\n\n- game number 78\n- date 3\n- score \"4 - 5 (ot)\"\n- decision \"brodeur\"\n- location/attendance \"prudential center - 17625\"\n- record \"48 - 26 - 4\"\n\nThe claim says the final score was 5 - 4 (ot). But in the table, the score is listed as \"4 - 5 (ot)\". The numbers are reversed. So the score in the game against Tampa Bay Lightning was actually 4-5, not 5-4.\n\nThis means the claim is incorrect because it states the opposite of what's shown in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I need to specify which cells are relevant. Since only row 1 (second row) has the opponent as Tampa Bay Lightning and that cell is at position [1], with the column being \"opponent\".

    "claim": "score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has several columns: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game with various details.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2.\" Hmm, that's a bit to unpack. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The score of game 79 should be 3-2, and this should hold true before the date 4. So, I'm looking for a game with the number 79 in the \"game\" column where the \"score\" is 3-2, but specifically before a certain date which is mentioned as 4.\n\nLooking at the table data, each row has a \"game\" number, \"date\", \"opponent\", etc. So I need to find the game with game number 79 and check its details.\n\nLet me look through the rows:\n\nRow 0: Game 77, Date 1\nRow 1: Game 78, Date 3\nRow 2: Game 79, Date 4\nRow 3: Game 80, Date 7\nRow 4: Game 81, Date 9\nRow 5: Game 82, Date 11\n\nSo, the game number we're interested in is 79. That's row 2.\n\nNow, checking the score for game 79: it says \"3 - 2\". So the score part checks out.\n\nThe claim also mentions that this should hold before date 4. Wait, but in the table, game 79 has a date of 4, so is the condition about being before or on date 4? The wording is a bit unclear. The claim says \"before date 4,\" which might imply that the score should be correct as of a time before April 4th (assuming the date is in month-day format). But in reality, each game has its own date, so perhaps it's better to look for games where the score was recorded before the date specified.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row represents a specific game with its own date. So game 79 happened on April 4th, as per the data. If I'm looking at whether, up until that date (April 4), the score was 3-2, then yes, because the game itself had that score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about games before a certain date in the season or league? But without more context, we have to go by what's given. The claim is stating that for game 79, which took place on April 4th, the score was 3-2 before that date. Wait, but the game happened on April 4th, so if it's about the result before that date, maybe it refers to the previous games leading up to that date.\n\nBut in this case, since each row is a separate game with its own date and score, perhaps the claim is asserting that as of date 4 (April 4), the score for game 79 was 3-2. But actually, game 79 took place on April 4th, so the score would be the final result. So if we check up to that point before the game started, maybe it's 3-2? Or perhaps the claim is saying that prior to date 4, the game had a certain score.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The claim says: \"score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2.\" So, for game 79 (which happened on date 4), its score was 3-2 prior to that date. But if the game occurred on date 4, then technically, it's not before that date. Unless \"before date 4\" refers to any games before April 4th, which would include all previous games.\n\nWait, but in that case, how does that relate to game 79 specifically? Game 79 is on April 4th, so if I'm looking at the score of game 79 (which happened on April 4), then saying it was 3-2 before April 4 might be referring to the result after the game. But that doesn't make much sense because the final score would only be known after the game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"hold before date 4\" means that as of the date April 4, the score for game 79 is 3-2, which it is in the table. So perhaps the claim is asserting that on April 4th (or before), game 79 had a score of 3-2, and indeed, looking at row 2, the score is 3-2.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied: the score for game 79 is 3-2, and this holds as of date 4. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that \"before date 4\" refers to before April 4th, so perhaps up until then, but since the game happened on April 4th, maybe it's considering the score as recorded at that point. Alternatively, maybe the opponent or location/attendance is being considered.\n\nWait no, the claim is specifically about the score of game 79 being 3-2 before date 4. So in the table, game 79 has a score of 3-2 and occurred on date 4. So as of that date, the score is indeed 3-2, so it holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the score for game 79 (which occurred on date 4) was 3-2 before that date. In the table, game 79 has a score of \"3 - 2\" and is listed under date 4. This means as of date 4, the score was indeed 3-2 when the game took place. Therefore, the claim is fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
