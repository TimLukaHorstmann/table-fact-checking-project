    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"montreal be the visitor on march 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it specifies that \"montreal\" should be the visitor on March 6. So, my main focus is to find the relevant data point for March 6 and check if the visitor was indeed Montreal.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The data rows provide details for each game. Each row represents a specific game on a particular date.\n\nNow, I need to find the row where the date is March 6. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: March 1\n2. Row 1: March 2\n3. Row 2: March 4\n4. Row 3: March 6 \u2013 this is the one.\n5. The rest are after March 6.\n\nSo, row index 3 corresponds to March 6.\n\nNext, I'll check the \"visitor\" column for this row. In row 3, the visitor is listed as \"montreal.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n\nTo ensure there's no mistake, I'll cross-verify other columns. The home team is Philadelphia, which makes sense since Montreal is visiting. The score is 4 - 5, decision is esche, attendance is around 19k, and the record shows 34 - 18 -10. All these details are consistent with a game where Montreal was the visitor.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or conflicting information. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the data provided in row index 3.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"montreal be the visitor on march 6,\" I identified the relevant row (index 3) and checked the \"visitor\" column, which confirms that Montreal was indeed the visitor.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying. It's about whether, before March 6th, Montreal was the visitor in any of the games listed.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. The columns are: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game with these details. So, my focus is on the \"visitor\" column and specifically checking if Montreal was the visitor before March 6.\n\nNow, I need to go through each row of the table and see which ones are before March 6. The dates provided in the table start from March 1 and go up to March 28. So, I should filter all rows where the date is before March 6. That means I need to check from March 1 to March 5.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. March 1: Visitor is Philadelphia.\n2. March 2: Visitor is NY Rangers.\n3. March 4: Visitor is Philadelphia.\n4. March 6: This is the date in question, so it's not before March 6.\n\nWait, but March 6th's data is a row where the visitor is Montreal. However, since the claim is about \"before\" March 6, I shouldn't include March 6 itself. So, only up to March 5 need to be checked.\n\nContinuing:\n\n3. March 4: Visitor is Philadelphia.\nSo, in all the games before March 6 (i.e., up to March 5), Montreal never was the visitor. Therefore, the claim that \"before March 6 montreal be the visitor\" is false because there's no evidence of Montreal being the visitor before March 6.\n\nBut let me double-check each relevant row to make sure I didn't miss anything. For each game up to March 5:\n\n- March 1: Philadelphia\n- March 2: NY Rangers\n- March 4: Philadelphia\n\nNone of these have Montreal as the visitor. The first time Montreal is the visitor is on March 6, which is not before March 6.\n\nSo, putting this together, since there's no record of Montreal being the visitor before March 6, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
