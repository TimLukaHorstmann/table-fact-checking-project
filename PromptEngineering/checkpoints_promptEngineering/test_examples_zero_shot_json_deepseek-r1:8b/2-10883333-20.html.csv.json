    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the crowd be the largest at the game play by richmond versus carlton.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's stating that for the game between Richmond and Carlton, the crowd (number of people attending) was the largest among all games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"crowd,\" etc. The data rows include specific games with their respective crowd numbers.\n\nNext, I need to find the specific row where Richmond is playing against Carlton. I'll go through each row of the data:\n\n1. Row 0: Geelong vs South Melbourne \u2013 crowd 10973\n2. Row 1: Fitzroy vs Melbourne \u2013 13181\n3. Row 2: Essendon vs North Melbourne \u2013 16545\n4. Row 3: St Kilda vs Collingwood \u2013 28359\n5. Row 4: Richmond vs Carlton \u2013 49756\n6. Row 5: Footscray vs Hawthorn \u2013 15601\n\nSo, Richmond vs Carlton is in row 4 with a crowd of 49,756.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this crowd was the largest. I'll list all crowd numbers:\n\n- 10973, 13181, 16545, 28359, 49756, 15601.\n\nComparing these numbers: 49756 is the highest. So yes, the crowd at that game was indeed the largest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need to identify which columns are used in checking this. The claim mentions \"crowd,\" so that's column index 5 (since columns are ordered as home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date). So, for row 4, the crowd is in column \"crowd\" at row_index 4.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row_index: 4, column_name: \"crowd\"\n\nI should format this as an array of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"the highest score for both the home team and the away team be at the same game play at moorabbin oval.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's saying that in a single game played at Moorabin Oval, both the home team and the away team achieved their highest scores.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different game with various details like home team, their score, away team, etc., including the venue. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"venue,\" and \"home team score\" or \"away team score.\"\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Moorabbin Oval, so I should focus on rows where the venue is \"moorabbin oval.\" From the data, only one row has that venue: row index 3. Let me check that row.\n\nIn row 3, the home team is \"st kilda\" with a score of 20.17 (137). The away team is \"collingwood\" with a score of 24.12 (156). So in this game at Moorabbin Oval, collingwood scored higher than St Kilda.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this was the highest score for both teams on that day. Since it's only one game at Moorabbin Oval, we have to see if any other games on the same date had higher scores for each team.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"the highest score for both the home team and the away team be at the same game play.\" That implies both teams achieved their highest scores in that particular game. So I need to check all games on the 16th of August 1975 (since all these entries are from that date) to see if any other home or away team had a higher score.\n\nLooking at the table, let's list out each team's performance:\n\n- St Kilda: 20.17 (137)\n- Collingwood: 24.12 (156)\n\nOther home teams:\n- Geelong: 13.22 (100)\n- Fitzroy: 13.20 (98)\n- Essendon: 15.15 (105)\n- Richmond: 13.20 (98)\n- Footscray: 14.9 (93)\n\nAway teams:\n- South Melbourne: 15.15 (105)\n- Melbourne: 13.11 (89)\n- North Melbourne: 13.13 (91)\n- Carlton: 14.11 (95)\n- Hawthorn: 13.13 (91)\n\nLooking at home team scores, the highest is St Kilda with 137, and the away teams' highest is Collingwood with 156.\n\nIn row 3, both teams played each other at Moorabbin Oval. So in that game, St Kilda scored their highest as a home team (137), and Collingwood scored their highest as an away team (156). Therefore, it's the same game where both achieved their respective highest scores on that date.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because both teams' highest scores for that day occurred in the same game at Moorabbin Oval.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 3, columns \"home team score\" and \"away team score,\" as it's the only game at Moorabbin Oval where both teams achieved their highest scores on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the closest scoring game be the game at junction oval, with a difference of only 0.11 between the home team and the away team.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about the closest scoring game, which probably refers to the game where the score difference between the home team and the away team was the smallest. The specific game in question is at junction oval, so I need to find that row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: there are multiple columns like \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" etc., but the key columns for this claim would be \"away team\" and \"home team score.\" Wait, no, actually, the difference is between home team and away team scores. So I need to calculate the score difference for each game.\n\nLet me go through each row in the data:\n\n1. **First row**: Home team is Geelong with 12.16 (88), away team is South Melbourne with 15.15 (105). The difference is 88 - 105 = -17, which isn't close.\n2. **Second row**: Home team Fitzroy has 13.22 (100), away team Melbourne has 13.11 (89). Difference is 100 - 89 = +11.\n3. **Third row**: Home team Essendon 15.15 (105) vs North Melbourne 13.13 (91). Difference is 14 points.\n4. **Fourth row**: St Kilda with 20.17 (137) vs Collingwood's 24.12 (156). Difference is -19.\n5. **Fifth row**: Richmond 13.20 (98) vs Carlton 14.11 (95). Difference is +3.\n6. **Sixth row**: Footscray 14.9 (93) vs Hawthorn 13.13 (91). Difference is +2.\n\nWait, the claim says a difference of only 0.11. But in all these games, the differences are 17, 11, 14, 19, 3, and 2 points. None of them are close to 0.11. That seems odd because scores in Australian football (or any sport) are whole numbers, so a difference can't be 0.11; it's either an integer or not possible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the claim is using a different metric for \"scoring.\" Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to something else, like points per game over multiple games? But the table only shows one game each row, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the claim is about the smallest difference. Looking at my calculations, the second row has a difference of 11, and the sixth row has a difference of 2, which are the closest in terms of smaller differences. Wait, but 0.11 isn't an integer. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, maybe I miscalculated one of them. Let me check each again:\n\n1. Geelong vs South Melbourne: Geelong scored 88, away team 105. Difference is 17.\n2. Fitzroy vs Melbourne: Home score 100, away 89. Difference is +11 (11 points).\n3. Essendon vs North Melbourne: 105 vs 91, difference +14.\n4. St Kilda vs Collingwood: 137 vs 156, difference -19.\n5. Richmond vs Carlton: 98 vs 95, difference +3.\n6. Footscray vs Hawthorn: 93 vs 91, difference +2.\n\nSo the differences are 17,11,14,19,3, and 2. The smallest difference here is 2 points in the last game (Footscray vs Hawthorn). But that's a difference of 2, not 0.11. So the claim must be incorrect because there's no game with such a small difference.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user meant something else. Let me think about how scores are represented. The scores are in the format like \"12.16 (88)\", which is goals and behinds followed by total points. Maybe the calculation uses some other method? For example, sometimes in sports, points per game or other metrics might be used, but here it's just the difference between home and away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a game where the home team was very close, like only a few points behind. But again, none of the differences are 0.11; that doesn't make sense with whole numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim is incorrect because there's no game at junction oval (row 1) where the difference is 0.11. Wait, actually, looking back: The second row is Fitzroy vs Melbourne at junction oval on 16 August 1975. Their scores are 13.22 (100) and 13.11 (89). Difference is 100 - 89 = 11.\n\nWait, so the game at junction oval has a difference of 11 points, not 0.11. So the claim's assertion that the difference is only 0.11 is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the closest scoring game was at Junction Oval with a 0.11-point difference. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- The home team Fitzroy scored 100 points (13.22), and the away team Melbourne scored 89 points (13.11).\n- The score difference is 11 points, not 0.11.\n\nSince no game has such a small difference as 0.11, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"carlton score 14.11 as the away team, while richmond score 13.20 as the home team in the same game.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table and see if there's a row that matches both of these scores for those teams. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 0: Home team is Geelong, so that doesn't match Richmond or Carlton. So not relevant.\nRow 1: Home team Fitzroy, so again, not matching. Away team Melbourne either, so no.\nRow 2: Home team Essendon, away North Melbourne. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Home team St Kilda and away Collingwood. No, we're looking for Carlton as away and Richmond as home.\nRow 4: Home team Richmond with a score of 13.20 and away Carlton with 14.11. Oh, wait, that's exactly the claim! So this row matches both parts of the claim.\nRow 5: Footscray vs Hawthorn. Not relevant.\n\nSo in row 4, we have Richmond as home with 13.20 and Carlton as away with 14.11. That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nI also need to make sure there's only one game where both teams are accounted for. Since each row is a separate game, and only row 4 has both Carlton and Richmond, that's the only relevant row.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because all parts of the claim are supported by this specific row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be 34155 less crowd in the crowd at the game at vfl park than there be in the game at mcg.\" So, they're saying that the crowd number at VFL Park is 34,155 less than the crowd number at McG.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data includes several games played on August 16, 1975, which might mean they're all from the same day or same event. \n\nI need to find the crowd numbers for VFL Park and McG. Let me scan through each row.\n\n1. First row: venue is Kardinia Park, crowd is 10973.\n2. Second row: venue is Junction Oval, crowd is 13181.\n3. Third row: venue is Windy Hill, crowd is 16545.\n4. Fourth row: venue is Moorabbin Oval, crowd is 28359.\n5. Fifth row: venue is McG, crowd is 49756.\n6. Sixth row: venue is VFL Park, crowd is 15601.\n\nSo from the data, the crowd at VFL Park (row 6) is 15,601 and at McG (row 5) it's 49,756.\n\nNow, let's check if VFL Park's crowd is less than McG by 34,155. \n\nCalculating the difference: McG crowd minus VFL Park crowd = 49756 - 15601 = 34155. So yes, that's exactly the number mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"there be 34155 less crowd at VFL Park than at McG.\" So, they're saying VFL Park has a crowd of (McG's crowd minus 34,155). Which is indeed what it is. So the claim seems correct based on this calculation.\n\nTherefore, I need to check which cells are relevant. The columns involved are \"crowd\" and \"venue\".

Geelong vs South Melbourne\n2. Fitzroy vs Melbourne\n3. Essendon vs North Melbourne\n4. St Kilda vs Collingwood\n\nThe fifth row is Richmond vs Carlton, and the sixth is Footscray vs Hawthorn.\n\nSo, the game in question is the 6th row, where Footscray is playing against Hawthorn. Wait, but the claim mentions \"Richmond versus Hawthorn.\" Looking at the data, I see a row where Richmond plays Carlton, which is row 5. There's no row with Richmond vs Hawthorn.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Geelong vs South Melbourne\n- Row 1: Fitzroy vs Melbourne\n- Row 2: Essendon vs North Melbourne\n- Row 3: St Kilda vs Collingwood\n- Row 4: Richmond vs Carlton\n- Row 5: Footscray vs Hawthorn\n\nYes, there is no game in the table where Richmond plays Hawthorn. The only Richmond game is against Carlton (row 4), and the Hawthorn game is against Footscray (row 5). Therefore, the claim about Richmond vs Hawthorn doesn't exist in the data provided.\n\nNow, checking the crowd numbers to see if any match the largest.

The claim says: \"the highest score for both the home team and the away team be at the same game play at windy hill.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The highest score for both teams must have occurred in the same game that took place at Windy Hill.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Windy Hill, so I should focus on rows where the venue is \"windy hill.\" Scanning through the data, only one row matches that condition:\n\n[\n  \"essendon\",\n  \"15.15 (105)\",\n  \"north melbourne\",\n  \"13.13 (91)\",\n  \"windy hill\",\n  16545,\n  \"16 august 1975\"\n]\n\nSo, in this game, Essendon scored 15.15 (105), and North Melbourne scored 13.13 (91). Therefore, Essendon had the highest score here.\n\nNow, I need to check if both teams' highest scores were achieved at the same game at Windy Hill. For that, I should compare each team's overall highest score across all games they played at Windy Hill.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, there's only one match at Windy Hill, which is Essendon vs. North Melbourne. So, to determine if this was their highest score at Windy Hill, we can look at their respective scores here and compare them to any other matches they might have had elsewhere.\n\nBut since the table given only includes this single game at Windy Hill, I don't have data from other games for these teams. However, the claim is about whether in that specific game both achieved their highest score. Since it's the only match at Windy Hill in the table, and Essendon scored 105 there, if they didn't achieve a higher score elsewhere, then this game was indeed their highest.\n\nAssuming that from the data provided, we can take that as true for this context. Therefore, the claim is saying that both teams achieved their highest scores at this game. So, in the table, the home team (Essendon) scored 105, and the away team (North Melbourne) scored 91. If Essendon didn't have a higher score elsewhere in the table, then yes, this was their highest.\n\nLooking through all rows to see if either team has a higher score elsewhere:\n\n- For Essendon: Their scores are 12.16 (88), 13.22 (100), 15.15 (105), etc. So, 105 is their highest in the table.\n\n- For North Melbourne: Their scores include 14.9 (93) and others, with 13.13 (91) being one of them. I don't see a higher score for them elsewhere in the table provided.\n\nSo both teams' highest scores as per the data are indeed achieved at this game at Windy Hill.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the same game at Windy Hill has the highest score for both the home and away teams. By examining the table, we find that the game at Windy Hill (row index 2) has Essendon as the home team with a score of 15.15 (105), which is their highest score in the table. The away team, North Melbourne, also scored their highest at this game with 13.13 (91).

Each row corresponds to a different game with these attributes filled in.\n\nI need to focus on the games played at Junction Oval because the claim mentions this venue. From the data, I can see that Junction Oval is listed as the venue for one of the games. Let me find which row that is.\n\nLooking through the 'venue' column:\n1. First game: kardinia park\n2. Second game: junction oval\n3. Third game: windy hill\n4. Fourth game: moorabbin oval\n5. Fifth game: mcg\n6. Sixth game: vfl park\n\nSo, the second row (row_index=1) is the game at Junction Oval.\n\nNow, let's look at that specific row:\n- Home team: fitzroy\n- Home team score: 13.22 (100)\n- Away team: melbourne\n- Away team score: 13.11 (89)\n\nI need to calculate the difference between the home and away scores.

That doesn't make sense because 11 is significantly larger than 0.15. Points in Australian rules football are whole numbers, so the smallest possible difference would be at least one point. Therefore, a difference of 0.15 isn't feasible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how scoring differences are calculated. Let me think again. Sometimes in sports, especially with scoring systems that allow for decimals (though in this case, it's whole numbers), but here both teams have integer scores. So the difference is an integer as well.\n\nGiven that, the claim stating a 0.15-point difference is incorrect because the actual difference is 11 points.\n\nSo, since the claim doesn't hold true based on the data provided, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the closest scoring game at Junction Oval with a 0.15-point difference is FALSE because the actual score difference was 11 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"there be 14155 less crowd in the crowd at the game at vfl park than there be in the game at mcg.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of this claim relate directly to the data in the table. The key elements are \"crowd\" at two venues: VFL Park and McG. So I'll need to locate these entries in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with various details. The columns relevant here are \"venue\", which tells us where the game was held, and \"crowd\", which gives the number of people attending that game.\n\nLet me go through each row to find the games played at VFL Park and McG. \n\nStarting from the first row: The venue is Kardinia Park, so that's not it. Second row: Junction Oval\u2014nope. Third row: Windy Hill, still no. Fourth row: Moorabbin Oval\u2014not our target venues. Fifth row: McG\u2014that's one of them. So the fifth row has McG as the venue and a crowd number of 49756.\n\nNow looking for VFL Park. Scanning through each row, the sixth row is the only one where the venue is VFL Park. The crowd number there is 15601.\n\nSo now I have two crowd numbers: 15601 at VFL Park and 49756 at McG. \n\nThe claim says that the crowd at VFL Park was 14155 less than at McG. To check this, I need to subtract the crowd at VFL from the crowd at McG and see if it equals 14155.\n\nCalculating that: 49756 (McG) minus 15601 (VFL) equals 34155. Wait, that's not 14155. There's a discrepancy here\u2014the subtraction gives a much larger number than what the claim states.\n\nHmm, maybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check the numbers. McG has 49756 and VFL has 15601. Subtracting the smaller from the larger: 49756 - 15601 = 34155. That's definitely more than 14155. So the claim is incorrect because the actual difference is much bigger.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the given claim about a sports game is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"carlton score 14.11 as the away team , while melbourne score 13.20 as the home team in the same game.\" So, we're saying that Carlton was the away team with a score of 14.11 and Melbourne was the home team with a score of 13.20 in the same match.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure, it has several columns: \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\" The data rows under these columns are provided for five games, all happening on 16 August 1975. \n\nI need to check if there's a row where Carlton is the away team with a score of 14.11 and Melbourne is the home team with a score of 13.20.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Home Team: geelong\n   - Away Team: south melbourne\n   - Scores don't match the claim.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Home Team: fitzroy\n   - Away Team: melbourne\n   - Scores: 13.22 (100) vs 13.11 (89). Doesn't match the claim since it's about Carlton, not Melbourne here as away.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Home Team: essendon\n   - Away Team: north melbourne\n   - Not relevant.\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - Home Team: st kilda\n   - Away Team: collingwood\n   - Scores don't match the claim.\n\n5. **Fifth Row:**\n   - Home Team: richmond\n   - Away Team: carlton\n   - Wait, here we go! Carlton is the away team with a score of 13.20. But according to the claim, Carlton should have scored 14.11 as an away team. Here, it's 13.20, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, that's different. The fifth row shows Richmond as home (score 13.20) and Carlton as away (score 14.20). Wait, no, the score for Carlton is 14.20? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Fifth row:\n  - \"richmond\", \"13.20 (98)\",\n  - \"carlton\", \"14.11 (95)\",\n  - Venue: mcg,\n  - Crowd: 49756,\n  - Date: 16 august 1975\n\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong earlier. Let me correct myself.\n\nThe fifth row shows:\n- Home team: richmond, score 13.20 (98)\n- Away team: carlton, score 14.11 (95)\n\nSo in this game, Carlton is the away team with a score of 14.11, and Richmond is the home team with 13.20.\n\nBut the claim says that Carlton scored 14.11 as the away team and Melbourne scored 13.20 as the home team. However, in this table, the home team is Richmond, not Melbourne.\n\nSo, does any row have both Carlton as away (14.11) and Melbourne as home (13.20)?\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\n- Second row: Away team is Melbourne, but home team is fitzroy. Scores are 13.22 vs 13.11.\n- Any other rows where Melbourne is the home team?\n\nChecking each row:\n\n1. geelong home, south melbourne away\n2. fitzroy home, melbourne away\n3. essendon home, north melbourne away\n4. st kilda home, collingwood away\n5. richmond home, carlton away\n6. footscray home, hawthorn away\n\nSo, the only time Melbourne is an away team is in row 2: fitzroy vs Melbourne (away). But here, fitzroy is home, so it's not Melbourne as home.\n\nWait, no, in row 2, the home team is fitzroy and away is melbourne. So that's when Melbourne is away, but not as home.\n\nSo, looking for a row where:\n- Home team: melbourne\n- Away team: carlton\n- Scores: 13.20 (home) vs 14.11 (away)\n\nBut checking all rows, I don't see any such occurrence. The closest is row 5, where richmond is home with 13.20 and carlton away with 14.11.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Carlton scored 14.11 as away while Melbourne scored 13.20 as home does not appear to be supported by the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in row 5. Let me double-check:\n\nIn row 5:\n- Home team: richmond\n- Away team: carlton\n- Scores: 13.20 (home) and 14.11 (away). So, Carlton's score is higher than Melbourne's.\n\nBut the claim says that the away team is carlton with 14.11 and home team is melbourne with 13.20. That would require a different row where home team is melbourne and away team is carlton.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nRow 2: fitzroy (home) vs melbourne (away). Fitzy's score is 13.22, Melbourne's is 13.11. Not matching the scores in the claim.\n\nNo other row matches this criteria. Therefore, there's no game where both Carlton is away with 14.11 and Melbourne is home with 13.20.\n\nSo the claim is false because such a game doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not find support in the provided table. There is no row where \"carlton\" is listed as the away team with a score of 14.11, while \"melbourne\" is the home team with a score of 13.20.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Rows:** We look for any row where \"carlton\" is the away team and \"melbourne\" is the home team.\n2. **Check Scores in Those Rows:** For each such row, verify if carlton's score is 14.11 (away) and melbourne's score is 13.20 (home).\n3. **Find No Matching Row:** Upon reviewing all rows, no such match exists in the table.\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim is not supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
