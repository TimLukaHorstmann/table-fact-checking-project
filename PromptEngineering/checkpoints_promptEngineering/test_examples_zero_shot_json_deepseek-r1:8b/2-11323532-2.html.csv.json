    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the people from the country/region of Vietnam speak the language Vietnamese.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like country/region, languages, premiere, seasons, and status. The relevant parts here are the \"country/region\" and \"languages\" columns because the claim is about what language the people speak in Vietnam.\n\nLooking through each row, I'm searching for the one where the country or region is Vietnam. Scanning down, I see a row with \"vietnam\" as the country. That's the 25th entry in the data array, which might take some time to reach, but let me find it correctly.\n\nOnce I locate the Vietnam row, I check the languages column. The value there is \"vietnamese.\" So, the language spoken in Vietnam according to the table is Vietnamese. \n\nThe claim states that people from Vietnam speak Vietnamese. That matches exactly what's in the table. There are no discrepancies or conflicting information elsewhere that would make this false.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the show in Israel be in the Hebrew language and be ongoing.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. The show in Israel is in the Hebrew language.\n2. The show in Israel is ongoing.\n\nI need to check both conditions against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country or region, and each column has information about languages, seasons (premiere), and status. The relevant columns for this claim are \"country / region\", \"languages\", \"premiere\", and \"status.\"\n\nStarting with the first condition: Is there a show in Israel that's in Hebrew?\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the country is Israel.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a row where \"country / region\" is \"israel\". This is row 10 (if we start counting from 0, it's actually the 11th element, but indexing starts at 0). \n\nIn that row, under \"languages\", it says \"hebrew.\" So condition one is satisfied.\n\nNow, the second condition: Is the show ongoing?\n\nLooking at the same row, under \"status\" it says \"discontinued.\" That means the show in Israel is not ongoing anymore. Therefore, this condition isn't met.\n\nSince both conditions need to be true for the claim to hold, but only the first condition is satisfied and the second isn't, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The user's instruction says to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table. So if either part of the claim isn't met, it's false.\n\nYes, so since the show in Israel is not ongoing, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"languages\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
