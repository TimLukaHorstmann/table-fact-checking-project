    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"brandi love be only nominated for best as 1 time in 2013\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are year, ceremony, result, award, and work. Each row represents a different entry with these details. My task is to see if Brandi Love was only nominated for \"Best Ass\" once in 2013.\n\nI remember that sometimes names can vary, so I should check both \"Brandi Love\" and any possible aliases or similar names. Looking at the table's data:\n\n- The first row has \"n / a\" under work, but no name.\n- Second row mentions \"big titty milfs\", which doesn't seem related to Brandi Love.\n- Third row refers to \"best cougar / milf performer,\" which might relate if there's a Cougar or MILF category, but not necessarily Brandi Love.\n- Fourth row has \"n / a\" under work again. The award is \"best ass.\" So this might be relevant because the claim mentions \"Best Ass.\"\n- Fifth row talks about \"web star of the year,\" unrelated.\n\nSo I'm focusing on the fourth row since it's the only one that mentions \"best ass.\" The name column here is \"n / a,\" which stands for not applicable or not available. This might indicate that Brandi Love wasn't nominated under this category, but perhaps she was elsewhere?\n\nWait, in 2013, there were multiple ceremonies: AVN, Nightmoves, XBIZ. I need to check if Brandi Love appeared in any of these categories other than \"Best Ass.\" For example, looking at the AVN award entries, none have her name mentioned. Similarly for Nightmoves and XBIZ.\n\nIf she only received a nomination for \"Best Ass\" but that row has \"n / a,\" perhaps she wasn't actually nominated there, or maybe the information isn't provided. Alternatively, maybe she was nominated elsewhere under a different category, which isn't covered in this table.\n\nGiven that the claim states she was only nominated once for \"Best Ass,\" and if the relevant row shows \"n / a,\" it suggests that perhaps she wasn't actually nominated for that award, or the data isn't available. Therefore, the claim might be false because either she was not nominated for \"Best Ass\" or the information is missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing other entries where she was nominated. But looking through each row's work column, only one entry refers to an award related to a specific category that could be her (\"big titty milfs\") and another mentions \"best ass.\" However, since those are under different ceremony columns, it's unclear if they pertain to Brandi Love.\n\nIn conclusion, without clear evidence in the table that she was nominated for \"Best Ass\" (given the \"n / a\"), I lean towards the claim being false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"big titty milfs be the only name work brandi love receive an award nomination for in 2013.\"\n\nI'll start by understanding each part of the claim. It mentions \"big titty milfs\" as the only name under which Brandi Love received an award nomination in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are 'year', 'ceremony', 'result', 'award', and 'work'. The data rows relate to different awards each year, so I need to check for Brandi Love's entries specifically.\n\nIn the table, the first two rows (index 0 and 1) have ceremony as \"avn award\", and the third row is \"nightmoves award,\" while the fourth is \"xbiz award.\" The fifth row has no relevant data. \n\nFocusing on the 'work' column, I see entries like \"n / a\" except for the first two rows where work names are given. Specifically, in row 1, under 'work', it's listed as \"big titty milfs.\"\n\nSince Brandi Love is mentioned in the claim, I need to check if there's any entry with her name. However, looking at the table, there isn't a column for the performer's name or a specific column for Brandi Love. The 'award' column lists categories like \"most outrageous sex scene\" and others, but not individual performers.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"work,\" which might correspond to the work title. So in row 1, under 'work', it's \"big titty milfs.\" That matches part of the claim. However, the claim says this is the only name Brandi Love received an award nomination for in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different award ceremony and category. The 'result' column shows whether it was won or nominated. In row 1, the result is \"nominated.\" So \"big titty milfs\" was indeed a nomination for that award.\n\nBut does Brandi Love receive this nomination alone? From the table, it's unclear if she's the only recipient or part of multiple entries. The 'award' column lists categories, not individual recipients.\n\nAlso, are there other award nominations for her in 2013? In row 0 and row 4, the work is listed as \"n / a,\" which might mean not applicable. Row 2 has a different ceremony but the same year, so if Brandi Love was involved elsewhere, it's not captured here.\n\nSince the claim specifies that \"big titty milfs\" is the only name she received a nomination for, but from the table, there's only one entry with her work mentioned. Without more data on other award entries where she might have been nominated or awarded, I can't confirm if it's the sole one.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, it seems that \"big titty milfs\" was indeed a nomination in 2013, but without knowing if there were others, I can't fully support the claim as stated. So the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"brandi love be nominate for 2 award at the avn award ceremony in 2013\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions \"Brandi Love\" being nominated for two awards at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013. So I need to check if Brandi Love is indeed a nominee for multiple awards that year.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: year, ceremony, result, award, work. Each row represents an entry with these details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: MILF / Cougar Performer of the Year\n- Work: N/A\n\nThis row is about the AVN Awards, and Brandi Love was nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year. But it's only one award mentioned here.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n- Work: Big Titty MILFs\n\nThis is another entry for the AVN Awards, but it's about a specific scene, not an award category. So this doesn't count towards Brandi Love being nominated for awards.\n\nRow 2:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n- Result: Won\n- Award: Best Cougar/MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice)\n- Work: N/A\n\nHere, Brandi Love won an award from the Nightmoves ceremony. So that's one award.\n\nRow 3:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Best Ass\n- Work: N/A\n\nThis is a different award category, and she was only nominated here, not won or received it. Also, it's from the same ceremony as row 2.\n\nRow 4:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: XBIZ Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Web Star of the Year\n- Work: N/A\n\nThis is from the XBIZ Awards, which is a different ceremony. So this doesn't count towards AVN Awards.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant information:\n\nFrom Row 0, Brandi Love was nominated for one award (MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year) at the AVN Awards in 2013.\n\nFrom Row 2, she won another award (Best Cougar/MILF Performer) at the Nightmoves Awards in 2013.\n\nSo in total, that's two awards: one nomination and one win. But the claim says \"nominate for 2 awards\", which could imply two nominations. However, based on the table, she only has one nominal award (MILF/Cougar) and one won (Best Cougar). So does this count as two awards? Or is it considering that she was only nominated in AVN?\n\nWait, the claim says \"nominate for 2 award\", so maybe the user meant being nominated for two different awards. In Row 0, she's nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year, and in Row 3, she's nominated for Best Ass at Nightmoves. That would be two separate nominations.\n\nBut looking back, in the table:\n\nRow 0: Nominated for MILF/Cougar\nRow 1: Not an award category but a scene.\nRow 2: Won for Cougar Performer\nRow 3: Nominated for Best Ass\nRow 4: Nominated for Web Star (XBIZ)\n\nWait, in Row 4, XBIZ is a different ceremony. So does the claim specify which ceremony? It mentions AVN Award ceremony.\n\nSo only Rows 0 and 1 are from AVN Awards. Row 0: nominated for MILF/Cougar\nRow 2: Won for Cougar at Nightmoves, not AVN.\nRow 3: Nominated for Best Ass at Nightmoves, not AVN.\nRow 4: XBIZ, different.\n\nTherefore, within the AVN Award ceremony in 2013, Brandi Love was only nominated once (MILF/Cougar). So the claim says she was \"nominate for 2 award\", but according to the table, she was only nominated once at AVN. Unless I'm missing another entry.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim is about being nominated for two awards at the AVN ceremony in 2013. From the table, AVN Awards are in Rows 0 and 1, and possibly others?\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: AVN award, result: nominated\nAward: MILF/Cougar\n\nRow 1: AVN award, result: nominated\nAward: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n\nWait, but \"Most Outrageous Sex Scene\" is an award category, right? So that's another award. So in Row 1, she was awarded that specific scene, not the performer award.\n\nSo in AVN Awards:\n\nRow 0: Nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer\nRow 1: Nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene\n\nWait no, actually, in Row 1, the award is \"Most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\", which is a category. So that's another award. But was she awarded or just nominated? The result column says \"nominated\". Wait, no: looking back:\n\nRow 0:\nResult: Nominated\nAward: MILF/Cougar Performer\n\nRow 1:\nResult: Nominated\nAward: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n\nSo both entries in AVN Awards are results as \"nominated\", meaning she was nominated for two different awards at the AVN ceremony. Therefore, she was indeed nominated for two awards.\n\nWait, but Row 0 and Row 1 both have \"avn award\" and result \"nominated\". So that's two separate nominations: MILF/Cougar Performer and Most Outrageous Sex Scene.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: Brandi Love was nominated for two awards at the AVN ceremony in 2013. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells:\n\nWe need to identify which cells support this. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: year=2013, ceremony=avn award, result=nominated, award=milf/cougar performer of the year\n- Row 1: year=2013, ceremony=avn award, result=nominated, award=most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison)\n- So both Rows 0 and 1 are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 1, columns \"ceremony\" and \"result\", but more accurately, columns that contain the awards she was nominated for. But since the claim is about being nominated for two awards, perhaps the relevant columns are \"award\".\n\nWait, the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim mentions \"2 award at the avn award ceremony\". So we need to find cells where:\n\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: either MILF/Cougar Performer or Most Outrageous Sex Scene\n\nSo for each of these awards, their respective rows are relevant.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 0: columns \"ceremony\" and \"result\" (but specifically \"award\")?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the specific award entries. So in the table, under AVN Award ceremony and year 2013, there are two awards where she was nominated.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0: \"avn award\", result=\"nominated\", award=\"milf/cougar performer of the year\"\n\nRow 1: \"avn award\", result=\"nominated\", award=\"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\"\n\nSo columns are: ceremony (for both), year (both), result (both), and award (both). But since all these cells are present in those rows, perhaps listing each cell as relevant.\n\nBut the instruction says \"You are to identify the specific entries that support your conclusion.\" So I think we need to list for each row what columns are relevant.\n\nSo for Row 0: columns \"year\", \"ceremony\", \"result\", and \"award\"\n\nFor Row 1: same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just identifying that in AVN Award rows (Rows 0 and 1), her result was \"nominated\" and the award was specific. So to confirm the two awards she was nominated for.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: ceremony=avn award, year=2013, result=nominated, award=milf/cougar performer of the year\n- Row 1: ceremony=avn award, year=2013, result=nominated, award=most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\n\nHence, these are the cells that support the conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe specific entries supporting the conclusion that Brandi Love was nominated for two awards at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013 are:\n\n1. In **Row 0**:\n   - Year: 2013\n   - Ceremony: avn award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Award: MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year\n\n2. In **Row 1**:\n   - Year: 2013\n   - Ceremony: avn award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Award: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n\nThese entries confirm that Brandi Love was indeed nominated for two separate awards at the AVN ceremony in question.\n\nAnswer:  \n**TRUE**\n\n**Relevant Entries:**  \n- **Row 0:** Year=2013, Ceremony=avn award, Result=nominated, Award=milf/cougar performer of the year  \n- **Row 1:** Year=2013, Ceremony=avn award, Result=nominated, Award=most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison)",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"brandi love be nominate for a total of 5 award in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents in the table. The columns are: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. Each row represents an award or nomination for a specific person in 2013.\n\nThe claim mentions \"brandi love be.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here. Maybe it's supposed to be \"Brandi Love.\" So, I'll consider that she is the individual in question.\n\nThe claim states that Brandi Love was nominated for a total of 5 awards in 2013. To verify this, I need to check each row where the work or performer might be associated with her and count the number of times she was nominated.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. First row: year 2013, ceremony \"avn award,\" result \"nominated,\" award \"milf / cougar performer of the year,\" work \"n / a.\" It's unclear who this is for since work is N/A.\n2. Second row: same year and ceremony, result \"nominated,\" award \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison),\" work \"big titty milfs.\" This seems to be an award for a specific category, possibly not Brandi Love unless she's part of this work.\n3. Third row: nightmoves award, won, award is best cougar / milf performer, work N/A. If this was her, it's a win, not a nomination.\n4. Fourth row: same ceremony, result \"nominated,\" award \"best ass,\" work N/A. Again, unless she's associated with the work or award name, unsure.\n5. Fifth row: xbiz award, nominated, award web star of the year, work N/A.\n\nWait, but how do we tie this to Brandi Love? The 'work' column might indicate what category she was nominated in. For example, if one of the rows has her as the work, then that would count as a nomination. But looking at the data, all the 'work' entries are either N/A or specific categories like \"big titty milfs\" or \"best cougar / milf performer.\"\n\nIf Brandi Love is associated with any of these works, she might have been nominated multiple times. However, without explicit mention of her name in the work column, it's hard to link them directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each award ceremony (avn, nightmoves, xbiz) has categories where she could be nominated. For example, if she was nominated for Milf/Cougar performer at AVN and Best Ass at Nightmoves, that would count as two nominations, but the claim says five.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine each row:\n\n- First row: ceremony is AVN award, result is nominated, award is Milf/Cougar performer of the year. If this was her nomination, that's one.\n- Second row: same ceremony, AVN award, nominated for Most outrageous sex scene with Kelly Madison. Maybe she wasn't involved here unless she's part of it.\n- Third row: Nightmoves award, won, so not a nomination.\n- Fourth row: Nightmoves award, nominated for Best Ass.\n- Fifth row: XBiz award, nominated for Web Star of the year.\n\nSo, if Brandi Love is associated with Milf/Cougar performer (first row), Best Ass (fourth row), and Web Star (fifth row), that's three nominations. But the claim says five. That doesn't add up unless there are more relevant rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each award ceremony counts separately. AVN, Nightmoves, XBiz\u2014each could have multiple categories where she was nominated.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n1. First row: Milf/Cougar performer (nomination)\n2. Second row: Doesn't mention her specifically.\n3. Third row: Won, not a nomination.\n4. Fourth row: Best Ass (nomination)\n5. Fifth row: Web Star of the year (nomination)\n\nThat's three nominations from three different ceremonies. The claim says five, so unless there are more, it's only three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because she was only nominated for three awards in 2013 based on the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Brandi Love was nominated for a total of 5 awards in 2013, we analyze each relevant row in the table:\n\n1. **First Row**: \n   - Ceremony: AVN Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Award: Milf/Cougar Performer of the Year\n   - This is a nomination.\n\n2. **Fourth Row**:\n   - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Award: Best Ass\n   - Another nomination.\n\n3. **Fifth Row**:\n   - Ceremony: XBiz Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Award: Web Star of the Year\n   - Third nomination.\n\nOnly three nominations are found, not five as claimed. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brandi love do not win web star of the year at any award ceremony in 2013\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. The data shows various awards from 2013, including AVN, Nightmoves, and XBiz awards.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Brandi Love not winning \"Web Star of the Year\" in any award ceremony during 2013. So, I need to check if there's any row where Brandi Love won that particular award.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The first entry (row 0) has \"milf / cougar performer of the year\" but it's under \"award,\" and the result is \"nominated.\" No mention of Brandi Love here.\n- Second row also mentions \"milf / cougar performer of the year\" differently, but again, no Brandi Love involved.\n- Third entry (row 2) for Nightmoves award: Result is \"won,\" award is \"best cougar / milf performer (editor's choice).\" So this is someone else winning a cougar/milf category, not Web Star of the Year.\n- Fourth row (row 3): Nominated for best ass, so unrelated.\n- Fifth row (row 4): Awarded \"web star of the year.\" Wait, that's exactly what the claim mentions.\n\nWait, but the fifth entry is under \"ceremony\" as XBiz award. The \"award\" column here is \"web star of the year,\" and result is \"nominated.\" So Brandi Love was nominated for Web Star of the Year at the 2013 XBiz awards but didn't win it. \n\nBut the claim says she did not win any such award in 2013. Since she was only nominated, not winning, technically the statement is true because she didn't win it. But wait, maybe the claim's wording is about whether she won at all, regardless of nomination.\n\nWait, but the table shows that in row 4, \"web star of the year\" is an award she was nominated for, which means she didn't win it. So the claim says she did not win it, so it's true because she didn't actually win; she just got a nomination.\n\nBut hold on, the claim is about whether she won at any ceremony in 2013. Since she was only nominated and didn't win, the statement holds as TRUE.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again: The data shows that for XBiz award (row 4), the \"award\" is \"web star of the year,\" and result is \"nominated.\" So Brandi Love was nominated but did not win it. Therefore, the claim is correct because she didn't win any such award in 2013.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misreading: The fifth row (row index 4) is:\n\n[\n  2013,\n  \"xbiz award\",\n  \"nominated\",\n  \"web star of the year\",\n  \"n / a\"\n]\n\nSo, yes, she was nominated for Web Star of the Year at XBiz. So she didn't win it, hence the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait no, wait: The claim says she did not win any award ceremony in 2013 for that specific award. Since she only got a nomination, which means she didn't win, so the statement is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the table has another row where she won it? Let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking through each row's \"award\" column:\n\n- Row 0: milf / cougar performer of the year \u2013 not Web Star\n- Row 1: most outrageous sex scene \u2013 nope\n- Row 2: best cougar / milf performer \u2013 different award\n- Row 3: best ass \u2013 nope\n- Row 4: web star of the year \u2013 she was nominated, not won\n\nSo yes, in all cases, she didn't win Web Star of the Year. She only got a nomination. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brandi Love did not win \"Web Star of the Year\" at any award ceremony in 2013. Checking the table, there's no entry where Brandi Love won this specific award; she was only nominated for it at the XBiz awards. Thus, the statement is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So the task is to determine whether a specific claim about an award won by Brandi Love in 2013 is true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim: \"brandi love be win 2 award at the avn award in 2013.\" It seems like the user is trying to say that Brandi Love won two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013. \n\nLooking at the table structure provided, it has columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. The data rows include various winners and their details from 2013.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the claim into parts:\n1. **Winners Name**: Brandi Love\n2. **Award Details**: two awards\n3. **Ceremony**: AVN Award\n4. **Year**: 2013\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the table to see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table's data, let's focus on the relevant columns for the claim: year, ceremony, result (which indicates if it was a win or nomination), award, and possibly work (though that might not be necessary here).\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: AVN Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Milf / Cougar Performer of the Year\n  - Work: n/a\n\nHere, Brandi Love is a MILF/Cougar performer and was nominated, not won. So this doesn't support the claim that she won two awards.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: AVN Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison\n  - Work: Big Titty MILF\n\nThis is about a different award category, not the main performer awards. So again, no win.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n  - Result: Won\n  - Award: Best Cougar / Milf Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice)\n  - Work: n/a\n\nHere, Brandi Love won an award at the Nightmoves ceremony. That's one win.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Best Ass\n  - Work: n/a\n\nThis is a different award category, so not relevant to the main claim of two AVN Awards.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: XBIZ Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Web Star of the Year\n  - Work: n/a\n\nThis is from a different ceremony (XBIZ), so not relevant here.\n\nSo, from this analysis, Brandi Love only won one award in 2013 at the Nightmoves Awards. She didn't win two AVN Awards because she was only nominated there and not won. Additionally, the claim says \"two awards,\" but the table shows her winning only once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because she only won one award that year, not two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"brandi love be nominate 2 time for best as as 2 different award ceremony in 2013.\" From what I can gather, it seems to suggest that Brandi Love was nominated twice in 2013 for the same award category but at two different ceremonies. Alternatively, it could mean she was nominated twice for two different awards.\n\nLooking at the table, let's parse the data. The columns are year, ceremony, result, award, and work. Each row represents an entry for a specific award.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: 2013, AVN Award, Nominated, MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year, Big Titty MILFs.\n2. Second row: Same year and ceremony as above, but different award category: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison), and the work is Big Titty MILFs again. Wait, so same ceremony (AVN Award) but different award categories? Or maybe it's a typo because AVN Award typically has multiple awards.\n3. Third row: 2013, Nightmoves Award, Won, Best Cougar/MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice), N/A.\n4. Fourth row: Same year and award as above, nominated for Best Ass.\n5. Fifth row: 2013, XBIZ Award, Nominated, Web Star of the Year.\n\nNow, focusing on Brandi Love. From what I know, her real name is Tracey Lynn Adams, but she's known as Brandi Love in the industry. Looking at the table, I can see that in the first row, she's nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year under AVN Award, and the work is Big Titty MILFs. The second row also lists her with the same ceremony (AVN) but a different award category: Most Outrageous Sex Scene, which makes sense because awards often have multiple categories.\n\nSo in 2013, Brandi Love was indeed nominated twice under AVN Awards: once for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year and another for Most Outrageous Sex Scene. That means she had two different award entries at the same ceremony but different categories. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"best as\" which might refer to Best Ass or something else. In row 4, under Nightmoves Award, she's nominated for Best Ass. So in 2013, she was also nominated for Best Ass at Nightmoves. So that would make it three nominations: AVN MILF/Cougar, AVN Most Outrageous Sex Scene, and Nightmoves Best Ass.\n\nBut the claim says \"nominated 2 time for best as as 2 different award ceremony.\" So perhaps they are considering two separate award ceremonies (AVN and Nightmoves), each with a different category. Therefore, she was indeed nominated twice in two different award ceremonies for the same or similar categories.\n\nSo yes, the claim is true because Brandi Love was nominated twice in 2013 at two different award ceremonies for \"best\" awards: once for MILF/Cougar Performer and another for Best Ass.\n\nWait, but looking back, the second row's award is Most Outrageous Sex Scene, which might not be the same as Best Ass. So maybe the user meant two different award categories within the same ceremony. But the claim says \"2 different award ceremony,\" so it's about two different ceremonies, each with a best award.\n\nSo in 2013, Brandi Love was indeed nominated for two separate awards at different ceremonies: AVN Award and Nightmoves Award. That aligns with the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Brandi Love was nominated twice in 2013 at two different award ceremonies: once for the MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year at the AVN Awards and another time for Best Ass at the Nightmoves Awards.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim: \"brandi love be nominate for and win 5 award in 2013.\" I need to check if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Brandi Love being nominated and winning awards. Looking at the table, each row represents an award ceremony with details like year, ceremony name, result, award category, and the work. \n\nI'll go through each row to find any related to Brandi Love or nominations and wins. Wait, the table doesn't list individual performers but rather award categories. The rows are about different award ceremonies like AVN, Nightmoves, XBIZ.\n\nWait, in 2013, Brandi Love was indeed nominated for several awards. For instance, she was a nominee at the AVN Awards and Nightmoves Awards. She also won some, like the \"Best Cougar/MILF Performer\" from Nightmoves. \n\nBut the claim says she \"win 5 award.\" Let me check how many times she actually won. The table shows only one win in 2013 under Nightmoves. So she might have been nominated for multiple awards but only won once.\n\nAlso, the term \"brandi love be nominate\" needs to match the data. I don't see any entries directly mentioning Brandi Love by name, but perhaps it's implied. The award categories are specific, so I need to check if her wins and nominations align with the claim.\n\nWait, the table shows she was nominated for things like \"most outrageous sex scene\" and \"best ass,\" which might relate to different categories. So while she was indeed nominated multiple times, she didn't win five awards in 2013\u2014just one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partly true but not entirely accurate about winning five awards.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brandi Love was nominated for and won five awards in 2013. From the table:\n\n- She was a nominee at AVN and Nightmoves Awards.\n- She won \"Best Cougar/MILF Performer\" from Nightmoves.\n\nThus, she didn't win five awards but was involved in several nominations. This makes the claim incorrect regarding the number of wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"big titty milfs be the third name work that brandi love receive an award for in 2013.\" \n\nLet me start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Timeframe**: The claim mentions the year 2013. Looking at the table, all the data entries are from 2013, so this checks out.\n\n2. **Recipient**: It specifies \"brandi love\" as the recipient of an award. I need to look into the 'work' column to see if Brandi Love's works are listed here. \n\nLooking through the data:\n- Row 0: Work is \"n / a\"\n- Row 1: Work is \"big titty milfs\"\n- Rows 2, 3, and 4 have either \"n / a\" or other names.\n\nSo, Brandi Love has at least two works listed in 2013: \"big titty milfs\" and another entry where work is missing. Wait, actually, row 0's work is \"n/a\", but maybe that's not Brandi Love? Let me check the 'award' column for each row.\n\nWait, the 'award' column might indicate what award was given. For example:\n- Row 1: Award is \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\"\n- Row 3: Award is \"best ass\"\n\nBut I'm not sure if these are awards Brandi Love won. So maybe it's better to focus on the 'award' column and see if any of them are for her.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents an award. Let me parse each entry as a separate award.\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, ceremony \"avn award\", result \"nominated\", award \"milf / cougar performer of the year\", work \"n / a\"\n\nSo, this is an AVN Award nomination for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year. But it's only a nomination, not a win.\n\nRow 1: Ceremony \"avn award\", result \"nominated\", award \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\", work \"big titty milfs\"\n\nThis is another AVN Award nomination, this time for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison. The work here is \"big titty milfs,\" which seems to be associated with Brandi Love.\n\nRow 2: Ceremony \"nightmoves award\", result \"won\", award \"best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice)\", work \"n / a\"\n\nThis is a win for Best Cougar/MILF Performer, but the work isn't specified. The recipient could be Brandi Love if that's her.\n\nRow 3: Ceremony \"nightmoves award\", result \"nominated\", award \"best ass\", work \"n / a\"\n\nAnother nomination, this time for Best Ass. Not sure if that's related to her.\n\nRow 4: Ceremony \"xbiz award\", result \"nominated\", award \"web star of the year\", work \"n / a\"\n\nThis is an XBIZ Award nomination for Web Star of the Year. If Brandi Love was also nominated here, then she could have multiple works.\n\nWait, but the claim says that \"big titty milfs\" is the third name work that Brandi Love received an award for in 2013. So I need to check how many times Brandi Love won awards in 2013 and what her awarded works were.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row 1: Work is \"big titty milfs\" and it's a nomination, not a win.\n- Row 2: She won Best Cougar/MILF Performer. The work here is listed as \"n / a,\" so maybe her actual award-winning work isn't specified in this row.\n\nWait, perhaps each entry represents an individual award. So if Brandi Love won multiple awards, the 'work' would be different for each.\n\nBut the claim says that \"big titty milfs\" is the third name work she received an award for. That suggests it's not the first or second work awarded to her in 2013.\n\nWait, looking at row 1: the work is \"big titty milfs,\" and the result is \"nominated.\" So she didn't win that award. Then, in row 2, she won an award, but the work is missing. Maybe her actual winning work isn't listed here or perhaps it's another category.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only lists specific awards, and not all of them.\n\nBut let me think about how many times Brandi Love was awarded in 2013. From the table:\n\n- Row 1: She was nominated for AVN Award for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison.\n- Row 2: She won Nightmoves Award for Best Cougar/MILF Performer.\n\nSo she at least has two entries here, one win and one nomination.\n\nThe claim is about \"big titty milfs\" being the third work. But in row 1, her work was nominated, not awarded. So does that count as receiving an award? No, because it's just a nomination.\n\nWait, maybe each entry represents a different award ceremony, like AVN Awards, Nightmoves Awards, XBIZ Awards, etc. Each of these could have multiple categories.\n\nIn row 1: She is nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison, and her work is \"big titty milfs.\"\n\nIn row 2: She won Best Cougar/MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice), but the work isn't listed.\n\nSo perhaps in 2013, she was only awarded once, and \"big titty milfs\" wasn't an award-winning work for her. It's just a nominated work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"big titty milfs\" is the third name of a work she won an award for. But from the table, it seems that row 1 is a nomination, not a win. So perhaps the claim is false because \"big titty milfs\" didn't receive an award in 2013.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if Brandi Love actually received an award for that work. Maybe she did, but according to this table, it's just a nomination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't list all her awards, so we can't be certain. But based on what is given in the table, \"big titty milfs\" was only nominated, not awarded.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"big titty milfs be the third name work that brandi love receive an award for in 2013\" would be FALSE because it's stated as a nomination, not an award.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"big titty milfs\" is the third work Brandi Love received an award for in 2013. However, upon reviewing the table, this entry was only a nomination and not an actual award. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"work\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"brandi love be the winner of the web star of the year award at the xbiz award ceremony in 2013.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are year, ceremony, result, award, and work. Each row represents an entry with data corresponding to these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions three main points: the year (2013), the ceremony (xbiz award), and the award (web star of the year). It also specifies that Brandi Love won this award.\n\nLooking at the table's data for 2013:\n\n- The first row has \"avn award\" as the ceremony, with the result being \"nominated\" for \"milf / cougar performer of the year\".\n- The second row is also about \"avn award\", but it's for \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\".\n- The third row is \"nightmoves award\", and they won \"best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice)\".\n- The fourth row is again \"nightmoves award\" with a \"nominated\" result for \"best ass\".\n- The fifth row is \"xbiz award\", with the result being \"nominated\" for \"web star of the year\".\n\nNow, focusing on the xbiz award in 2013 (which is the fifth row), I see that it's nominated for \"web star of the year.\" There's no mention of Brandi Love winning this. In fact, the table doesn't show any entry where she won this specific award.\n\nI need to check if there's any cell related to her winning in 2013. The table includes multiple award categories: avn award, nightmoves award, and xbiz award.
