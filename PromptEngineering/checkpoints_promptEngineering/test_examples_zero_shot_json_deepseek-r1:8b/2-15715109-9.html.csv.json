    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"thomas yurkovich be bear in eveleth , minnesota on 29 october , 1935 and play for the rochester mustang and james westby be bear in minneapolis , minnesota on 5 february , 1937 and play for the fort france canadian.\"\n\nSo, there are two parts to this claim. The first part is about Thomas Yurkovich, and the second part is about James Westby.\n\nStarting with Thomas Yurkovich:\n\n1. **Name**: His name is Thomas Yurkovich.\n2. **Birthplace**: Eveleth, Minnesota on 29 October 1935.\n3. **Team**: Rochester Mustangs (USHL).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for Thomas Yurkovich. Scanning through each row, I see that he is listed in row index 18:\n\n- Name: Thomas Yurkovich\n- Birthdate: 29 October 1935\n- Birthplace: Eveleth, Minnesota\n- Team: Rochester Mustangs (USHL)\n\nSo his information matches exactly what's in the claim. That part seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to James Westby:\n\n1. **Name**: His name is James Westby.\n2. **Birthplace**: Minneapolis, Minnesota on 5 February 1937.\n3. **Team**: Fort Frances Canadians.\n\nLooking for James Westby in the table, he's in row index 15:\n\n- Name: James Westby\n- Birthdate: 5 February 1937\n- Birthplace: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n- Team: Fort Frances Canadians\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match. According to the claim, he plays for the Fort France Canadian, but in the table, his team is listed as \"fort frances canadians\" without the word \"and\". Hmm, that's a slight difference in capitalization and structure.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The claim says \"play for the fort france canadian\", while the table has \"fort frances canadians\". So the table actually lists it correctly as plural, which makes sense because it's a team name. However, the claim only mentions \"the fort france canadian\" without the 's', which might be a typo or oversight.\n\nBut regardless of that, the key points are:\n\n- Name: Correct.\n- Birthplace: Minneapolis, Minnesota on 5 February 1937: Correct.\n- Team: Fort Frances Canadians in the table vs. \"fort france canadian\" in the claim.\n\nSo the team name discrepancy is just a matter of pluralization, but it's about whether the team is correctly mentioned. The claim uses \"the fort france canadian\", which might not be the exact team name as listed in the table, which is \"fort frances canadians\".\n\nBut wait, another thought: the user provided the table data, and looking at row 15, the team column has \"fort frances canadians\". So the correct team name is plural. The claim says \"the fort france canadian\", singular. That's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect in the team name.\n\nBut wait again, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: is \"fort frances canadians\" the same as \"the fort france canadian\"? Or maybe it's just a typo. Alternatively, perhaps both are acceptable variants.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other rows, such as row 12 for William Reichart, his team is \"rochester mustangs ( ushl )\", which includes parentheses and additional info. Similarly, others have teams with similar structures.\n\nBut in any case, the key point is whether James Westby's information matches. His name, birthplace, and date are all correct. The only possible issue is the exact wording of his team.\n\nSo, does the claim accurately describe both Thomas Yurkovich and James Westby? It seems so for Thomas, but not exactly for James regarding the team name.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions say to check each condition in the claim against the table. So for each person, we need to verify all aspects: name, birthdate, birthplace, and team.\n\nFor Thomas Yurkovich:\n\n- Name: Correct.\n- Birthdate: 29 October 1935: Correct.\n- Birthplace: Eveleth, Minnesota: Correct.\n- Team: Rochester Mustangs (USHL): Correct.\n\nFor James Westby:\n\n- Name: Correct.\n- Birthdate: 5 February 1937: Correct.\n- Birthplace: Minneapolis, Minnesota: Correct.\n- Team: Fort Frances Canadians vs. claim's \"the fort france canadian\": Discrepancy in pluralization and article usage.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be slightly incorrect regarding the team name, but all other aspects are correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the team name in their question. Let me check again:\n\nThe claim says: \"...and play for the fort france canadian.\"\n\nIn the table, it's \"fort frances canadians.\" So it's plural. Therefore, the claim is missing the 's' and using \"the\" instead of just referring to it as part of the name.\n\nSo, in terms of accuracy, the team name should be correctly stated as per the table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect in its phrasing of the team name for James Westby.\n\nBut does that make the entire claim false? Because only the team name is off, but all other aspects are correct.\n\nHowever, when verifying claims, even minor discrepancies can cause the whole claim to be considered false if accuracy is paramount. Therefore, since the team name differs in pluralization and phrasing, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. The user might have just mistyped \"canadians\" as \"canadian.\" In that case, it's a minor error, but still an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both versions are acceptable, and the team name can be referred to singularly or plurally. But in the table, it's clearly listed with 's', so perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since one of the statements (about James Westby's team) is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is partially incorrect due to a discrepancy in the team name for James Westby. While his name, birthplace, and date are correct, the table lists \"fort frances canadians,\" whereas the claim refers to \"the fort france canadian.\" This makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status\": \"false\",\n    \"reason\": \"The team name for James Westby does not match exactly as stated in the claim.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to support this claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the player that plays for the flin flon bombers (sjhl) is pat rupp and the player that plays for the university of north dakota (ncaa) is donald ross.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about Pat Rupp playing for the Flin Flon Bombers in the SJHL. The second part is about Donald Ross playing for the University of North Dakota in the NCAA.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if these players are present and associated with the correct teams.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each entry:\n\n1. David Brooks - plays for Rochester Mustangs (USHL)\n2. Herb Brooks - same team as above\n3. Roger Christian - Warroad Lakers\n4. Bill Christian - same team as above\n5. Paul Coppo - Green Bay Bobcats (USHL)\n6. Daniel Dilworth - St Paul Saints (IHl)\n7. Dates Fryberger - Middlebury College\n8. Paul Johnson - Waterloo Black Hawks (USHL)\n9. Red Martin - None listed\n10. Jim McCoy - Blind River Hockey Club\n11. Wayne Meredith - St Paul Saints (IHl)\n12. William Reichart - Rochester Mustangs (USHL)\n13. Donald Ross - University of North Dakota (NCAA) \u2013 This matches the claim for the second part.\n14. Pat Rupp - Flin Flon Bombers (SJHL) \u2013 This matches the first part of the claim.\n\nSo, both parts are supported by the table.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. For each player mentioned in the claim, I'll look up their row index and the columns that contain the team names.\n\nFor Pat Rupp:\n- Row 13: columns \"name\" and \"19631964 team\". The 1963-1964 season's team is Flin Flon Bombers (SJHL).\n\nFor Donald Ross:\n- Row 13: same as above, but his column is \"19631964 team\", which lists the University of North Dakota (NCAA).\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in row 13, the name is Donald Ross, and looking at the columns:\n\n\"columns\": [\n    \"name\",\n    \"height (cm)\",\n    \"weight (kg)\",\n    \"birthdate\",\n    \"birthplace\",\n    \"19631964 team\"\n]\n\nSo for each row, it's the sixth column (index 5) that lists their team for 1963-1964. So Pat Rupp is in row 13, and Donald Ross is also in row 13?\n\nWait no, let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 14 is \"pat rupp\":\n- \"name\": pat rupp\n- \"19631964 team\": flin flon bombers (sjhl)\n\nRow 13: \"donald ross\":\n- \"name\": donald ross\n- \"19631964 team\": university of north dakota (ncaa)\n\nSo, both are in row 13. But each has their own column entries.\n\nTherefore, for the claim, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Pat Rupp:\n- Row 14 (since it's the 14th entry in data array), columns: name and 19631964 team.\n\nFor Donald Ross:\n- Same row? Wait no, let me check the indices again.\n\nWait the table is a list of arrays. The first one is index 0, second index 1, etc. So looking at the \"data\" array:\n\n0: David Brooks\n1: Herb Brooks\n...\n13: Donald Ross\n14: Pat Rupp\n\nSo, Donald Ross is row 13 and Pat Rupp is row 14.\n\nTherefore, for each of them, I need to check their respective columns.\n\nFor Donald Ross (row 13):\n- \"name\" column: donald ross\n- \"19631964 team\" column: university of north dakota (ncaa)\n\nFor Pat Rupp (row 14):\n- \"name\": pat rupp\n- \"19631964 team\": flin flon bombers (sjhl)\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Donald Ross: row_index=13, column_name=\"name\" and \"19631964 team\"\n- For Pat Rupp: row_index=14, same columns.\n\nWait but in the claim, it's about two players, so each part needs to be checked. So I need to extract both.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n[{\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"name\"},{\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"19631964 team\"},{\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"name\"},{\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"19631964 team\"}]\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row has all columns. So for row 13 (Donald Ross), \"name\" is donald ross and \"19631964 team\" is university of north dakota. For row 14 (Pat Rupp), same thing but different name and team.\n\nSo yes, both players are correctly in the table with their respective teams.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table entries for Pat Rupp and Donald Ross. The relevant cells indicate their names and the teams they played for during the 1963-1964 season.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"19631964 team\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"19631964 team\"}\n]\n```",

His name appears in row index 11. The relevant columns here are \"name\", \"weight (kg)\", \"height (cm)\", and \"birthdate\". From the data, his weight is 71 kg, height is 170 cm, and birthdate is 3 July 1935. All these match the claim exactly.\n\nNow for Wayne Meredith. His name is in row index 8. Checking the columns: weight is 80 kg, height is 175 cm, and birthdate is 4 October 1939. These also align perfectly with the claim.\n\nI should make sure there's no discrepancy in the data. For both individuals, all specified attributes are correctly matched.

The claim says he plays for St. Paul Saints (IHl). Looking at the \"19631964 team\" column, Wayne Meredith's team is listed as \"st paul saints (ihl)\". This matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nAdditionally, I'll verify if there's only one player from South Bend, Indiana who fits these criteria.

The claim is: \"the person bear 12 august 1942 in detroit , michigan be pat rupp and he play for the flin flon bomber and have a birthplace of detroit , michigan.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check against each column in the table.\n\n1. **Name**: The name should be \"Pat Rupp.\"\n2. **Birthdate**: August 12, 1942.\n3. **Birthplace**: Detroit, Michigan.\n4. **Team**: Flin-Flon Bombers (SJHL).\n5. **Height and Weight**: Not specified in the claim, so maybe they don't matter here.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different person with their details. I'll go through each row to find someone who matches all these criteria.\n\nStarting from row 0: David Brooks doesn't match the name or birthdate.\nRow 1: Herb Brooks - not matching name or team.\nRow 2: Roger Christian - no match.\nRow 3: Bill Christian - no.\nRow 4: Paul Coppo - no.\nRow 5: Daniel Dilworth - no.\nRow 6: Dates Fryberger - different first name, so probably not.\nRow 7: Paul Johnson - nope.\nRow 8: Red Martin - team is 'none', doesn't match.\nRow 9: Jim McCoy - different name.\nRow 10: Wayne Meredith - no.\nRow 11: William Reichart - different name and birthdate.\nRow 12: Donald Ross - not matching.\nRow 13: Pat Rupp - Here's someone with the same last name as the claim. Let me check all columns:\n   - Name: \"pat rupp\" (all lowercase in table, but it's a match).\n   - Birthdate: \"12 august 1942\" which matches August 12, 1942.\n   - Birthplace: \"detroit , michigan\". The table has \"detroit , michigan\", so that's correct.\n   - Team: \"flin flon bombers ( sjhl )\" in the table. The claim says \"flin flon bomber\" without mentioning SJHL, but I think it's a variation or abbreviation.\n\nSo all criteria are met for Pat Rupp. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells:\n- In row 13, columns are: name, height, weight, birthdate, birthplace, and team.\n- The relevant columns would be \"birthdate\" at row_index 13, \"birthplace\" at row_index 13, \"name\" at row_index 13, and \"19631964 team\" (though the claim doesn't mention the year, but the table's column is named that way).

Row 13, \"19631964 team\"\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"play for the flin flon bomber\", so that's exactly what's in the '19631964 team' column for this row.\n\nSo all four cells are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"birthdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"birthplace\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"19631964 team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is about two individuals: Thomas Yurkovich and James Westby.

First, the names \"Fort France Canadian\" doesn't seem right. I think it's supposed to be \"Fort Frances Canadians.\" Also, the claim has a typo: \"he be bear\" should probably be \"he was born.\" Similarly, for James Westby, it says \"on February 5, 197,\" which is likely a mistake because looking at the table, his birthdate is in 1937.\n\nNow, I'll check the table provided. The table has several columns: name, height, weight, birthdate, birthplace, and team. Let me find Thomas Yurkovich and James Westby in this table.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Thomas Yurkovich's row is towards the end. His birthdate is October 29, 1935, which matches the claim's October 29, 1935. His birthplace is Eveleth, Minnesota, but the claim says Minneapolis, Minnesota. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. Thomas Yurkovich's row:\n- Name: Thomas Yurkovich\n- Birthdate: 29 October 1935\n- Birthplace: Eveleth, Minnesota\n- Team: Rochester Mustangs (USHL)\n\nSo the claim says he was born in Minneapolis, but according to the table, it's Eveleth. That's incorrect.\n\nNow James Westby:\n- His row is earlier in the table.\n- Name: James Westby\n- Birthdate: 5 February 1937\n- Birthplace: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n- Team: Fort Frances Canadians\n\nWait, no, looking at the data:\n\nActually, James Westby's team is listed as \"fort frances canadians.\" So the claim says he played for Rochester Mustangs, but according to the table, it's Fort Frances Canadians. That's incorrect too.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false: Thomas Yurkovich wasn't born in Minneapolis, and James Westby didn't play for Rochester Mustangs; he played for Fort Frances Canadians.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the data again:\n\nThomas Yurkovich is indeed from Eveleth, not Minneapolis. His team is Rochester Mustangs (USHL), which matches part of the claim about the team but not the birthplace.\n\nJames Westby's row:\n- Name: James Westby\n- Birthdate: 5 February 1937\n- Birthplace: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n- Team: fort frances canadians\n\nThe claim says he was born in Eveleth on February 5, 197 and played for Rochester Mustangs. So the birthplace is wrong (Eveleth vs. Minneapolis) and the team is incorrect (Fort Frances vs. Rochester). Also, the claim mentions February 5, 197, which doesn't make sense because he was born in 1937.\n\nSo the claim has several inaccuracies: wrong birthplaces and teams, incorrect dates, and misspellings.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"Pat Rupp played for the University of North Dakota and Donald Ross played for the Flin Flon Bombers.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately. Starting with Pat Rupp: I need to check if he played for the University of North Dakota. Looking through the table, there's a row where \"name\" is \"pat rupp\". The corresponding team listed under \"19631964 team\" is \"flin flon bombers ( sjhl )\". So, from this, it seems Pat Rupp didn't play for UND; he was with the Flin Flon Bombers. That means the first part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nNext, checking Donald Ross: His row in the table shows that his team is \"university of north dakota ( ncaa )\". So he did play for UND. Now, looking at the second part of the claim, it says Donald Ross played for the Flin Flon Bombers. But from the table, his team was UND, not the Flin Flon Bombers. \n\nWait, I think I might have misread that. Let me double-check. The row for Donald Ross has \"university of north dakota ( ncaa )\" as the team, so he played there. The claim says he played for the Flin Flon Bombers, which is incorrect.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are not entirely true. The first part about Pat Rupp playing for UND is false because he was with the Flin Flon Bombers. The second part about Donald Ross playing for Flin Flon Bombers is also false because his team was UND. Therefore, the entire claim should be considered FALSE.\n\nAs for relevant cells, I need to find which data points from the table support this conclusion. For Pat Rupp, I need his name row and the \"19631964 team\" column to confirm he wasn't with UND. Similarly, for Donald Ross, his row and the same column show where he was. So the relevant cells would be the rows for both Pat Rupp and Donald Ross, specifically their team columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Pat Rupp played for the Flin Flon Bombers, not UND, and Donald Ross also did not play for the Flin Flon Bombers; he was with UND.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"19631964 team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"19631964 team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about William Reichart and Wayne Meredith is true based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"William Reichart be bear january 29 , 1938 and currently weigh 68 kg while stand 180 cm while wayne meredith currently weigh 98 kg and stand 186 cm , he be bear on may 5 , 1937\". Hmm, there's a typo here\u2014\"be bear\"\u2014I think they meant \"be born\" or maybe it's trying to say \"born\"? So I'll assume it's about their birthdates.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which columns are relevant. From the table, the columns related to each person include name, height (cm), weight (kg), birthdate, birthplace, and team. For the claim, we're focusing on birthdate, weight, and height for both William Reichart and Wayne Meredith.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll search for \"william reichart\" and \"wayne meredith\". Let's see:\n\nWilliam Reichart is in row 11 of the table. His details are:\n- Name: william reichart\n- Height (cm): 170\n- Weight (kg): 71\n- Birthdate: 3 July 1935\n- Birthplace: winnipeg, manitoba\n\nWayne Meredith is in row 9. His details:\n- Name: wayne meredith\n- Height (cm): 175\n- Weight (kg): 80\n- Birthdate: 4 October 1939\n- Birthplace: south bend, indiana\n\nNow, checking the claim against these:\n\n1. William Reichart's birthdate: The claim says he was born on January 29, 1938. But in the table, his birthday is July 3, 1935. That doesn't match.\n2. His current weight and height: The claim mentions 68 kg and 180 cm. However, according to the table, he's 71 kg and 170 cm. These don't align either.\n3. Wayne Meredith's details: The claim says he currently weighs 98 kg and stands 186 cm. In the table, he's 80 kg and 175 cm. That doesn't match as well.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions both of them being \"bear\" on May 5, 1937. Since I think it's a typo for birthdate, checking their actual dates shows neither was born on that date either.\n\nSo putting this all together, the claim seems to have multiple inaccuracies regarding both individuals' birthdates and other stats. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"birthdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"birthdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weight (kg)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"height (cm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Pat Rupp is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Pat Rupp be bear in Winnipeg, Manitoba and be bear on July 3, 1935, he be currently play for the green bay bombcats.\"\n\nLet me break this down into three main parts to verify:\n\n1. **Place of Birth**: The claim states that Pat Rupp was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on July 3, 1935.\n2. **Team Affiliation**: He is supposed to be playing for the Green Bay Bombcats currently.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant data for each part.\n\nStarting with the first part: Place of Birth. I'll check each row's birthplace and date. The table has several players named \"Pat Rupp,\" but from the data provided, there are two entries:\n\n- One Pat Rupp is born on December 12, 1942 in Detroit, Michigan. This doesn't match July 3, 1935 in Winnipeg.\n  \nWait, actually, looking again: There's only one entry for Pat Rupp in the table. Let me check row 13: \n\nYes, row 13 has \"pat rupp\" with birthdate December 12, 1942 in Detroit, Michigan. That doesn't match July 3, 1935 in Winnipeg. So there's no record of a Pat Rupp born on that specific date and place.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rows. Let me count again:\n\nRows are from 0 to 13. Row 13 is indeed the only one with \"pat rupp.\" So his birthdate is December 12, 1942 in Detroit. Therefore, the claim about being born on July 3, 1935 in Winnipeg is incorrect.\n\nSecond part: Currently playing for Green Bay Bombcats. Looking at the table, I don't see any entry where Pat Rupp is listed as currently playing for that team. The table might list past teams or current, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the claim states he is currently playing there.\n\nWait, looking back: In row 13, \"pat rupp\" is listed with a team called \"flin flon bombers (sjhl)\". That doesn't match Green Bay Bombcats. So he isn't currently playing for them based on the table.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are false. There's no Pat Rupp born in Winnipeg on July 3, 1935, and he isn't listed as playing for Green Bay Bombcats now.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"birthdate\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"birthplace\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"19631964 team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Wayne Meredith is true based on the given table. The claim says that Wayne Meredith is from Minneapolis, Minnesota and plays for the Blind River Hockey Club. Let me start by looking through the table to find his information.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to Wayne Meredith. Scanning through the \"name\" column: daniel dilworth, dates fryberger, paul johnson, red martin, jim mccoy, wayne meredith... there he is in row 9. Wait, actually, let me count again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n1. david brooks\n2. herb brooks\n3. roger christian\n4. bill christian\n5. paul coppo\n6. daniel dilworth\n7. dates fryberger\n8. paul johnson\n9. red martin\n10. jim mccoy\n11. wayne meredith\n12. william reichart\n13. donald ross\n14. pat rupp\n15. gary schmaltzbauer\n16. james westby\n17. thomas yurkovich\n\nWait, no, the row indices start at 0. So the first entry is index 0, so Wayne Meredith should be around index 9? Let me check: after Paul Johnson (index 8), then Red Martin (9), Jim McCoy (10), so actually, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, let me list them properly:\n\n- Index 0: david brooks\n- 1: herb brooks\n- 2: roger christian\n- 3: bill christian\n- 4: paul coppo\n- 5: daniel dilworth\n- 6: dates fryberger\n- 7: paul johnson\n- 8: red martin\n- 9: jim mccoy\n- 10: wayne meredith\n- 11: william reichart\n- etc.\n\nSo Wayne Meredith is at row index 10. Now, looking at his data:\n\nLooking at the columns for row 10:\n\n\"name\": \"wayne meredith\",\n\"height (cm)\": 175,\n\"weight (kg)\": 80,\n\"birthdate\": \"4 october 1939\",\n\"birthplace\": \"south bend , indiana\",\n\"19631964 team\": \"st paul saints ( ihl )\"\n\nWait, but the claim says he's from Minneapolis, Minnesota. However, his birthplace is listed as \"south bend , indiana\". So that's a discrepancy. He was born in South Bend, Indiana, not Minneapolis.\n\nAlso, regarding his team: according to the table, he plays for \"st paul saints ( ihl )\", but the claim says he plays for the Blind River Hockey Club. That doesn't match either.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Wayne Meredith is from Minneapolis, Minnesota and plays for the Blind River Hockey Club is **FALSE** because the table shows he was born in South Bend, Indiana, and played for the St Paul Saints (IHl), not the Blind River Hockey Club.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"birthplace\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"19631964 team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
