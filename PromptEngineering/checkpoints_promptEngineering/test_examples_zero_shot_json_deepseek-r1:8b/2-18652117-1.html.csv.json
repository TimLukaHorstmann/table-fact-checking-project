    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"tony lorick be the running back for oakland\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions Tony Lorick as a running back for Oakland. So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table where \"player\" is \"tony lorick,\" their \"position\" is \"rb,\" and the \"team\" is \"oakland.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with several attributes. The columns are pick, team, player, position, and college. So for each row, I can check these fields.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if any match all three criteria: player name, position, and team.\n\nRow 0: Player is Jack Cannon, position QB, team Boston. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Pete Beathard, QB, Kansas City. No match.\nRow 2: Matt Snell, RB, New York. Not Oakland, so no.\nRow 3: Bob Brown, OT, Denver. Position and team don't match.\nRow 4: Carl Eller, DE, Buffalo. Nope.\nRow 5: Scott Appleton, DT, Houston. No match.\nRow 6: Tony Lorick is listed here. His position is RB, and the team is Oakland. Oh, that's exactly what we're looking for.\n\nSo, this row (row index 6) has all the relevant information. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are at row 6 for both player, position, and team columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the player from ohio state plays for new york\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The table has columns: pick, team, player, position, and college. Each row represents a different player with their respective details. \n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. There is a player from Ohio State.\n2. This player plays for the New York team.\n\nI need to check if any player in the table fits both of these criteria.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 0: Player is Jack Cannon, college Boston College. Not Ohio State and not playing for New York.\n- Row 1: Pete Beathard, college USC. Also doesn't fit.\n- Row 2: Matt Snell, college Ohio State. Hmm, this is from Ohio State, but his team is listed as \"new york\". That seems relevant because the claim mentions both Ohio State and New York.\n\nWait, so Matt Snell is from Ohio State and plays for the New York team. That would make the claim TRUE, right? But let me double-check all rows to be sure.\n\nRow 3: Bob Brown from Nebraska, not Ohio State.\nRow 4: Carl Eller from Minnesota, no.\nRow 5: Scott Appleton from Texas, no.\nRow 6: Tony Lorick from Arizona State, no.\nRow 7: Ted Davis from Georgia Tech, no.\nRow 8: Teddy DAVIS (wait, correction: row 8 is Ted Davis from Georgia Tech. But the claim is about Ohio State, so this doesn't apply.\n\nWait a second, in the table, row 2 lists Matt Snell with college \"ohio state\" and team \"new york\". So yes, that matches both parts of the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's only one such player. Since only row 2 meets both conditions, it's fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is found in row 2 under the \"player\" and \"team\" columns where Matt Snell from Ohio State plays for New York.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"tony lorick , , be the player who be pick number 7 , by denver\". So, essentially, it's stating that Tony Lorick was picked by Denver as their 7th overall selection.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a pick. The columns are pick number, team, player, position, and college. My goal is to find if there's a row where the player is Tony Lorick, the pick number is 7, and the team is Denver.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Pick 1, Team Boston, Player Jack Cannon, Position QB, College Boston College.\nNo match here.\n\nRow 1: Pick 2, Team Kansas City, Player Pete Beathard, Position QB, College USC.\nStill not matching.\n\nRow 2: Pick 3, Team New York, Player Matt Snell, Position RB, College Ohio State.\nNot a match either.\n\nRow 3: Pick 4, Team Denver, Player Bob Brown, Position OT, College Nebraska.\nClose, but the player is Bob Brown, not Tony Lorick. So this row doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 4: Pick 5, Team Buffalo, Player Carl Eller, Position DE, College Minnesota.\nNope.\n\nRow 5: Pick 6, Team Houston, Player Scott Appleton, Position DT, College Texas.\nNot a match.\n\nRow 6: Pick 7, Team Oakland, Player Tony Lorick, Position RB, College Arizona State.\nWait, here's a potential match. Pick number is 7, team is Oakland, not Denver. So the pick number and player are correct, but the team doesn't match the claim which states it was by Denver.\n\nRow 7: Pick 8, Team San Diego, Player Ted Davis, Position LB, College Georgia Tech.\nNo match here either.\n\nSo, none of the rows have all three elements matching the claim: Tony Lorick as pick 7 for Denver. The closest is Row 6 where Tony Lorick is pick 7, but by Oakland, not Denver.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no row where Tony Lorick was picked by Denver at number 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lorick was the 7th pick by Denver, but checking each row shows that while Tony Lorick was indeed the 7th overall pick (Row 6), he was selected by Oakland, not Denver. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by breaking down the claim and understanding what each part means.\n\nThe claim says: \"new york be the team for the player from minnesota who's position be qb.\" Hmm, let me parse this sentence. It seems like it's asking if there's a player in Minnesota who plays quarterback (QB) and whose team is New York.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row to see if any fit these criteria. The columns relevant here are \"team,\" \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"college\" (since the college is where the player comes from). \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Team - Boston, Player - Jack Cannon, Position - QB, College - Boston College. Not from Minnesota.\n2. Row 1: Team - Kansas City, Player - Pete Beathard, Position - QB, College - USC. Not from Minnesota.\n3. Row 2: Team - New York, Player - Matt Snell, Position - RB, College - Ohio State. Position is RB, not QB. Also, college isn't Minnesota.\n4. Row 3: Team - Denver, Player - Bob Brown, Position - OT, College - Nebraska. Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Team - Buffalo, Player - Carl Eller, Position - DE, College - Minnesota. The college is Minnesota, so this could be a candidate. But position is DE, not QB.\n6. Row 5: Team - Houston, Player - Scott Appleton, Position - DT, College - Texas. Not relevant.\n7. Row 6: Team - Oakland, Player - Tony Lorick, Position - RB, College - Arizona State. Not relevant.\n8. Row 7: Team - San Diego, Player - Ted Davis, Position - LB, College - Georgia Tech. Not relevant.\n\nWait, in row 4, the player is from Minnesota, but their position is DE (defensive end), not QB. So there's no QB player from Minnesota in this table. The claim says that \"new york be the team for the player from minnesota who's position be qb,\" which would require a QB player from Minnesota with New York as their team.\n\nLooking through all the rows, none of the players are from Minnesota and play QB except maybe row 0 (Boston College), but that's in Boston. So I don't see any such player in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that New York is the team for a player from Minnesota who plays quarterback. Checking each row, none of the players from Minnesota have the position QB. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
