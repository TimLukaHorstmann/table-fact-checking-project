    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim: It says that 217 is the smallest (lowest) \"1st lbsc number\" where the \"lbsc name\" is \"granville.\" So I need to look for rows where the lbsc name is granville and find the lowest 1st lbsc no in those rows.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related are:\n- \"1st lbsc no\"\n- \"lbsc name\"\n\nSo, my relevant cells would be where the \"lbsc name\" is \"granville.\" Let me scan through each row's lbsc name to find granville.\n\nStarting from row 0: littlehampton\nRow 1: cottesloe\nRow 2: fratton\nRow 3: hayling\nRow 4: pevensey\nRow 5: southsea\nRow 6: leatherhead\nRow 7: sandown\nRow 8: arundel\nRow 9: croydon\nRow 10: hastings\nRow 11: eastbourne\nRow 12: carew d gilbert\nRow 13: george a wallis\nRow 14: de la warr\nRow 15: philip rose\nRow 16: allen sarle\nRow 17: edward blount\nRow 18: arthur otway\nRow 19: gordon - lennox\nRow 20: jacomb - hood\nRow 21: fremantle\nRow 22: bickersteth\nRow 23: cardew\nRow 24: ralph l lopes\nRow 25: jonas levy\nRow 26: sheffield\nRow 27: samuel laing\nRow 28: beresford\nThen I notice row numbers jump to 214, so let me check rows from 214 onwards.\n\nRow 214: gladstone\nRow 215: salisbury\nRow 216: granville\nRow 217: northcote\nRow 218: beaconsfield\nRow 219: cleveland\nRow 220: hampden\n\nLooking at row 216, the lbsc name is \"granville.\" So that's where I need to check. Now, in this row (row 216), what is the value of \"1st lbsc no\"? The columns for each row are as follows:\n\nEach row has values like:\nFor example, row 214: 214, gladstone\nRow 215: 215, salisbury\nRow 216: granville\n\nWait, in the table provided, the structure seems to be that each row has multiple entries. Let me check how the data is structured.\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement, the table starts with rows numbered from 0 up, and each row has multiple columns. For example:\n\nAt row 214: {\n  \"row_index\": 214,\n  \"columns\": [\n    {\"name\": \"1st lbsc no\", \"value\": \"214\"},\n    {\"name\": \"lbsc name\", \"value\": \"gladstone\"},\n    ... (other columns not relevant here)\n  ]\n}\n\nSimilarly, row 216 would be:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 216,\n  \"columns\": [\n    {\"name\": \"1st lbsc no\", \"value\": \"216\"},\n    {\"name\": \"lbsc name\", \"value\": \"granville\"},\n    ... (other columns)\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but looking again at the user's table structure, it's a bit unclear. The user provided a JSON object for the table, but I think each row in the table is an object with multiple properties. So for row 216, which has \"lbsc name\" as \"granville\", what is its \"1st lbsc no\"?\n\nFrom the data given, for row 214: columns include \"1st lbsc no\" as 214 and lbsc name as gladstone.\n\nRow 215: same structure but with salisbury.\n\nThen row 216: columns include \"1st lbsc no\" as 216? Wait, in the provided table, I see that at row_index 216, the column values are:\n\nAt line 30 of the table:\n[\n  ...\n  {\"row_index\": 214, \"columns\": [\n    {\"name\": \"1st lbsc no\", \"value\": \"214\"},\n    {\"name\": \"lbsc name\", \"value\": \"gladstone\"},\n    ...]\n  },\n...\n{\"row_index\": 216, \"columns\": [\n  {\"name\": \"1st lbsc no\", \"value\": \"216\"},\n  {\"name\": \"lbsc name\", \"value\": \"granville\"},\n  ...\n]}\n\nWait, but looking at the provided table, it seems that row 216 is:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 216,\n  \"columns\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"1st lbsc no\",\n      \"value\": \"216\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"lbsc name\",\n      \"value\": \"granville\"\n    },\n    ... (other columns)\n  ]\n}\n\nSo, the \"1st lbsc no\" for granville is 216.\n\nBut wait, the claim says that 217 is the lowest such number. So if in row 216, the number is 216, then 216 would be lower than 217. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there exists a row with granville and a lower \"1st lbsc no\" (216) than 217.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table provided by the user, rows go up to 220, but then at row 214 onwards, they have different values.\n\nBut looking back, I think that in the table, each row represents an lbsc number, and for some rows, like row 216, the \"lbsc name\" is granville. So the \"1st lbsc no\" for granville is 216.\n\nTherefore, since 216 is lower than 217, the claim that 217 is the lowest such number is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where the \"lbsc name\" is \"granville,\" specifically in row 216 with column \"1st lbsc no.\" Since this value is 216, which is lower than 217, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 216,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
