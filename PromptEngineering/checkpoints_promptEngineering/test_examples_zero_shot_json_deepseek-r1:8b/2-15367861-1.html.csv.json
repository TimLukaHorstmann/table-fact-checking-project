    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 points.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: \n1. Corinthians amass 22 points.\n2. They receive less than 11 losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team's performance. So, I need to find the row where the team is Corinthians. \n\nIn the data section of the table, I'll go through each row until I find \"corinthians\" in the 'team' column. Let me check:\n\n- Row 0: palestra it\u00e1lia - sp\n- Row 1: s\u00e3o paulo\n- Row 2: portuguesa\n- Row 3: bangu\n- Row 4: vasco da gama\n- Row 5: corinthians\n\nHere we go, row index 5 is Corinthians. Now, I need to check two things for this row:\n1. Do they have 22 points?\n2. How many losses do they have?\n\nLooking at the columns provided, the relevant columns are 'points' and 'lost'. \n\nIn row 5, under 'points', it's 22, so that condition is met.\n\nNow, under 'lost', it says 2. Wait, but the claim says \"less than 11 losses.\" Since 2 is definitely less than 11, this part also holds true.\n\nSo both conditions of the claim are satisfied in the data provided for Corinthians. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's saying. The claim mentions Corinthians and talks about their losses (\"zero loss\") in specific circumstances: when they \"score over 25 points.\" So, I need to find out how many times Corinthians lost a game where their score was above 25.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a team, with various statistics like points, played, drawn, lost, against, and difference. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"points\" and \"lost.\" \n\nI'll focus on the rows where the team is Corinthians. From the data provided, I see that Corinthians are in row 6. Their points in that game were 22, which is below 25, so the condition of scoring over 25 isn't met here. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again. The claim says \"when they score over 25,\" so I need to find any games where Corinthians scored more than 25 points and see if their losses in those games are zero.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 0: Points 36, but it's not Corinthians.\n- Row 1: Points 34, not Corinthians.\n- Row 2: Points 30, no.\n- Row 3: 29, no.\n- Row 4: 24, nope.\n- Row 5: 22, not over 25.\n- Row 6: 22, same as above.\n- The rest are other teams.\n\nSo, in the table, Corinthians only have a points value of 22. There's no row where their points are over 25. Therefore, there can't be any games where they scored more than 25 and lost zero because such games don't exist in the table. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Wait, let me double-check the rows. Corinthians have points of 22 in their game (row 6), which is less than 25. So, there are no instances where they scored over 25, hence zero losses in those games don't apply because such games don't happen.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}]}",
