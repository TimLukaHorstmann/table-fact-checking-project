    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"during season 2000 - 1 , kanto gakuin university be the winner , the title be 37th and the attendance be not available.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Season: 2000 - 1\n2. Winner: Kanto Gakuin University\n3. Title: 37th\n4. Attendance: Not available\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table's data, it's structured with columns like \"season,\" \"winner,\" \"title,\" etc. Each row corresponds to a different season and its details.\n\nLet me scan through each row for the season 2000 -1. \n\nGoing through the 'season' column:\n\n- 1993 -4, 1994-5,... up to 2012-13.\n\nLooking for \"2000 -1\". Scanning through, I find it in row 37 (since the first entry is 1993-4 as row 0, so each increment corresponds to a season). Wait, actually, the rows are listed from 0 to 49, but the seasons go from 30th (1993) up. So, for example:\n\nRow 0: 30th (1993)\n...\nRow 16: 36th (1999 -0 details)\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me recount.\n\nEach row has \"season\" as a string like \"2000 -1\". I need to find the exact row where season is \"2000 -1\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row after 40 entries would be row 36: \"36th\", which is 1999 -0 details.\nThen row 37: \"2000 -1 details\", so that's the one.\n\nNow, in row 37 (which is the 38th entry), let me check each relevant column:\n\n- winner: The cell for row 37, column \"winner\" is \"kanto gakuin university.\" So that matches.\n- title: The \"title\" column in row 37 is \"37th.\" That's correct.\n- attendance: In the same row, under \"attendance,\" it says \"n / a.\" So the claim's part about attendance being not available is supported.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are true for that season. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant columns are:\n\n- winner: column index where \"winner\" is, let me see. In the JSON structure, the columns list has \"title\", \"season\", \"winner\", etc., so \"winner\" is at position 2 (0-based indexing). So each row's winner is at column 2.\n\nBut wait, in the JSON data, each row is an array. The third element (index 2) is \"winner.\" So to get the relevant cells for each part:\n\n1. Winner: Check column 2 in row 37.\n2. Title: Check column 0 in row 37.\n3. Attendance: Column 5 in row 37.\n\nWait, no, the columns are as per the given JSON structure. The columns list is [\"title\", \"season\", \"winner\", ..., \"attendance\"]. So:\n\n- title: index 0\n- season: index 1\n- winner: index 2\n...\n- attendance: maybe around index 6 or so? Wait, no, let me count.\n\nLooking at the JSON's column list:\n\n[\n  \"title\",\n  \"season\",\n  \"winner\",\n  \"title_being\",\n  \"attendance\",\n  ...\n]\n\nWait, actually, in the provided data, each row has the following columns: title (0), season (1), winner (2), title_being (3), attendance (4). Wait no, that doesn't make sense because I see more than four columns. Let me recount.\n\nIn the JSON's table, the first few columns are:\n\n[\n  \"title\",\n  \"season\",\n  \"winner\",\n  \"title_being\",\n  \"attendance\",\n  ...\n]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all columns as per the given data. But in any case, for this specific claim, I need to find the cells that correspond to each part.\n\nFor \"winner\": column index is 2.\nFor \"title\": column index is 0.\nFor \"attendance\": in the JSON structure, it's listed after several other columns, but perhaps it's at position 4. Let me check the exact order.\n\nLooking at the JSON:\n\n\"columns\": [\n  \"title\",\n  \"season\",\n  \"winner\",\n  \"title_being\",\n  \"attendance\",\n  ...\n]\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate because I don't have the full list. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer by column name rather than index.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, in the example, relevant_cells is a list of objects with row_index and column_name. So regardless of their position in the array, each column has a specific name.\n\nSo for each part:\n\n- Winner: column name \"winner\"\n- Title: column name \"title\"\n- Attendance: column name \"attendance\"\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row 37 (since season is \"2000 -1\" and it's at row_index 37), column_name \"winner\".\n2. Same row, column_name \"title\".\n3. Same row, column_name \"attendance\".\n\nSo in total, three cells: two from row 37.\n\nWait, but the attendance cell in that row has the value \"n / a,\" which matches the claim's \"attendance be not available.\"\n\nTherefore, all parts are satisfied, making the claim TRUE.\n\nNow, to structure this as per the instructions:\n\n- answer is \"TRUE\"\n- relevant_cells is an array of three objects:\n   - {\"row_index\":37, \"column_name\":\"winner\"}\n   - {\"row_index\":37, \"column_name\":\"title\"}\n   - {\"row_index\":37, \"column_name\":\"attendance\"}\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, they had a JSON with two relevant cells. In our case, we have three. So I need to include all three.\n\nWait no, actually, the claim has three parts: winner, title, attendance. Each of these corresponds to specific columns in row 37. Therefore, each part must be checked by referring to their respective column.\n\nSo yes, three relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table confirms that during season 2000-1, Kanto Gakuin University was the winner with the 37th title and attendance not available.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"meiji win the 32nd title , while waseda be the runner - up.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. Meiji wins the 32nd title.\n2. Waseda is the runner-up.\n\nI need to find the row in the table where the season is \"32nd\" because that's when the 32nd title was awarded. Looking at the table, I see that each row starts with a number followed by 'st', 'nd', etc. The second row is \"31st\", third is \"32nd\". So the relevant row for the first part of the claim is row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed).\n\nIn row 2, the winner is \"meiji\" and the runner-up is \"waseda.\" That matches both parts of the claim. \n\nFor the second part of the claim, the runner-up should be waseda, which aligns with the data in row 2.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells. The columns involved are \"winner\" and \"runner - up,\" so I'll extract their values from row 2.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

The claim states: \"the season 2010 - 11 detail have a title of 47th and the runner - up be waseda.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first part says \"season 2010 - 11 detail\" has a title of \"47th\". Looking at the table, each row represents a different season with their respective details. The column named \"title\" lists values like \"30th\", \"31st\", up to \"49th.\" So I need to find the row where the title is \"47th.\"\n\nNext, the second part says the runner-up is waseda. In the table, there's a column called \"runner - up,\" which lists universities or institutions. I'll need to check if in that particular row (the one with the 47th title), the runner-up is indeed waseda.\n\nLet me start by locating the row with the title \"47th.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The first few titles are 30th, 31st, up to 49th. Specifically, looking at each entry:\n  - 40th: Waseda\n  - 41st: 35462 attendees\n  - 42nd: ...\nWait, no, I need to find where the title is exactly \"47th.\" Let me list them all out:\n\nLooking through each row's first element (title):\n\n- 30th, 31st, 32nd,... up to 49th.\n\nAt row index 46, it's the 47th title: \"47th.\"\n\nSo row index 46 is where the title is \"47th.\"\n\nNow, I need to check what the runner-up is for that row. The \"runner - up\" column in this row (index 46) is listed as \"waseda.\" \n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the data: each sub-array represents a season. For row index 46:\n\n[\n  \"47th\",\n  \"2010 - 11 details\",\n  \"teikyo\",\n  \"17 - 14\",\n  \"waseda\",\n  ...\n]\n\nSo yes, in this row, the runner-up is waseda.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct. The season 2010-11 detail has a title of 47th and the runner-up is waseda.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data. The 47th title corresponds to the 2010-11 season, and in that row, the runner-up is indeed waseda.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in JSON format with several columns and rows of data. The claim is: \"2010 - 11 detail season have a runner - up of tokai , and a title of 47th.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's making two assertions:\n\n1. In the season marked as \"2010 - 11 details,\" the runner-up is \"tokai.\"\n2. The same season has a title of \"47th.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different year or season. The columns include \"title,\" \"season,\" \"winner,\" \"runner-up,\" etc. So I need to find the specific row that matches \"2010 - 11 details\" and check the relevant columns.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for the 2010-11 season. Scanning through each entry, I see:\n\n- Row with index 46: \"2009 - 10 details\"\n- Then row 47: \"2010 - 11 details\"\n\nSo that's row 47. Now, checking the columns for this row.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: the runner-up is tokai and the title is 47th.\n\nLooking at the \"title\" column in row 47: it says \"47th.\" That matches the first part of the claim. Good so far.\n\nNext, check the \"runner - up\" (assuming it's a typo for \"runner-up\") column in row 47. The value there is \"waseda,\" according to the table data: [..., \"17 - 14\", \"waseda\", ...]. Wait, no\u2014that's the winner. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, looking at row 47:\n\n[\n  ...\n  \"47th\",\n  \"2010 - 11 details\",\n  \"teikyo\",\n  \"17 - 14\",\n  \"waseda\",\n  \"national stadium , tokyo , tokyo\",\n  \"25458\"\n]\n\nSo the winner is teikyo, and the runner-up is waseda. The claim says the runner-up is tokai, but in this row, it's waseda. That doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim about the runner-up being tokai is incorrect for the 2010-11 season. However, the title part is correct.\n\nBut wait, does the claim specify both parts as being true? Yes: \"runner - up of tokai , and a title of 47th.\" So since one part is wrong (runner-up isn't tokai), the entire claim should be false.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 47's season is indeed \"2010 - 11 details.\"\n- The title is correctly \"47th.\"\n- The runner-up in this row is waseda, not tokai.\n- So the claim's assertion about the runner-up being tokai is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the runner-up isn't tokai. However, I should structure the relevant_cells to point out which cells were checked.\n\nThe relevant columns are \"title\" and \"runner - up.\" Their corresponding rows (indexes) are 47 for both since that's where the season in question is located.\n\nWait, but each row has multiple columns. So for the claim, we need to check two specific columns: \"title\" and \"runner-up.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For the title column: row 47, column \"title.\"\n- For the runner-up column: row 47, column \"runner - up.\"\n\nI should include both in the relevant_cells list.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because while the title matches, the runner-up doesn't. But since both parts of the claim need to be true, and one is false, overall it's false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in JSON format and a claim that I need to verify. The task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nLet me first understand the claim: \"2010 - 2011 detail be the season have kanto gakuin university as the winner , with an attendance of n / a , and a title of 37th.\"\n\nBreaking it down, I need to check several things:\n1. The season is \"2010 - 2011\".\n2. The winner is \"kanto gakuin university.\"\n3. The attendance is \"n / a.\"\n4. The title is the \"37th.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a season with various details. The columns are: title, season, winner, score, runner-up, venue, and attendance.\n\nSo, I need to find the row where the season is \"2010 - 2011.\" Once found, check the other relevant fields.\n\nFirst step: Find the row for \"2010 - 2011\". Scanning through the data, each entry starts with a title like \"30th,\" \"31st,\" etc. Wait, the seasons are listed as \"1993 - 4 details\" and so on. So perhaps the season is split into two parts separated by a hyphen. For example, \"2000 - 1 details.\"\n\nWait, looking at the last few rows: \n- \"46th\", \"2009 - 10 details\"\n- \"47th\", \"2010 - 11 details\"\n- \"48th\", \"2011 - 12 details\"\n\nSo for 2010-2011, that would correspond to a season where the title starts with \"47th\" (since each title increments by one each year). Wait no, actually, looking at the data, the title is like \"30th,\" \"31st,\" etc., which I think are the ordinal numbers of the competition. So each row represents a different year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's see: The first row has \"30th\" and season \"1993 - 4 details.\" The next has \"31st,\" \"1994 -5 details,\" and so on. So the title is the ordinal number of the competition, while the season is a two-part string indicating the year.\n\nSo for 2010-2011, I need to find the row where the season is \"2010 - 11 details.\" Because looking at the data:\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- 46th: 2009-10\n- 47th: 2010-11\n- 48th: 2011-12\n\nSo yes, \"2010 - 11 details\" would be the row for the season 2010-2011.\n\nNow, in that row, what are the values:\n- title: 47th (since it's the 47th competition)\n- season: 2010 - 11 details\n- winner: teikyo\n- score: 17 -14\n- runner-up: waseda\n- venue: national stadium\n- attendance: 25458\n\nWait, but the claim says that in this season, kanto gakuin university is the winner with attendance n/a and title 37th. But in the table, for \"2010 -11 details\" (which would be the 47th competition), the winner is teikyo, not kanto gakuin.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each row's season:\n\nLooking at the last few rows:\n- Row 45: 49th, 2012-13\n- Row 46: 48th, 2011-12\n- Row 47: 47th, 2010-11\n- Row 46: 46th, 2009-10\nWait, perhaps I should list them all in order:\n\nEach row's title and season:\nRow 0: 30th, 1993 -4\n...\nContinuing up to Row 49 (since it's a 50-row table).\n\nBut the last few rows are:\n- Row 44: 45th, 2008 -9 details\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at the data again.\n\nThe user provided a list from row 0 to row 49:\n\nEach row has \"row_index\" and the cells. So looking for the row where the season is \"2010 -11 details.\" Scanning through the rows, the relevant one would be around row 47: \n\nLooking at the last few lines provided by the user:\n[\n    {\"row_index\":46, \"season\":\"2009 -10 details\"},\n    {\"row_index\":47, \"season\":\"2010 -11 details\"},\n    ...\n]\n\nSo row 47 has season \"2010 -11 details.\"\n\nIn that row, the winner is teikyo, not kanto gakuin. So the claim says the winner is kanto gakuin, but in reality, it's teikyo.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all rows to confirm:\n\nLooking for \"2010 -11 details\" as season. From the data:\n\nRow 47: {\"row_index\":47, \"season\":\"2010 -11 details\"}\n\nSo that's the correct row.\n\nIn that row, winner is \"teikyo,\" not kanto gakuin. So the claim is incorrect on this point.\n\nAdditionally, the attendance in that row is \"25458,\" which is a number, but the claim says it should be \"n /a.\" So another discrepancy.\n\nAlso, the title would be \"47th,\" but the claim states \"37th.\"\n\nSo multiple points of discrepancy: wrong winner, wrong attendance value, and wrong title ordinal.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because all the conditions specified in the claim are not met by the corresponding row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that for the season \"2010 - 2011,\" kanto gakuin university won with an attendance of n/a and a title of 37th. However:\n\n1. The correct winner is teikyo, not kanto gakuin.\n2. The attendance in that row is 25458, not n/a.\n3. The title for that season is the 47th, not the 37th.\n\nAll these points disprove the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 47,\n      \"column_name\": \"season\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 47,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 47,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 47,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Meiji be the loser in the game that has a title of 32nd with Hosei as the runner-up.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify which row corresponds to the 32nd title. Looking at the 'title' column, the entries start from \"30th\" and go up. So, the 32nd title would be when the title is \"32nd\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: \"30th\"\n- Row 1: \"31st\"\n- Row 2: \"32nd\" \u2013 this is the one we need.\n\nNow, looking at the 'winner' column for row 2, it says \"meiji.\" So Meiji is indeed the winner of that game. The claim says Meiji was the loser, which contradicts this, so I'm already thinking it might be false.\n\nNext, checking the 'runner-up' column for row 2: it lists \"waseda.\" But the claim mentions Hosei as the runner-up. So not only does Meiji not lose, but the runner-up is also incorrect. This further supports that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Meiji was the loser in the 32nd title game with Hosei as the runner-up. However, checking the table:\n\n- The 32nd title (row index 2) has Meiji as the winner, not the loser. \n- The runner-up is Waseda, not Hosei.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"tenri be the winner in the game that have teikyo as the runner - up.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. I'm looking for a row where the winner is \"tenri\" and the runner-up is \"teikyo\". So, I should check each row to see if it matches these two criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows with different data. The columns relevant here are \"winner\" and \"runner - up\". \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Winner is \"meiji\", runner-up is \"hosei\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Winner is \"daito bunka university\", runner-up is \"meiji\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Winner is \"meiji\", runner-up is \"waseda\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 3: Winner is \"meiji\", runner-up is \"waseda\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 4: Winner is \"kanto gakuin university\", runner-up is \"meiji\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 5: Winner is \"kanto gakuin university\", runner-up is \"meiji\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 6: Winner is \"keio\", runner-up is \"kanto gakuin university\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 7: Winner is \"kanto gakuin university\", runner-up is \"hosei\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 8: Winner is \"kanto gakuin university\", runner-up is \"waseda\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 9: Winner is \"waseda\", runner-up is \"kanto gakuin university\" \u2192 Runner-up is the same as the previous, but winner here is waseda, so no.\nRow 10: Winner is \"waseda\", runner-up is \"kanto gakuin university\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 11: Winner is \"kanto gakuin university\", runner-up is \"teikyo\" \u2192 Wait, this row has the winner as kanto gakuin and runner-up as teikyo. But our claim is about tenri being the winner with teikyo as runner-up. So this isn't matching.\nRow 12: Winner is \"teikyo\", runner-up is \"tenri\" \u2192 Now this is interesting. Here, the winner is teikyo and runner-up is tenri, which is opposite of what the claim says. The claim wants tenri as winner and teikyo as runner-up, but here it's reversed.\nRow 13: Winner is \"teikyo\", runner-up is \"tsukuba\" \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 14: Winner is \"teikyo\", runner-up is \"tenri\" again. Same as row 12, just reversed.\n\nWait a second, in rows 12 and 14, the winner is teikyo and the runner-up is tenri. That doesn't fit the claim at all because the claim wants tenri as the winner with teikyo as runner-up. So none of the rows have both \"tenri\" as the winner and \"teikyo\" as the runner-up.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through each row again quickly:\n\nRow 0: meiji, hosei \u2192 No.\nRow 1: daito, meiji \u2192 No.\nRow 2: meiji, waseda \u2192 No.\nRow 3: same as row 2 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: kgu, meiji \u2192 No.\nRow 5: kgu, meiji \u2192 No.\nRow 6: keio, kgu \u2192 No.\nRow 7: kgu, hosei \u2192 No.\nRow 8: kgu, waseda \u2192 No.\nRow 9: waseda, kgu \u2192 No.\nRow 10: same as row 9 \u2192 No.\nRow 11: kgu, teikyo \u2192 Runner-up is teikyo but winner isn't tenri \u2192 No.\nRow 12: teikyo, tenri \u2192 Opposite of what's claimed \u2192 No.\nRow 13: teikyo, tsukuba \u2192 No.\nRow 14: teikyo, tenri again \u2192 Same as row 12.\n\nSo, after checking each row, there is no occurrence where the winner is \"tenri\" and the runner-up is \"teikyo\". Therefore, the claim is false. \n\nWait, but I noticed that in some rows, \"tenri\" appears as the runner-up. For example, in row 14, the winner is teikyo and the runner-up is tenri. So maybe there's a confusion between \"tenri\" and \"teikyo\". But the claim specifically mentions \"tenri\" as the winner. Since in no row does \"tenri\" win with \"teikyo\" as runner-up, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because there's no supporting data in the table for this claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any row in the table where tenri is the winner and teikyo is the runner-up. Therefore, the answer is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
