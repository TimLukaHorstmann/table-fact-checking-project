    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the november 16 score be i 123 - 126\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a game that happened on November 16 with a score of \"i 123 - 126\". The 'i' might be an abbreviation, perhaps for a win or loss? Looking at the columns in the table: \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", etc., so I should focus on these.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any games played on November 16. Scanning the 'date' column: I see entries like November 2, 4, 6, up to November 30. So November 16 is there at row 8. Let me confirm that row 8's date is indeed November 16.\n\nLooking at row 8: date is \"november 16\". The score column says \"l 123 - 126\", which translates to a loss with the opponent's score being 126 and the team's score 123. But wait, the claim says \"i 123 - 126\". So does 'i' stand for something here? In basketball terms, I think 'W' is win and 'L' is loss. Maybe 'I' isn't a standard abbreviation, but looking at the table, scores are in the format like \"w 101 - 94\" or \"l 91 - 92\". So perhaps the claim has a typo or uses an incorrect abbreviation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'i' refers to something else, like the team's initials. But that doesn't seem to fit here because the score is structured as Team vs Opponent, which in the table is shown without any letters before the numbers except for 'w' and 'l'. So the claim might have an incorrect abbreviation or a typo.\n\nAlso, checking the date: November 16 is correctly matched with row 8. The team in that game was Seattle, but the claim doesn't specify the team, so maybe it's not necessary here. The key point is the score part.\n\nIn the table, the score for November 16 is \"l 123 - 126\". Comparing this to the claim, which says \"i 123 - 126\", I think the abbreviation might be wrong. 'I' isn't a standard notation I recognize in the context of sports results. So it's likely that the claim is using an incorrect or non-standard abbreviation.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, there is no game on November 16 with the score \"i 123 - 126\". Instead, the correct score is \"l 123 - 126\". Since the claim uses 'i', which doesn't match, it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly uses an abbreviation for the result. The table shows the score as a loss, so the claim's 'i' is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
