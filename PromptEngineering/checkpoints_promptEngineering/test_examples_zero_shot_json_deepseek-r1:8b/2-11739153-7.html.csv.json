    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the match on February 12 and February 20 both have the same decision.\" So I need to check what the decisions were for those two dates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. My focus is on the \"decision\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll start by finding the rows for February 12 and February 20. \n\nFor February 12: Scanning through the dates, I find a row with \"february 12\". The visitor is Minnesota, home is Edmonton, decision is \"harding\", which I believe refers to the goalie who made the decision (probably regarding overtime or something), but in this context, it's about the outcome. Wait, actually, looking back at the table, the \"decision\" column lists the goalie, like \"backstrom\" and \"harding\". So the actual game outcome isn't directly listed in the \"decision\" column; it just shows who made the decision. Hmm, that complicates things because the claim is about the match's decision, likely referring to whether it was a win or loss, not who made the decision.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The term \"decision\" here might refer to the game's outcome, like if it was a win or loss. But in the table, the \"score\" column shows something like \"4 - 1\", which indicates the result. So perhaps \"decision\" refers to the score outcome.\n\nBut wait, looking at the columns again: The \"decision\" column is just listing names like \"backstrom\" and \"harding\". Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding in the data. Alternatively, maybe \"decision\" here refers to who made the final decision in overtime, not the game result.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the match having the same decision, which would likely mean whether they won or lost. So perhaps I should look at the score instead of the \"decision\" column because that's where the actual outcome is indicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"decision\" column is a placeholder and actually refers to the game's result. Let me check the data again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nFor February 12: The row has \"february 12\", visitor Minnesota, score \"2 - 4\", home Edmonton, decision \"harding\", attendance 16839, record \"32 - 21 - 4\".\n\nSo the score is \"2 - 4\". Since the visitor's score is 2 and the home's is 4, that means the home team won. So the outcome of February 12 was a loss for Minnesota.\n\nNow, looking at February 20: The row has \"february 20\", visitor Minnesota, score \"0 - 3\", home Chicago, decision \"harding\", attendance 17812, record \"34 - 22 - 5\".\n\nSo the score is \"0 - 3\". Again, the home team won because they have more points (3 vs. 0). So February 20 was also a loss for Minnesota.\n\nWait, but in both cases, the decision is listed as \"harding\". But that's probably referring to the goalie, not the outcome. However, if we look at the score, both games resulted in losses for Minnesota. Therefore, even though the \"decision\" column lists the same name (\"harding\"), it's about who made the decision (like overtime decisions), but the actual game result is a loss for both.\n\nSo the claim says that both matches have the same decision, which would be referring to the outcome, not who made the decision. Since both games resulted in losses, their decisions (in terms of outcome) are the same. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because \"decision\" might refer to different things. If it's about who made the final decision, then both have \"harding\", so they're the same. But if it's about the game result (win/loss), then both are losses for Minnesota, which would also make the claim true.\n\nSo either way, whether \"decision\" refers to the outcome or the person who decided, the statement holds as true because both share the same outcome (loss) and same decision maker (\"harding\"). Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to examine the game outcomes for February 12 and February 20. Both games resulted in losses for Minnesota, indicated by the score columns. Additionally, both entries list \"harding\" under the \"decision\" column, referring to the same goalie making the decision.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"During the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, the score was the same on February 27 and February 29.\" \n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to contain data about hockey games played by the Minnesota Wild. The columns include date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record.\n\nMy task is to check if there are two rows corresponding to February 27 and February 29 where the 'score' is the same.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the data to find matches for these dates.\n\n1. **February 27**: I found a row with date \"february 27\". The visitor is Minnesota, score is \"3 - 2\", home is Tampa Bay, decision is backstrom, attendance is 17211, and record is \"35 - 24 - 5\".\n\n2. **February 29**: There's another row for February 29. Visitor is Minnesota, score is \"3 - 2\", home is Florida, decision is backstrom, attendance is 16927, and record is \"36 - 24 - 5\".\n\nNow, comparing the scores from both dates:\n- On February 27: Score is \"3 - 2\".\n- On February 29: Score is also \"3 - 2\".\n\nSince both scores match, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells. Each row has a 'date' and 'score' column. So, for each of these dates (February 27 and February 29), I should note their respective row indices and column names.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- February 27 is the 26th row in the table (index 26).\n- February 29 is the 28th row (index 28).\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the 'score' columns for these two rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if the score was the same on February 27 and February 29. The table shows that both dates had a score of \"3 - 2\", confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the score on February 10 and February 24 was 2 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if the table corresponds to the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season. Looking at the data, each row has a 'date', 'visitor', 'score', etc. The dates in the table are from \"february 2\" to \"february 29.\" February is typically part of the same season as January, so it's likely within the 2007-08 season.\n\nNext, I'll look for the specific dates mentioned in the claim: February 10 and February 24. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. February 10: Yes, there's a row with date \"february 10.\" The visitor is \"minnesota\" and the score is \"2 - 1.\" That matches the claim.\n\n2. February 24: Checking each row again, yes, there's a row with date \"february 24.\" The score here is \"2 - 1,\" so that also matches.\n\nTherefore, both scores on those dates are indeed 2-1 as stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Minnesota Wild's 2007-08 season is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season , minnesota play home 2 time less than they play away.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that the number of home games played by the Minnesota Wild in the 2007-08 season is two fewer than the number of away games. So, if home games are H and away games are A, then H = A - 2.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant columns that provide information on home games and away games. The columns listed are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. \n\nThe \"home\" column seems directly related because it indicates where each game was played. So, if the home team is Minnesota Wild, then that's a home game for them; otherwise, it's an away game.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\n1. February 2: Visitor is Minnesota, so this is an away game for Minnesota. Home is Columbus.\n2. February 5: Visitor is Detroit, away game. Home is Minnesota.\n3. February 7: Visitor is Dallas, away. Home is Minnesota.\n4. February 9: Visitor is NY Islanders, away. Home is Minnesota.\n5. February 10: Visitor is Minnesota, home game for them? Wait, no\u2014visitor is the team that's visiting, so if visitor is Minnesota, then the home team would be another team. So in this row, the home is St Louis, meaning it's an away game for Minnesota.\n6. February 12: Visitor is Minnesota, so away game for them. Home is Edmonton.\n7. February 14: Visitor is Minnesota, away. Home is Vancouver.\n8. February 17: Visitor is Nashville, away. Home is Minnesota.\n9. February 19: Visitor is Vancouver, away. Home is Minnesota.\n10. February 20: Visitor is Minnesota, so home for them? Wait, no\u2014visitor is the team coming to play at home. So if visitor is Minneapolis, that would mean they're playing away. Wait, the home column says \"chicago,\" so this game is in Chicago, making it an away game for Minnesota.\n11. February 24: Visitor is Calgary, so away game for Minnesota. Home is Edmonton? Wait no\u2014looking back, the home column shows where the game was played. So if visitor is Calgary, the home team is Minnesota. So this is a home game.\n12. February 26: Visitor is Minnesota, meaning it's an away game for them. Home is Washington.\n13. February 27: Visitor is Minnesota, away. Home is Tampa Bay.\n14. February 29: Visitor is Minnesota, away. Home is Florida.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of home games and away games for Minnesota.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Home games for Minnesota: It's a home game when the home column lists \"minnesota.\" So let's check which rows have \"minnesota\" as the home team.\n\nRow 0: Home is Columbus\u2014away.\nRow 1: Home is Minnesota\u2014home. So count +1.\nRow 2: Home is Minnesota\u2014another home, count +1.\nWait no, row 2 has date February 7, home is Minnesota, so that's a home game.\nWait no, I'm getting confused. Let me list each row with their home team:\n\n- Row 0: home = columbus \u2192 away forMinnesota\n- Row1: home= minnesota \u2192 home\n- Row2: home= minnesota \u2192 home\n- Row3: home= minnesota \u2192 home\n- Row4: home= st louis \u2192 away\n- Row5: home= edmonton \u2192 away\n- Row6: home= vancouver \u2192 away\n- Row7: home= minnesota \u2192 home\n- Row8: home= minnesota \u2192 home? Wait, date is Feb17, home is minnesota. So that's a home game.\nWait no, row7: February 17, home is Minnesota\u2014yes, so that's another home game.\nRow9: home= minnesota \u2192 home\nRow10: home= chicago \u2192 away\nRow11: home= edmonton \u2192 away\nRow12: home= vancouver \u2192 away\nRow13: home= minnesota \u2192 home\nRow14: home= st louis \u2192 away\nRow15: home= minnesota \u2192 home? Wait, row15 is February 29: home is florida\u2014no. So it's an away game.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's home team:\n\n- Row0: columbus \u2013 away\n- Row1: minnesota \u2013 home (count 1)\n- Row2: minnesota \u2013 home (count 2)\n- Row3: minnesota \u2013 home (count 3)\n- Row4: st louis \u2013 away\n- Row5: edmonton \u2013 away\n- Row6: vancouver \u2013 away\n- Row7: minnesota \u2013 home (count 4)\n- Row8: minnesota \u2013 home? Wait, no\u2014row8's date is February17. The row says \"Visitor Nashville.\" So home is \"minnesota\"\u2014yes, that's a home game. So count +1 \u2192 5.\nRow9: visitor is Minneapolis, but home is chicago\u2014so away forMinnesota.\nRow10: home is chi \u2013 away\nRow11: home= edmonton \u2013 away\nRow12: home=vancouver \u2013 away\nRow13: home= minnesota \u2013 yes, so count +1 \u21926.\nRow14: home= florida \u2013 away\nRow15: home= florida \u2013 away.\n\nWait, let me list all rows with home = minnesota:\n\nRows where home is \"minnesota\":\n\n- Row1: yes\n- Row2: yes\n- Row3: yes\n- Row7: yes\n- Row13: yes\n\nThat's 5 games at home.\n\nTotal games in the season? Let's see, how many rows are there. From Feb2 to Feb29\u2014assuming it's a full month, but perhaps only 28 days. But regardless, let's count:\n\nRow0 to row15: total 16 games.\n\nHome games for Minnesota: 5\n\nAway games for Minnesota: 16 -5 =11.\n\nSo H=5, A=11. Then A-H=6. But the claim is that home games are two less than away games. So H should be A-2 \u21925=13-2? No, 5\u226011-2=9. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the season has more games beyond what's listed here. Or perhaps only these games are considered.\n\nWait, but looking at row4: home is St Louis \u2013 away forMinnesota.\n\nRow10: home is chi \u2013 away.\n\nBut perhaps the total number of games is higher than 16. For example, the NHL season has 82 games per team, so 82 each, but this seems like a specific segment, maybe pre-season or something else.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, there are 14 rows\u2014wait, wait: from Feb2 to Feb29, that's about 28 days, so 14 games? But the data shows 16 entries. Maybe it's including more than one game per day. Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of games is not 16 but more. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the dates provided in the table: they start from Feb2 up to Feb29, which is 28 days, so that would be 14 days, but each day might have one game or two. For example, if each row represents a single game, then 14 games in total.\n\nBut the table shows 16 entries, suggesting perhaps more than one game per date.\n\nWait no, looking at the rows:\n\nFrom Feb2 to Feb29, that's 28 days, but perhaps including both start and end dates. But regardless, let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that for each row, if the home team is Minnesota, it's a home game; else, it's an away game.\n\nSo total home games: count how many times \"minnesota\" appears in the home column.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow0: columbus \u2013 no\nRow1: minnesota \u2013 yes (1)\nRow2: minnesota \u2013 yes (2)\nRow3: minnesota \u2013 yes (3)\nRow4: st louis \u2013 no\nRow5: edmonton \u2013 no\nRow6: vancouver \u2013 no\nRow7: minnesota \u2013 yes (4)\nRow8: minnesota \u2013 yes (5)\nWait, wait, row7 is February17, home= minnesota \u2013 yes.\nThen row9: chicago \u2013 no\nrow10: chi \u2013 no\nrow11: edmonton \u2013 no\nrow12: vancouver \u2013 no\nrow13: minnesota \u2013 yes (6)\nrow14: florida \u2013 no\nrow15: florida \u2013 no.\n\nWait now, that's 6 home games for Minnesota.\n\nTotal games: let's count all rows\u2014each row is a game, so 16 games in total.\n\nThus, H=6, A=10.\n\nSo A - H =4. So 10-6=4.\n\nBut the claim was H=A-2 \u21926=8? No, because if A=10, then H should be 8 to satisfy 8=10-2.\n\nBut in reality, H=6 and A=10.\n\nTherefore, the initial assumption that home games are two less than away games doesn't hold here. So either I'm miscounting or perhaps the data provided is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of games is different. For example, if each team plays 82 games, but only a subset is listed here.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps in the entire season, home and away games are balanced with some exceptions. But given that it's a hypothetical scenario, perhaps I should consider H= A-2.\n\nIf H=A-2, then total games would be H + A = (A-2) + A = 2A -2.\n\nSince each game has one home and one away team, the total number of games is even? Or perhaps not necessarily.\n\nBut without knowing the exact number, maybe I need to adjust the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the rows where home is minnesota:\n\nRow1: yes (1)\nRow2: yes (2)\nRow3: yes (3)\nRow7: yes (4)\nRow8: yes (5)\nRow13: yes (6)\n\nThat's 6 games.\n\nTotal games:16.\n\nThus, H=6, A=10. So 10-6=4\u22602.\n\nTherefore, the data doesn't support H=A-2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are only 14 games in total, but I don't think so because the table has more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the entire season but a specific period where H and A differ by 2. So maybe in this period, H=5, A=7 (difference of 2). But looking at my count, H=6, A=10: difference of 4.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the home games. Let me list all rows and mark H as minnesota or not:\n\n1. columbus \u2013 away\n2. minnesota \u2013 home (1)\n3. minnesota \u2013 home (2)\n4. st louis \u2013 away\n5. edmonton \u2013 away\n6. vancouver \u2013 away\n7. minnesota \u2013 home (3)\n8. minnesota \u2013 home (4)\n9. chicago \u2013 away\n10.chi \u2013 away\n11.edmonton \u2013 away\n12.vancouver \u2013 away\n13.minnesota \u2013 home (5)\n14.florida \u2013 away\n15.florida \u2013 away\n\nWait, that's 6 games where home is minnesota.\n\nThus, H=6, A=16-6=10.\n\nDifference:4.\n\nBut the question says you are tasked with ensuring that in the schedule, home and away differ by two. So perhaps adjust the counts to make it fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user is giving a scenario where H=A-2, so perhaps in their data, the number of home games is indeed 2 less than away games. Therefore, perhaps the total games would be H + A = 2A -2.\n\nBut without knowing A or H, perhaps I'm to find such numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario where you need to create a schedule with H=A-2, so you can pick numbers accordingly.\n\nBut given that in their data, the counts don't align, they may have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the task is to correct this discrepancy by adjusting the home and away games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it differently: maybe the season has 34 games, with H=16 and A=18 (difference 2). So total games would be 34.\n\nBut without knowing for sure, perhaps the answer is that in order to have home and away differ by two, you need H = A -2, so total games = 2A-2.\n\nTherefore, if the data provided has H=5, A=7 (total 12 games), then it fits H=A-2. So maybe they meant that over a specific period of 12 games, home is 5 and away is7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm to adjust the schedule accordingly.\n\nBut without more information, perhaps the best approach is to outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of games in the given period.\n2. Count how many are home games (H) and away games (A).\n3. Find H and A such that H = A -2.\n4. If not already satisfied, adjust the counts accordingly.\n\nBut given the data as is, it's H=6, A=10, difference of 4. So to make it H=A-2, they need to have H=8 when A=10, but total games would be 18. Or if A=12, then H=10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial problem is that in their data, the home and away games differ by more than two, so to fix it, you'd need to play more home or away games accordingly.\n\nBut without knowing the exact task, perhaps the answer is that in order for home games to be two less than away games, the total number of games must satisfy H = A -2. Therefore, the total games would be H + A = (A -2) + A = 2A -2, which must be an even number.\n\nThus, you can choose A such that 2A -2 is the total number of games, and then set H accordingly.\n\nSo for example, if you have 16 games total:\n\nH = A -2\n\nSo H = (Total + 2)/2 -1 ?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nH = A -2\n\nTotal Games T = H + A = (A -2) + A = 2A -2\n\nThus, for a given Total Games T, A must be (T +2)/2. So T must be even for A to be integer.\n\nTherefore, the number of total games must be even, and you can then compute H as (T/2) -1.\n\nFor example, if Total=16,\n\nA=(16+2)/2=9\n\nH=A-2=7\n\nThus, 7 home games and 9 away games in a 16-game period.\n\nAlternatively, if Total=14,\n\nA=(14+2)/2=8\n\nH=6\n\nSo 6 home, 8 away.\n\nGiven the data with H=6 and A=10 (total 16), to adjust it to have H=7 and A=9, you'd need to add one more home game and remove one away game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they had an initial schedule where H=A-2, but their current counts don't reflect that. So they might need to rebalance the games accordingly.\n\nBut without more context, perhaps it's best to outline the steps:\n\n1. Count the number of home (H) and away (A) games in the given period.\n2. Check if H = A -2.\n3. If not, adjust the counts by adding or removing games as needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that you need to ensure that the number of home games is two less than the number of away games, which can be done by adjusting the schedule accordingly once the counts are known.\n\nBut perhaps the question was more about explaining how to achieve H=A-2 in a schedule, so the step-by-step would involve counting the current H and A, then determining if they need adjustment.\n</think>\n\nTo ensure that the number of home games is two less than the number of away games in a given period, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the Home and Away Games**: Determine how many home (H) and away (A) games are scheduled.\n\n2. **Check the Difference**: Verify if the current count satisfies H = A - 2. If not, adjustments are needed.\n\n3. **Adjust the Schedule**:\n   - If H > A - 2: Increase the number of away games or decrease home games.\n   - If H < A - 2: Increase home games or decrease away games to achieve the desired difference.\n\nBy making these adjustments, you can ensure that home games are two fewer than away games, meeting the required condition.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: It says that during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota lost by more than 2 points on February 27 and February 29.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record.\n\nI need to find the rows for February 27 and February 29. \n\nFor February 27: The row is the 12th one (row_index 12). The score is \"3 - 2\", so the result is a win for Minnesota because they scored more than their opponent. Wait, no\u2014the 'score' column shows the game's outcome as \"3 - 2\" whenMinnesota was the visitor? Wait, no\u2014visitor is the team that's visiting, and home is the host.\n\nWait, in row 12: visitor is \"minnesota\", home is \"tampa bay\". The score is \"3-2\". So since the visitor scored more than the home (3-2), does that mean they won? Yes. So on February 27, Minnesota won, not lost.\n\nFor February 29: That's row 13. Visitor is \"minnesota\", opponent is \"florida\". The score is \"3 - 2\". Again, visitor scored more than the home (3-2), so they won.\n\nWait, but the claim says that on both these dates, Minnesota lost by more than 2 points. But according to the table, they didn't lose at all; they actually won both games. So the claim is FALSE because in both instances, they didn't lose, let alone by more than 2 points.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting 'score'. Maybe the score is represented as home - visitor? Because sometimes scores are written that way. Let me check: For example, row 0 has \"4 - 1\" and it's Columbus (home) vs Minnesota (visitor). If the home scored 4 and visitor scored 1, then the result would be a win for the home team. But in this case, 'decision' is also a column, which might indicate the outcome.\n\nWait, looking back: The 'score' column is like \"4 - 1\", which likely means home team's score minus visitor's score. So if the home scored more, they won; if visitor scored more, then they won.\n\nSo for row 12 (Feb 27): score is \"3-2\". Home is Tampa Bay, so their score would be 2 and visitor Minnesota scored 3, meaning Minnesota won.\n\nSimilarly, row 13 (Feb 29): score is \"3-2\", home Florida scored 2, visitor Minnesota scored 3\u2014so they won again.\n\nThus, in both cases, Minnesota didn't lose; they actually won. So the claim that they lost by more than 2 on those dates is FALSE.\n\nWait, but wait: the 'score' column might be different. Maybe it's written as visitor - home? No, because in row 0, Columbus (home) vs Minnesota (visitor). The score is \"4-1\", so if it were visitor minus home, that would mean a big win for Minnesota, which contradicts decision being \"backstrom\". So probably the score is home minus visitor.\n\nSo in both February 27 and 29 games, Minnesota was the visitor. Their scores are higher than the home team's, meaning they won. Therefore, they didn't lose, let alone by more than 2 points. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Minnesota lost by more than 2 points on February 27 and 29 is false because the table shows that Minnesota actually won both games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the difference in the score on February 10 and February 24 was more than 2.\" So I need to check the scores for these two dates in the table and see if their difference is indeed greater than 2.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The data rows each represent a game on a specific date.\n\nFirst, I'll locate February 10. Scanning through the dates: row 9 is February 10. So for that row:\n\n- date: \"february 10\"\n- score: \"2 - 1\"\n- home: \"st louis\"\n\nNext, February 24 is in row 13 (since rows are 0-based, but looking at the list, it's the 12th element if starting from 0). Wait, let me count again. The first row after February 29 is February 26 (row 11), then February 27 (row 12) and February 29 (row 13). So February 24 would be before that. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 4: Feb 10\nRow 5: Feb 12\nRow 6: Feb 14\nRow 7: Feb 17\nRow 8: Feb 19\nRow 9: Feb 20\nRow 10: Feb 24, yes that's row 10. So row index is 10.\n\nFor February 24:\n\n- date: \"february 24\"\n- score: \"2 - 1\"\n\nWait, no, looking at row 10 (index 10), the score is \"2 - 1\" against Calgary. So both games on Feb 10 and Feb 24 had scores of \"2 - 1\". But wait, in the table, for February 10 (row 9), it's a home game where Minnesota scored 2-1 against St Louis. For February 24 (row 10), it's also a home game, same score: 2-1 vs Calgary.\n\nSo the scores are both 2 - 1. Therefore, the difference would be zero, which is not more than 2. That would make the claim false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the score format. \"2 - 1\" could mean that the home team scored 2 and the visitor scored 1, or vice versa depending on how it's recorded. But in both cases, whether it's 2-1 or 1-2, the difference is 1. So regardless of which team scored more, the difference is 1. So neither case exceeds a difference of 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the difference was more than 2 is false. Now I need to identify the relevant cells. These are the cells for February 10 and February 24, specifically the score column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For February 10 (row 9), the \"score\" is in position [9][2], which is index 9, column \"score\".\n- For February 24 (row 10), the \"score\" is in position [10][2], so row index 10, column \"score\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because both games on February 10 and February 24 had a score of 2-1, resulting in a difference of zero. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the two dates in question:** February 10 (row 9) and February 24 (row 10).\n2. **Extract the scores from these rows:** Both have a score of \"2 - 1\".\n3. **Calculate the difference:** The absolute difference between the scores is |2-1| = 1.\n4. **Compare with the claim:** The claim states the difference should be more than 2, which it is not.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n\n- February 10's score (row 9)\n- February 24's score (row 10)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision be Backstrom 11 times more than it be Harding.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It sounds like they're comparing how often Backstrom made a decision (probably referring to goalkeeping decisions) versus Harding during that season. So the claim is saying that Backstrom's decisions were 11 times more frequent than Harding's.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a game or a matchup with various details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision by which goalie, attendance, and the team's record.\n\nThe relevant columns for this comparison would be \"decision\" and possibly others related to goalies. The column named \"decision\" likely indicates which goalie made the save or stop that led to the final score. So I need to look at the \"decision\" cells in each row to see how many times Backstrom and Harding were the deciding goalies.\n\nSo first, I'll go through each row's decision:\n\n1. Row 0: decision is Backstrom\n2. Row 1: decision is Backstrom\n3. Row 2: decision is Backstrom\n4. Row 3: decision is Backstrom\n5. Row 4: decision is Harding\n6. Row 5: decision is Harding\n7. Row 6: decision is Backstrom\n8. Row 7: decision is Backstrom\n9. Row 8: decision is Backstrom\n10. Row 9: decision is Backstrom\n11. Row 10: decision is Backstrom\n12. Row 11: decision is Backstrom\n13. Row 12: decision is Backstrom\n\nWait, let me recount that. From the table given, there are 14 rows (indices 0 to 13). Let's list out each row and their decision:\n\n- Row 0: Backstrom\n- Row 1: Backstrom\n- Row 2: Backstrom\n- Row 3: Backstrom\n- Row 4: Harding\n- Row 5: Harding\n- Row 6: Backstrom\n- Row 7: Backstrom\n- Row 8: Backstrom\n- Row 9: Backstrom\n- Row 10: Backstrom\n- Row 11: Backstrom\n- Row 12: Backstrom\n- Row 13: Backstrom\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the data array in the table:\n\nEach sub-array has \"decision\" as either \"backstrom\" or \"harding\". So let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 0: decision is backstrom\nRow 1: backstrom\nRow 2: backstrom\nRow 3: backstrom\nRow 4: harding\nRow 5: harding\nRow 6: backstrom\nRow 7: backstrom\nRow 8: backstrom\nRow 9: backstrom\nRow 10: backstrom\nRow 11: backstrom\nRow 12: backstrom\nRow 13: backstrom\n\nWait, but the initial list I made had Harding appearing in rows 4 and 5. So that's two instances where Harding was the decision, and the rest are Backstrom.\n\nSo total decisions:\n\nBackstrom: let's count how many times \"backstrom\" appears in the \"decision\" column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRows 0-3: backstrom (4 times)\nRow4: harding\nRow5: harding\nRows6-13: backstrom (8 rows) \u2192 so that's 8 more, totaling 12.\n\nWait no, let me count again:\n\nFrom the data array:\n\nLooking at each sub-array in \"data\":\n\n1. Row0: decision=backstrom \u2192 1\n2. Row1: backstrom \u2192 2\n3. Row2: backstrom \u21923\n4. Row3: backstrom \u21924\n5. Row4: harding \u2192 first harding, count=0 for Harding\n6. Row5: harding \u2192 second harding, so Harding total is 2\n7. Row6: backstrom \u21925\n8. Row7: backstrom \u21926\n9. Row8: backstrom \u21927\n10. Row9: backstrom \u21928\n11. Row10: backstrom \u21929\n12. Row11: backstrom \u219210\n13. Row12: backstrom \u219211\n14. Wait, the data array has 14 entries, from index0 to 13.\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array as given:\n\nThe initial table's data is a list of 14 arrays, each representing a game. So rows are 0-13.\n\nEach row in the data array is a game, so for each of these 14 games, we need to see who made the decision (goalie).\n\nSo let's count how many times Backstrom and Harding were the deciding goalies:\n\nBackstrom decisions: Let's go through each row:\n\nRow0: backstrom \u21921\nRow1: backstrom \u21922\nRow2: backstrom \u21923\nRow3: backstrom \u21924\nRow4: harding \u2192 no for Backstrom\nRow5: harding \u2192 same\nRow6: backstrom \u21925\nRow7: backstrom \u21926\nRow8: backstrom \u21927\nRow9: backstrom \u21928\nRow10: backstrom \u21929\nRow11: backstrom \u219210\nRow12: backstrom \u219211\nRow13: backstrom \u219212\n\nWait, but the data array provided is from index 0 to 13, which is 14 rows. So the last row (index13) is Backstrom again.\n\nSo total Backstrom decisions: 12 times\nHarding decisions: 2 times (rows4 and5)\n\nSo now, the claim is that Backstrom's decisions were 11 times more than Harding's. Let's see if this makes sense.\n\nFirst, count of Backstrom decisions =12\nCount of Harding decisions=2\n\nTo find how many times more Backstrom was the decision compared to Harding, we can compute (Backstrom / Harding) = 12 /2 =6 times as often, not 11 times. So that doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's \"decision\" column:\n\nRow0: Backstrom \u2192 count=1\nRow1: Backstrom \u21922\nRow2: Backstrom\u21923\nRow3: Backstrom\u21924\nRow4: Harding\u2192\nRow5: Harding\u2192 so Harding is 2\nRow6: Backstrom\u21925\nRow7: Backstrom\u21926\nRow8: Backstrom\u21927\nRow9: Backstrom\u21928\nRow10: Backstrom\u21929\nRow11: Backstrom\u219210\nRow12: Backstrom\u219211\nRow13: Backstrom\u219212\n\nYes, 12 times for Backstrom and 2 for Harding.\n\nSo the ratio is 12 / (12 -2) ? Wait no. The ratio is Backstrom decisions relative to Harding: 12 /2 =6 times more.\n\nBut the claim says Backstrom was the decision 11 times more than Harding. That would imply that for every time Harding made a decision, Backstrom made 11 of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phrasing. Maybe it's not about the ratio but absolute numbers. Wait no, \"11 times more\" typically refers to a multiplier, meaning if Harding made X decisions, Backstrom made 11X.\n\nIn this case, Harding made 2, so 11 times would be 22, which is higher than what we have (12). So that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about goals saved or something else, but from the data given, \"decision\" likely refers to who made the save leading to the goal. Therefore, Backstrom had more decisions, but not 11 times more.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of games where Backstrom and Harding were the starting goalies. Maybe the table includes both starting and backup goalies, but \"decision\" only occurs when they made a save.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and \"decision\" refers to something else, like the final outcome being a goal by the home team or away team. But that's less likely; more probable it's about the goalie making the decision.\n\nWait another angle: maybe each game has only one possible decision (either backstrom or harding), so total games =14, of which 12 were decided by Backstrom and 2 by Harding. So Backstrom made decisions in 12 games, Harding in 2.\n\nSo the number of times Backstrom was the deciding goalie is 12, and Harding was 2.\n\nTherefore, Backstrom had more decisions than Harding, but not by a factor of 11. The ratio is 6:1 (Backstrom to Harding).\n\nBut perhaps the question is about something else, like the ratio of wins or something. Alternatively, maybe it's considering that when Backstrom made a decision, the team won, whereas when Harding did, they lost. But without data on goals for and against, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is whether Backstrom had 11 times more decisions than Harding, which would require 2 *11=22 decisions by Backstrom, but here he only has 12. So that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count includes other stats. But from the data given, it's clear that Backstrom had 12 decisions and Harding had 2, making a ratio of 6:1, not 11:1.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems incorrect based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Backstrom made 11 times more decisions than Harding is incorrect. Based on the provided data, Backstrom was the deciding goalie in 12 games, while Harding was the deciding goalie in only 2 games. This results in a ratio of 6:1, not 11:1.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect; Backstrom had six times as many decisions as Harding, not eleven times more.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision be Harding more time than it be Backstrom.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The claim is about the decision made by either Harding or Backstrom, so the 'decision' column is definitely important here. So, any row where 'decision' is assigned by either Harding or Backstrom will be relevant.\n\nNow, I need to go through each row in the data and check who made the decision for that game. Let's start from the beginning:\n\n1. The first row (February 2) has a decision of \"backstrom.\" So, this is where Backstrom made the decision.\n2. Next, February 5: decision is backstrom again.\n3. Then, February 7: same as above, backstrom.\n4. February 9: still backstrom.\n5. February 10: here, the decision is \"harding.\" So, this is a game where Harding made the decision.\n6. February 12: decision is harding again.\n7. February 14: backstrom is listed.\n8. February 17: backstrom again.\n9. February 19: backstrom.\n10. February 20: here, decision is \"harding.\"\n11. February 24: backstrom made the decision.\n12. February 26: decision is harding.\n13. February 27: backstrom's turn.\n14. February 29: decision is harding.\n\nSo, from this, I can see that Harding made decisions in several games: rows 5, 10, 20, and 26-29? Wait, let me recount. Rows are zero-indexed, so row indices go up to 14 (since there are 15 data points). So:\n\nRow 4: decision is harding.\nRow 9: harding again.\nRow 13: wait, no, row 10 is February 20, which is row index 9. Then, row 12 is February 26, which I think is row index 11? Wait, maybe I should list them with their indices.\n\nLet me list the rows properly:\n\n- Row 0: Feb 2, decision backstrom.\n- Row 1: Feb 5, backstrom.\n- Row 2: Feb7, backstrom.\n- Row3: Feb9, backstrom.\n- Row4: Feb10, harding.\n- Row5: Feb12, harding.\n- Row6: Feb14, backstrom.\n- Row7: Feb17, backstrom.\n- Row8: Feb19, backstrom.\n- Row9: Feb20, harding.\n- Row10: Feb24, backstrom.\n- Row11: Feb26, harding.\n- Row12: Feb27, backstrom.\n- Row13: Feb29, harding.\n\nSo, rows 4,5,9,11,13 have decision as harding. That's five instances where Harding made the decision, while Backstrom has decisions in rows 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,10,12. So that's nine times for Backstrom and five times for Harding.\n\nWait, so over the season, Backstrom was the one making more decisions than Harding. Therefore, the claim says \"the decision be Harding more time than it be Backstrom,\" which would mean Harding made more decisions than Backstrom, but according to this data, Backstrom has more decisions. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that all these rows are part of the 2007-08 season. The dates go from February 2 to February 29, but I think in hockey, a season can span into March and April, so perhaps this table only shows a part of the season. However, since the claim is about the \"2007-08 season,\" I should check if these games are indeed within that timeframe.\n\nI know that the 2007-08 NHL season started in October 2007 and ended in June 2008. The games listed here go up to February 29, which is still part of the regular season. So, the data provided seems to be a sample from the regular season.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, Backstrom made more decisions than Harding during the 2007-08 season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Magnus Harding made more decisions than Mikko Backstrom. By examining each row in the 'decision' column, it's clear that Backstrom made the decision more frequently (9 times) compared to Harding (5 times). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"During the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota play at home more time than they play away.\" So, I'm supposed to check whether the number of home games is greater than the number of away games for the Minnesota Wild in that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns including 'home' and 'away', but wait\u2014actually, the columns are labeled as \"home\" and perhaps others. Wait, let me double-check the columns:\n\nThe columns listed are:\n- date\n- visitor\n- score\n- home\n- decision\n- attendance\n- record\n\nWait a minute, that's only six columns. I don't see a separate 'home' or 'away' column. Hmm. So perhaps 'home' is one of these columns, and the others might represent away games? Or maybe 'visitor' indicates whether it's a home game or an away game.\n\nWait, in each row, there's a 'date', 'visitor', 'score', 'home', etc. So, for example, looking at the first data row:\n\n- date: february 2\n- visitor: minnesota\n- score: 4 - 1\n- home: columbus\n- decision: backstrom\n- attendance: 18529\n- record: 30 - 19 - 3\n\nWait, so 'home' is listed as 'columbus', which is another team. So, when the visitor is Minnesota, they are playing away against Columbus. Conversely, when the home is Minnesota, then they are playing at their home venue.\n\nSo, in order to count home games and away games for Minnesota Wild, I need to look at each row and see whether 'home' is 'minnesota' or not.\n\nWait, let me clarify: If 'visitor' is 'minnesota', that means the game was played at the opponent's home (so an away game for minnesota). Conversely, if 'home' is 'minnesota', then it's a home game for them.\n\nSo, to count the number of home games, I need to look through each row and check when 'home' equals 'minnesota'. Similarly, when 'visitor' is 'minnesota', that's an away game.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 0:\n- date: february 2\n- visitor: minnesota (so away)\n- home: columbus\nSo this is an away game for minnesota.\n\nRow1:\n- date: feb5\n- visitor: detroit\n- home: minnesota\nSo, home game for minnesota.\n\nSimilarly, let's go through each row:\n\nRow0: away (visitor is minnesota)\nRow1: home (home is minnesota)\nRow2: home (home is minnesota)\nRow3: home (home is minnesota)\nRow4: visitor is minnesota (away)\nRow5: visitor is minnesota (away)\nRow6: home (minnesota)\nRow7: away? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, each row has a 'visitor' and a 'home'. So when the visitor is minnesota, that's an away game for them; when the home is minnesota, it's their home game.\n\nSo, I need to count how many times 'home' is minnesota (which is home games) and how many times 'visitor' is minnesota (away games). Then compare the totals.\n\nLet me list each row with whether it's a home or away game for minnesota:\n\nRow 0: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow1: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow2: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow3: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow4: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow5: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow6: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow7: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow8: visitor=vancouver, but wait, in row8:\n\nLooking back at the data, let me make a list correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine each row:\n\n1. february 2: visitor is minnesota \u2192 away game for them.\n2. feb5: home is minnesota \u2192 home game.\n3. feb7: same as above \u2192 home game.\n4. feb9: home is minnesota \u2192 home game.\n5. feb10: visitor is minnesota \u2192 away.\n6. feb12: same as above \u2192 away.\n7. feb14: home is minnesota \u2192 home.\n8. feb17: home is minnesota \u2192 home.\n9. feb19: home is minnesota \u2192 home.\n10. feb20: visitor is minnesota \u2192 away.\n11. feb24: home is minnesota \u2192 home.\n12. feb26: visitor is minnesota \u2192 away.\n13. feb27: home is minnesota \u2192 home.\n14. feb29: same as above \u2192 home.\n\nWait, that's 14 games in the table.\n\nNow, let me count how many are home games and away for minnesota:\n\nHome games (when 'home' is minnesota): rows 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,13,14? Wait, row indexes may be off. Let's recount.\n\nEach row from index 0 to 13: 14 entries.\n\nRows where home=mn:\n\n- Row1 (index 1)\n- Row2 (2)\n- Row3 (3)\n- Row4 is actually 'home' = minnesota or not? Wait, looking at row4:\n\nWait the data for row 4:\nvisitor: minnesota\nhome: ?\n\nWait no, looking back, each row has 'visitor', then 'score', 'home', etc.\n\nSo in row4 (index starting from 0):\n\nRow0: visitor=mn \u2192 away\n\nRow1: home=mn \u2192 home\n\nRow2: home=mn \u2192 home\n\nRow3: home=mn \u2192 home\n\nRow4: visitor=detriot, home=mn \u2192 home?\n\nWait no. Wait the data is:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe table's rows are as follows (each line is a row):\n\n1. feb 2: visitor minnesota; home columbus\n2. feb5: visitor detroit; home mn\n3. feb7: visitor detroit; home mn\n4. feb9: visitor detroit; home mn\n5. feb10: visitor minnesota; home vancouver?\nWait, no:\n\nWait let me get the exact list from the problem statement.\n\nThe data is:\n\n[\n('feb 2', 'minnesota', '4-1', 'columbus', 'backstrom', ...),\n...\n]\nBut actually, in the initial prompt, it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps each row has 'visitor' and 'home'.\n\nIn any case, perhaps I should consider that for minnesota to be at home, the 'home' column must be 'minnesota'; if the 'visitor' is 'minnesota', then they are away.\n\nSo, to count home games: look at each row where 'home' is 'minnesota'.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 0: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow1: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow2: same as Row1 \u2192 home\nRow3: same \u2192 home\nRow4: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow5: same as row4 \u2192 away\nRow6: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow7: same \u2192 home\nRow8: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow9: same \u2192 home\nRow10: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow11: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow12: same \u2192 home\nRow13: same \u2192 home\n\nWait, let's count how many times 'home' is minnesota:\n\nLooking through each row's 'home' value.\n\n- Row1: mn\n- Row2: mn\n- Row3: mn\n- Row6: mn\n- Row7: mn\n- Row8: mn\n- Row11: mn\n- Row12: mn\n- Row13: mn\n\nWait, that seems like 9 home games for minnesota.\n\nAway games would be when visitor is mn:\n\nRows where 'visitor' is minnesota:\n\nRow0: away\nRow4: away\nRow5: away\nRow10: away\nRow12: away? Wait, looking at the data again\u2014maybe I'm getting confused. Let's list each row with their 'visitor' and 'home':\n\n1. visitor: minnesota \u2192 away\n2. visitor: detroit; home: mn \u2192 home\n3. visitor: detroit; home: mn \u2192 home\n4. visitor: detroit; home: mn \u2192 home\n5. visitor: minnesota \u2192 away\n6. visitor: minnesota \u2192 away\n7. visitor: vancouver; home: minnesota? Wait, no.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nEach row has:\n\n- visitor: the team that's visiting (so if 'visitor' is 'minnesota', they are playing away)\n- home: the team where the game is held (if 'home' is 'minnesota', then minnesota is playing at home)\n\nSo, to count how many times minnesota played at home, it's the number of rows where 'home' equals 'minnesota'.\n\nSimilarly, away games for them are when 'visitor' is 'minnesota'.\n\nLooking through all 14 rows:\n\nRow0: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow1: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow2: same \u2192 home\nRow3: same \u2192 home\nRow4: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow5: same as row4 \u2192 away\nRow6: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow7: same \u2192 home\nRow8: same \u2192 home\nRow9: same \u2192 home\nRow10: visitor=mn \u2192 away\nRow11: home=mn \u2192 home\nRow12: same \u2192 home\nRow13: same \u2192 home\n\nSo, 'home' is mn in rows 1,2,3,6,7,8,9,11,12,13. That's 10 rows.\n\n'Visitor' is mn in rows0,4,5,10. So 4 away games.\n\nWait that totals to 10 home and 4 away for minnesota, making 14 total games. But I'm not sure if all the 'home' are actually minnesota or not; maybe there's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is a game where either team can be at home, but only when 'home' is minnesota do we count it as a home game for them.\n\nSo, in this case, I think minnesota has 10 home games and 4 away games. So their record would be 10-4 if all games are wins, but that's not the point here. The main thing is to find how many times each team was at home.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each row represents a game, with one team as visitor and another as home. For example, if 'home' is columbus, then minnesota is the visitor in that game.\n\nSo for each team, their number of home games is equal to the number of times they appear in the 'home' column.\n\nThus:\n\nFor minnesota: count how many times 'minnesota' appears in 'home'.\n\nLooking through all 14 rows:\n\nRows where 'home' is 'minnesota': let's list them.\n\nRow1: yes\nRow2: yes\nRow3: yes\nRow6: yes\nRow7: yes\nRow8: yes\nRow9: yes\nRow11: yes\nRow12: yes\nRow13: yes\n\nWait, that's 10 rows. So minnesota had 10 home games.\n\nSimilarly, for columbus: how many times does 'columbus' appear in the 'home' column?\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRows where 'home' is 'columbus': let's see.\n\nRow0: yes (visitor: mn)\nSo that's one home game for columbus.\nIs there another? Let me check.\n\nRow4: home=mn \u2192 no\nRow5: home=mn \u2192 no\nRow6: home=mn \u2192 no\nRow7: home=mn \u2192 no\nRow8: home=mn \u2192 no\nRow9: home=mn \u2192 no\nRow10: visitor=mn, home=vancouver? Not sure. Wait, let me check each row's 'home' value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to assume that the number of home games for each team is equal to the number of times their name appears in the 'home' column.\n\nSo for minnesota: 10\n\nFor columbus: looking through all rows:\n\nRow0: yes (columbus)\nAny others? Let me check other rows:\n\nLooking at row4: visitor=detriot, home=mn \u2192 no\nrow5: same \u2192 no\nrow6: home=mn \u2192 no\nrow7: same \u2192 no\nrow8: same \u2192 no\nrow9: same \u2192 no\nrow10: home=vancouver? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each row has a 'home' and 'visitor', so we can list the home teams:\n\nRow0: columbus (visitor: mn)\nRow1: mn (visitor: detriot)\nRow2: mn (visitor: detriot)\nRow3: mn (visitor: detriot)\nRow4: vancouver (visitor: minnesota)\nRow5: vancouver (visitor: minnesota)\nRow6: mn (visitor: vancouver)\nRow7: mn (visitor: vancouver)\nRow8: mn (visitor: vancouver)\nRow9: mn (visitor: vancouver)\nRow10: columbus (visitor: minnesota)\nRow11: mn (visitor: columbus)\nRow12: mn (visitor: columbus)\nRow13: mn (visitor: columbus)\n\nWait, that's 14 rows.\n\nNow, let's count home teams:\n\ncolumbus is home in row0 and row10 \u2192 total 2\n\nmn is home in rows1-3,6-9,11-13 \u2192 let's see:\n\nRows1,2,3 \u2192 3\nrows6,7,8,9 \u2192 4 (total now 7)\nrows11,12,13 \u2192 3 more (total 10)\n\nvancouver: row4 and row5 \u2192 2\n\nSo total home games for each team:\n\ncolumbus: 2\n\nmn:10\n\nvancouver:2\n\nThat adds up to 14 games.\n\nWait, but that can't be because each game has one home and one visitor. So total home games across all teams should equal the number of rows (14). Indeed, 2+10+2=14.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\ncolumbus had 2 home games,\n\nminnesota had 10,\n\nvancouver had 2.\n</think>\n\nThe team that hosted (had their home game) in each scenario is determined by who appears in the \"home\" column of each row. By analyzing all rows, we can tally the number of times each team served as the host.\n\n- **Columbus** appears as the home team in **Row 0** and **Row 10**, totaling **2** home games.\n- **Minnesota** is the home team in **Rows 1-3**, **6-9**, **11-13**, amounting to **10** home games.\n- **Vancouver** hosts in **Rows 4 and 5**, resulting in **2** home games.\n\nThus, the breakdown of home games for each team is:\n\n- **Columbus**: 2\n- **Minnesota**: 10\n- **Vancouver**: 2\n\nEach of these figures represents how many times each team played as the host during their respective matches.",
