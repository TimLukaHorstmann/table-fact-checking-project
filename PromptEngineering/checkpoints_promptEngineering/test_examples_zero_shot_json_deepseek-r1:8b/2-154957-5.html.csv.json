    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Ben Frank have 30 cap for the Hawke's bay hurricane.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find Ben Frank's data. The columns in the table are player, position, date of birth (age), caps, and club / province. So, each row represents a player with these details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the name \"Ben Frank\". Let me see... Scanning the first few rows:\n\n1. Dane Coles - hooker\n2. Andrew Hore - hooker\n3. Keven Mealamu - hooker\n4. Wyatt Crockett - prop\n5. Charlie Faumuina - prop\n6. Ben Franks - prop\n\nAh, there's a row with \"Ben Franks\" as the player. So that's the relevant row. Now, I need to check each column for this row.\n\nThe claim says he has 30 caps for Hawke's Bay Hurricanes. Looking at the 'caps' column: it's listed as 30. That matches. \n\nNext, checking the \"club / province\" column: It says \"hawke 's bay / hurricanes\". Wait, there's an apostrophe in Hawke's, but in the claim, it's written as Hawke's Bay Hurricanes. So that part also matches.\n\nIs there any other information needed? The position is prop, which isn't specified in the claim, so we don't need to verify that. \n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. So, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because Ben Franks has 30 caps for Hawke's Bay Hurricanes, matching both the cap number and the club details in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
