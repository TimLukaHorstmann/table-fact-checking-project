    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the crowd be bigger at the game at junction oval than at kardinia park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nThe claim compares two venues: Junction Oval and Kardinia Park. It states that the crowd size at Junction Oval was larger than at Kardinia Park during a particular game. To verify this, I should look into the \"crowd\" column of the table for both locations and see which had a bigger number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details about home team, their score, away team, etc., including the venue and crowd size. My first step is to find all rows where either Junction Oval or Kardinia Park was the venue. \n\nStarting with Junction Oval: I'll scan through each row's \"venue\" column. The third entry (row_index 5) has \"junction oval\" as the venue. According to the table, the crowd for this game was 22413.\n\nNext, Kardinia Park is listed in row 4 (row_index 3), where the crowd was 17864.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 22413 (Junction Oval) vs. 17864 (Kardinia Park). Since 22413 is larger than 17864, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that both venues were used in games listed in the table and that there's a direct comparison available. In this case, both Junction Oval and Kardinia Park do appear with their respective crowd sizes. There's no conflicting information; each venue has only one entry each in the table. So, the comparison is straightforward.\n\nI don't need to consider other columns like date or team names because the claim specifically mentions crowd size, so I should focus only on the \"crowd\" column for relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Junction Oval had a larger crowd (22,413) compared to Kardinia Park's crowd of 17,864.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the game at arden street oval have a smaller crowd than the game at junction oval\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. The claim is comparing two games: one played at Arden Street Oval and another at Junction Oval. It claims that the crowd size at Arden Street was smaller than at Junction Oval.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's a JSON structure with columns like \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" etc., and each row represents a game with its details. The relevant columns here are \"crowd\" since we're talking about the number of people attending each game.\n\nSo, I need to find the crowd numbers for both Arden Street Oval and Junction Oval in the table. Then, compare those two numbers to see if Arden Street's crowd is indeed smaller than Junction Oval's.\n\nLet me scan through the data rows:\n\n1. First row: Venue is Moorabbin Oval, so not relevant.\n2. Second row: Venue is McG, also not relevant.\n3. Third row: Venue is Victoria Park, nope.\n4. Fourth row: Venue is Kardinia Park, still no.\n5. Fifth row: Venue is Arden Street Oval. So, in the fifth row, the crowd is 8733 people.\n6. Sixth row: Venue is Junction Oval. The crowd here is 22413.\n\nWait, so Arden Street had 8,733 attendees and Junction Oval had 22,413. That means Arden Street's crowd was smaller than Junction Oval's. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because it correctly states that the game at Arden Street had a smaller crowd.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread any rows. The fifth row is indeed north Melbourne vs Essendon at Arden Street with 8,733, and the sixth row is Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval with 22,413. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to compare the crowd sizes for games at Arden Street Oval and Junction Oval. \n\n- **Arden Street Oval**: In row 5 (index 4), the crowd was 8,733.\n- **Junction Oval**: In row 6 (index 5), the crowd was 22,413.\n\nSince 8,733 is less than 22,413, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant to verifying this claim. The claim compares two venues: Moorabbin Oval and Arden Street Oval. From the table's columns, \"venue\" will tell me which games were played at each venue, but more importantly, the \"crowd\" column gives the number of people attending each game.\n\nI need to find the crowd numbers for both Moorabbin Oval and Arden Street Oval. Looking at the data:\n\n- In row 0, the venue is Moorabbin Oval with a crowd of 16205.\n- In row 4, the venue is Arden Street Oval with a crowd of 8733.\n\nSo, I need to extract these two crowd numbers. The claim states that Moorabbin's crowd is bigger than Arden's. Since 16205 is indeed greater than 8733, this should make the claim TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list which rows and columns are involved. For Moorabbin Oval, it's row 0, column \"crowd\". For Arden Street Oval, it's row 4, column \"crowd\".\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being these two entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by comparing the crowd sizes at Moorabbin Oval and Arden Street Oval. The data shows that Moorabbin had a larger crowd.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the game at victoria park have a larger crowd than the game at kardinia park.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table correspond to Victoria Park and Kardinia Park. Looking at the table's columns, there's a column called \"venue,\" so that's where I'll look for each location.\n\nIn the data section, let's go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has the venue as \"moorabbin oval.\"\n2. The second row is \"mcg.\"\n3. Third is \"victoria park.\"\n4. Fourth is \"kardinia park.\"\n5. Fifth is \"arden street oval.\"\n6. Sixth is \"junction oval.\"\n\nSo, Victoria Park is in row 2 (since it's the third entry, but index starts at 0), and Kardinia Park is in row 3.\n\nNow, I need to check the crowd numbers for each of these games. The crowd column is the fifth one in the table, so for each relevant row, I'll extract that value.\n\nFor Victoria Park (row 2), the crowd is 41312.\nFor Kardinia Park (row 3), the crowd is 17864.\n\nThe claim is about whether Victoria Park's crowd was larger than Kardinia Park's. So, comparing 41,312 to 17,864, clearly Victoria Park had a larger crowd.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. I need to note which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for each venue are \"venue\" and \"crowd.\" For Victoria Park, it's row index 2, column name \"venue,\" and crowd column; same for Kardinia Park at row index 3 with \"venue\" and \"crowd.\"\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the crowd numbers from Victoria Park and Kardinia Park in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at junction oval have a larger crowd than at kardinia park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which parts of the claim refer to data in the table. The claim mentions two venues: junction oval and kardinia park. These are both in the \"venue\" column of the table. So, I should look at the crowd numbers for these specific venues on the given date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the venue with corresponding crowd numbers. For example, the first row is about st kilda vs south melbourne at moorabbin oval with 16,205 people. The second row is melbourne vs richmond at mcg with 37,732. The third row is collingwood vs hawthorn at victoria park with 41,312. The fourth row is geelong vs footscray at kardinia park with 17,864. Fifth row is north melbourne vs essendon at arden street oval with 8,733. Sixth row is fitzroy vs carlton at junction oval with 22,413.\n\nThe claim specifically compares the game at junction oval (fitzroy vs carlton) to the game at kardinia park (geelong vs footscray). So, I need to find the crowd numbers for these two venues on that date, which is August 21, 1971.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Junction oval had a crowd of 22,413.\n- Kardinia park had a crowd of 17,864.\n\nComparing these two numbers: 22,413 (junction oval) is larger than 17,864 (kardinia park). Therefore, the claim that the game at junction oval had a larger crowd is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The columns involved are \"venue\" and \"crowd\". For each of these, I should note their row indices where they correspond to the specific venues mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking for \"junction oval\": It's in row 5 (row_index: 5) under \"venue\", and in row 6 (row_index: 6) under \"crowd\".\n\nFor \"kardinia park\": It's in row 3 (row_index: 3) under \"venue\", and in row 4 (row_index: 4) under \"crowd\".\n\nWait, no. Let me check again:\n\nRow indices start from 0.\n\n- Row 0: moorabbin oval\n- Row 1: mcg\n- Row 2: victoria park\n- Row 3: kardinia park\n- Row 4: arden street oval\n- Row 5: junction oval\n\nSo, the venue \"junction oval\" is in row 5. The crowd for that game is in cell (5, \"crowd\"), which is 22,413.\n\nThe venue \"kardinia park\" is in row 3. The crowd for that game is in cell (3, \"crowd\"), which is 17,864.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For junction oval: row_index=5, column_name=\"venue\"\n- For junction oval crowd: row_index=5, column_name=\"crowd\"\n- For kardinia park: row_index=3, column_name=\"venue\"\n- For kardinia park crowd: row_index=3, column_name=\"crowd\"\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about the game at each venue. Each game is a separate row. So the relevant cells are:\n\nFor junction oval game: the entire row (row 5) since it includes both venue and crowd.\n\nSimilarly, for kardinia park game: row 3.\n\nBut wait, the claim is comparing two specific games on August 21, so the rows are fixed. Therefore, the relevant_cells should be the \"crowd\" column values for junction oval and kardinia park. Alternatively, perhaps just the crowd cells since that's what's being compared.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are \"crowd\" only because that's what is being evaluated. So, to confirm, I need to check the crowd numbers at each venue on that date. Therefore, the relevant_cells would be the two \"crowd\" entries corresponding to junction oval and kardinia park.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the game at junction oval have a larger crowd than at kardinia park\". So each of these games is a separate row: fitzroy vs carlton (row 5) and geelong vs footscray (row 3). Therefore, their respective crowd numbers are in cells:\n\n- For fitzroy vs carlton: row 5, \"crowd\" column\n- For geelong vs footscray: row 3, \"crowd\" column\n\nSo the relevant_cells should be these two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps also including the venue columns to confirm they're referring to the same date? But the claim is about the games on that specific date, so the crowd numbers are sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the table, each game is on the same date (21 august 1971), so we don't need to consider other dates. So yes, only the crowd columns for these two venues on that day matter.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"},\n  {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"}\n]\n\nWait, but I think I need to include both venue and crowd. Because in some cases, someone might think that the same date has multiple games at each venue, so maybe it's better to specify both.\n\nBut looking back at the instructions: the relevant_cells should be a list of objects, each with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". The example given includes two cells from different rows and columns. So in this case, for each game we need to check the crowd, which is their own row's \"crowd\" column.\n\nSo perhaps just the crowd columns for those two games are sufficient. Therefore:\n\nrelevant_cells = [\n  {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"},\n  {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"}\n]\n\nYes, that makes sense because we need to check if the crowd at junction oval (row5, crowd) is larger than at kardinia park (row3, crowd).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- The claim is TRUE because 22,413 >17,864.\n- Relevant cells are row5 and row3 in \"crowd\" column.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the crowd size is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the crowd at junction oval be 3 time bigger than the game at kardinia park.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. It's comparing two venues: junction oval and kardinia park. Specifically, it's looking at the crowd numbers for games held at these locations. The claim states that the crowd at junction oval is three times bigger than the crowd at kardinia park.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see there are multiple rows, each representing a game with details filled in for home team, away team, their scores, venue name, crowd number, and date. \n\nI need to identify which rows correspond to junction oval and kardinia park. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Venue is \"moorabbin oval\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 1: Venue is \"mcg\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Venue is \"victoria park\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 3: Venue is \"kardinia park\" \u2013 this is one of the venues mentioned in the claim. So, I'll note that this row has the crowd number for kardinia park.\nRow 4: Venue is \"arden street oval\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 5: Venue is \"junction oval\" \u2013 this is the other venue in the claim. So, the crowd number here will be compared against kardinia park's.\n\nNow, I need to find the crowd numbers for both venues:\n\nFor junction oval (row 5), the crowd is 22413.\nFor kardinia park (row 3), the crowd is 17864.\n\nThe claim says that the crowd at junction oval is three times bigger. To check this, I'll calculate whether 22413 is equal to 3 times 17864.\n\nCalculating 3 * 17864: \n17864 * 3 = 53,592.\n\nNow, comparing this to the actual crowd number at junction oval which is 22,413. Since 22,413 is much less than 53,592, the claim doesn't hold true.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check:\n\n17864 x 3:\nFirst, 10,000 *3 =30,000\n8,000*3=24,000 \u2192 total so far 54,000.\n764*3: 700*3=2,100; 64*3=192. Total for 764 is 2,292. So overall, 54,000 + 2,292 = 56,292. Wait, that doesn't add up because I think I messed up the breakdown.\n\nWait no, perhaps a better way: 17864 x3:\n10,000 *3=30,000\n8,000*3=24,000 \u2192 54,000 so far.\n700*3=2,100 \u2192 total 56,100\n64*3=192 \u2192 total 56,292.\n\nBut the crowd at junction oval is 22,413, which is way less than 56,292. So it's not three times bigger; in fact, it's around 0.397 times (22,413 / 56,292 \u2248 0.4), so much smaller.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the crowd at junction oval is three times larger than at kardinia park isn't supported by the data since 22,413 is less than three times 17,864 (which would be approximately 53,592). \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Identify rows for junction oval and kardinia park.\n2. Extract crowd numbers: 22,413 (junction oval) and 17,864 (kardinia park).\n3. Calculate 3 times the kardinia park crowd: 17,864 * 3 = 53,592.\n4. Compare with junction oval's crowd: 22,413 < 53,592.\n5.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the game at mcg have a smaller crowd than the game at junction oval.\" So, the claim is comparing two games\u2014one at the McGraw-Hill (MCG) venue and another at the Junction Oval. It says that the MCG game had fewer people attending compared to the Junction Oval game.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can see it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows include different games with details from August 21, 1971.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that support or contradict this claim. Since the claim is about comparing crowd sizes at two specific venues, MCG and Junction Oval, I should look for the corresponding row in the table where the venue is \"mcg\" and another where it's \"junction oval.\"\n\nLet me go through each row of the data:\n\n1. **First row**: Venue is Moorabbin Oval. So, not relevant.\n2. **Second row**: Venue is MCG. Here, crowd is 37732.\n3. **Third row**: Venue is Victoria Park. Not relevant.\n4. **Fourth row**: Venue is Kardinia Park. Not relevant.\n5. **Fifth row**: Venue is Arden Street Oval. Not relevant.\n6. **Sixth row**: Venue is Junction Oval. Here, crowd is 22413.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says that the game at MCG has a smaller crowd than at Junction Oval. So, I need to compare these two venues' crowds. From the table:\n\n- MCG: 37732\n- Junction Oval: 22413\n\nSo, the crowd at Junction Oval is smaller than at MCG. Therefore, the claim that \"the game at MCG have a smaller crowd\" is actually FALSE because the MCG had a larger crowd.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. The claim says \"the game at mcg have a smaller crowd than the game at junction oval.\" So it's comparing MCG vs Junction Oval. But in reality, MCG has a higher crowd (37,732) compared to Junction Oval (22,413). Therefore, the statement is incorrect because the opposite is true.\n\nHence, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify which rows and columns are used for this comparison. For MCG, it's row index 1 with column \"crowd.\" For Junction Oval, it's row index 5 (since the data starts at 0, so fifth element is row 5) but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the data array has six elements, each a game. So:\n\n- Row 0: Moorabbin\n- Row 1: MCG\n- Row 2: Victoria Park\n- Row 3: Kardinia\n- Row 4: Arden Street\n- Row 5: Junction Oval\n\nYes, so row index 5 is Junction Oval.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For MCG: row 1, column \"crowd\"\n- For Junction Oval: row 5, column \"crowd\"\n\nSo, I need to list these two as the relevant_cells.\n\nWait, but in the table, the columns are listed with their indices. So for the first data row (row 0), it's:\n\n[\n  \"st kilda\",\n  \"18.14 (122)\",\n  \"south melbourne\",\n  \"6.14 (50)\",\n  \"moorabbin oval\",\n  16205,\n  \"21 august 1971\"\n]\n\nSo, the columns are:\n\n0: home team\n1: home team score\n2: away team\n3: away team score\n4: venue\n5: crowd\n6: date\n\nTherefore, for each game, column index 5 is the crowd.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1 (MCG), column \"crowd\" at index 5.\n- Row 5 (Junction Oval), column \"crowd\" at index 5.\n\nSo in terms of row indices and column names, they would be:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n]\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is FALSE because MCG has a larger crowd than Junction Oval, and the relevant cells are the two 'crowd' columns for those venues.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by comparing the crowd sizes at McGraw-Hill (MCG) and Junction Oval. The MCG game had a higher attendance, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the crowd at moorabbin oval be bigger than the crowd at junction oval.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the columns of the table because I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns listed are home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim is about comparing two venues: Moorabbin Oval and Junction Oval. So I should focus on the \"crowd\" column for these specific venues.\n\nLooking at each row in the data:\n\n1. The first row has the venue as Moorabbin Oval with a crowd of 16205.\n2. The fifth row (index 4) is about Fitzroy at Junction Oval, with a crowd of 22413.\n3. The sixth row (index 5) seems to be about Carlton, but their venue isn't specified beyond \"south melbourne\" which doesn't match either, so maybe I'm misreading it. Wait, no\u2014looking again, each row has the home team, away team, etc. So actually, the fifth row is about Fitzroy (home) vs Carlton (away) at Junction Oval with 22413 people.\n\nWait, but in the data, the first entry is St Kilda at Moorabbin Oval with 16205. Then Melbourne, Richmond, Collingwood, Geelong, North Melbourne, and Fitzroy/Carlton are the other matches. So the claim is specifically about Moorabbin Oval vs Junction Oval. From the table, there's only one Moorabbin Oval entry (row 0) and one Junction Oval entry (row 5).\n\nSo comparing their crowd numbers: Moorabbin Oval had 16205, while Junction Oval had 22413. So 16205 is less than 22413, meaning that the crowd at Moorabbin was NOT bigger than at Junction.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"The game at Victoria Park had a larger crowd than the combined crowd of Kardinia Park and MCG.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions three venues: Victoria Park, Kardinia Park, and MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground). The task is to compare the crowd numbers at Victoria Park with the combined crowds at Kardinia Park and MCG.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The columns relevant here are \"venue\" and \"crowd\". So I'll focus on these two columns to find the necessary data points.\n\nI need to identify which rows have Victoria Park as their venue because that's where the home game is. Then, for Kardinia Park and MCG, I should look at all the games played there.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Venue is Moorabbin Oval, so not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Venue is MCG, so this is one of the comparison points (Kardinia and MCG). The crowd here is 37,732.\n3. Row 2: Venue is Victoria Park, which is our main point of interest. Crowd is 41,312.\n4. Row 3: Venue is Kardinia Park, so another comparison point. Crowd is 17,864.\n5. Row 4: Venue is Arden Street Oval, not relevant.\n6. Row 5: Venue is Junction Oval, not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, I have three data points:\n\n- Victoria Park: 41,312\n- Kardinia Park: 17,864 (row 3)\n- MCG: 37,732 (row 1)\n\nNow, I need to check if Victoria Park's crowd is larger than the sum of Kardinia and MCG.\n\nLet me calculate the combined crowd for Kardinia and MCG:\n\n17,864 (Kardinia) + 37,732 (MCG) = 55,596\n\nCompare that with Victoria Park's 41,312. Since 41,312 is less than 55,596, the claim that Victoria Park had a larger crowd than the combined total of Kardinia and MCG is false.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check if I missed any other games at Kardinia or MCG. Looking back, row 3 is the only one for Kardinia with 17,864, and row 1 is the only MCG game with 37,732. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the crowd at Victoria Park (41,312) is not larger than the combined crowds of Kardinia Park (17,864) and MCG (37,732), which sum to 55,596.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"the game at junction oval have 2 time a larger crowd than at kardinia park.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It's a JSON with columns like home team, scores, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The data rows include information about each game.\n\nI need to find out if there are two games where the crowd at junction oval is larger than that at kardinia park. Wait, actually, the claim says \"have 2 time a larger crowd,\" which I think means two instances where the crowd at junction oval was larger than at kardinia park on separate occasions.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. The first row: venue is Moorabbin Oval, so not relevant.\n2. Second row: McG, so not relevant.\n3. Third row: Victoria Park, nope.\n4. Fourth row: Kardinia Park. Crowd was 17864.\n5. Fifth row: Arden Street Oval, not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: Junction Oval, crowd was 22413.\n\nWait, that's only one instance where junction oval is the venue with a larger crowd compared to Kardinia Park (which had 17864). So does \"2 times\" mean two separate games? But in this table, I only see one game at junction oval. Unless there are more rows beyond what's shown.\n\nBut the data provided has six rows. Among them, only the sixth row is for junction oval, and that's compared to Kardinia Park in the fourth row. So maybe there's only one comparison where junction oval had a larger crowd than Kardinia Park.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"have 2 times a larger crowd,\" but only one instance exists. That would make the claim false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
