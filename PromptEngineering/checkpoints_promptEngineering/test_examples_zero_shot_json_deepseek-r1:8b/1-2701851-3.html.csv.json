    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table seems to be in JSON format, listing various episodes with details like their number in the series and season, titles, directors, writers, air dates, and production codes.\n\nThe claim given is: \"201a be the production code of the 14a series and 1a season , title spontaneously combustible which be direct by igor kovalyov.\" Hmm, that's a bit to parse. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The claim mentions \"201a\" as the production code for \"14a series and 1a season.\" So I should look at the row where the series is \"14a\" and the season is \"1a.\"\n\nLooking at the data, the first entry is:\n[\n  \"14a\",\n  \"1a\",\n  \"spontaneously combustible\",\n  \"igor kovalyov\",\n  ...\n]\n\nHere, \"14a\" is the series number, \"1a\" is the season, and the title is \"spontaneously combustible.\" The director listed here is \"igor kovalyov.\"\n\nNow, the claim states that the production code for this entry is \"201a.\" So I need to check if in this row, the production code column has \"201a.\"\n\nLooking at the data, the first row's production code is \"201a,\" which matches the claim. That part checks out.\n\nNext, it says \"title spontaneously combustible\" which we've confirmed from the title column. Then, it mentions that it's directed by \"igor kovalyov.\" Again, this matches with the director's name in the same row.\n\nSo all parts of the claim correspond correctly to the first row of the table. There's no discrepancy or mismatch here. The production code, series number, season, title, and director all align with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, based on this verification, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"production code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}",
