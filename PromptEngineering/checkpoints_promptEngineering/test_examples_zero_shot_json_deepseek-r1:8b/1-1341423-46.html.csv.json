    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"in 1982, norman sisisky be re - elect\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the year 1982 and Norman Sisisky being re-elected. So, I should look for rows where the \"first elected\" year is 1982 and check if that row shows him as being re-elected.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\n1. The first row is about Virginia 2, incumbent Owen B. Pickett, party Democratic, first elected in 1986. He retired, so not relevant.\n2. The second row is Virginia 3, Bobby Scott, Democratic, first elected in 1992. Not 1982.\n3. Third row: Virginia 4, Norman Sisisky, Democratic, first elected in 1982. The \"results\" column says \"re - elected.\" This matches the claim.\n\nSo, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row index for this is 2 (since it's the third element in data[], starting at 0). The columns needed are \"district,\" \"incumbent,\" and \"first elected,\" as well as \"results.\"\n\nWait, the user instructions specify that relevant_cells should be a list of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" So, for each column that is relevant to verifying the claim, I'll include them.\n\nIn this case, the columns are:\n- row_index: 2\n- district: virginia 4\n- incumbent: norman sisisky\n- first elected: 1982\n- results: re - elected\n\nSo all these columns support the claim. Therefore, relevant_cells includes these.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"norman sisisky be re - elected after 1982\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Norman Sisisky being re-elected after 1982. So, I'm looking for information about Norman Sisisky in the table that relates to his election status post-1982.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are district, incumbent, party, first elected, results, and candidates. The data rows have details about each of these aspects for different districts in Virginia.\n\nI should go through each row to find the one where the incumbent is Norman Sisisky. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: District 2, Owen B. Pickett, Democratic, 1986, retired Republican gain, etc.\n- Row 1: District 3, Bobby Scott, Democratic, 1992, re-elected, etc.\n- Row 2: District 4, Norman Sisisky, Democratic, 1982, re-elected, and candidates as Norman Sisisky (D) unopposed.\n\nSo, row 2 is about District 4 and Norman Sisisky. The \"first elected\" column shows 1982, which means he was first elected in that year. The \"results\" column says \"re - elected,\" indicating he was re-elected at some point after his initial election.\n\nNow, the claim says he was re-elected after 1982. Since his first term started in 1982, being re-elected would naturally be after that time. Looking at the table, there's no conflicting information; the results column confirms he was re-elected, which happened after 1982.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The \"first elected\" is 1982, so any re-election must be after that. The claim doesn't specify when exactly after 1982, just that it occurred. From the table, he was re-elected as shown in the results column, which aligns with the claim.\n\nI don't see any information that contradicts this. The other columns like \"district,\" \"incumbent,\" and \"party\" also match, so nothing there is a problem.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"results\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
