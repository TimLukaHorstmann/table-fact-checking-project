    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"On the 29 november be the game score for sydney spirit v south dragon be 103 - 94.\" So, we're looking for a game between Sydney Spirit and South Dragons that occurred on November 29th with a score of 103-94.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row to see if any match this description. The columns relevant here are \"date,\" \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"score.\"\n\nStarting from the first data row: \n- Date: 26 november\nNot matching.\n\nSecond row: Same date, so skip.\n\nThird row: 27 november, different date.\n\nFourth row: 29 november. Let's see:\n- Home team: Adelaide 36ers\n- Away team: Wollongong Hawks\nScore: 101 - 96\nDoesn't match.\n\nFifth row: 29 november.\nHome team: Cairns Taipans\nAway team: Townsville Crocodiles\nScore: 90 -94\nNo match.\n\nSixth row: 29 november.\nHome team: Gold Coast Blaze\nAway team: New Zealand Breakers\nScore:88-110\nNot matching.\n\nSeventh row: 29 november.\nHome team: Perth Wildcats\nAway team: Melbourne Tigers\nScore:95-108\nNope.\n\nEighth row: 29 november.\nHere we have:\nHome team: Sydney Spirit\nAway team: South Dragons\nScore:103 -94\nThis matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, I need to identify which columns in this relevant row are important. The \"date\" confirms it's November 29th. \"home team\" is Sydney Spirit and \"away team\" is South Dragons, so those two columns are needed. The score column is also relevant because it shows 103-94.\n\nTherefore, the cells that are relevant are at row_index 7 (since rows start from 0), in columns \"date,\" \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"score.\"\n\nWait, but looking back, the table's data starts with index 0. So row 7 is the eighth entry, correct.\n\nSo, the JSON should include each of these cells.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "claim": "melbourne tiger be the away team that play home team of perth wildcat on the 29 november",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"Melbourne Tigers be the away team that play home team of Perth Wildcats on the 29 November.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three entities: Melbourne Tigers as the away team, Perth Wildcats as the home team, and the date is 29 November.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, home team, score, etc. So I need to find rows where the date is 29 November because that's when the event supposedly happened.\n\nNow, checking the data section of the table:\n\nI see several rows for 29 November:\n- The fourth row: date is \"29 november\", home team is \"adelaide 36ers\", away team is \"wollongong hawks\".\n- Fifth row: home team \"cairns taipans\" vs away team \"townsville crocodiles\".\n- Sixth row: home team \"gold coast blaze\" vs away \"new zealand breakers\".\n- Seventh row: home \"perth wildcats\" vs away \"melbourne tigers\".\n- Eighth row: home \"sydney spirit\" vs away \"south dragons\".\n\nWait, the seventh row is crucial because it has Perth Wildcats as the home team. The away team listed there is Melbourne Tigers. That matches exactly what the claim states: Melbourne Tigers are the away team playing against Perth Wildcats on 29 November.\n\nSo, in this row (row index 7), the columns relevant would be date, home team, and away team. Let me check their indices:\n\nLooking at the structure:\nEach data array is a row. The first element is date, then home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report.\n\nSo for row 7 (index 7):\n- \"29 november\" is the date.\n- \"perth wildcats\" is the home team.\n- \"melbourne tigers\" is the away team.\n\nTherefore, the relevant columns are: date (row_index 0), home team (row_index 1), and away team (row_index 3).\n\nI need to make sure there's only one occurrence where this happens. In row 7, it's clear that Melbourne Tigers are away against Perth Wildcats on 29 November. No other rows have Melbourne Tigers as the away team against Perth Wildcats on that date.\n\nSo the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the november 29 melbourne tiger game be in the state sport centre venue",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the november 29 melbourne tiger game be in the state sport centre venue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to identify what it's asking for. The claim mentions a specific game: November 29th, Melbourne Tigers, and the venue should be the State Sport Centre.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. So I need to check if there's a row where the date is November 29, the home or away team is the Melbourne Tigers, and the venue is State Sport Centre.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\n1. The first row has the date as \"26 november\" \u2013 doesn't match.\n2. Second row: same date as above, so no.\n3. Third row: \"27 november\", not matching.\n4. Fourth row: \"29 november\". Home team is Adelaide 36ers, away is Wollongong Hawks. Venue is Distinctive Homes Dome. Not Melbourne Tigers or State Sport Centre.\n5. Fifth row: Date matches. Home team is Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles. Venue is Cairns Convention Centre. No match.\n6. Sixth row: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre. Doesn't fit.\n7. Seventh row: Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers, venue is Marrara Stadium. Close, but not State Sport Centre.\n8. Eighth row: Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons, venue is State Sports Centre.\n\nWait, the eighth row has the date as \"29 november\", home team Sydney Spirit, away team South Dragons. The venue is State Sports Centre. But the claim mentions Melbourne Tigers, so this doesn't fit because the home team here is Sydney Spirit, not Melbourne Tigers.\n\nSo none of the rows match all three criteria: November 29th, Melbourne Tigers as either home or away, and venue as State Sport Centre.\n\nI should check each row for both home and away teams being Melbourne Tigers on November 29. From the table:\n\n- Looking at the data, only the seventh row has Melbourne Tigers as the away team, playing against Perth Wildcats on \"29 november\" at Marrara Stadium. So no match for venue in that case either.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where all three conditions are met: November 29, Melbourne Tigers game, and State Sport Centre as venue.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks each row for the specified date, team, and venue but finds no matching entry. Thus, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
