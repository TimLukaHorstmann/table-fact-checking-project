    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"On September 26, 1971, the attendance at the game was 57,895 crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the specific date in the table to find the corresponding row. The table's 'date' column has entries from September 19 to December 19, 1971. Scanning through them, I see that September 26 is one of the dates. It's the second entry in the data array because it's at index 1 (since arrays start at 0). \n\nNext, I need to check the 'attendance' for that date. In row 1, the attendance is listed as 57,895. That matches exactly with the claim. So, the attendance figure supports the claim fully.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I should note which cells are relevant. The key columns here are 'date' and 'attendance'. For September 26, the date is at row_index 1 and column \"date\", while the attendance is also in row 1 under \"attendance\". Both pieces of information are needed to verify the claim.\n\nTherefore, both these cells are relevant because they provide both the condition (date) and the fact (attendance number). Without checking both, I can't fully confirm or deny the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check the date and attendance columns for September 26, 1971.\n\nThe table shows that on September 26, 1971, the attendance was indeed 57,895. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Locate the row with \"September 26, 1971\" in the date column (row index 1).\n2. Check the attendance for this row, which is 57,895.\n3. Since both the date and attendance match the claim, it's TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are those providing the date and attendance data for September 26, 1971.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of data about football games, and there's a claim that says: \"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971 and the attendance be 57895\". My job is to figure out if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the week being 14 and the date being September 26, 1971. The second part is about the attendance being 57,895.\n\nI'll start by looking at each column in the table. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, attendance. So for the first part of the claim, I need to check the \"week\" and \"date\" columns.\n\nLooking through the data, each row represents a different week. Week 14 is present in one of these rows. Let me find which row that is. Scanning down, I see that week 14 is at row index 13 (since it's zero-indexed or not? Wait, no, looking back, the first row is week 1, so the indices go from 0 to 13 for weeks 1 to 14). So the date for week 14 is \"december 19 , 1971\". That doesn't match the claim which says September 26. So already, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim says week 14 on September 26. Looking through the dates: week 2 is September 26. So in the table, week 2 has date \"september 26 , 1971\". That means the claim's week number doesn't match the actual week. It's claiming that week 14 is on September 26, but according to the table, week 14 is December 19. So already, the first part of the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: attendance being 57,895. I need to find which row has an attendance value of 57,895. Looking through each row's attendance column:\n\nRow 0: 56,990\nRow 1: 57,895\nRow 2: 54,418\nRow 3: 58,850\n... and so on.\n\nSo the only row with attendance 57,895 is row 1 (week 2). So if someone claims that both week 14 has a specific date and attendance is 57,895, then they're mixing up two different weeks. Week 2 had that attendance, not week 14.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Is it saying that in week 14, the date was September 26 and attendance was 57,895? Or is it separate? The wording is a bit unclear: \"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971 and the attendance be 57895\". So it's two conditions: one about the week and date, and another about the attendance.\n\nSo to satisfy the claim, both conditions must be met in the same row. That is, there should exist a week where both the week number is 14, the date is September 26, and the attendance is 57,895.\n\nLooking at all rows, no single row has week 14, September 26 date, and attendance 57,895. Week 14's date is December 19, and its attendance is 44,582, which doesn't match. So neither of the two conditions are met in the same row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly associates a later week with an earlier week's date and attendance numbers.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",
