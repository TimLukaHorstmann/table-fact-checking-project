    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"houston have no post - season record\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns relevant here are \"season,\" \"manager,\" \"record,\" \"win %,\" \"post - season record,\" and \"mlb affiliate.\" The claim specifically mentions \"houston\" having no post-season record, so I need to focus on the \"post - season record\" column for Houston entries.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Season 2001, Manager Joe Cannon, Post-Season Record is \"4 - 0.\" So there's a post-season record here.\n2. **Row 1**: Season 2002, Manager Joe Cannon, Post-Season Record is \"-\". The \"-\" likely means no play-off or no record, so Houston didn't have a post-season record in 2002.\n3. **Row 2**: Season 2003 (with an asterisk), Manager Russ Nixon, Post-Season Record \"0 - 2.\" Houston had a post-season record here.\n4. **Row 3**: 2004 season with Ivan De Jesus as manager; post-season record is \"-\". No record again.\n5. **Row 4**: 2005 with Tim Bogar; post-season record \"-\", so no record.\n6. **Row 5**: 2006 with Jack Lind; post-season \"0 - 2.\" So they had a record here.\n7. **Row 6**: 2007, Gregg Langbehn; record is \"-\". No post-season.\n8. **Row 7**: 2008, same manager; no post-season.\n9. **Row 8**: 2009, Tom Lawless; no record.\n10. **Row 9**: 2010, Rodney Linares; \"-\", so no.\n11. **Row 10**: 2011, same manager; \"-\".\n12. **Row 11**: 2012, Ivan De Jesus; record is \"69 - 69\", which might be a typo for the regular season. Wait, but the column is \"post - season record,\" and here it's \"69 - 69.\" That seems off. Maybe that entry didn't have a post-season.\n13. **Row 12**: 2013, Brian Buchanan; affiliate changed to Kansas City, so not Houston anymore.\n\nLooking at these, in some years like 2001, 2003, 2006, 2005, etc., Houston had post-season records. The claim is that \"houston have no post - season record,\" which isn't entirely true because they do have entries where they did have post-season records, such as 2001, 2003, and 2006.\n\nHowever, in some years like 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007-2011, etc., Houston didn't have a post-season record. So the claim is only partially true if it's about specific years but false overall because there are instances where they did have records.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"houston have no post - season record.\" That implies that across all seasons listed, Houston never had any post-season record, which isn't accurate because in 2001, 2003, and 2006, they did. So overall, the claim is false because there are years where they do have records.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"houston have no post - season record\" is FALSE because the table shows that Houston had post-season records in some years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"Kansas City\" refers to a team, likely in baseball given the context (since it's about MLB affiliates). The term \"post-season record\" would typically refer to their performance in the playoffs after the regular season. The claim is that they had no post-season record in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find information related to Kansas City in 2013. The table has several columns: season, manager, record, win %, post-season record, post-season win %, and MLB affiliate. \n\nI'll start by searching for rows where the \"mlb affiliate\" column is \"kansas city.\" Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 0: Houston\n- Row 1: Houston\n- ... (continuing until row 12)\n- Wait, I see that in row 12, the \"mlb affiliate\" is \"kansas city,\" but the season is 2013. Let me check that again.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table provided, the rows are from 2001 to 2013. The last few rows:\n\nRow 11: 2012 with Houston.\nRow 12: 2013, affiliate is \"kansas city.\"\n\nSo, in 2013 (row 12), the manager is Brian Buchanan, and the record is 44-42, which translates to 512 wins. The columns for post-season record and win % are both \"-\", indicating that there was no post-season play or their performance wasn't recorded.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013.\" So, if in 2013, Kansas City had a record of 44-42 and their post-season record is \"-\", does this mean they didn't qualify for the playoffs? Or did they have some participation?\n\nIn MLB, teams that don't make the playoffs wouldn't have a post-season record. If they do make it, there would be a record. So if in 2013, Kansas City's post-season record is \"-\", that means they didn't have a playoff series. Therefore, their post-season record was zero games or they didn't participate.\n\nSo the claim is saying they had no post-season record in 2013, which aligns with the table data where it's \"-\". Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because the table shows no post-season record for Kansas City in 2013.\n\nWait a moment, but I need to make sure there isn't any other row that might refer to 2013 with a different affiliate. Looking back at all rows, only row 12 (2013) has \"kansas city\" as the affiliate. So no confusion there.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the ones from row 12: specifically, the columns \"post - season record\" and maybe others? Wait, the claim is about having no post-season record. The relevant column would be \"post - season record,\" which is \"-\", so that's one cell. Do I need to include other columns like \"season\"? Maybe not unless necessary.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should list all relevant cells that directly support or contradict the claim. So, in this case, the manager, record, etc., might be less relevant because they don't directly address the post-season record. The key cell is the one under \"post - season record\" for 2013.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the row for 2013 with the \"post - season record\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013\" is true, we need to examine the table provided. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where the \"mlb affiliate\" is \"kansas city.\" The only such row is in 2013.\n2. **Check Post-Season Record**: In the 2013 row, the \"post - season record\" column has a \"-\", indicating no post-season play.\n\nSince the table confirms that Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
