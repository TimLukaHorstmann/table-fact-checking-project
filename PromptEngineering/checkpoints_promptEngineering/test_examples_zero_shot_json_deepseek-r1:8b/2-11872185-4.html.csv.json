    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim says, \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think it means that no movie in the table had a lifetime India distributor share before 2009.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the table structure. It has columns: rank, movie, year, studio (s), and lifetime india distributor share. The data is a list of movies with their respective years, studios, and shares.\n\nMy task is to check each row's \"lifetime india distributors share\" column and see if any of them have a value that indicates distribution before 2009. But wait, the claim says no shares are given earlier than 2009. So I need to look for movies released in 2008 or earlier, right? Because if such a movie exists with a non-zero share, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2013\n- Row 1: Year 2012\n- Row 2: Year 2009\n- Row 3: Year 2013\n- Row 4: Year 2012\n- Row 5: Year 2012\n- Row 6: Year 2011\n- Row 7: Year 2010\n- Row 8: Year 2012\n- Row 9: Year 2012\n\nSo, all the movies listed were released from 2009 onwards. The earliest is 2009 in row 2.\n\nNow, looking at their \"lifetime india distributor share\" values:\n\nRow 0: 114 , 25 , 00000 \u2013 that's a three-part number? Wait, the format is like \"114 , 25 , 00000\". Hmm, maybe it's three numbers separated by commas. So first value is 114, second 25, third 00000.\n\nBut I'm not sure if each of these represents something specific. Maybe the first number is the share in a particular region? Or perhaps the three numbers are for different aspects like India and others.\n\nWait, maybe the \"lifetime india distributors share\" is just one number per movie. Looking at the data:\n\nRow 0: \"114 , 25 , 00000\" \u2013 could be 114 as the main number.\nRow 1: \"106 , 00 , 00000\" \u2013 106.\nRow 2: \"99 , 02 , 00000\" \u2013 99.\nRow 3: \"91 , 00 , 00000\" \u2013 91.\nRow 4: \"84 , 00 , 00000\" \u2013 84.\nRow 5: \"79 , 49 , 00000\" \u2013 79.\nRow 6: \"76 , 84 , 00000\" \u2013 76.\nRow 7: \"74 , 00 , 00000\" \u2013 74.\nRow 8: \"65 , 53 , 00000\" \u2013 65.\nRow 9: \"64 , 58 , 00000\" \u2013 64.\n\nWait, maybe the first number is the share in India. So for each movie, their India distributor' share is the first number before the comma. For example:\n\n- Chennai Express (row 0): 114\n- Ek Tha Tiger (row1):106\n- 3 Idiots (row2):99\n- Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (row3):91\n- Dabangg 2 (row4):84\n- Bodyguard (row5):79\n- Dabangg (row6):76\n- Rowdy Rathore (row7):74\n- Agneepath (row8):65\n- Ready (row9):64\n\nSo, all these shares are above zero, but the claim is about whether any share was given earlier than 2009. Since all movies in the table were released from 2009 onwards (the earliest being 2009), and none before that year, there are no movies in the table with a release date before 2009.\n\nWait, but if the claim says \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009,\" perhaps it's referring to any movie distributed by India distributors before 2009. So if any of these movies were released before 2009, and their share is given (non-zero), then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking back at the table, the earliest year in the data is 2010 (row7). There are no movies from 2008 or earlier in this table. Therefore, none of them had shares given before 2009.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009.\" So perhaps it's saying that no movie in the list had a distribution share prior to 2009. Since all movies were released from 2009 onwards, their shares would have been given starting from 2009. Therefore, the claim is stating that none of them (in the table) had shares before 2009, which is correct because they are all from 2009 or later.\n\nWait no, actually, if a movie was released in 2008 but isn't listed here, maybe it existed elsewhere. But since we're only looking at this table, perhaps none of these movies were released before 2009, so their shares were given starting from 2009 or later.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about whether \"no lifetime india distributors share be given earlier than 2009.\" So if any movie in the table was distributed by India distributors before 2009, then the claim would be false. But since none of these movies were released before 2009 (all are from 2009 onwards), their shares must have been given starting from 2009 or later.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because if a movie is released in 2010, its share was given after 2009. So the claim says that no shares were given earlier than 2009, which is true because all these movies' shares were given at or after 2009.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"lifetime india distributors share\" refers to the share from when they were released in India. So if a movie was released in 2008 but isn't listed here, perhaps it had a share, making the claim false. But since we don't have such data, and all movies here are from 2009 onwards, maybe the claim is true.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to rephrase:\n\nThe claim: No movie in this table had its India distributor' share given before 2009.\n\nLooking at each row, all movies were released in 2009 or later, so their shares must have been allocated starting from 2009 onward. Therefore, none of them had shares given earlier than 2009. So the claim is true.\n\nBut wait, perhaps \"given\" refers to distribution happening before release. For example, distribution contracts might be signed before release. If a movie was released in 2010, its India share would have been determined by contracts made before 2010, which could be earlier than 2009.\n\nSo if any of these movies had their India distribution contracted before 2009, then the claim is false because shares were given (agreed upon) before 2009.\n\nBut since the data doesn't specify when each movie's distribution was finalized, we can't know for sure. However, based on the release years, all are from 2009 onwards, so any share agreements would be after 2008 at the latest, making the claim true only if the shares were given in or after 2009.\n\nAlternatively, if \"given earlier than 2009\" refers to the movies being distributed by India distributors before 2009, then since none of them were, the claim is true.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, the claim seems to hold because none of these movies were released before 2009, so their shares would have been given starting from 2009 onward. Thus, no shares were given earlier than 2009 for these movies.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that none of the listed movies had their India distributors' shares allocated before 2009. Since all movies in the table were released in or after 2009, any share agreements would have occurred at least by 2008 if not later. Therefore, no shares were given earlier than 2009 for these specific movies.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true; none of the listed movies had their India distributors' shares allocated before 2009.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that for movies released before 2009, their lifetime India distributor share was 0. So, I need to check each movie in the table and see if it was released before 2009 and whether its \"lifetime india distributor share\" is zero.\n\nLooking at the table structure: There are five columns\u2014rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. Each row represents a different movie with corresponding details.\n\nI should go through each row and check two things:\n1. Is the movie's release year (year column) earlier than 2009?\n2. Does the \"lifetime india distributors share\" for that movie have a value of zero?\n\nLet me start by identifying which movies were released before 2009. I'll list out the years:\n\n- Chennai Express: 2013\n- Ek Tha Tiger: 2012\n- 3 Idiots: 2009\n- Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani: 2013\n- Dabangg 2: 2012\n- Bodyguard: 2011\n- Dabangg: 2010\n- Rowdy Rathore: 2012\n- Agneepath: 2012\n- Ready: 2011\n\nNow, the movies with years before 2009 are:\n- Bodyguard: 2011\n- Dabangg: 2010\n- Ready: 2011\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2011 and 2010 are both after 2009, right? No, wait. If the claim is about movies released earlier than 2009, then we need to find movies with year < 2009. Looking at the list:\n\nChecking each movie's year:\n- Chennai Express: 2013 (after)\n- Ek Tha Tiger: 2012 (after)\n- 3 Idiots: 2009 (same as cutoff)\n- Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani: 2013\n- Dabangg 2: 2012\n- Bodyguard: 2011\n- Dabangg: 2010\n- Rowdy Rathore: 2012\n- Agneepath: 2012\n- Ready: 2011\n\nWait, so movies with year less than 2009 would be any movie released before 2009. So, for example, if a movie was released in 2008 or earlier, that's when the share should be zero. But in this table, the earliest movie is Chennai Express in 2013, which is way after. Wait, no, Bodyguard is 2011, Dabangg is 2010, and Ready is also 2011. So all movies in the table were released from 2009 onwards.\n\nWait a second, let me clarify: The claim says \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0.\" Does that mean for movies released before 2009? Or does it refer to the lifetime share being zero at some point prior to 2009?\n\nBut looking at the table, all movies are from 2009 onwards. So there are no movies in this table that were released before 2009. Therefore, the condition of the claim (movies released earlier than 2009) doesn't apply because none of them exist in the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is about any movie where their lifetime share was zero at some point before 2009, regardless of release date. But that's a different interpretation.\n\nHowever, given the wording \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0,\" it seems more likely to mean that for movies released before 2009, their share was zero. Since there are no such movies in this table (all movies listed were released from 2010 onwards), there's nothing to verify.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be FALSE because there are no movies in the table that meet the condition of being released earlier than 2009 and having a lifetime India distributors share of zero.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for movies released before 2009, their lifetime India distributors share was zero. However, all movies listed were released from 2010 onwards. Since there are no such movies in the table, the claim is not supported.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that in the year 2009, \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release. That implies two things: (1) the movie \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2009, and (2) it was the first movie to be released that year in the context of the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. Each row represents a different movie with its details.\n\nSo, I need to check each part of the claim against the table.\n\n1. **Year Check**: The claim mentions 2009 as the release year for \"ek tha tiger\". Let's look through the table for the movie \"ek tha tiger.\" Scanning the 'movie' column, I see that row number 2 is for \"ek tha tiger\" with a year of 2012. Wait, that doesn't match 2009 at all. That means the claim might be incorrect because according to the table, the movie was released in 2012, not 2009.\n\n2. **Release Order Check**: Even if there were a movie released in 2009, I need to see if \"ek tha tiger\" was indeed the first release of 2009 in the given data set. So, I should look at all movies released in 2009 and see how they are ranked or ordered.\n\nLooking through the 'year' column, the only movies with a year of 2009 is row number 2: \"3 idiots\" released in 2009. Therefore, if \"ek tha tiger\" was not even released in 2009, it can't be the first release that year.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I think I might have confused row numbers. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: Chennai Express (2013)\n- Row 1: Ek Tha Tiger (2012)\n- Row 2: 3 Idiots (2009)\n- Row 3: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013)\n- Row 4: Dabangg 2 (2012)\n- Row 5: Bodyguard (2011)\n- Row 6: Dabangg (2010)\n- Row 7: Rowdy Rathore (2012)\n- Row 8: Agneepath (2012)\n- Row 9: Ready (2011)\n\nSo, \"ek tha tiger\" is in row 1, released in 2012. Therefore, it wasn't released in 2009 at all. The claim says it was released in 2009, which is not true because the table shows it was released two years later.\n\nAdditionally, even if the release year were correct, I need to check if \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release of that year. But since no movie from the given data set was released in 2009 besides \"3 idiots,\" and \"ek tha tiger\" wasn't even released then, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because:\n\n- The movie \"ek tha tiger\" wasn't released in 2009.\n- Even if it were, there's no other movie from the data set released that same year, so it can't be the first release of 2009.\n\nI don't need to consider any other columns for this claim since both parts of the claim are directly contradicted by the table. The 'rank' might indicate order, but since \"ek tha tiger\" isn't in 2009, its rank is irrelevant here.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"agneepath be release first in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that \"agneepath\" was released first in 2010. So, I'm looking to see if there's a row in the table where the movie is \"agneepath\" and the year is 2010.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. The data rows start from index 0 to 10. I need to check each row to see if any match both the movie title and the release year.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Movie is \"chennai express\", released in 2013.\n2. Row 1: \"ek tha tiger\" - 2012\n3. Row 2: \"3 idiots\" - 2009\n4. Row 3: \"yeh jawaani hai deewani\" - 2013\n5. Row 4: \"dabangg 2\" - 2012\n6. Row 5: \"bodyguard\" - 2011\n7. Row 6: \"dabangg\" - 2010\n8. Row 7: \"rowdy rathore\" - 2012\n9. Row 8: \"agneepath\" - 2012\n10. Row 9: \"ready\" - 2011\n\nFrom this, I can see that \"agneepath\" is listed in row 8 with a release year of 2012. Now, the claim says it was released first in 2010. But according to the table, \"dabangg\" (row 6) was released in 2010, which comes before \"agneepath\" in 2012.\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether \"agneepath\" was released first in 2010. Since \"agneepath\" wasn't released until 2012, and it's not the first movie released in that year (as per the table), the claim seems incorrect.\n\nSo, checking for both the movie name and the release year, the only row where \"agneepath\" is present is row 8 with a release year of 2012. Therefore, the statement claims it was released in 2010, which doesn't match the table data. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The relevant columns are \"movie\" and \"year\". For row 8, both these columns have values that are important: \"agneepath\" under movie and 2012 under year. These cells directly show that \"agneepath\" wasn't released in 2010.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are row 8, column \"movie\" and row 8, column \"year\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"movie\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
