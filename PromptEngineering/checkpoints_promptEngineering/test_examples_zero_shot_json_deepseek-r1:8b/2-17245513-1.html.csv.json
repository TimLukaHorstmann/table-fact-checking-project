    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"t7 be the place of Peter Oosterhuis , who win 7500\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It has two parts: \n1. That the place is t7 for Peter Oosterhuis.\n2. That Peter Oosterhuis won 7500.\n\nI'll need to check both parts against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a player with their details. The columns are: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. \n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Does Peter Oosterhuis have t7 as his place? I'll scan through the data rows for \"Peter Oosterhuis\". \n\nRow 0: t1, John Mahaffey.\nRow 1: t1, John Mahaffey again.\nRow 2: t3, Frank Beard.\nRow 3: t3, Ben Crenshaw.\nRow 4: t3, Hale Irwin.\nRow 5: t3, Bob Murphy.\nRow 6: t7, Jack Nicklaus.\nRow 7: t7, Peter Oosterhuis. Ah, here we go. So in row index 7 (which is the eighth row overall), Peter Oosterhuis's place is t7.\n\nSo that part of the claim checks out. Now, the second part: did Peter Oosterhuis win 7500? Looking at the \"money\" column for his row. In row 7, under \"money\", it's listed as 7500. So yes, he won 7500.\n\nPutting both parts together: The place is t7 and he won 7500, so the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For the place (t7), it's in column \"place\" of row index 7. For the money, it's in column \"money\" of row index 7.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include both these columns from row 7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis , who have 10875.\" Hmm, let's break this down. I think it's saying two things: first, that Peter Oosterhuis is playing at t7 (which refers to his position or tier), and second, that he has a score of 10,875. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details like their place (\"t1\", \"t3\", etc.), player name, country, score, to par, and money. So I need to find Peter Oosterhuis in this table.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. The first few rows are t1 with different players, then t3, t7, t9. Wait, looking at the data:\n\nRow 0: place is t1, player is Lou Graham... nope.\nRow 1: t1, John Mahaffey... not him.\nRows 2-5: t3, four different players with same score and money... none are Peter Oosterhuis.\nRow 6: t7, player is Jack Nicklaus. Not Peter.\nRow 7: place is t7, player is Peter Oosterhuis from England. His score is \"69 +73 +72 +75=289\", to par \"+5\", and money is \"7500.\" So that's one relevant cell.\n\nWait, the claim says he has 10875. But in row 7, his money column is 7500. So that doesn't match. Also, the place is t7, which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nSo the score part is wrong because it's 7500, not 10875. Therefore, the claim is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE. But let me double-check if there's another Peter Oosterhuis in the table. The last rows are t9, with different players, none named Peter.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be row_index 7 (since it's zero-based), and columns place and money because we need to check both parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
