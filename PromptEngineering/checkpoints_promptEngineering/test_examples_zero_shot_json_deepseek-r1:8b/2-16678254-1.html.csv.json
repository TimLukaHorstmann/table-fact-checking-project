    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949 have a w result with a score of 65 - 20\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. It's in JSON format with columns: week, date, opponent, result, and record. The data rows contain specific information for each week.\n\nThe claim mentions \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949\". So I need to find the corresponding row in the table where week is 8 and the date is November 13, 1949. Let me go through each row:\n\nLooking at row by row:\n- Week 1: September 26\n- Week 2: October 2\n- Week 3: October 8\n- Week 4: October 16\n- Week 5: October 23\n- Week 6: October 30\n- Week 7: November 6\n- Week 8: November 13\n\nAh, here's week 8 with the date November 13, 1949. That's the row I need to check.\n\nNow, checking the result column for this week. The entry is \"w 65 - 20\". So that seems to match the claim which states a \"w\" result and a score of 65-20.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the record column: it shows \"4 - 4\". Since the claim doesn't mention anything about the record, I don't need to consider this part beyond verifying the week and date.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is about week 8 on November 13 having a win (W) with the score 65-20. The table supports this exactly at row index 7, under the \"result\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim.\n\nThe claim is: \"there be a result of w 65 - 20 after week 9 on november 13 , 1949.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions three specific pieces of information:\n\n1. The result should be \"w 65 - 20\".\n2. This result should occur after week 9.\n3. The date is November 13, 1949.\n\nI'll need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and record. Each row represents a specific game with details filled in those columns.\n\nLet me go through each relevant column:\n\n- **Week**: The claim specifies week 9.\n- **Date**: November 13, 1949.\n- **Result**: \"w 65 - 20\".\n\nI need to find the row where week is 9 and date is November 13, 1949. Then check if the result matches.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Week 8: November 13, 1949 vs. New York Bulldogs. Result is \"w 65 - 20\". So that's week 8, not week 9.\n2. Next, looking for week 9 and date November 13: In the table, week 9 corresponds to November 27, 1949 (as per row 9). Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the data array:\n\n- Row 0: Week 1\n- ...\n- Row 8: Week 9? Let me count. The first entry is week 1 as index 0 or 1?\n\nWait, looking at the table's data:\n\nEach sub-array represents a game. The first element of each sub-array is the week number.\n\nSo row 0: week 1\n\nrow 1: week 2\n\n...\n\nrow 8: week 9 (since it's the 9th index if starting from 0, but wait, let me count properly.\n\nWait, no. Let's list out the weeks:\n\n- The first sub-array is for week 1.\n- The second for week 2.\n- So each row in data corresponds to week number equal to its position in the array plus 1? Wait, no: looking at the first entry, it's week 1 as per \"week\":1.\n\nSo row index 0 is week 1, row 8 would be week 9 (since 0-based), but let me check each row:\n\nRow 8 has week 9. So:\n\n- Row 8: Week 9\n  - Date: November 20, 1949 (as per the data: \"november 20 , 1949\")\nWait, no, looking at row 8's date:\n\nLooking back:\n\nData array:\n\n[\n  [1, \"september 26 , 1949\", ...],\n  ...\n  [8, \"november 13 , 1949\", ...], --> week 8\n  [9, \"november 20 , 1949\", ...], --> week 9\n  ...\n]\n\nWait no: Each sub-array is a game. The first element is the week number.\n\nSo row 0: week 1\n\nrow 1: week 2\n\n...\n\nrow 8: week 9? Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the data array as given:\n\nThe 9th entry (index 8) is:\n\n[\n  9,\n  \"november 20 , 1949\",\n  \"los angeles rams\",\n  \"t 28 - 28\",\n  \"4 - 4 - 1\"\n]\n\nWait, that's week 9 on November 20, not November 13.\n\nWait, but the claim says November 13, which is in row 8: [8, \"november 13 , 1949\", ...], opponent New York Bulldogs, result w65-20. So that's week 8.\n\nSo the claim is looking for a game after week 9 on Nov 13, but according to the table, week 8 is Nov 13, and week 9 is Nov 20.\n\nTherefore, there's no game in week 9 on November 13. That already suggests something is wrong.\n\nMoreover, the result \"w 65 - 20\" occurs in week 8 (row 8), not week 9.\n\nSo the claim mentions week 9 and November 13, but the table shows that on November 13, it's week 8, and the result for week 9 is a different game on November 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because:\n\n- There's no game in week 9 on November 13.\n- The result \"w65-20\" occurs in week 8, not week 9.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE. But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the columns correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to a game where the result was w65-20 occurring after week 9 on Nov 13? That doesn't make sense because that date is earlier than week 9 (if week 9 is in November). Wait, no: November 13 is earlier than November 20. So week 9 would be later.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is mistaking the week number or the date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the columns.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nEach row has:\n\n- week (integer)\n- date (string)\n- opponent\n- result (string like \"w 65 -20\")\n- record\n\nSo for the claim: Is there a result of \"w 65 -20\" after week 9 on November 13, 1949?\n\nLooking at the table, on November 13, 1949, which is row 8, the result is indeed w65-20. That's in week 8.\n\nSo, in week 9 (row 9), the date is November 20, and the result is \"t28-28\".\n\nThus, there is no game on November 13, 1949, after week 9; that's a contradiction because November 13 comes before November 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. There's no such game in the table where both the date is November 13, 1949, and it's after week 9.\n\nMoreover, even if we consider the same date for week 8, which is earlier than week 9, but then the result is already there, so it's not \"after\" week 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the final answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether a game with specific characteristics exists in the provided data. \n\n1. **Identify Key Details from the Claim:**\n   - **Result:** The game must have the result \"w65-20\".\n   - **Date:** November 13, 1949.\n   - **Week:** After week 9.\n\n2. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - **Week Structure:** Each row in the data array represents a week starting from week 1 as per the first entry (row 0).\n   - **Date and Week Matching:** \n     - The game with result \"w65-20\" occurs on November 13, which corresponds to **week 8** (not week 9).\n     - The next game after week 8 is week 9, occurring on November 20.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no game in the data that satisfies all three criteria simultaneously.\n   - The claim is incorrect because:\n     - Week 9 is later than November 13.\n     - The \"w65-20\" result occurs earlier (week 8) and on an earlier date.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",
