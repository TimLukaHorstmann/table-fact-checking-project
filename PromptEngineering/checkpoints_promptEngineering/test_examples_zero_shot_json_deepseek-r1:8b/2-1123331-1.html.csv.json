    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"hydraulics , drive by damon hill , have a grid number bigger than 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim means. It mentions three things: hydraulics, drive by Damon Hill, and grid number bigger than 1. So, there are two parts to verify here.\n\nStarting with \"hydraulics,\" this seems to refer to an issue or problem that a driver encountered during their race. Looking at the table, the column for \"time / retired\" sometimes has entries like \"+ x laps\" which indicates something went wrong, but other times it's specific issues like \"suspension,\" \"engine,\" etc. So, \"hydraulics\" is likely an entry in the \"time / retired\" column.\n\nNext, \"drive by Damon Hill.\" In the table, each row represents a driver, and the first cell is their name. I need to find which row has \"Damon Hill\" as the driver. Scanning through the list: there's a row where the driver is \"damon hill,\" with \"jordan - mugen - honda\" as the constructor, 19 laps, \"hydraulics\" as the issue, and grid number 7.\n\nNow, the claim also says that this specific instance of hydraulics (from Damon Hill) has a grid number bigger than 1. The grid column indicates the starting position in the race. Looking at Damon Hill's row, the grid is 7, which is indeed bigger than 1.\n\nSo, I need to check two cells: one for \"hydraulics\" and another for \"grid.\" But wait, actually, the claim connects these three elements together: hydraulics, drive by Damon Hill, and grid number >1. So each part must be true.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that there might be multiple entries for \"hydraulics,\" but in this case, only one driver (Damon Hill) had \"hydraulics\" as their issue. His grid position is 7, so yes, it's bigger than 1.\n\nI should also ensure that I'm checking the correct columns and rows. The relevant cells are in the \"time / retired\" column for hydraulics and the \"grid\" column for Damon Hill's starting position.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
