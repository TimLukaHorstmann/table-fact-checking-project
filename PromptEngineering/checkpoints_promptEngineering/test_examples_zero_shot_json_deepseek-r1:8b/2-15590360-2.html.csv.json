    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: class, season, race, podiums, and pole. The data has several rows, each corresponding to different classes like \"125 cc\", \"250 cc\", etc., along with some totals.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the moto2 class having 0 poles. So I need to check if any of the rows for the moto2 class have a pole count of zero.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row where \"class\" is \"moto2\". The data in that row is: [\"moto2\", \"2010 -\", 62, 4, 0]. Here, the column we're interested in is \"pole,\" which has a value of 0.\n\nSo, the moto2 class does have a pole count of zero. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows that might affect this. The total row says the total poles from 2002 to present is 135, and for moto2 it's 11. But that doesn't negate the fact that in the specific moto2 class, the pole count is zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class,\" we look at the relevant row and column in the table. The \"moto2\" class has a pole value of 0, which supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is true or false based on the given table. First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and then check it against the data provided.\n\nThe table has columns: class, season, race, podiums, pole. The data rows include various classes like 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and total. Each row seems to represent different categories or classifications with corresponding values in each column.\n\nNow, the claim is about \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" So, I need to parse this: it's saying that there are four instances where 'pole' equals 'moto2.' Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. It says \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" Hmm, maybe it means that in the data, when looking at the 'pole' column, four rows show 'moto2' as their class.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I don't see a 'pole' value of 4. Let me check each row:\n\n- First row: pole is 0\n- Second row: pole is 0\n- Third row: pole is 0\n- Fourth row: pole is 0\n- Fifth row: pole is 0\n\nWait, that's confusing. None of the rows have a 'pole' value greater than zero except perhaps in the 'total'? No, the fifth row's class is \"total,\" not a specific class.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for where the 'pole' column has the value corresponding to four, maybe I need to see if any row in the 'race' or other columns equals 4? Or perhaps it's about how many times 'moto2' appears in the 'class' column with a certain condition.\n\nWait, the claim says \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" So perhaps it's saying that four entries in the 'pole' column are associated with the 'moto2' class. But looking at the table:\n\nEach row's 'class' is either 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, or total. The 'pole' column has values like 0, 65, 7, etc., which I think might represent race wins or podiums.\n\nWait, maybe \"4 pole\" refers to four races where the class was moto2? Or perhaps it's a misinterpretation of the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that in the 'pole' column, there are four entries where the corresponding 'class' is moto2. But looking at each row:\n\n- 125 cc: pole 0\n- 250 cc: pole 65\n- motogp: pole 7\n- moto2: pole 62\n- total: pole 135\n\nWait, no, that's not right because the 'pole' column is just numerical values. So perhaps \"4 pole\" refers to four instances where the class was moto2 and the pole value is something specific.\n\nBut wait, in the data, only the fourth row has the class as moto2, with a pole of 62. The other rows have different classes. So if the claim is that there are four times when the class is moto2 and the pole value is 4, but looking at each row, none of them have a 'pole' value that's 4 except maybe the third row has 7.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe the claim is misinterpreted. It says \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" Perhaps it means that in four instances, the 'class' was motogp, and their 'pole' value was 4? But looking at the table, there's only one row for motogp with a pole of 7.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each column represents. The columns are:\n\n- class: the type of class (125 cc, etc.)\n- season: the years\n- race: perhaps the number of races or something else?\n- podiums: maybe the number of podium finishes?\n- pole: likely the number of pole positions.\n\nWait, but in the table, the 'race' column has values like 1,65,7,62,135. So 'race' might be a misnomer; perhaps it's actually something else, like the number of wins or points. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThe claim is about \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" So maybe it's saying that four times in the 'pole' column, the value was associated with the 'moto2' class. But looking at each row:\n\n- 125 cc: pole 0\n- 250 cc: pole 65 (but this is for 2002-2008)\n- motogp: pole 7\n- moto2: pole 62\n- total: pole 135\n\nWait, none of these 'pole' values are 4. So if the claim is that there are four instances where 'moto2' class had a pole value of 4, but in reality, only one row has 'moto2' as its class and the pole is 62. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about how many times 'moto2' appears in the table. Looking at the 'class' column:\n\n- 125 cc\n- 250 cc\n- motogp\n- moto2\n- total\n\nSo 'moto2' appears once. So if the claim is that four poles have a moto2 class, but there's only one row where class is moto2 and pole is 62, then it's false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"4 pole\" refers to four instances across all classes where the class was motogp, and their pole value was 4? But in the table, I don't see any 'pole' value of 4 except maybe none.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is miswritten, and it's actually about four races where the moto2 class had a pole. But again, looking at the data, only one row has 'moto2' as its class with a pole of 62. So there's no way to have four instances here.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the table doesn't show any 'pole' value that matches the number four for the moto2 class.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is true, we need to check the relevant cells in the table. The 'pole' column contains values like 0,65,7,62,135. None of these values correspond to four (4). Additionally, there's only one row where the class is 'moto2', and its pole value is 62.\n\nSince there are no instances where the pole equals 4 for the moto2 class, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
