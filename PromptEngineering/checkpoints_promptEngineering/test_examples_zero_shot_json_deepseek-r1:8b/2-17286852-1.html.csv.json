The claim says, \"in stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style.\" So, I need to check if there's a bridge in Stanley that's a concrete deck girder.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has columns: name, listed, location, county, type. Each row represents a different bridge with its details.\n\nI'll search for entries where the location is \"Stanley.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Looking at row 8: name is \"great northern railway underpass,\" location is \"stanley,\" county is \"mountrail,\" and type is \"concrete deck girder bridge.\" That seems relevant because it's in Stanley and has the type mentioned.\n\nOther rows with \"Stanley\": I don't see any others. Most of them are either other bridges or possibly duplicates, but row 8 is definitely in Stanley with the deck girder type.\n\nSo, there's at least one bridge in Stanley that's a concrete deck girder. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The type is listed as \"pratt through truss.\" That matches the claim's description of it being a Pratt through truss bridge.\n\nSo, both the name and type in the table support the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the westgaard bridge be in the style of a pratt pony through truss bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, I should look up the westgaard bridge in the table provided. Since the claim mentions the westgaard bridge specifically, my first step is to find its details in the data. The table has a column called \"name,\" so I can go through each row until I find where name equals \"westgaard bridge.\"\n\nLooking at the data, there's an entry with name: \"westgaard bridge,\" which is located in row 26 (since it starts from index 0). Now, I need to check other relevant columns for this bridge. The claim is about the style or type of the bridge.\n\nThe \"type\" column seems important here. So, I should look at what's listed under the type for the westgaard bridge. From the table data, the type for westgaard bridge is \"pratt pony through truss.\" That matches exactly with the claim which states it's a \"pratt pony through truss bridge.\"\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything else. The claim doesn't mention any other attributes besides the style or type, so as long as the type is correct, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nAlso, are there any other columns that might affect this? Like \"listed\" or \"location.\" But those don't pertain to the structural style of the bridge. So, it's safe to focus only on the type column.\n\nAdditionally, I can confirm that in the westgaard bridge row (row 26), the type is indeed \"pratt pony through truss,\" which aligns perfectly with the claim. There are no conflicting or other types listed for this bridge.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the claim should be considered TRUE because the westgaard bridge is explicitly categorized as a pratt pony through truss bridge in the provided table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"type\" column of the westgaard bridge in the table. The type matches the claim's description.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that in Cooperstown, there's a bridge of the type \"pratt through truss.\" So I need to check if any of the bridges listed under Cooperstown are of that specific type.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: name, listed (date), location, county, and type. The data is in rows where each row represents a bridge with its details.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries related to Cooperstown. Scanning through the 'location' column:\n\n- The first few rows have locations like finley, caldonia, cedar creek, etc.\u2014none are cooperstown.\n- Further down, I see a row with \"romness bridge\" located in \"cooperstown.\" That's relevant because it mentions Cooperstown as the location.\n\nNow, looking at this specific row for the romness bridge: its details include name, date, location (cooperstown), county (griggs), and type (pratt through truss). So yes, the romness bridge in Cooperstown is a pratt through truss type.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other Cooperstown entry. Let me scan again: after romness bridge, the next entries are Blanchard, Goose River, Liberty Memorial, Porter Elliott, Portland Park, Rainbow Arch\u2014all with different locations, none mentioning Cooperstown except romness bridge.\n\nSo, only one bridge in Cooperstown is listed, and it's a pratt through truss. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any bridges that were removed or have special notes, as some rows mention removal dates. For example, Blanchard bridge was removed in 2009, Goose River similarly, Liberty Memorial and Porter Elliott as well. But none of these are Cooperstown; they're all other locations.\n\nThe romness bridge doesn't mention being removed, so it's still present as a pratt through truss bridge in Cooperstown. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that the Nesheim Bridge is located in McVille. So, my task is to check if this information matches any row in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns of the table. The relevant columns are \"name,\" \"location,\" and maybe others, but specifically for this claim, \"name\" and \"location\" will be important because we're checking both the bridge's name and where it's located.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the data to find any that mention Nesheim Bridge. \n\nLooking at the first rows, I see bridges like Beaver Creek Bridge, Caledonia Bridge, Cedar Creek Bridge, etc., but none of these are Nesheim Bridge. Then, as I go down the list, I come across a row where \"name\" is \"nesheim bridge\". Let me check that specific row.\n\nIn row 18 (since indexing starts at 0), we have:\n- name: nesheim bridge\n- listed: 1997 - 02 - 27\n- location: mcville\n- county: nelson\n- type: pratt through truss\n\nSo, the \"location\" column here is \"mcville,\" which matches what the claim says.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if there's another Nesheim Bridge elsewhere. Scanning through all the rows again, I don't see any other bridges named Nesheim. So, this seems to be the only occurrence of Nesheim Bridge in McVille.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there is a Nesheim Bridge located in McVille according to the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as the Nesheim Bridge is listed with its location in McVille. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I'll break down the components of the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: \"Cooper town\" and the \"Blanchard bridge.\" So, I should check both parts in the table.\n\nStarting with \"Cooper town,\" looking at the 'name' column, I see entries like \"Romness bridge\" and others. Wait, Cooperstown is listed as one of the locations under the Romness bridge. That's a bit confusing because Cooperstown might be a different place from Cooper town. Maybe there's a typo or two places named similarly? I need to look carefully.\n\nNext, the Blanchard bridge. Checking the 'name' column, I find that entry 35 is \"Blanchard bridge.\" The location for this bridge is Blanchard and Traill counties. So, the Blanchard bridge exists in the table.\n\nNow, considering the claim says \"Cooper town\" is famous for the Blanchard bridge. However, looking at the table, Cooperstown (not Cooper town) is associated with the Romness bridge, not the Blanchard bridge. There's no entry for a Blanchard bridge located in or related to Cooper town. The Blanchard bridge is in Blanchard and Traill counties, which are different from Cooper county.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to mix up the locations.

The claim is: \"mcville have goose river bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's saying. It mentions \"mcville\" having a \"goose river bridge\" that is currently under construction because of a structural issue.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different bridge with various attributes. The columns are: name, listed, location, county, and type. So, I'll need to find any bridges related to mcville and goose river.\n\nStarting with \"mcville,\" I'll scan through the 'location' column for that term. Skimming down the list... Yes, there's a bridge at row 20 where the location is \"mcville.\" The name of that bridge is \"nesheim bridge,\" which seems unrelated to goose river. So, maybe mcville doesn't have a goose river bridge yet.\n\nNext, looking for \"goose river bridge\" in the 'name' column. Scanning through each row... At row 18, there's a bridge named \"goose river bridge.\" Its location is listed as \"hillsboro,\" so it's not in mcville. However, I also see that this bridge was removed on March 25, 2009, due to structural issues.\n\nWait, the claim says that goose river bridge in mcville is under construction for structural reasons. But from the table, mcville's bridge (nesheim) is a different one, and the goose river bridge is in hillsboro and was removed. There might be confusion here: maybe the user meant that the goose river bridge in hillsboro was removed because of issues, not that there's another one in mcville.\n\nSo, checking if mcville has a goose river bridge, it seems they don't; instead, the goose river bridge is in hillsboro. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect or based on a misunderstanding.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the user mixed up the location of the goose river bridge. But according to the table, it's definitely under \"hillsboro.\" So, mcville doesn't have that bridge, which is in another county.\n\nMoreover, the claim states that the bridge is currently under construction. However, looking at the 'listed' dates and removal dates, the goose river bridge was removed in 2009, so it's not under construction anymore\u2014it's gone. Therefore, the claim about mcville having such a bridge doesn't hold up because either the location or the current status is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, there's no evidence in the table that mcville has a goose river bridge currently under construction for structural reasons. The goose river bridge is listed as removed and located in hillsboro, not mcville.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"removed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the westgaard bridge be a pratt pony through truss bridge in traill county.\" So, I'm looking for information about the westgaard bridge that includes both its type and location.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are name, listed, location, county, and type.

Row 0: beaver creek bridge \u2013 no.\n2. Row 1: caldonia bridge \u2013 no.\n3. Row 2: cedar creek bridge \u2013 no.\n4. Row 3: colton's crossing bridge \u2013 no.\n5.

Row 24: westgaard bridge \u2013 yes, this is the row we're interested in.\n\nNow that I've found the westgaard bridge at row 24, let's look at the relevant columns: type and county. The claim mentions two things: the type of bridge and the county it's in.\n\nLooking at the type column for row 24, it says \"pratt pony through truss.\" That matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, the county column for this row is \"mchenry.\" However, the claim specifies that the bridge should be in \"traill county.\" There's a discrepancy here: mchenry vs. traill.\n\nWait, did I read that correctly?

That means one part of the claim is incorrect\u2014the county.\n\nBut does the claim specifically state the county as \"traill\"? Yes, it says \"in traill county.\" Since the actual county is mchenry, this part doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the county information.\n\nHowever, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The type is correct, but the location isn't. So even though the type matches, the county doesn't. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait a second\u2014maybe the bridge was moved or renamed? Let me check other notes in the table. Looking at row 24: \"westgaard bridge\" has \"row_index\": 24 and columns filled as:\n\n- name: westgaard bridge\n- listed: presumably the date it was listed?\n- location: voltaire\n- county: mchenry\n- type: pratt pony through truss\n\nNo, there's no mention of removal or relocation. So the current data says it's in mchenry county.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states the bridge is in traill county when according to the table, it's actually in mchenry county.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the westgaard bridge being a pratt pony through truss bridge in traill county is incorrect.
