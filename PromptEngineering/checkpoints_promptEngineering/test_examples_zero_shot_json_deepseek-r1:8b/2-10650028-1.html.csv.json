    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"frank conover be the third defensive tackle to get draft\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the data.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are player, position, round, overall, and college. The data rows contain information about each player.\n\nThe claim mentions \"frank conover,\" so I should locate his row in the table. Scanning through the data, I find Frank Conover in row 8 (row_index: 8). His position is listed as \"defensive tackle.\"\n\nNow, I need to check if he's the third defensive tackle selected in the draft. To do this, I'll go through each row and identify which players have the position \"defensive tackle.\" \n\nLooking at the data:\n- Row 0: Eric Turner - Defensive Back (not tackles)\n- Row 2: James Jones - Defensive Tackle (row_index: 2)\n- Row 3: Pio Sagapolutele - Defensive Tackle (row_index: 3)\n- Row 5: Frank Conover - Defensive Tackle (row_index: 8)\n- Row 6: Raymond Irvin - Defensive Back\n- Row 10: Todd Jones - Offensive Tackle\n- Row 11: Elijah Austin - Defensive Tackle (row_index: 11)\n\nSo, the defensive tackles are in rows 2, 3, 5, and 11. That means the third defensive tackle to be drafted is Frank Conover, as he's the fourth one but the third when considering their order.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The first defensive tackle would be James Jones (row 2), second Pio Sagapolutele (row 3), third Frank Conover (row 5). So yes, Frank Conover is the third in the drafting order among defensive tackles. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each player's position and identified Frank Conover as the third defensive tackle selected.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"raymond irvin be the second defensive back to get draft.\" Hmm, wait, actually, it says \"get draft\" but I think that's a typo; probably meant \"get drafted.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has several columns: player, position, round, overall, and college. Each row represents a different player with their draft details.\n\nSo, to check the claim about Raymond Irvin, I need to find his entry in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Eric Turner - Defensive Back, Round 1, Overall 2, College UCLA.\n2. Ed King - Guard, Round 2, Overall 29, Auburn.\n3. James Jones - Defensive Tackle, Round 3, Overall 57, Northern Iowa.\n4. Pio Sagapolutele - Defensive Tackle, Round 4, Overall 85, San Diego State.\n5. Michael Jackson - Wide Receiver, Round 6, Overall 141, Southern Mississippi.\n6. Frank Conover - Defensive Tackle, Round 8, Overall 197, Syracuse.\n7. Raymond Irvin - Defensive Back, Round 9, Overall 225, Central Florida.\n8. Shawn Wiggins - Wide Receiver, Round 9, Overall 239, Wyoming.\n9. Brian Greenfield - Punter, Round 10, Overall 252, Pittsburgh.\n10. Todd Jones - Offensive Tackle, Round 11, Overall 280, Henderson State.\n11. Elijah Austin - Defensive Tackle, Round 12, Overall 308, North Carolina State.\n\nOkay, Raymond Irvin is in row index 6 (wait, no, looking back, the rows are numbered from 0 to 10 because there are 11 players). Wait, let me count again. The data array has 11 elements, so row indices are 0-10.\n\nLooking at each player's position:\n\nRaymond Irvin is in row index 6? No, wait: the first entry is Eric Turner (row 0), then Ed King (1), James Jones (2), Pio Sagapolutele (3), Michael Jackson (4), Frank Conover (5), Raymond Irvin (6), Shawn Wiggins (7), Brian Greenfield (8), Todd Jones (9), Elijah Austin (10). Yes, so Raymond is in row 6.\n\nHis position is Defensive Back. The claim says he's the second defensive back to get drafted. So I need to check how many players before him are also defensive backs or defensive tackles?\n\nWait, looking at the positions:\n\nEric Turner - Defensive Back (row 0)\nRaymond Irvin - Defensive Back (row 6)\n\nSo, Eric Turner is a Defensive Back and was picked in Round 1, Overall 2. Then Raymond Irvin is another Defensive Back, picked in Round 9, Overall 225.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the second defensive back to get drafted.\" So if there's one before him who is also a defensive back, then he would be the second. Eric Turner is row 0, so he's the first defensive back, and Raymond Irvin is the second. Therefore, the claim seems to say that Raymond is the second defensive back, which matches.\n\nBut wait, let me check all players up to his point in the draft order. So, in Round 9, overall pick 225, Raymond Irvin is selected as a Defensive Back. Before him, Eric Turner (Round 1, Overall 2) was also a Defensive Back. Any others?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nPlayers before Raymond in terms of overall picks: let's see.\n\nOverall picks go from 1 to 308, but I think the rounds and overall are separate; each pick is round and then overall number within that round.\n\nBut for the purpose of being drafted, the order matters. So Eric Turner was picked earlier than Raymond Irvin.\n\nWait, no, actually, the draft order isn't necessarily in the table's row order because the rows might represent different rounds or positions. But in this case, each row is a separate player, so the first player (row 0) is the highest pick: Round 1, Overall 2.\n\nThen Raymond Irvin is picked later, Round 9, Overall 225. So in the actual draft, Eric Turner was taken before Raymond. So Raymond would be the second Defensive Back after Eric.\n\nBut wait, are there any other Defensive Backs before Raymond? Let's check each player:\n\n- Row 0: Eric Turner - DB\n- Row 1: Ed King - Guard (no)\n- Row 2: James Jones - DT (defensive tackle)\n- Row 3: Pio Sagapolutele - DT\n- Row 4: Michael Jackson - WR\n- Row 5: Frank Conover - DT\n- Row 6: Raymond Irvin - DB\n\nSo before Raymond, only Eric Turner is a Defensive Back. So that makes Raymond the second Defensive Back to be drafted.\n\nBut wait, is there any player between row 0 and row 6 who is a defensive back? No, because after Eric Turner (row 0), the next players are non-DBs until Raymond in row 6.\n\nTherefore, Raymond Irvin is indeed the second Defensive Back to get drafted. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns that matter here are \"player\" and \"position\", specifically for Raymond Irvin.\n\nSo the player is \"raymond irvin\" in row 6, column \"player\". Also, his position is \"defensive back\" in column \"position\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For row 6 (Raymond's row), both \"player\" and \"position\".\n- Plus any other cells that might be relevant. Wait, the claim only mentions being the second Defensive Back, so maybe just his own position is enough? Or do we need to compare with others?\n\nI think the answer expects the specific cells related to Raymond Irvin's draft info. So for his row, \"player\" and \"position\", as well as perhaps round or overall, but the claim doesn't mention those.\n\nWait, no, the relevant_cells should be all columns that are checked. Since we need to verify if he is a defensive back, and how many have been before him, but since it's about him being the second, maybe just his own row's player and position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps also check previous players in the data array to see if any other Defensive Backs are there, but I think for this task, we just need to point out Raymond Irvin's specific cells.\n\nSo in the JSON, the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"player\"}, because it's raymond irvin\n- {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"position\"}, since his position is defensive back\n\nTherefore, those two cells are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Raymond Irvin is the second Defensive Back to be drafted is TRUE. The relevant data points confirming this are his position and his name in their respective columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Raymond Irvin, being the player named 'raymond irvin' in row 6 and having the position 'defensive back', is indeed the second Defensive Back to be drafted after Eric Turner. The relevant data points confirming this are his name ('player') and his position ('position').\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"elijah austin be the last defensive tackle to get draft\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, breaking down the claim: It's about Elijah Austin being the last player selected as a defensive tackle in the draft. So I need to find out which row corresponds to Elijah Austin and check his position and overall draft pick number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has data for \"player\", \"position\", \"round\", \"overall\", and \"college\". The columns are \"player\", \"position\", \"round\", \"overall\", \"college\".\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to find Elijah Austin. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. First row: player is Eric Turner, position is Defensive Back. Not Elijah.\n2. Second row: Ed King, Guard. No.\n3. Third row: James Jones, Defensive Tackle. Not the one we're looking for.\n4. Fourth row: Pio Sagapolutele, Defensive Tackle. Still not Elijah.\n5. Fifth row: Michael Jackson, Wide Receiver. Nope.\n6. Sixth row: Frank Conover, Defensive Tackle. Not Elijah.\n7. Seventh row: Raymond Irvin, Defensive Back. Not him.\n8. Eighth row: Shawn Wiggins, Wide Receiver. No match.\n9. Ninth row: Brian Greenfield, Punter. Doesn't fit.\n10. Tenth row: Todd Jones, Offensive Tackle. Different position.\n11. Eleventh row: Elijah Austin, Defensive Tackle. Here we go.\n\nSo, Elijah Austin is in the 12th row (since it's zero-indexed as 11), position is Defensive Tackle, round is 3, overall draft pick number 308, and his college is North Carolina State.\n\nNow, to verify the claim: whether he was the last defensive tackle to be drafted. So I need to check if any other players after him in the table are also defensive tackles. If there's another one with a higher (later) row index, then he wouldn't be the last.\n\nLooking at the rows after Elijah:\n\n- 12th row: He is the 11th index row. The next ones:\n   - 12th row (index 12): player is Elijah Austin.\n   - Wait, no, wait\u2014the table has 11 data rows, so row indices go from 0 to 10, right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the data array has 11 elements, each representing a row. So the last row is at index 10. Therefore, Elijah Austin is in row 11? Wait no\u2014let's count:\n\nWait, the columns are declared first, then the data is an array of 11 arrays. So the rows go from 0 to 10.\n\nLooking again: Elijah Austin is in the 12th position when counting, but since it's zero-indexed, that would be index 11? Wait no\u2014wait, let me recount:\n\nThe data array has 11 elements, so indices 0-10. So row 10 is the last one.\n\nWait, looking at the table provided, the user included 11 entries in the data array. So rows are from 0 to 10. Therefore, Elijah Austin is in the 12th position? No, wait: counting each row:\n\nRow 0: Eric Turner\nRow 1: Ed King\n...\nRow 10: Elijah Austin.\n\nWait no, looking at the last entry: It's [\n  \"elijah austin\",\n  ...\n], so that would be index 10. So the rows are from 0 to 10, making 11 rows in total.\n\nSo Elijah is at row index 10.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other defensive tackles come after him (i.e., have higher row indices). But since he's the last one, there can't be any others after him. Therefore, he would be the last defensive tackle drafted.\n\nWait, but looking through the table:\n\nLooking at each player's position:\n\n- Eric Turner: DB\n- Ed King: Guard\n- James Jones: DT\n- Pio Sagapolutele: DT\n- Michael Jackson: WR\n- Frank Conover: DT\n- Raymond Irvin: DB\n- Shawn Wiggins: WR\n- Brian Greenfield: Punter\n- Todd Jones: OT\n- Elijah Austin: DT\n\nSo the defensive tackles are at row indices 2 (James), 3 (Pio), 5 (Frank), and 10 (Elijah). So among these, Elijah is the last one in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"elijah austin be the last defensive tackle to get draft\" is TRUE because he's the last DT in the list. \n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other defensive tackles after him. Since the table ends at row 10, and Elijah is at row 10, there are no players after him. So yes, he's the last one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Elijah Austin is the last player in the table with the position of defensive tackle.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Frank Conover's overall draft position being 56 higher than Michael Jackson is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the data structure of the table. The columns are player, position, round, overall, and college. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two players: Frank Conover and Michael Jackson. I need to find their corresponding rows in the data array.\n\nStarting with Michael Jackson: I'll search through each row until I find his name. Looking at the list, Michael Jackson is in the 5th row (index 4 if starting from 0). In that row, his overall draft position is 141.\n\nNext, Frank Conover is mentioned as well. Scanning the rows, Frank Conover is in the 7th row (index 6). His overall draft position is listed as 197.\n\nThe claim states that Frank's overall position is 56 higher than Michael's. To check this, I'll subtract Michael's overall from Frank's: 197 - 141 = 56. That seems correct mathematically.\n\nWait, but sometimes in drafting, the \"overall\" can be a bit tricky because it might refer to their pick slot within the round. For example, if a player was picked later in the round with a higher number, that could affect the total count. However, in this case, both players are in different rounds (Michael is 6th and Frank is 8th), so it's just a straightforward subtraction.\n\nSo, based on the numbers provided, Frank's overall is indeed 56 higher than Michael's. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go row by round:\n\n- Row 0: Eric Turner - DB\n- Row 1: Ed King - Guard\n- Row 2: James Jones - Defensive Tackle\n- Row 3: Pio Sagapolutele - DT\n- Row 4: Michael Jackson - Wide Receiver, round 6, overall 141\n- Row 5: Frank Conover - DT\n- Row 6: Raymond Irvin - DB\n- Row 7: Shawn Wiggins - Wide Receiver, round 9, overall 239\n- Row 8: Brian Greenfield - Punter\n- Row 9: Todd Jones - Offensive Tackle\n- Row 10: Elijah Austin - DT\n\nSo, Shawn Wiggins is in row index 7. His position is wide receiver and he was drafted in round 9, overall pick 239.\n\nNow, the claim says he's the second wide receiver to get drafted. So I need to check if there's another wide receiver before him in the table who also got drafted.\n\nLooking through each row, Michael Jackson is a wide receiver in row index 4, round 6, overall 141. That means Michael was selected before Shawn (round 6 vs. 9). Since Michael is earlier and also a wide receiver, that makes Shawn Wiggins the second wide receiver to be drafted.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE, supported by the cells at row index 7 (position: wide receiver) and row index 4 (Michael Jackson's cell).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"raymond irvin,\" so I need to find his information in the table.

His row is:\n\n[\n  \"raymond irvin\",\n  \"defensive back\",\n  9,\n  225,\n  \"central florida\"\n]\n\nWait a minute, his position is listed as \"defensive back.\" The claim says he's an offensive player, specifically the second offensive player to get drafted. That doesn't match up because defensive back isn't an offensive position.\n\nSo, this might already indicate that the claim is false. But let me check if there are any other relevant cells that could affect this. \n\nI should look for the column \"position\" and see what each player's position is. The claim is about an offensive player, so I'm interested in players whose positions are offensive roles like wide receiver, tight end, offensive tackle, etc.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Eric Turner: Defensive Back\n- Ed King: Guard (offensive)\n- James Jones: Defensive Tackle (defensive)\n- Pio Sagapolutele: Defensive Tackle\n- Michael Jackson: Wide Receiver (offensive)\n- Frank Conover: Defensive Tackle\n- Raymond Irvin: Defensive Back\n- Shawn Wiggins: Wide Receiver\n- Brian Greenfield: Punter\n- Todd Jones: Offensive Tackle\n- Elijah Austin: Defensive Tackle\n\nFrom this, the offensive positions are Guard (Ed King), Wide Receiver (Michael Jackson and Shawn Wiggins), and Offensive Tackle (Todd Jones). So, the second offensive player to get drafted would be either Michael Jackson or Shawn Wiggins, depending on their round.\n\nNow, looking at their rounds:\n\n- Ed King is 2nd round.\n- Michael Jackson is 6th round.\n- Shawn Wiggins is also 9th round.\n- Todd Jones is 11th round.\n\nWait, the order of drafting might affect who is considered \"second.\" So let me list the offensive players in order of their draft rounds:\n\n1. Ed King - Round 2\n2. Michael Jackson - Round 6\n3. Shawn Wiggins - Round 9\n4. Todd Jones - Round 11\n\nSo, the second offensive player to be drafted is Michael Jackson, not Raymond Irvin.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Frank Conover being the third offensive player to get drafted. So, my task is to check if in the provided table, Frank Conover is listed as the third offensive player selected in the draft.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: player, position, round, overall, and college. The data rows list players with their respective positions and other details.\n\nI should start by locating Frank Conover's row in the table. Scanning through each row, I find that Frank Conover is indeed one of the players. His row is at index 6 (since indexing starts from 0). Now, let's look at his position: it says \"defensive tackle.\" Hmm, but the claim refers to him as an offensive player. That's a red flag. The position listed for Frank doesn't match what's claimed in the statement.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. His position is definitely \"defensive tackle,\" so that's a defensive position. The claim mentions him being an offensive player, which already contradicts unless there's a typo or misunderstanding. But according to the table, it's defensive tackle.\n\nBut let's not stop here. Maybe I should check if any other rows have offensive positions and see their order. So, in the table, players are listed with positions like wide receiver, guard, offensive tackle, etc. Let me list out all offensive players:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Eric Turner: defensive back (defensive position)\n- Ed King: guard (offensive)\n- James Jones: defensive tackle (defensive)\n- Pio Sagapolutele: defensive tackle (defensive)\n- Michael Jackson: wide receiver (offensive)\n- Frank Conover: defensive tackle (defensive)\n- Raymond Irvin: defensive back (defensive)\n- Shawn Wiggins: wide receiver (offensive)\n- Brian Greenfield: punter (special teams, not offensive or defensive)\n- Todd Jones: offensive tackle (offensive)\n- Elijah Austin: defensive tackle (defensive)\n\nFrom this, the offensive players are Ed King (guard), Michael Jackson (wide receiver), and Todd Jones (offensive tackle). That's three offensive players. Now, their order in the draft is based on the \"round\" and \"overall\" columns.\n\nLooking at each offensive player:\n\n1. Ed King: round 2, overall 29\n2. Michael Jackson: round 6, overall 141\n3. Todd Jones: round 11, overall 280\n\nSo, their order in the draft is Ed King first (round 2), then Michael Jackson later (round 6), and Todd Jones even later (round 11). Therefore, the third offensive player to be drafted would be Todd Jones, not Frank Conover.\n\nBut wait, Frank's position is defensive tackle, which is a defensive position. The claim says he's an offensive player, so that's incorrect based on the table. Even if we consider him as defensive, among offensive players, he isn't third.\n\nSo, putting it together: the claim incorrectly states his position and also misplaces him in the order of draft picks. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because Frank Conover's position is listed as \"defensive tackle,\" not an offensive role, and he isn't the third offensive player to be drafted.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The earlier a player is picked in terms of round and overall position, the higher their Draft status.\n\nLooking at their data:\n\n- James Jones: Round 3, Overall 57\n- Pio Sagapolutele: Round 4, Overall 85\n- Frank Conover: Round 8, Overall 197\n- Elijah Austin: Round 12, Overall 308\n\nWait a minute. The claim says \"the earliest defensive tackle to get draft.\" Now, the term \"earliest\" could be interpreted in two ways: either the round number or the overall pick number. However, typically, when talking about being \"highly drafted,\" we consider both round and overall position.\n\nBut in this context, it's more likely referring to the order in which they were picked in the draft, meaning who was selected first. So, looking at the round numbers:\n\n- Round 3: James Jones\n- Round 4: Pio Sagapolutele\n- Round 8: Frank Conover\n- Round 12: Elijah Austin\n\nSo, the earliest defensive tackle in terms of round is James Jones, picked in Round 3. Next is Pio Sagapolutele in Round 4, then Frank Conover in Round 8, and lastly Elijah Austin in Round 12.\n\nWait again. Wait, no\u2014Round 1 would be earlier than Round 3, but looking at the table, there are no defensive tackles picked before Round 3 except for Eric Turner (Defensive Back) in Round 1, but he's not a tackle. So, the first defensive tackle is James Jones in Round 3.\n\nBut Elijah Austin is picked later in Round 12. So according to this, James Jones was the earliest defensive tackle selected, and Elijah Austin was much later.\n\nHowever, sometimes the term \"earliest\" can be confusing. If someone is drafted earlier in overall picks, that would also indicate being higher. Let's check their overall numbers:\n\n- James Jones: Overall 57\n- Pio Sagapolutele: Overall 85\n- Frank Conover: Overall 197\n- Elijah Austin: Overall 308\n\nAgain, James Jones has the lowest overall pick among defensive tackles at 57. So neither his round nor his overall position makes him the \"earliest\"\u2014he's actually the first in both.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Elijah Austin is the earliest defensive tackle to get drafted seems incorrect because James Jones was picked earlier in Round 3 and Overall 57. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Elijah Austin is the earliest defensive tackle to be drafted. By examining the table, we find that Elijah Austin was picked in Round 12, Overall 308. However, James Jones was selected earlier in Round 3, Overall 57. Since James Jones was picked before Elijah Austin, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Frank Conover is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that Frank Conover has an overall number that's 56 points lower than Michael Jackson. \n\nFirst, I need to locate both players in the table. Looking through the data rows, I see Frank Conover in row index 6 and Michael Jackson in row index 4. Now, I should check their \"overall\" numbers.\n\nFrank Conover's overall is 197, and Michael Jackson's overall is 141. To find the difference, I subtract Michael's number from Frank's: 197 - 141 equals 56. That means Frank's overall is exactly 56 points higher than Michael's. \n\nWait, but the claim says Frank's is 56 points lower. So that would mean if we take Frank's number and subtract Michael's, it should be negative 56 for the claim to be true. But 197 minus 141 is positive 56, so the claim isn't correct as stated. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Both players' rows have the \"overall\" column, so those two entries in their respective columns are important.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "shawn wiggins be be the first wide receiver to get draft",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"shawn wiggins be be the first wide receiver to get draft\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Shawn Wiggins being the first wide receiver to get drafted. So, my task is to check if there's any information in the provided table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: player, position, round, overall, and college. The data rows contain different players with their respective positions, draft rounds, overall picks, and colleges.\n\nI need to find Shawn Wiggins' row in the data. Let me scan through each row until I find his name.\n\nHere's the list of players:\n1. Eric Turner\n2. Ed King\n3. James Jones\n4. Pio Sagapolutele\n5. Michael Jackson\n6. Frank Conover\n7. Raymond Irvin\n8. Shawn Wiggins\n9. Brian Greenfield\n10. Todd Jones\n11. Elijah Austin\n\nFound him in row 8 (index 7 if we're starting from 0). Now, let's check his position. In the table, Shawn Wiggins is listed as a wide receiver.\n\nThe claim says he was the first wide receiver to be drafted. To verify this, I need to see if any other players before him in the data are also wide receivers.\n\nLooking at previous rows:\n- Eric Turner: Defensive Back\n- Ed King: Guard\n- James Jones: Defensive Tackle\n- Pio Sagapolutele: Defensive Tackle\n- Michael Jackson: Wide Receiver\n\nWait, Michael Jackson is a wide receiver and appears before Shawn Wiggins. That means Michael Jackson was drafted earlier than Shawn. So if the claim says Shawn is the first, that's incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check. The data seems to be ordered by draft round. Round 1 is Eric Turner (overall pick 2), then Ed King in Round 2 (pick 29), James Jones in Round 3 (57), and so on. Michael Jackson is in Round 6 with overall 141, and Shawn Wiggins is in Round 9, pick 239.\n\nSince Michael Jackson is a wide receiver drafted before Shawn, the claim that Shawn is the first wide receiver to get drafted isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim refers to Shawn Wiggins, I should look at his row and the position column to verify he's a wide receiver. So, cell at row 8, column \"position\" is relevant because it shows he's a wide receiver. Also, checking Michael Jackson's row would show that there was another wide receiver picked before him.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to list cells that are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about Shawn being the first, we need to check if any previous players were wide receivers. So, for each player before Shawn, I need to check their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's enough to just show that there was another wide receiver picked earlier, so Michael Jackson's row (row 5) and Shawn Wiggins' row (row 8). Also, checking the position of Michael Jackson to confirm he is a wide receiver. So, in terms of relevant cells, we have:\n\n- Shawn Wiggins's row: row index 7, column \"position\" (wide receiver)\n- Michael Jackson's row: row index 4, column \"position\" (wide receiver)\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both to show that there was another wide receiver picked earlier.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Michael Jackson, being a wide receiver and appearing in an earlier round than Shawn Wiggins, makes Shawn not the first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
