The relevant seasons will be those between row indices that cover the years leading up to, including, and following 1969-70.\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - We first check whether there is indeed an entry for the 1969-70 season with a \"div finish\" of 7th.\n   - Then we review all other entries in the table for any additional occurrences of a 7th place division finish.\n\nUpon checking each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Season: 1968-69)**: The column \"div finish\" does not specify a 7th place finish.\n- **Row 2 (Season: 1969-70)**: This row indicates the \"div finish\" is indeed 7th for this season, which supports part of the claim.\n- For all other rows from 3 to 46:\n   - None of these rows indicate a \"div finish\" of 7th.\n\nSince no other row besides Row 2 shows a division finish of 7th, the claim holds true based on the data provided.
