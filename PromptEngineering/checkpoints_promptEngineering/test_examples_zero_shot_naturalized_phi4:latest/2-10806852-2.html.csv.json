    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table, we need to break down and verify each part of the claim against the relevant data:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim mentions \"April 1939\". We should check if all matches in the table are from April 29, 1939.\n2. **Teams Involved**: The claim states a match between \"Hawthorn\" and \"North Melbourne\".\n3. **Match Result**: The claim asserts that Hawthorn defeated North Melbourne with scores of \"17 to 11\".\n\nNow let's verify these conditions using the table:\n\n- **Date Check**:\n  - All rows have the date as \"29 April 1939\". This condition is satisfied.\n\n- **Teams and Match Details**:\n  - In Row 1, we find: \n    - Home Team: Hawthorn\n    - Away Team: North Melbourne\n    - Scores are given in a different format: Home team score is \"17.13 (115)\" and away team score is \"11.11 (77)\". These scores translate to:\n      - Hawthorn scored 115 points.\n      - North Melbourne scored 77 points.\n  - The claim's description of the score as \"17 to 11\" refers to goals and behinds, which corresponds to the scores provided in a different format:\n    - Goals are the first number (17 for Hawthorn, 11 for North Melbourne).\n    - Behinds are the second number (13 for Hawthorn, 11 for North Melbourne).\n\n- **Match Outcome Verification**:\n  - The claim states that \"Hawthorn destroyed North Melbourne\" with scores of \"17 to 11\". From the table data:\n    - Hawthorn's goals: 17\n    - North Melbourne's goals: 11\n  - Since 115 (Hawthorn's total) is greater than 77 (North Melbourne's total), Hawthorn indeed defeated North Melbourne. The term \"destroyed\" can be considered subjective, but the outcome aligns with the claim.\n\nAll conditions in the claim are verified to be true based on the data from Row 1 of the table.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table, we need to verify two main conditions:\n\n1. The highest scoring game was when Richmond played Footscray.\n2. Richmond scored 19.21 in that game.\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table relevant to these conditions:\n\n- **Row 4** (Richmond vs. Footscray):\n  - Home team: Richmond\n  - Home team score: 20.19 (139)\n  - Away team: Footscray\n  - Away team score: 17.8 (110)\n\nFirst, we calculate the total scores for each game:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Hawthorn vs. North Melbourne\n   - Total score = 115 + 77 = 192\n\n2. **Row 2**: Fitzroy vs. St Kilda\n   - Total score = 102 + 134 = 236\n\n3. **Row 3**: Essendon vs. Melbourne\n   - Total score = 135 + 141 = 276\n\n4. **Row 4**: Richmond vs. Footscray\n   - Total score = 139 + 110 = 249\n\n5. **Row 5**: South Melbourne vs. Collingwood\n   - Total score = 107 + 146 = 253\n\n6. **Row 6**: Geelong vs. Carlton\n   - Total score = 92 + 79 = 171\n\nFrom these calculations, the highest total score is 276 in Row 3 (Essendon vs. Melbourne).\n\nNow, let's verify the specific claims:\n\n- The claim states that the highest scoring game was when Richmond played Footscray. However, the highest scoring game was Essendon vs. Melbourne with a total of 276.\n  \n- The claim also states that Richmond scored 19.21 in their game against Footscray. In Row 4, Richmond's score is actually 20.19 (139), not 19.21.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are false.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".

Let's analyze each row:\n\n- **Row 1:** Home team: Hawthorn, Crowd: 11,000  \n  The crowd size is less than 17,000.\n\n- **Row 2:** Home team: Fitzroy, Crowd: 15,000  \n  The crowd size is less than 17,000.\n\n- **Row 3:** Home team: Essendon, Crowd: 20,000  \n  The crowd size exceeds 17,000.\n\n- **Row 4:** Home team: Richmond, Crowd: 26,000  \n  The crowd size exceeds 17,000.\n\n- **Row 5:** Home team: South Melbourne, Crowd: 17,000  \n  The crowd size is equal to 17,000 but does not exceed it.\n\n- **Row 6:** Home team: Geelong, Crowd: 15,000  \n  The crowd size is less than 17,000.\n\nTo satisfy the claim that \"all the VFL games on April 29, 1939 have more than 17,000 in attendance,\" every game listed must have a crowd greater than 17,000.
