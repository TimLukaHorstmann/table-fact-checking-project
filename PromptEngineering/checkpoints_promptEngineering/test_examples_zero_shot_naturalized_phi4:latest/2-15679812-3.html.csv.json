    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the grizzlies move from vancouver to memphis in 2001,\" we need to carefully examine the relevant details provided in the table:\n\n### Breakdown of Relevant Information\n\n1. **Vancouver Grizzlies Era**: \n   - Rows 1-7 correspond to seasons when the team was known as the Vancouver Grizzlies.\n   - In Row 2 (1995-96) and subsequent rows up to Row 7 (2000-01), all entries under conference, division, finish, wins, losses, win%, and awards are \"vancouver grizzlies.\"\n   - The last season for the Vancouver Grizzlies listed is 2000-01 in Row 7.\n\n2. **Memphis Grizzlies Era**:\n   - Row 8 marks a transition to \"memphis grizzlies\" for all fields: season, conference, division, finish, wins, losses, win%, and awards.\n   - This indicates that the team's identity changed starting from the next season (2001-02) as seen in Row 9.\n\n3. **Transition Year**:\n   - The transition appears to occur between the seasons listed in Rows 7 and 8. \n   - Since Row 7 ends with the 2000-01 season and Row 9 starts with the 2001-02 season under \"memphis grizzlies,\" it suggests that the move happened after the 2000-01 season.\n\n### Evaluation of Claim\n\nThe claim states that the team moved in 2001. Based on the table:\n\n- The Vancouver Grizzlies are listed up to and including the 2000-01 season (Row 7).\n- The Memphis Grizzlies begin from the 2001-02 season onward (starting at Row 9).\n\nThis indicates that the move likely occurred between the end of the 2000-01 season and the start of the 2001-02 season. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the move happened in 2001.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"the grizzlies move from vancouver to memphis in 2001\" is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the grizzly saw their best win percentage, 610, in the 2012 - 2013 season,\" we need to examine the 'win%' column across all seasons and compare the values. The focus is on identifying if 610 is indeed the highest win percentage and whether it corresponds to the 2012-2013 season.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Column**: The relevant column for this claim is \"win%,\" as it contains the win percentages for each season.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - Row 9: Season 2001-02, Win% = 280\n   - Row 10: Season 2002-03, Win% = 341\n   - Row 11: Season 2003-04, Win% = 610 (Highest win percentage)\n   - Row 12: Season 2004-05, Win% = 549\n   - Row 13: Season 2005-06, Win% = 598\n   - Row 14: Season 2006-07, Win% = 268\n   - Row 15: Season 2007-08, Win% = 268\n   - Row 16: Season 2008-09, Win% = 293\n   - Row 17: Season 2009-10, Win% = 488\n   - Row 18: Season 2010-11, Win% = 561\n   - Row 19: Season 2011-12, Win% = 621 (Higher than 610)\n   - Row 20: Season 2012-13, Win% = 683 (Highest win percentage)\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the best win percentage was 610 during the 2012-2013 season.\n   - From the data extracted, the highest win percentages are 621 in 2011-12 and 683 in 2012-13.\n   - Therefore, while 610 is a high win percentage, it is not the highest. Moreover, it occurred in the 2003-04 season, not in 2012-2013.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because:\n   - 610 is not the best win percentage.\n   - The highest win percentages were 621 and 683 in subsequent seasons, with 683 being the highest overall.\n\nThus, the JSON output reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"win%\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"win%\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
