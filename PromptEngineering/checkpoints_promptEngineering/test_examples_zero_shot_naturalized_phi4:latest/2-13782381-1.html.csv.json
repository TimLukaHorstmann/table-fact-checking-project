    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about week 13, we need to analyze the data related to this specific week in the table provided.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim specifically refers to \"week 13\". From the table, row 13 corresponds to week 13.\n\n2. **Check the Result:**\n   - In row 13, the 'result' column indicates the result of the game as \"l 28 - 17\".\n   - This matches exactly with what is claimed in the statement: \"the average result for week 13 be l 28 - 17\".\n\n3. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim uses the term \"average result\". In this context, since there's only one game per week, the \"average\" result refers to the actual result of that week.\n\n4. **Relevant Data Extraction:**\n   - To verify, we need the data from row 13 and specifically check the 'week', 'result' columns.\n   - Ensure the 'week' is indeed 13 and the 'result' matches \"l 28 - 17\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The relevant data point in row 13 confirms that:\n  - **Week:** 13\n  - **Result:** l 28 - 17\n\nSince this directly aligns with the claim, we conclude that the statement is accurate.\n\nHere's the JSON output for this verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response indicates that the claim is true, based on the data extracted from the relevant cells in row 13 of the table.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to break down and analyze the specific elements of the claim in relation to the data provided in the table.\n\n**Claim:** \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17\"\n\n1. **Understanding 'Average':**\n   - Typically, when calculating an average of results (e.g., scores), you consider each individual result score and compute their mean.\n   - For a sports context involving games with scores (such as \"23-14\" or \"28-26\"), the average would be calculated for both the winning and losing team's points separately over all games.\n\n2. **Relevant Data from the Table:**\n   - We need to extract each game's score, specifically the home team\u2019s score since we assume that Meadowlands is the home site (as many entries are \"the meadowlands\" which suggests a home game context).\n   - Calculate the average of all home team scores over all weeks.\n   \n3. **Scores from Each Week:**\n   - Week 1: Result is \"W 23-14\". Home score = 23\n   - Week 2: Result is \"L 23-17\". Home score = 23\n   - Week 3: Result is \"W 43-23\". Home score = 43\n   - Week 4: Result is \"W 28-26\" (Away game, so ignore).\n   - Week 5: Result is \"L 28-21\". Home score = 28\n   - Week 6: Result is \"W 17-16\" (Away game, so ignore).\n   - Week 7: Result is \"W 24-20\" (Away game, so ignore).\n   - Week 8: Result is \"W 28-7\". Home score = 28\n   - Week 9: Result is \"L 30-20\" (Away game, so ignore).\n   - Week 10: Result is \"L 31-17\". Home score = 31\n   - Week 11: Result is \"L 9-5\". Home score = 9\n   - Week 12: Result is \"L 31-20\". Home score = 31 (This is the week in question)\n   - Week 13: Result is \"L 28-17\" (Away game, so ignore).\n   - Week 14: Result is \"L 20-10\". Home score = 20\n   - Week 15: Result is \"W 21-17\". Home score = 21\n   - Week 16: Result is \"L 41-21\" (Away game, so ignore).\n\n4. **Calculation of Average Score for Home Team:**\n   - Extracted home scores: [23, 23, 43, 28, 28, 31, 9, 31, 20, 21]\n   - Calculate average: \\( \\frac{23 + 23 + 43 + 28 + 28 + 31 + 9 + 31 + 20 + 21}{10} = \\frac{267}{10} = 26.7 \\)\n\n5. **Comparison with the Claimed Average (Week 12):**\n   - The average home score is 26.7, not 28.\n   - Week 12's specific home score was 31.\n\nGiven this analysis, week 12 does not represent an average home team score of \"28-17\" in any capacity based on the data provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is FALSE because neither the calculated average nor the specifics for week 12 align with the statement \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
