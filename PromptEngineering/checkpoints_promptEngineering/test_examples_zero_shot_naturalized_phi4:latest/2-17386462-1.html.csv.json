    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if Matlock Town indeed has the highest number of games lost compared to all other teams listed in the table.\n\nThe relevant parts of the claim are:\n1. Matlock Town has 23 games lost.\n2. No other team in the table has more than 23 games lost.\n\nFirstly, let's identify where this information is located within the table:\n\n- **Row corresponding to Matlock Town**: This would be Row 21 as per the provided data.\n  - \"team: matlock town\"\n  - \"lost: 23\"\n\nNext, we need to check if any other team has more than 23 games lost. We should examine the \"lost\" column for each row.\n\nHere are the losses for all teams:\n\n- Row 1 (Bangor City): Lost = 7\n- Row 2 (Mossley): Lost = 7\n- Row 3 (Witton Albion): Lost = 10\n- Row 4 (Gateshead): Lost = 9\n- Row 5 (King's Lynn): Lost = 11\n- Row 6 (Grantham): Lost = 11\n- Row 7 (Burton Albion): Lost = 14\n- Row 8 (Southport): Lost = 12\n- Row 9 (Marine): Lost = 13\n- Row 10 (Macclesfield Town): Lost = 16\n- Row 11 (Workington): Lost = 17\n- Row 12 (Worksop Town): Lost = 14\n- Row 13 (South Liverpool): Lost = 16\n- Row 14 (Goole Town): Lost = 16\n- Row 15 (Oswestry Town): Lost = 17\n- Row 16 (Buxton): Lost = 17\n- Row 17 (Lancaster City): Lost = 17\n- Row 18 (Gainsborough Trinity): Lost = 19\n- Row 19 (Tamworth): Lost = 23\n- Row 20 (Morecambe): Lost = 22\n- **Row 21 (Matlock Town)**: Lost = 23\n- Row 22 (Netherfield): Lost = 28\n\nUpon reviewing the \"lost\" column, we observe that Netherfield has lost more games than any other team, with a total of 28 losses.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Matlock Town does not have the highest number of games lost; instead, it's Netherfield.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- For verifying Matlock Town's losses:\n  - Row Index: 21\n  - Column Name: \"lost\"\n\n- For verifying that no other team has more than 23 losses:\n  - Row Index: 22 (Netherfield with 28 losses)\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: Row indices in the JSON start from 0, hence Matlock Town is at index 20 and Netherfield is at index 21.)",
