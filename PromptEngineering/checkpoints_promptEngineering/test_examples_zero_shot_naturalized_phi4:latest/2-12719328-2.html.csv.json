    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the given table and specifically check the finish times of racers in positions after the first place.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The next 4 racers after the first place finisher finish more than 5 minutes after the top finisher.\"\n\n1. **Identify the First Place Finisher:**\n   - S\u00e9bastien Bourdais is listed with a time of `1:40:58.596` and is in the first position on the grid (grid: 1), so he's the first place finisher.\n\n2. **Determine the Finish Times for Racers Finishing After First Place:**\n   - We will look at racers from Row 2 to Row 5, as these are the next four racers after S\u00e9bastien Bourdais.\n   \n3. **Check the Condition (More Than 5 Minutes Behind):**\n   - Convert \"5 minutes\" into seconds for easier comparison: `5 minutes = 300 seconds`.\n   - Calculate the time difference between each of these racers and the first place finisher.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\n- **Row 2: Dan Clarke**\n  - Time/Retired: +9.8 secs\n  - Difference from first place: 9.8 seconds\n\n- **Row 3: Graham Rahal**\n  - Time/Retired: +12.2 secs\n  - Difference from first place: 12.2 seconds\n\n- **Row 4: Oriol Servi\u00e0**\n  - Time/Retired: +20.9 secs\n  - Difference from first place: 20.9 seconds\n\n- **Row 5: Alex Tagliani**\n  - Time/Retired: +50.7 secs\n  - Difference from first place: 50.7 seconds\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the racers in positions 2 through 5 have finished more than 300 seconds (5 minutes) behind the first place finisher.
