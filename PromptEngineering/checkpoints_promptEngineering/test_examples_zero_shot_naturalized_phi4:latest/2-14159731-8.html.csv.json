The visitor must be Montreal.\n\nWe will locate the row in the table that corresponds to March 6 and check if the 'visitor' column is listed as \"montreal.\"\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the row with the date \"march 6.\" According to the table, this information appears in Row 4.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Check the visitor for the entry on March 6. In Row 4, under the 'visitor' column, it is listed as \"montreal.\"\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in Row 4: \n- The date matches (\"march 6\").\n- The visitor matches (\"montreal\").\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 3 (since indexing starts from 0), column \"date\" for March 6.\n- Row index 3, column \"visitor\" for \"montreal.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"before March 6, Montreal be the visitor\" is true or false, we need to verify if there was a game where Montreal was the visiting team prior to March 6.\n\nHere's how we can evaluate this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**: We are interested in games occurring before March 6.\n2. **Check Visitor Column**: For each relevant game (before March 6), check if \"Montreal\" is listed as the visitor.\n\nLet's examine the table rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date is March 1, Visitor is Philadelphia.\n- **Row 2**: Date is March 2, Visitor is NY Rangers.\n- **Row 3**: Date is March 4, Visitor is Philadelphia.\n\nNone of these games (before March 6) have Montreal as the visitor. The first occurrence where Montreal is mentioned as a visitor is in:\n\n- **Row 4**: Date is March 6, Visitor is Montreal.\n\nSince Montreal appears as a visitor on March 6 and not before, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are from rows with dates before March 6, specifically checking the \"visitor\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
