Points in Australian Rules Football are calculated as follows: 6 points per goal and 1 point per behind.\n\nThe relevant data from the table includes:\n- Goals and Behind tallies for each year he played with Geelong (2005, 2006, 2007).\n- We need to calculate the total points for each of these years.\n- Additionally, we should check if there is any available data for 2008.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n1. **Year 2005**:\n   - Goals: 8\n   - Behind: 2\n   - Points = (Goals * 6) + Behind = (8 * 6) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50 points\n\n2. **Year 2006**:\n   - Goals: 4\n   - Behind: 3\n   - Points = (Goals * 6) + Behind = (4 * 6) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27 points\n\n3. **Year 2007**:\n   - Goals: 34\n   - Behind: 18\n   - Points = (Goals * 6) + Behind = (34 * 6) + 18 = 204 + 18 = 222 points\n\n4. **Year 2008**:\n   - The table shows no data for this year, indicated by \"-\" in all the relevant columns. Therefore, there are no points to calculate.\n\nThe claim is that Nathan Ablett's best year for points was 2008 with Geelong. However, since there is no data available for 2008, we cannot determine any points scored during that season. Among the years where data is available (2005, 2006, 2007), the highest point tally was in 2007 with 222 points.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and calculated:\n- The claim about 2008 being his best year for points is FALSE because there are no records of games or points for that season.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion include the goals and behinds columns for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007 (as well as noting the lack of data in 2008):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
