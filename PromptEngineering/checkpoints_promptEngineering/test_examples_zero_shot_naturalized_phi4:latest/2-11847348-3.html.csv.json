    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league,\" we need to examine the column named \"league\" for each row and count how many players have exactly 8 goals in the league.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The claim pertains to the number of league goals scored by players, so we focus on the \"league\" column.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 league goals.\n   - Row 2: whelan has 4 league goals.\n   - Row 3: n\u00e9meth has 3 league goals.\n   - Row 4: ince has 2 league goals.\n   - Row 5: cooper has 2 league goals.\n   - Row 6: queudrue has 2 league goals.\n   - Row 7: marinelli has 2 league goals.\n   - Row 8: mustoe has 2 league goals.\n   - Row 9: deane has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 10: johnston has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 11: greening has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 12: stockdale has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 13: festa has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 14: windass has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 15: southgate has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 16: carbone has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 17: ehiogu has 1 league goal.\n   - Row 18: murphy has 0 league goals.\n   - Row 19: wilson has 0 league goals.\n   - Row 20: cambell has 0 league goals.\n   - Row 21: own goals have 1 league goal.\n\n3. **Count Players with 8 League Goals**: Only bok\u0161i\u0107 (Row 1) is listed as having scored 8 league goals. No other players have exactly 8 league goals.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who scored 8 league goals, but only one player fits this criterion according to the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those in the \"league\" column for Row 1 and all other rows (to confirm no other players have 8 league goals).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
