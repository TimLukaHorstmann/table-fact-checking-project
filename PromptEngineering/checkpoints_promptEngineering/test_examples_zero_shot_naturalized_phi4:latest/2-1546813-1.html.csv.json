    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to analyze the scores of the winning teams for each row in the table. The claim consists of two parts: \n\n1. The highest score for a winning team is 18.\n2. The lowest score for a winning team is 13.\n\nWe will check each part against the data provided:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Highest Score Check:\n- **Row 1**: Europe wins with a score of 18 - 10 (Winning Team's Score: 18)\n- **Row 2**: Europe wins with a score of 15 - 13 (Winning Team's Score: 15)\n- **Row 3**: United States wins with a score of 16 - 12 (Winning Team's Score: 16)\n- **Row 4**: United States wins with a score of 16 - 12 (Winning Team's Score: 16)\n- **Row 5**: United States wins with a score of 15\u00bd - 12\u00bd (Winning Team's Score: 15.5)\n- **Row 6**: Europe wins with a score of 17\u00bd - 10\u00bd (Winning Team's Score: 17.5)\n- **Row 7**: United States wins with a score of 15\u00bd - 12\u00bd (Winning Team's Score: 15.5)\n- **Row 8**: Europe wins with a score of 14\u00bd - 11\u00bd (Winning Team's Score: 14.5)\n- **Row 9**: United States wins with a score of 16 - 12 (Winning Team's Score: 16)\n- **Row 10**: United States wins with a score of 17 - 11 (Winning Team's Score: 17)\n- **Row 11**: United States wins with a score of 13 - 7 (Winning Team's Score: 13)\n- **Row 12**: Europe wins with a score of 11\u00bd - 6\u00bd (Winning Team's Score: 11.5)\n- **Row 13**: United States wins with a score of 11\u00bd - 4\u00bd (Winning Team's Score: 11.5)\n\nThe highest winning team score is indeed 18, found in Row 1.\n\n#### Lowest Score Check:\nFrom the scores analyzed above, the lowest winning team score is 11.5, which occurs in Rows 12 and 13. Therefore, the claim that the lowest score for a winning team is 13 is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim \"the highest score for a winning team be 18, while the lowest score for a winning team be 13\" is partially true (only the first part about the highest score being 18 is correct).
