    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"tie for lowest rank be municipal chorrillo and atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense,\" we need to examine the rankings and points of these two teams from the table provided.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim suggests that \"municipal chorrillo\" and \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\" are tied for the lowest rank, meaning they share the same place in the ranking order with an equal number of points.\n\n2. **Review Table Data:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - **Municipal Chorrillo** is placed at position 4 with 27 points.\n     - **Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense** is placed at position 10 with 11 points.\n\n3. **Determine if there is a Tie for Lowest Rank:**\n   - A tie would mean that both teams have the same number of points and occupy consecutive ranking positions without any other team having fewer points than them.\n   - Municipal Chorrillo has more points (27) compared to Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense (11).\n   - There are also teams below Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense, but all with equal or less points. Specifically:\n     - **Row 10: Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense** has the lowest rank and points in the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The two teams do not have the same number of points.\n   - Only Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense is at the lowest rank with no other team having fewer points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Municipal Chorrillo does not tie for the lowest rank with Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense; only Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense holds that position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
