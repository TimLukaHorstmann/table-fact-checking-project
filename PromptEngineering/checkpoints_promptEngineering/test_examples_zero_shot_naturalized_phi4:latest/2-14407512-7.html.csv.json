    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze the conditions stated:\n\nThe claim specifies:\n- The condition for \"the lowest point earn\" when \"2nd (m) be 135.0 be 246.6\".\n\nWe need to verify two main components of this claim from the table:\n1. Identify entries where the \"2nd (m)\" value is 135.0.\n2. Among these, find if the minimum points earned corresponds to 246.6.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:  \n  - 2nd (m): 136.0\n  - Points: 252.7\n\n- **Row 2**:  \n  - 2nd (m): 136.0\n  - Points: 248.9\n\n- **Row 3**:  \n  - 2nd (m): 135.0\n  - Points: 246.6\n\n- **Row 4**:  \n  - 2nd (m): 136.0\n  - Points: 246.3\n\n- **Row 5**:  \n  - 2nd (m): 139.0\n  - Points: 243.2\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 3 has a \"2nd (m)\" value of 135.0, with the points earned being 246.6. Since it's the only row matching the condition for \"2nd (m) = 135.0\", and its points are indeed 246.6, this satisfies both parts of the claim: the minimum point total when \"2nd (m)\" is 135.0.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is verified to be true. The relevant cells for checking this are those in Row 3 where the columns are \"2nd (m)\" and \"points\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
