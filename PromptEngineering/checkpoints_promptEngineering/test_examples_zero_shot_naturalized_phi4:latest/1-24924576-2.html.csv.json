The final score could be represented by something like 120-108 for UD (12 rounds), indicating a 12-point difference.\n\n2. **Relevant Information in the Table:**\n   - Each row provides information about a specific fight, including the result and whether it was decided by points or not.\n   - We need to focus on fights that ended with decisions (SD or otherwise) because only these can have scoring point differences.\n\n3. **Analyzing Relevant Rows:**\n   - Row 5 and Row 6: Fight against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, Result: SD 12/12 (Split Decision)\n     - A split decision typically means one judge scored the fight differently from the other two. However, exact scores are not provided.\n   - Row 8: Fight against Ricky Hatton, Result: KO 2/12\n     - This is a knockout win, so there's no scoring point difference.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only decision in the table where we might infer a scoring point difference is the fight with Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez.\n   - Since Row 8 (Ricky Hatton) ended in KO, it does not have a final scoring point difference.\n   - Therefore, the claim that Manny Pacquiao had his biggest difference in final scoring points during his bout with Ricky Hatton is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to identify rows where decision results are mentioned and check for potential scoring differences:\n     - Row 5: Result (SD)\n     - Row 6: Result (SD)\n     - Row 8: Result (KO)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Manny Pacquiao have the biggest difference in score point during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera\" is true or false, we need to assess the results of all bouts listed in the table and compare them based on the difference in score points.\n\nIn boxing, a decision (SD - Split Decision) involves judges scoring the fight, which implies that there are differing scores among the judges. A KO (Knockout) or TKO (Technical Knockout) means one fighter won by knockout within the rounds, with no need for judge's scorecards at that point of determining victory.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify bouts where decision was rendered**: Only SD results are relevant since they provide judges' scores, and those involve points. In this table:\n   - Row 5: Result is \"sd 12 / 12\" (Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez vs Manny Pacquiao)\n   - Row 6: Result is also \"sd 12 / 12\" (Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez vs Manny Pacquiao)\n\n2. **Bouts with KO/TKO results do not provide score differences**:\n   - Row 1: \"ko 8 / 12\"\n   - Row 3: \"tko 6 / 12\"\n   - Row 4: \"tko 11 / 12\" (Marco Antonio Barrera vs Manny Pacquiao)\n   - Row 7: \"tko 9 / 12\"\n   - Row 8: \"ko 2 / 12\"\n\n3. **Calculate score differences for SD bouts**:\n   - For Row 5 and Row 6, both have results of \"sd 12 / 12\", which indicates all three judges scored two rounds in favor of each fighter with one round a tie (typical split decision scoring). This implies the smallest possible difference in score points since only one judge's score differed. The specific point differences are not given but can be inferred to be minimal.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since none of the other results provide a basis for calculating a point difference and Rows 5 and 6 have the minimum possible difference (as split decisions usually imply), it is clear that Marco Antonio Barrera's bout (Row 4) does not have a score difference, as it was decided by TKO.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Manny Pacquiao have the biggest difference in score point during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The \"result\" column for all rows where decisions could be compared (Rows 5 and 6).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
