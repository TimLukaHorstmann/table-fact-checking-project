    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"an easy person to beat would be chen yanchong\" is true or false based on the table provided, we need to examine the relevant data.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are focusing on the opponent \"chen yanchong\" and the outcome of the match against them.\n   - Specifically, look at the row where chen yanchong is listed as an opponent.\n\n2. **Examine Row with Chen Yanchong:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 has chen yanchong as the opponent.\n     - The outcome for this match is \"winner.\"\n     - The score was 6-4, 6-4.\n\n3. **Assessing Claim Validity:**\n   - To claim that someone is an \"easy person to beat,\" we would expect evidence of difficulty in winning against them or multiple defeats.\n   - In Row 1, the player won with a relatively straightforward score (6-4, 6-4), indicating no struggle.\n   - There are no other matches against chen yanchong in the table. Therefore, there's no additional data to suggest that they were difficult to beat or easy to defeat consistently.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the available information, we only have one instance of a match against chen yanchong where the player won easily.\n   - There is insufficient evidence from this table alone to categorically state chen yanchong as an \"easy person to beat.\"\n\nThus, based solely on the provided data and without additional context or matches, the claim cannot be fully supported.
