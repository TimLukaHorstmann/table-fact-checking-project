    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n1. Identify which games Florida played against Pittsburgh.\n2. Check if this game had the lowest attendance compared to all other games.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Played Against Pittsburgh\n\nFrom the table, look for rows where the \"visitor\" or \"home\" is \"pittsburgh\":\n\n- **Row 3**: Visitor is \"pittsburgh\", Home is \"florida\". Therefore, this game involves Florida playing against Pittsburgh.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Attendance of This Game\n\nFor Row 3:\n- The attendance for this game is **17012**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Attendances to Determine the Lowest\n\nNow, we need to compare the attendance of all games to find the lowest:\n\n- Row 1: 15314\n- Row 2: 16478\n- Row 3: 17012 (Florida vs. Pittsburgh)\n- Row 4: 16614\n- Row 5: 15233\n- Row 6: 19321\n- Row 7: 15704\n- Row 8: 18546\n- Row 9: 18502\n- Row 10: 16110\n- Row 11: 17301\n- Row 12: 17832\n\nThe lowest attendance is **15233** (Row 5).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the game between Florida and Pittsburgh has an attendance of 17012, which is not the lowest (the lowest being 15233), the claim \"Florida plays Pittsburgh in the game with the lowest attendance\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Attendance for Row 3 (Florida vs. Pittsburgh).\n- All attendance figures to determine the lowest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
