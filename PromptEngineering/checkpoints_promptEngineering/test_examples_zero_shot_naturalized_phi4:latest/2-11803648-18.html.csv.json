    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"more than half of Ottawa's draft picks be acquire by trade,\" we need to analyze the relevant entries in the provided table to determine how many of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired through trades.\n\n1. **Identify Ottawa's Draft Picks:**\n   - We need to look for rows where the club team is associated with Ottawa.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 7 has a player Corey Cowick, position LW, nationality Canada, from \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\".\n\n2. **Determine Acquisition Method for Each Pick:**\n   - For each of Ottawa's draft picks, check if there is any indication that the pick was acquired through a trade.\n   - Row 7 mentions Corey Cowick with no note about being acquired via trade; it only lists his original team as \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\".\n\n3. **Calculate Total and Traded Picks:**\n   - Ottawa has made 1 draft pick according to the table (Corey Cowick).\n   - Since there is no indication that this pick was acquired through a trade, we conclude that 0 out of 1 Ottawa's picks were acquired by trade.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"more than half\" of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired by trade.\n   - More than half of 1 would require at least 1 pick to be acquired via trade, but in this case, none were.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is not supported by the data.
