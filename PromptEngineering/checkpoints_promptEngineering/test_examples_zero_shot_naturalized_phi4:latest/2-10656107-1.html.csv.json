However, no row specifies \"Phoenix Suns\" directly as the opponent with 48 minutes for David Robinson.\n   - **Row 19**: Michael Jordan played against Detroit Pistons for 43 minutes, not relevant.\n   - **Row 18**: Hakeem Olajuwon played against Minnesota Timberwolves for 44 minutes, not relevant.\n   - **Row 17**: LeBron James played against Orlando Magic for 42 minutes, not relevant.\n   - **Row 16**: Hakeem Olajuwon played against Minnesota Timberwolves for 46 minutes, not relevant.\n   - **Row 15**: LeBron James played against Miami Heat for 43 minutes, not relevant.\n   - **Row 14**: Michael Jordan played against Detroit Pistons for 44 minutes, not relevant.\n   - **Row 13**: David Robinson played against New York Knicks for 46 minutes.

This directly contradicts the claim about the player.\n- Additionally, the points scored by Michael Jordan on this date are recorded as 42, not 50. Thus, the score also does not match the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on these verifications, the claim that \"LeBron James scored 50 points against the Boston Celtic on 1 - 15 - 1989\" is **FALSE** because:\n\n- The player listed for that date is Michael Jordan, not LeBron James.\n- The score recorded does not match the claimed score of 50 points.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from Row 28, specifically for the \"date,\" \"player,\" and \"points\" columns.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
