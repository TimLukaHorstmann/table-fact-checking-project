    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table, we need to evaluate each condition within it:\n\nClaim: \"The game with 18843 attendance have panathinaikos as opponent with fr round on 25 october.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim into its components and check against the provided table data:\n1. **Attendance**: The claimed attendance is 18843.\n2. **Opponent**: The claimed opponent is \"panathinaikos.\"\n3. **Round**: The claimed round is \"fr\" (first round).\n4. **Date**: The claimed date is \"25 october.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Attendance: 15431\n  - Opponent: dnipro\n  - Round: fr\n  - Date: 20 september\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Attendance: 26275\n  - Opponent: dnipro\n  - Round: fr\n  - Date: 4 october\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Attendance: 8154\n  - Opponent: panathinaikos\n  - Round: gs (group stage)\n  - Date: 25 october\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Attendance: 18843\n  - Opponent: lokomotiv moscow\n  - Round: gs (group stage)\n  - Date: 8 november\n\nFrom this examination:\n\n- The game with an attendance of 18843 is on Row 4. Here, the opponent is \"lokomotiv moscow,\" not \"panathinaikos.\"\n- The opponent \"panathinaikos\" appears in Row 3, but the attendance there is 8154 and it's a group stage round, not \"fr.\"\n\nThus, none of the rows fully support all conditions specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
