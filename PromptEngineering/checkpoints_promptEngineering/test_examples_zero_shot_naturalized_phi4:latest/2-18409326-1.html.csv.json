    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Claim:** \"bell media own 3 separate radio stations like the cbc\"\n\nThis claim has two parts:\n1. Bell Media owns three separate radio stations.\n2. These stations are similar to those owned by CBC (in terms of format).\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n1. **Identify Radio Stations Owned by Bell Media:**\n   - From the table, we look for rows where the owner is \"bell media\".\n     - Row 6: Owner is bell media.\n     - Row 7: Owner is bell media.\n\n   So, Bell Media owns two radio stations according to the provided data (rows 6 and 7).\n\n2. **Check Radio Stations Owned by CBC:**\n   - Look for rows where the owner is \"canadian broadcasting corporation\" (CBC).\n     - Row 2: Owner is canadian broadcasting corporation.\n     - Row 3: Owner is canadian broadcasting corporation.\n     - Row 4: Owner is canadian broadcasting corporation.\n\n   CBC owns three radio stations according to the provided data (rows 2, 3, and 4).\n\n3. **Compare Formats for Similarity:**\n   - The claim implies a similarity in format between Bell Media's stations and those of CBC.\n   - Check the formats for the stations owned by Bell Media:\n     - Row 6: Format is \"contemporary hits radio\".\n     - Row 7: Format is \"adult contemporary\".\n\n   - Check the formats for the stations owned by CBC:\n     - Row 2: Format is \"public news / talk\".\n     - Row 3: Format is \"public music\".\n     - Row 4: Format is \"public news / talk\".\n\n   There are no direct format matches between Bell Media's stations and CBC's stations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Ownership:** Bell Media owns only two stations, not three.\n- **Format Similarity:** None of the formats owned by Bell Media match those of CBC's stations.\n\nGiven these points, the claim is false because Bell Media does not own three separate radio stations, nor do their formats align with those of CBC's stations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will count these rows:\n\n1. Row 1: frequency: 1150 am, call sign: ckfr\n2. Row 2: frequency: 00 88.9 fm, call sign: cbtk - fm\n3. Row 3: frequency: 00 89.7 fm, call sign: cbu - fm - 3\n4.
