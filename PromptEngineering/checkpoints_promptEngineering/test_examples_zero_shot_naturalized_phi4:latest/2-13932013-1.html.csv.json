    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the cleveland brown have tie a total of 12 games,\" we need to examine the information provided in the table for each quarterback associated with the Cleveland Browns and look specifically at the column \"ties\" to see if it sums up to 12.\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**: We focus on the rows that mention quarterbacks who have played for the Cleveland Browns, as this is where ties would be recorded.\n2. **Analyze the 'ties' column**: For each row corresponding to a Cleveland Brown quarterback, note how many ties are mentioned in their record.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- Row 0: Don Strock (1 tie)\n- Row 6: Thaddeus Lewis (1 tie)\n- Row 11: Spergon Wynn (no ties listed explicitly, but he has played for Browns; check if \"games started\" includes ties)\n- Row 12: Terry Lewis (no ties mentioned directly or indirectly in the context of Cleveland Browns' records)\n- Row 25: Babe Parilli (1 tie)\n- Row 35: Brian Hoyer (0 ties)\n  \nOther quarterbacks listed do not specifically indicate playing for Cleveland Browns or their record related to ties.\n\nNow, summing up the relevant entries:\n- Don Strock: 1 tie\n- Spergon Wynn: Although not directly mentioned, since there's no mention of a tie in his record and considering he played for Browns, assume 0.\n- Thaddeus Lewis: 1 tie\n- Babe Parilli: 1 tie\n\nAdding these up gives us: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3 ties.\n\nThe claim states there are a total of 12 ties.
