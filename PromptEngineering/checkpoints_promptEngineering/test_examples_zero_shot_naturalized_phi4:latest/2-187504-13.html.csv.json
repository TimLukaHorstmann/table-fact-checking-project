    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"8 different countries receive the same number of bronze medals\" is true or false, we need to examine the 'bronze' column in the table provided.\n\nHere's what we have for the number of bronze medals:\n\n- Soviet Union (USSR): 9\n- East Germany (GDR): 6\n- Switzerland (SUI): 5\n- Finland (FIN): 2\n- Sweden (SWE): 2\n- Austria (AUT): 2\n- Netherlands (NED): 2\n- West Germany (FRG): 2\n- United States (USA): 3\n- Italy (ITA): 2\n- Canada (CAN): 3\n\nNow, let's look for how many countries received the same number of bronze medals:\n\n1. 9 bronze medals: Soviet Union (USSR) - 1 country\n2. 6 bronze medals: East Germany (GDR) - 1 country\n3. 5 bronze medals: Switzerland (SUI) - 1 country\n4. 3 bronze medals: United States (USA), Canada (CAN) - 2 countries\n5. 2 bronze medals: Finland (FIN), Sweden (SWE), Austria (AUT), Netherlands (NED), Italy (ITA) - 5 countries\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that:\n- The number \"2\" for bronze medals is shared by 5 different countries.\n- The number \"3\" for bronze medals is shared by 2 different countries.\n\nNo other number of bronze medals is shared by exactly 8 or more countries.
