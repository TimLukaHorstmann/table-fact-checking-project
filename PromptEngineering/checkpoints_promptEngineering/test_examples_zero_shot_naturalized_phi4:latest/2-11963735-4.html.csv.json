This implies the Warriors lost their home game.\n  - On December 30, 2007 (Row 13), the Nuggets were the hosts and won with a score of 95 - 105.

This score was their highest home total in December 2007.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table based on these criteria:\n\n- **First Part**: Check if the Nuggets scored 112 points against the Rockets on December 20, 2007.\n  \n  From Row 8:\n  - Date: 20 December 2007\n  - Visitor: rockets\n  - Score: 111 - 112 (Nuggets scored 112)\n  - Home: nuggets\n  \n  This confirms that the Nuggets did score 112 points against the Rockets on this date.\n\n- **Second Part**: Determine if 112 was their highest home total for December 2007.\n  \n  We need to compare the Nuggets' home scores in December 2007 from all relevant rows:\n\n  - Row 1: Score 115 (against Heat)\n  - Row 2: Score 107 (against Lakers)\n  - Row 4: Score 101 (against Kings)\n  - Row 5: Score 105 (against Hornets)\n  - Row 8: Score 112 (against Rockets)\n  - Row 10: Score 105 (against Kings)\n  - Row 11: Score 125 (against Bucks)\n  - Row 13: Score 95 (against Warriors)\n\n  The highest score among these is 125 points against the Bucks on December 26, 2007.\n\nSince the Nuggets' highest home total in December was 125 points, not 112, the claim that 112 points were their highest home total is false.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 8: \"score\" and \"visitor\" (to confirm the score of 112 against Rockets)\n- Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13: \"score\" (to compare all home scores)\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
