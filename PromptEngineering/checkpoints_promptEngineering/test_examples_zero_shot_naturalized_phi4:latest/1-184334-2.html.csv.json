The claim requires the pop density to be more than 19,641.5, but in Row 1, it is exactly 19,641.5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the population and area conditions are satisfied, but the pop density condition (greater than 19,641.5) is not met (it's equal), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1: Population (2010 Census)\n- Row 1: Area\n- Row 1: Pop Density (per km\u00b2)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"population (2010 census)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"area (has)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pop density (per km2)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
