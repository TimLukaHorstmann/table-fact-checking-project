From our verification, Bob Charles from New Zealand is indeed ranked second in the table.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (Bob Charles is from New Zealand and is ranked second), the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this claim include:\n- Row 2 for the country \"new zealand\"\n- Row 2 for the rank \"2\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
