    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding players on the 1995-96 Canadiens team, we need to focus on identifying which players played as centers according to the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"miloslav guren and stephane robidas be the only player that play center on the 1995 - 96 canadiens team.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Identify all players listed in the table along with their positions**:\n   - Row 1: Terry Ryan, Position: Left Wing\n   - Row 2: Miloslav Guren, Position: Defense\n   - Row 3: Martin Hohenberger, Position: Left Wing\n   - Row 4: Jonathan Delisle, Position: Right Wing\n   - Row 5: Niklas Anger, Position: Right Wing\n   - Row 6: Boyd Olson, Position: Center\n   - Row 7: Stephane Robidas, Position: Defense\n   - Row 8: Greg Hart, Position: Right Wing\n   - Row 9: Eric Houde, Position: Center\n\n2. **Check the players mentioned in the claim**:\n   - Miloslav Guren is listed as playing defense (Row 2).\n   - Stephane Robidas is also listed as playing defense (Row 7).\n\n3. **Identify any players who play center according to the table**:\n   - Boyd Olson plays center (Row 6).\n   - Eric Houde plays center (Row 9).\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim against this information**:\n   - The claim states that Miloslav Guren and Stephane Robidas are the only centers, which is false because they do not play center; instead, Boyd Olson and Eric Houde are listed as playing center.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim does not hold true based on the provided table. Therefore, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
