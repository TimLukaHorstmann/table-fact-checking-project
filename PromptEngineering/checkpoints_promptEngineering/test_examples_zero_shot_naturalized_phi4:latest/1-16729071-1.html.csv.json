Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this claim are:\n- \"week\" column in Row 15\n- \"game site\" column in Row 15\n- \"attendance\" column in Row 15\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `row_index` is given as 14 because JSON array indexing starts at 0, and Row 15 corresponds to index 14.",
