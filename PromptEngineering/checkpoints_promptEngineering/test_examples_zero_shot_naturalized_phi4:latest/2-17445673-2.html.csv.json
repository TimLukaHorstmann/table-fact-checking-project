    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the match with the longest time be win against david ross,\" we need to analyze each row in the table for matches that ended with a \"win\" and compare their times.\n\n1. **Identify Winning Matches:**\n   - Row 3: Win against Osami Shibuya, time: 5:00\n   - Row 4: Win against Kengo Watanabe, time: 3:23\n   - Row 7: Win against Joe Campanella, time: 0:18\n   - Row 9: Draw against Ron Waterman (not a win)\n   - Row 11: Win against Mark Tullius, time: 6:58\n   - Row 12: Win against Eugene Jackson, time: 9:49\n   - Row 13: Win against David Ross, time: 5:36\n   - Row 14: Win against Paul Devich, time: 1:20\n\n2. **Compare Times for Winning Matches:**\n   - The longest time among the wins is 9:49 (Row 12: Eugene Jackson).\n   - David Ross match (Row 13) has a time of 5:36.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the match with the longest time was a win against David Ross, but the longest time for a win is actually against Eugene Jackson.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to consider all winning matches and their times to verify the claim.\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
