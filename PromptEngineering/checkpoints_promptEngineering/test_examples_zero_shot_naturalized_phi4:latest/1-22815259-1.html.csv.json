The table states that this game occurred on Oct 11, matching our requirement.\n\n- **Record Check**:\n  - Verify the record after this game. In Row 4, under the column \"record\", it shows \"4 - 0\". This indicates that prior to and including game 4, the Cowboys had a win-loss record of 4 wins and 0 losses.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: Game 4 is on Oct 11, and the record after this game is indeed 4 - 0.
