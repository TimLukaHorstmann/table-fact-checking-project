    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Ben Franks have 30 cap for the Hawke's Bay Hurricane,\" we need to check the following conditions in the table:\n\n1. **Player Name:** The player should be named \"Ben Franks.\"\n2. **Caps:** The number of caps should be 30.\n3. **Club/Province:** The club/province should include both \"Hawke's Bay\" and \"Hurricanes.\"\n\nLet's examine these conditions against the table:\n\n- From Row 6, we find:\n  - Player: Ben Franks\n  - Caps: 30\n  - Club/Province: Hawke's Bay / Crusaders\n\nThe claim mentions \"Hawke 's Bay Hurricane,\" but the table shows that Ben Franks is associated with \"Hawke's Bay\" and \"Crusaders,\" not \"Hurricanes.\"\n\nTherefore, the condition regarding the club/province does not fully match the claim.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, the claim is not entirely accurate. Thus, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
