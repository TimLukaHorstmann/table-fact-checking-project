The attendance for games against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n2. The attendance for games against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n- **Philadelphia Eagles Attendance:**\n  - Row 10 indicates a game on November 6, 1994, with an attendance of 64,952.\n  - Row 12 indicates another game on November 20, 1994, with an attendance of 62,779.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the attendance figure of 62,779 for the Philadelphia Eagles game. Thus, we focus on Row 12 for this specific number.\n\n- **Dallas Cowboys Attendance:**\n  - Row 5 shows a game on October 9, 1994, with an attendance of 64,518.\n  - Row 8 shows another game on October 23, 1994, with an attendance of 71,023.\n\nWe compare the 62,779 attendance from the Philadelphia Eagles game (Row 12) to both Dallas Cowboys games' attendances. Both are higher: 64,518 and 71,023.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince both attendance numbers for the Dallas Cowboys games are greater than 62,779, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
