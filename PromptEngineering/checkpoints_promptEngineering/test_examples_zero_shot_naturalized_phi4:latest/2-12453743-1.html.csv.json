However, it's reasonable to assume that \"2.0\" is equivalent to \"2\" as the decimal part does not alter the identifier.\n\n2. **Area of Mexicali**:\n   - The claim states that Mexicali has an area of \"12,700 km\".\n   - From Row 2 in the table: \n     - Area (km\u00b2): 13700.0\n\n   The area from the table is 13,700 km\u00b2, not 12,700 km\u00b2 as stated in the claim.\n\nBased on these checks:\n- The INEGI code part of the claim is supported by the table.\n- The area part of the claim is incorrect according to the table.\n\nSince one condition of the claim (the area) does not match the data in the table, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are from Row 2:\n- INEGI code: \"inegi code\" column\n- Area: \"area (km2)\" column\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"inegi code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
