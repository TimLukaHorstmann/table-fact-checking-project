We focus on entries for the \"season\" column and identify those with \"army - navy score\" specifying Baltimore, MD, at M&T Bank Stadium.\n2. We'll count these occurrences and check if only one season does not meet this condition.\n\nRelevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 42 (2012):** Specifies that the Army-Navy game took place in Baltimore, MD at M&T Bank Stadium.\n  \n- **Row 43 (2016):** Specifies that the Army-Navy game is scheduled for December 10, 2016, at Baltimore, MD at M&T Bank Stadium.\n  \n- **Row 44 (2018):** Specifies that the Army-Navy game took place in December 2018 at Baltimore, MD at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nFrom rows 1 to 41:\n- The only other mention of an Army-Navy game location is row 33 (2004) and onwards where it consistently mentions M&T Bank Stadium.\n  \nCounting these occurrences from the table:\n\n- For seasons before 2012: Navy games played in Baltimore were specified starting from 2003 onward, which means all from 2003 to 2011 include Army-Navy games at this venue.\n  \n- From 2012 onwards (rows 42 to 44): Baltimore is explicitly mentioned.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any seasons prior to 2003 that do not mention Baltimore. Given the data available:\n\n- Seasons from 1989 to 2002 do not specify a location for Army-Navy games at all.\n  \nTherefore, we conclude that except for these earlier years (pre-2003) where no game location is mentioned, every other year with an army-navy match specified does mention Baltimore.\n\nThe claim states \"all but 1 season,\" meaning one exception. However, multiple seasons from 1989 to 2002 lack any venue specification and hence do not meet the condition of having a game in Baltimore.
