    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each row in the table to identify which games ended in a tie at the end of regulation play and whether any of these ties went to penalty kicks.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Tied Games:**\n   - A game ends in a tie if the total score is equal after both rounds.\n   - Check the \"score\" column for each row to see if the teams have equal points.\n\n2. **Check for Penalty Kicks:**\n   - The claim specifies that 2 of these tied games went to penalty kicks.\n   - Since the table does not explicitly mention penalty kicks, we assume a game with an overall tie score might imply a potential for penalties in real-world scenarios. However, without explicit data on penalties, we can't confirm this part based solely on the given table.\n\n### Analysis of Each Row:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Score: 2 - 2 (Tie)\n  \n- **Row 2:**\n  - Score: 2 - 2 (Tie)\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Score: 2 - 3 (Not a Tie)\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Score: 2 - 1 (Not a Tie)\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Score: 3 - 0 (Not a Tie)\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Score: 0 - 1 (Not a Tie)\n\n- **Row 7:**\n  - Score: 3 - 5 (Not a Tie)\n\n- **Row 8:**\n  - Score: 0 - 0 (Tie)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There are three games that ended in ties at the end of regulation play (Rows 1, 2, and 8).\n- The table does not provide information about penalty kicks, so we cannot confirm if any of these ties went to penalties.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit data on penalty kicks, we can only verify the first part of the claim regarding tied games.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"4 different teams fail to score a single point in regulation in their round of 16 match\" is true or false, we need to interpret what it means for a team to fail to score in regulation time. Generally, this implies that the team did not score any goals throughout the entire match (both rounds combined).\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice\n   - Total Score: 2 - 2\n   - Both teams scored.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Lille OSC vs AJ Auxerre\n   - Total Score: 2 - 2\n   - Both teams scored.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Montpellier HSC vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard\n   - Total Score: 2 - 3\n   - Both teams scored.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Stade de Reims vs Le Havre AC\n   - Total Score: 2 - 1\n   - Both teams scored.\n\n5. **Row 5**: FC Metz vs FC Mulhouse\n   - Total Score: 3 - 0\n   - Only FC Metz scored; FC Mulhouse failed to score.\n\n6. **Row 6**: FC S\u00e8te vs RC Lens\n   - Total Score: 0 - 1\n   - Only RC Lens scored; FC S\u00e8te failed to score.\n\n7. **Row 7**: AEP Bourg sous la Roche vs Stade Quimp\u00e9rois\n   - Total Score: 3 - 5\n   - Both teams scored.\n\n8. **Row 8**: SO Ch\u00e2tellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil\n   - Total Score: 0 - 0\n   - Neither team scored.\n\nFrom this evaluation, we can see that the following teams failed to score in regulation time:\n- FC Mulhouse (Row 5)\n- FC S\u00e8te (Row 6)\n- SO Ch\u00e2tellerault (Row 8)\n\nThere are only 3 different teams that failed to score a single point across their matches.
