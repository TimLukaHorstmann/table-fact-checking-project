    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the relevant data from Row 5 of the table:\n\n- The match involves team 1: FC Nantes (d1) and team 2: Olympique Lyonnais (d2).\n- The overall score between these two teams is given as \"score: 4 - 4.\"\n- The breakdown into the first and second rounds shows:\n  - 1st round: 0 - 0\n  - 2nd round: 4 - 4\n\nThe claim states that FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais tied on aggregate with a score of 4 - 4, which matches the information given in Row 5. Furthermore, it mentions that the match needs to be decided by the away goal rule.\n\nIn football (soccer), if two teams have an equal aggregate score over two legs, the team that scored more goals away from home is declared the winner. If both teams also scored the same number of away goals, then the winner would typically be determined through extra time and/or a penalty shootout, not by applying the away goal rule again.\n\nFrom Row 5:\n- Both the first round (0 - 0) and second round (4 - 4) scores are equal in terms of home and away goals. Therefore, there is no advantage via the away goal rule since both teams scored zero away goals in total (0 + 0 for FC Nantes and 0 + 4 for Olympique Lyonnais, but these aren't compared directly against each other as needed).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"the match to be decided by the away goal rule\" is incorrect because both teams have scored an equal number of away goals (zero in aggregate). Hence, the correct decision would require additional methods beyond the away goal rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
