The percentage calculation based on those numbers.\n\nThe claim states \"grass be the surface in 3 of the 14 championship or 21.43%.\" This means we must check if there are exactly 3 instances where the surface is listed as \"grass\" and whether this represents approximately 21.43% of the total championships, which is 14 in this case.\n\nFirstly, let's identify each instance where the surface is \"grass\":\n\n- Row 7: Surface is grass.\n- Row 8: Surface is grass.\n\nThese are the relevant cells for checking how many times \"grass\" appears as a surface. There are only 2 such instances from the table. Therefore, it is not 3 as stated in the claim.\n\nNow, let's verify the percentage calculation:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Grass Surface Championships}}{\\text{Total Number of Championships}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSubstituting the numbers we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{2}{14} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 14.29\\% \\]\n\nThe percentage is approximately 14.29%, not 21.43%.
