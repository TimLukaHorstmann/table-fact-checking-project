Verify if the game with the highest attendance was held on December 26.\n\nWe will analyze the \"attendance\" column for all rows corresponding to December dates and compare the values to find the maximum attendance figure.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Row 1 (December 2):** Attendance = 19,227\n- **Row 2 (December 4):** Attendance = 19,577\n- **Row 3 (December 6):** Attendance = 14,061\n- **Row 4 (December 9):** Attendance = 19,037\n- **Row 5 (December 11):** Attendance = 19,057\n- **Row 6 (December 13):** Attendance = 19,811\n- **Row 7 (December 16):** Attendance = 19,219\n- **Row 8 (December 18):** Not relevant as the home team is not Philadelphia.\n- **Row 9 (December 20):** Attendance = 19,897\n- **Row 10 (December 21):** Not relevant as the home team is not Philadelphia.\n- **Row 11 (December 23):** Attendance = 19,578\n- **Row 12 (December 26):** Attendance = 22,712\n- **Row 13 (December 27):** Not relevant as the date is January and also the home team is not Philadelphia.\n- **Row 14 (December 30):** Not relevant as the date is January.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the game on December 26 had an attendance of 22,712, which is indeed the highest among all games held in December where Philadelphia was the home team. This supports the claim made about December 26 having the highest attendance for a game involving Philadelphia.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is TRUE.

To verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games**: Since we are considering only home games (where \"Philadelphia\" is listed as the home team), we will focus on those rows where Philadelphia is mentioned in the \"home\" column.\n2. **Determine Wins and Losses**:\n   - A win for Philadelphia occurs when they have more goals than their opponent in a home game (\"score: X - Y\", with X > Y).\n   - A loss for Philadelphia occurs when they have fewer or equal goals than their opponent (X \u2264 Y).\n\nLet's examine each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Home vs. Tampa Bay, Score: 3 - 4, Result: Loss\n- **Row 2**: Home vs. New Jersey, Score: 3 - 2, Result: Win\n- **Row 4**: Home vs. NY Islanders, Score: 3 - 4, Result: Loss\n- **Row 5**: Home vs. Carolina, Score: 5 - 6, Result: Loss\n- **Row 6**: Home vs. Pittsburgh, Score: 3 - 6, Result: Loss\n- **Row 7**: Home vs. Colorado, Score: 2 - 5, Result: Loss\n- **Row 9**: Home vs. Washington, Score: 1 - 7, Result: Loss\n- **Row 11**: Home vs. Ottawa, Score: 4 - 6, Result: Loss\n\nFrom these rows:\n- Wins: Row 2 (1 win)\n- Losses: Rows 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11 (7 losses)\n\nThe claim states that the Flyers won 3 games.
