    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"neither st kilda nor fitzroy get to play at brunswick street oval\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and focus on the relevant columns: \"home team\", \"away team\", and \"venue\".\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Home team: fitzroy\n  - Away team: st kilda\n  - Venue: brunswick street oval\n\nIn Row 1, both Fitzroy and St Kilda are playing at Brunswick Street Oval. This directly contradicts the claim that neither team plays there.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the claim is false because Fitzroy and St Kilda do play at Brunswick Street Oval according to Row 1.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying the claim:\n- Row 1: \"home team\" (fitzroy)\n- Row 1: \"away team\" (st kilda)\n- Row 1: \"venue\" (brunswick street oval)\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
