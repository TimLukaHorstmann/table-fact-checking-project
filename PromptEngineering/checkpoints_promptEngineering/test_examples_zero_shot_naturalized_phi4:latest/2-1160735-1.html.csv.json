    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"type 0 - 4 - 2t be the most used type between 1973 and 2008,\" we need to evaluate the types listed in each row of the table for their frequency, considering only those within the specified date range.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row 1:** \n   - Date: 2000\n   - Type: bo - bodh\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - Date: 1973\n   - Type: 4wdh\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - Date: 1993\n   - Type: 4wdh\n\n4. **Row 4:** \n   - Date: 1998\n   - Type: 0 - 4 - 2t\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - Date: 2008\n   - Type: 0 - 4 - 0\n\nNext, we count the occurrences of each type within the date range:\n\n- \"bo - bodh\" appears once (in Row 1).\n- \"4wdh\" appears twice (in Rows 2 and 3).\n- \"0 - 4 - 2t\" appears once (in Row 4).\n- \"0 - 4 - 0\" appears once (in Row 5).\n\nThe claim states that the type \"0 - 4 - 2t\" is the most used. However, based on our analysis:\n\n- \"4wdh\" is the most frequently occurring type, with two occurrences.\n- \"0 - 4 - 2t\" occurs only once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. The relevant rows and columns for verifying this are those that include the \"type\" and \"date\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
