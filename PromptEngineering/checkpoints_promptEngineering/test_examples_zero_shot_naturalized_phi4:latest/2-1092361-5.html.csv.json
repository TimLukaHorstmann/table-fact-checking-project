Identify all occurrences of matches played on a \"hard\" surface.\n2. Confirm if the second occurrence indeed happened on 12 March 1989.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row based on these criteria:\n\n- **Row 27**: Date is 12 March 1990, Surface is hard. This is not applicable as it happens after our claimed date of interest.\n  \n- **Row 28**: Date is 6 August 1990, Surface is hard. Again, this occurs well after the claim's date.\n\n- **Row 3**: Date is 13 February 1989, Surface is carpet (i). This doesn't match a \"hard\" surface, so it isn't relevant for our count of hard surfaces.\n\n- **Row 4**: Date is 17 September 1988, Surface is clay. Not hard; hence not applicable.\n\n- **Row 19**: Date is 11 February 1991, Surface is carpet (i). Again, irrelevant for a \"hard\" surface count.\n\nRe-examine and identify the first occurrence of a match on a \"hard\" surface:\n\n- **Row 27**: 12 March 1990 - First hard surface encounter. \n\nContinuing to search backward in time from this point:\n\n- **Row 3** to **Row 26**: None of these rows have \"hard\" as the surface. They either are carpet (i), clay, or unspecified.\n\nIdentify when the first match on a \"hard\" surface occurs:\n\n- **Row 27**: This is confirmed as the first encounter with a hard surface.\n\nNow checking for earlier matches that would make this second occurrence false:\n\n- None of the rows prior to Row 27 feature \"hard\" as the surface, which means Row 27's occurrence is indeed the first one.\n\nFinally, locate if there was any match on \"hard\" surface before 12 March 1989 (the claimed date):\n\n- **Row 5**: Date is 11 February 1989, Surface is carpet (i). \n- **Row 6** to **Row 26**: None have a hard surface listed.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is no entry prior to Row 27 that has \"hard\" as the surface.
