    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the format of season 6 be q145\" is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify the row where the `season` column has a value of 6.\n2. Check if the corresponding `format` column in that row equals `q145`.\n\nLet's go through the table step by step:\n\n- **Row 1:** Season is 1, which does not match season 6.\n- **Row 2:** Season is 2, which does not match season 6.\n- **Row 3:** Season is 3, which does not match season 6.\n- **Row 4:** Season is 4, which does not match season 6.\n- **Row 5:** Season is 5, which does not match season 6.\n- **Row 6:** Season is 6. Now we need to check the format for this row:\n  - Format: `q145`. This matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the row with season 6 has a format of `q145`), the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells in Row 6 that were checked include:\n\n- The `season` column to ensure it is 6.\n- The `format` column to confirm it is `q145`.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

If there is any other episode with the format 'q147'.\n\nLet's analyze each condition step by step using the data from the table:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Check if episode number 223 has format 'q147'.\n  - According to Row 9, Episode 225 (not 223) has the format 'q147'. Thus, Episode 223 does not have the format 'q147'.\n\n- **Condition 2**: Identify any other episodes with the format 'q147'.\n  - As established from Row 9, only Episode 225 has the format 'q147'.\n\nSince Episode 223 does not have the format 'q147', it cannot be \"the only episode number\" with that format.
