    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main conditions based on the table:\n\n1. **Identify all teams using the machine `nsr250`.**\n2. **Check if these teams have points less than 8.**\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Team: \"cup noodle - honda\"\n  - Machine: `nsr250`\n  - Points: 8\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Team: \"cup noodle - honda\"\n  - Machine: `nsr250`\n  - Points: 11\n\nFrom the table, only the team \"cup noodle - honda\" uses the machine `nsr250`. Now, let's check their points:\n\n- In Row 1, they have 8 points.\n- In Row 2, they have 11 points.\n\nBoth values are not less than 8. Therefore, there is no instance where a team using `nsr250` has less than 8 points.\n\nSince \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team with `nsr250`, and they do not have any points less than 8, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are those that contain information about the machine `nsr250` and their corresponding points:\n\n- Row 1: \"machine\", \"points\"\n- Row 2: \"machine\", \"points\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
