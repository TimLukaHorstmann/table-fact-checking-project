We must check how many times the value \"5\" appears in this column across different rounds.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- **Row 1:** Round 1, Pick 2\n- **Row 2:** Round 2, Pick 17\n- **Row 3:** Round 4, Pick 5 (relevant)\n- **Row 4:** Round 6, Pick 12\n- **Row 5:** Round 8, Pick 5 (relevant)\n- **Row 6:** Round 8, Pick 19\n- **Row 7:** Round 9, Pick 4\n- **Row 8:** Round 10, Pick 5 (relevant)\n- **Row 9:** Round 11, Pick 4\n- **Row 10:** Round 12, Pick 5 (relevant)\n\nThe \"pick\" value of \"5\" appears in the following rounds:\n\n1. Round 4 (Row 3)\n2. Round 8 (Row 5)\n3. Round 10 (Row 8)\n4. Round 12 (Row 10)\n\nThere are four separate rounds where the pick number is 5. The claim states \"more than 4,\" which means at least five occurrences across different rounds.\n\nSince there are only four such instances, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n\n- Row 3: Pick 5\n- Row 5: Pick 5\n- Row 8: Pick 5\n- Row 10: Pick 5\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
