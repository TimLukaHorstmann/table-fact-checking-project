    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"brandon sutter, who position be c or w, be draft in round 1\", we need to verify specific details from the table.\n\nThe claim is composed of three key parts:\n1. The player's name: \"brandon sutter\"\n2. The player's position: \"c or w\" (center or winger)\n3. The round in which the player was drafted: \"round 1\"\n\nWe need to verify these components from Row 1 of the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: 0 (as indices typically start from zero, and row 1 in naturalized format corresponds to index 0).\n- **Player Name Check**: From the table, Row 1 indicates \"player: brandon sutter\". This matches with the claim.\n- **Position Check**: The position listed is \"c / w\", which indeed includes both \"c\" (center) and \"w\" (winger). Therefore, this part of the claim is supported.\n- **Draft Round Check**: The draft round is specified as \"round: 1\". This matches with the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are satisfied by the data in Row 1. Thus, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Player's name cell corresponds to column \"player\" (Row Index 0).\n- Position cell corresponds to column \"position\" (Row Index 0).\n- Draft round cell corresponds to column \"round\" (Row Index 0).\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
