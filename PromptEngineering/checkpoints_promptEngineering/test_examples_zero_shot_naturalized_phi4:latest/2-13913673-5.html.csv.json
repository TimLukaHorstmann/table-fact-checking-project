Row 1: Loss (3-2), Record becomes 37-48\n2. Row 2: Loss (6-5), Record becomes 37-49\n3. Row 3: Loss (12-3), Record becomes 37-50\n4. Row 4: Loss (9-6), Record becomes 37-51\n5.

Row 13: Win (9-6), Record becomes 44-53\n14. Row 14: Loss (9-4), Record becomes 44-54\n15. Row 15: Loss (8-5), Record becomes 44-55\n16. Row 16: Loss (14-12), Record becomes 44-56\n17. Row 17: Win (9-4), Record becomes 45-56\n18. Row 18: Win (8-5), Record becomes 46-56\n19. Row 19: Loss (14-12), Record becomes 46-57\n20.
