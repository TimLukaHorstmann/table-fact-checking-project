    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380,\" we need to analyze two aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a row where the number of \"cashes\" is exactly 6.\n2. Check whether the earnings for that particular row equal 39,380.\n\nWe will go through each row in the table and look for these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Cashes: 6\n  - Earnings: 9500\n  \n  This matches the first condition of having exactly 6 cashes. However, the earnings are not 39380; they are 9500.\n\n- **Row 2 to Row 11**:\n  - We will check each row for the number of \"cashes\" and corresponding \"earnings.\"\n  - None of these rows have both conditions met (i.e., cashes equal 6 and earnings equal 39380).\n\nAfter examining all the rows, we find that no row in the table has exactly 6 cashes with earnings amounting to 39,380.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by any data in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\" The only relevant cell needed to evaluate this claim is from Row 1 for both \"cashes\" and \"earnings.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
