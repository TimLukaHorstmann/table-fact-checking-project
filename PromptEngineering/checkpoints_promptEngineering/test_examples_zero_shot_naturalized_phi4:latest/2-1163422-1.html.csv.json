The team name should be \"Evansville Triplets.\"\n2. The sport played by this team should be \"baseball.\"\n3. The class level for the team should be \"AAA.\"\n\nWe will verify these points against the table:\n\n- **Team Name**: We need to find a row where the \"team\" is \"evansville triplets.\" From the table, this corresponds to Row 12.\n  \n- **Sport**: In Row 12, we check if the \"sport\" column says \"baseball.\" It does.\n\n- **Class Level**: Lastly, in Row 12, we confirm if the \"class\" level is \"AAA.\" The table states it as \"aaa,\" which matches \"AAA\" ignoring case sensitivity, indicating that it's indeed a AAA class team.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The claim is fully supported by the data in Row 12 of the table.\n  \nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim are:\n\n1. Row Index 11 (Row 12 as per zero-based indexing), Column \"team\"\n2. Row Index 11, Column \"sport\"\n3. Row Index 11, Column \"class\"\n\nBased on this verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check the relevant details for each part of it against the provided table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"evansville triplet baseball team be class aaa in the three - i league title 1946 , 1948 , 1956 , 1957 championship\"**\n\n#### Steps to Verify:\n\n- **Team Name and Classification:**\n  - The claim mentions \"Evansville Triplet\" as a Class AAA team.\n  - From Row 12, we know that the Evansville Triplets were indeed a baseball team classified as AAA, but they played in the American Association from 1970 to 1984.\n\n- **League and Championships:**\n  - The claim states championships in the \"three-i league\" for the years 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957.\n  - From Row 10, we see that the Evansville Braves won titles in the Three-I League during those years, not the Triplets.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim incorrectly associates the Evansville Triplets with a Class AAA classification in the Three-I League and championships from 1946 to 1957. These details actually pertain to the Evansville Braves.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n1.
