Wampler as a candidate and his defeat:**\n   - In Row 5, under candidates, it is stated that Parren Mitchell was \"unopposed\".\n   - This means there were no other candidates, including Elton R. Wampler.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Parren Mitchell was indeed re-elected in Maryland District 7.\n- However, he did not defeat Elton R.
