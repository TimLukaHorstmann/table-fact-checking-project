The relevant details from the claim include:\n\n1. The release date should be Q2 2008.\n2. The part number(s) should be `lf80537 ge0301 m`.\n\nLet's go through the steps to verify these conditions:\n\n1. **Identify the row with sspec number `sla4h (m0)`**:\n   - Row 4 has `sspec number: sla4h (m0)`.\n\n2. **Check the release date for this model**:\n   - In Row 4, the `release date` is Q2 2008.\n   - This matches the claim's condition that the release date should be Q2 2008.\n\n3. **Verify the part number(s) for this model**:\n   - In Row 4, the `part number (s)` is `lf80537 ge0361 m`.\n   - The claim states the part number should be `lf80537 ge0301 m`, which does not match what we have.\n\nSince one of the conditions in the claim (the part number) is incorrect based on the table, the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 4, Column: `sspec number`\n- Row 4, Column: `release date`\n- Row 4, Column: `part number (s)`\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"sspec number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"part number (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
