We should look at Row 1 where the date is specified as \"29 April 2012\".\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: The claim mentions that the opponent was \"Giles Simon\". In Row 1, the opponent in the final is listed as \"Gilles Simon\". There's a minor difference in spelling (\"Giles\" vs. \"Gilles\"), but this can be interpreted as an error in transcription or a typo.\n\n3. **Outcome Check**: The claim states that the outcome was \"runner-up\". In Row 1, the outcome is recorded as \"runner-up\".\n\nGiven these checks:\n- Date matches.\n- Opponent matches despite a minor spelling difference.\n- Outcome matches.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the information in Row 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.

We need to check if this is listed as the opponent in the final for that specific date.\n\nLet's examine each row of the table relevant to our task:\n\n- **Row 5** contains:\n  - Date: \"28 july 2013\"\n  - Outcome: \"runner - up\" (though this detail isn't necessary for verifying the claim)\n  - Opponent in the final: \"tommy robredo\"\n\nSince Row 5 matches both the date and the opponent mentioned in the claim, we have verified that the claim is true.\n\nThus, the JSON object with our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis solution confirms that Tommy Robredo was indeed the opponent on July 28, 2013.",
