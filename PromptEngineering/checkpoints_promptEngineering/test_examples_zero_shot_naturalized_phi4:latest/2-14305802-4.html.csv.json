Whether there was a game between the Cleveland Barons and an unspecified opponent (which should be the Philadelphia Flyers according to the claim) on December 21st.\n2. If such a game existed, whether the score indicated that the Cleveland Barons scored zero points.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row 10** has the following details:\n  - Game: 31\n  - Date: December 21\n  - Opponent: Cleveland Barons\n  - Score: 4 - 0\n\nFrom this row, we can see that on December 21st, there was a game where the opponent was the Cleveland Barons. The score was 4 - 0, indicating that the Cleveland Barons did not score any points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim specifies that the Cleveland Barons scored no points against an unspecified team on December 21st, and we have confirmed that this indeed happened in a game against another team (not specifically mentioned as the Philadelphia Flyers in the table). However, the specific matchup with the Philadelphia Flyers is not directly addressed in the table.\n\nSince the claim focuses only on whether the Cleveland Barons scored zero points on December 21st, which they did according to the table, the relevant part of the claim is true.
