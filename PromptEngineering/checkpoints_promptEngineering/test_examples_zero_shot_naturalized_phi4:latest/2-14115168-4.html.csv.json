    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Bellevue University be the first college founded in the 20th century,\" we need to examine the founding years of all universities listed in the table and identify which, if any, was established before Bellevue University.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"founded\" column from each row since this information will tell us when each school was founded.\n\n2. **Data Extraction:**\n\n   - Row 1: Bellevue University, Founded in 1966\n   - Row 2: College of Saint Mary, Founded in 1923\n   - Row 3: Concordia University, Founded in 1894\n   - Row 4: Doane College, Founded in 1872\n   - Row 5: Hastings College, Founded in 1882\n   - Row 6: Midland University, Founded in 1883\n   - Row 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University, Founded in 1887\n   - Row 8: Peru State College, Founded in 1865\n   - Row 9: York College, Founded in 1890\n\n3. **Determine the First School Founded in the 20th Century:**\n   - The 20th century spans from the year 1901 to 2000.\n   - From the list above, the earliest founding date in the 20th century is for the College of Saint Mary, which was founded in 1923.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Bellevue University was founded in 1966.\n   - Since there exists a school (College of Saint Mary) that predates Bellevue University within the 20th century (founded in 1923), Bellevue University cannot be considered the first college established in this period.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE, as College of Saint Mary was founded earlier than Bellevue University in the 20th century.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - We consider the \"founded\" column for all universities to establish their founding years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
