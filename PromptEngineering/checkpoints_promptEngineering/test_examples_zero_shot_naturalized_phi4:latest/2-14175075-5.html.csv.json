    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to evaluate whether the sport \"w gymnastics\" has the earliest date in 2007 compared to other sports listed in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Rows for the Claim:**\n   - The claim pertains to events from the year 2007.\n   - We will focus on rows with dates in 2007 and compare their respective sports to see which one has the earliest date.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - Row 1: September 4, 2007, Sport: m golf\n   - Row 2: September 8, 2007, Sport: volleyball\n   - Row 3: September 9, 2007, Sport: w soccer\n   - Row 4: September 15, 2007, Sport: football\n   - Row 6: November 10, 2007, Sport: w cross country (although this event is in 2007, it's not \"w gymnastics\")\n   - Row 11: February 22, 2008, Sport: w gymnastics (this is in 2008, so it does not apply to our check for the earliest date in 2007)\n\n3. **Compare Dates:**\n   - The dates from 2007 are September 4, September 8, September 9, and September 15.\n   - The sport \"w gymnastics\" is listed under February 22, 2008, which is not within the year 2007.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no event for \"w gymnastics\" occurred in 2007, it cannot be the earliest date in that year.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because there are earlier dates in 2007 for other sports, and \"w gymnastics\" does not have an occurrence in 2007.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to identify all rows with dates in 2007 and their respective sports to validate this conclusion.\n   - Relevant cells include the date and sport columns from Rows 1 through 4, which provide earlier dates than February 22, 2008 (the date for \"w gymnastics\" but not within 2007).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"sport\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
