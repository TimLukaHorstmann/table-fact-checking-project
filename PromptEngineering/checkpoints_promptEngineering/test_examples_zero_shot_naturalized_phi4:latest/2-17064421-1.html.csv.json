The claim states: \"Leonel Marquetti and Alvin Brooks be the only players from the same college.\"\n2. We will first identify the colleges for both players:\n   - Leonel Marquetti is listed with \"college: hampton\" (Row 9).\n   - Alvin Brooks is listed with \"college: lamar\" (Row 10).\n\n3. Since Leonel Marquetti and Alvin Brooks attended different colleges, they cannot be the only players from the same college.\n\n4. To further verify the claim, we must ensure there are no other pairs of players who share the same college.\n5. We will check each player's college:\n\n   - Row 1: Duke\n   - Row 2: South Alabama\n   - Row 3: Eastern Kentucky\n   - Row 4: St Bonaventure\n   - Row 5: Vanderbilt\n   - Row 6: Jackson State\n   - Row 7: Northern Michigan\n   - Row 8: San Diego\n   - Row 9: Hampton (Leonel Marquetti)\n   - Row 10: Lamar (Alvin Brooks)\n\n6. Each college listed is unique to a single player, confirming there are no other players from the same college.\n\nBased on this analysis, since no two players share the same college, the claim that Leonel Marquetti and Alvin Brooks be the only players from the same college is false because they do not come from the same college at all. The verification of colleges shows none match.\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
