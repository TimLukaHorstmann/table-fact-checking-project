    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table's \"goals for\" column across all teams, as this directly relates to the claim about goals scored in games.\n\nThe claim states: \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\". This implies that every team should have a \"goals for\" value of at least 30.\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Ottawa Hockey Club):** Goals For = 90\n- **Row 2 (Montreal Wanderers):** Goals For = 74\n- **Row 3 (Montreal Victorias):** Goals For = 76\n- **Row 4 (Quebec Hockey Club):** Goals For = 57\n- **Row 5 (Montreal Hockey Club):** Goals For = 49\n- **Row 6 (Montreal Shamrocks):** Goals For = 30\n\nEvery team has scored at least 30 goals. Therefore, there are no instances where a \"goals for\" value is less than 30.\n\nSince the condition of the claim holds true across all teams in the table, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells checked:\n\n- Row 1, \"Goals For\"\n- Row 2, \"Goals For\"\n- Row 3, \"Goals For\"\n- Row 4, \"Goals For\"\n- Row 5, \"Goals For\"\n- Row 6, \"Goals For\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
