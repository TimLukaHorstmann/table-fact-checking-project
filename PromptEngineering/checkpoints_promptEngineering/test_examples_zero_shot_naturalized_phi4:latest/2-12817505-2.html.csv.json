The key details required are the match results between these two teams.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We look for rows where \"opponents\" is \"blackburn rovers.\"\n   - Check if both matches after 13 August 2005 ended in a draw.\n\n2. **Extracting Relevant Data:**\n   - For each match against Blackburn Rovers, we need to verify the result (\"result\" column) and ensure it indicates a draw.\n   - A draw is represented as \"0-0.\"\n\n3. **Check Dates:**\n   - Ensure these matches occurred after 13 August 2005.\n\n### Data Extraction:\n\nFrom the table, we identify two rows involving Blackburn Rovers:\n\n- **Row 24:** \n  - Date: 1 February 2006\n  - Result: 3-4 (not a draw)\n  \n- **Row 23:** \n  - Date: 22 January 2006\n  - Result: 1-0 (not a draw)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth matches between Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers did not end in a draw.

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine the attendance at Arsenal's game on April 9, 2006, and then count how many games from August 13, 2005, onward have exactly that same attendance.\n\n1. **Determine Attendance for Arsenal's Game on April 9, 2006:**\n   - Locate row 33 in the table:\n     - Row 33: Date is \"9 april 2006\", and the attendance is \"70908\".\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Time Frame:**\n   - The claim specifies games since August 13, 2005.\n   - Since no specific starting date for August is provided, assume all dates in August are valid. Therefore, count from row 0 onward.\n\n3. **Count Games with Attendance of \"70908\":**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the attendance number \"70908\" from rows 0 through 37 (since May 7, 2006, is the last date mentioned).\n\n4. **Check Each Row for the Specified Attendance:**\n   - Traverse each row and check if the attendance matches \"70908\".\n   - Record the relevant rows where this condition holds true.\n\n5. **Count the Matches:**\n   - If there are exactly 19 occurrences of \"70908\" in attendance from August 13, 2005, onward, the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- Row 14 (22 january 2006): Attendance = 67874\n- Row 23 (9 april 2006): Attendance = 70908\n- Row 30 (26 march 2006): Attendance = 69070\n- Row 32 (1 april 2006): Attendance = 27718\n- Row 33 (9 april 2006): Attendance = 70908\n\nOnly rows 23 and 33 have the attendance of \"70908\".\n\nThus, there are only **2** occurrences of an attendance of \"70908\" after August 13, 2005.\n\nSince the number of games with that specific attendance is not equal to 19, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
