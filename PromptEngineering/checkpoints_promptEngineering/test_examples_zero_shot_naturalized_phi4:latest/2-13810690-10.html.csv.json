    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"only 2 games were postponed due to weather; the game on September 6 and September 12,\" we must verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. There should be exactly two instances where a game was postponed due to weather.\n2. These postponements should specifically occur on September 6 and September 12.\n\nWe'll examine each row for entries marked as \"postponed due to weather\" in the relevant columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. \n\n1. **Identifying Postponed Games:**\n   - Row 5 (September 6): The game is listed as postponed due to weather.\n   - Row 12 (September 12): The game is also listed as postponed due to weather.\n\n2. **Verifying the Total Number of Postponed Games:**\n   - Only rows 5 and 12 indicate postponements due to weather, confirming that there are exactly two such instances.\n\n3. **Checking Specific Dates for Postponement:**\n   - The dates specified in the claim (September 6 and September 12) match the postponed games found in rows 5 and 12.\n\nBased on this analysis, both conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- There are indeed only two postponed games.\n- These postponed games occurred on September 6 and September 12, as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells that verify this claim are from rows where postponement due to weather is indicated: Row 5 (September 6) and Row 12 (September 12). Each of these rows has multiple columns marked with \"postponed due to weather,\" but we only need one column per row to confirm the postponement.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Whether these shutouts occurred on September 5 and September 2.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant row based on the table provided:\n\n- **Row 2 (September 2, Nationals):** The score is \"4 - 0\". This indicates that the opposing team (Nationals) held the home team to zero points. Therefore, this game satisfies the condition of being a shutout.\n\n- **Row 4 (September 5, Mets):** The score is \"3 - 0\". This also indicates that the opposing team (Mets) held the home team to zero points. Thus, this game is another instance of a shutout.\n\nNow, we need to ensure no other games in the table resulted in a shutout:\n\n- For all other rows (1, 3, 5-7, 8-27), check the scores:\n  - Row 1: \"7 - 4\"\n  - Row 3: \"9 - 7\"\n  - Row 5: Postponed\n  - Row 6: \"6 - 2\"\n  - Row 7: \"6 - 3\"\n  - Row 8: \"8 - 6\"\n  - Row 9: \"10 - 8\"\n  - Row 10: \"7 - 3\"\n  - Row 11: \"6 - 3\"\n  - Row 12: Postponed\n  - Row 13: \"7 - 3\"\n  - Row 14: \"7 - 3\"\n  - Row 15: \"6 - 1\"\n  - Row 16: \"8 - 7\"\n  - Row 17: \"6 - 1\"\n  - Row 18: \"4 - 3\"\n  - Row 19: \"14 - 8\"\n  - Row 20: \"3 - 2\"\n  - Row 21: \"5 - 2\"\n  - Row 22: \"6 - 2\"\n  - Row 23: \"3 - 2\"\n  - Row 24: \"10 - 4\"\n  - Row 25: \"8 - 4\"\n  - Row 26: \"4 - 3\"\n  - Row 27: \"8 - 3\"\n\nNone of these scores indicate a shutout (zero points for either team).\n\nThe claim states that shutouts occurred only on September 2 and September 5, which matches our findings.\n\nThus, the claim is verified as true.
