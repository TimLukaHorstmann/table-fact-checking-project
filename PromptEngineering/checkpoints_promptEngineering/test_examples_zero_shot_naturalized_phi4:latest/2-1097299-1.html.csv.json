The claim states that \"2/3 of the judges appointed have more than 10 years to go until their mandatory retirement.\"\n\nLet's break down how to assess this:\n- We first need to count the total number of judges listed.\n- Then, determine how many of these judges have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement.\n\nRelevant data from the table is found in the column \"years until mandatory retirement\" for each row.
