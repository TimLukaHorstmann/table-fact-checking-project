The Deacon was indeed shut out three times (Rows 4, 6, and 7).\n2.

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to evaluate two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Whether there are seven games played in North Carolina.\n2. If these games were all held at the same stadium.\n\nLet's analyze each condition based on the provided data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Played in North Carolina\n\nWe will look for entries where the \"location\" indicates a site within North Carolina (NC). The relevant column is \"location,\" and we need to identify which rows mention locations in NC.\n\n- **Row 1:** Location: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- **Row 5:** Location: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- **Row 6:** Location: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- **Row 7:** Location: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- **Row 9:** Location: wallace wade stadium durham , nc\n- **Row 10:** Location: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- **Row 11:** Location: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n\nThere are seven games listed in North Carolina, confirming the first part of the claim.\n\n### Step 2: Check if All These Games Were Played at the Same Stadium\n\nFrom the previous analysis, we observe:\n\n- The majority (six out of seven) were played at \"groves stadium winston - salem , nc.\"\n- One game was played at a different North Carolina location: \"wallace wade stadium durham , nc\" (Row 9).\n\nSince not all games in North Carolina were held at the same stadium, the claim does not hold true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because one of the seven games in North Carolina was not played at the \"groves stadium winston - salem,\" but rather at a different location. Therefore, only six out of seven games were at the same venue.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those indicating the opponent and the location where games took place:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the highest number of points anyone scored be below 50,\" we need to examine the \"result\" column in each row of the table. The relevant information is the point totals for both teams, as they represent the scores from their respective games.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Extract Points**: For each game result, extract and compare the points scored by both teams.\n2. **Determine Maximum Score**: Identify the highest score from these extracted values across all rows.\n3. **Compare Against Claim Threshold**: Check if this maximum score is below 50.\n\nNow, let's analyze each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Result: \"w 26 - 20\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 26\n  - Opponent points: 20\n\n- **Row 2**: Result: \"l 10 - 56\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 10\n  - Opponent points: 56 (Highest score so far)\n\n- **Row 3**: Result: \"l 6 - 45\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 6\n  - Opponent points: 45\n\n- **Row 4**: Result: \"l 0 - 23\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 0\n  - Opponent points: 23\n\n- **Row 5**: Result: \"l 13 - 42\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 13\n  - Opponent points: 42\n\n- **Row 6**: Result: \"l 0 - 21\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 0\n  - Opponent points: 21\n\n- **Row 7**: Result: \"l 0 - 31\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 0\n  - Opponent points: 31\n\n- **Row 8**: Result: \"l 3 - 35\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 3\n  - Opponent points: 35\n\n- **Row 9**: Result: \"w 9 - 7\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 9\n  - Opponent points: 7\n\n- **Row 10**: Result: \"l 12 - 15\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 12\n  - Opponent points: 15\n\n- **Row 11**: Result: \"l 9 - 44\"  \n  - Points scored by the team: 9\n  - Opponent points: 44\n\nThe highest score identified is 56 from Row 2, where SMU scored against the team. Since this value exceeds the claim's threshold of below 50, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows to verify the claim are those with the \"result\" column containing scores where at least one number meets or exceeds 50. These rows are:\n\n- Row 2: result column (\"l 10 - 56\")\n- Any other row that might have had a score of 50 or more, if applicable.\n\nFinal JSON output:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Row 3 and Row 11 also involve scores close to the threshold but do not exceed it, hence are not relevant for determining falsehood.",
