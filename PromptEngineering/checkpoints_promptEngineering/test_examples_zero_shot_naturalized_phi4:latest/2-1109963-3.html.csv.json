The age at that performance is greater than 45 years.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: Performance is 60.73 m, Age is 45. This meets the performance condition but not the age condition (age must be more than 45).\n- **Row 2** to **Row 22**: None of these rows have a performance of 60.73 m.\n\nSince there are no other instances in the table where the performance is 60.73 m and the age is greater than 45, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cell for this verification is from Row 1, specifically for the columns \"performance\" and \"age.\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"performance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"age\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, the claim specifies that when achieving first place at the highest age (39), a certain performance should be met. We need to check if this condition aligns with any achievement at age 39.\n\n- **Condition 2**: Check if at age 39, the athlete achieved a performance of 62.20 meters:\n  - Row 7: Age 39, Performance: 62.20 m\n\nNow, let's verify the claim:\n\n- The highest age for achieving first place is actually 45 (Row 1), not 39.\n- At age 39, the athlete did achieve a performance of 62.20 meters and placed first.\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the highest age for a first-place finish was 39 when it was actually 45.
