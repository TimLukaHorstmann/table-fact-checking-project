None of the rows satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for evaluation are from Row 2 because it partially satisfies one condition (score = 3 - 1).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
