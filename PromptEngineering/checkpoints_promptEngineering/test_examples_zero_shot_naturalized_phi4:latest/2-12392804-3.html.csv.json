    "resp": "To verify the claim about Ukraine's total score and medal distribution, we need to check specific details from the table:\n\n1. **Total Score**: The claim states that Ukraine has a \"total score of 2\". We must locate the row corresponding to Ukraine and confirm the value in the \"total\" column.\n\n2. **Gold Medals**: The claim specifies \"0 gold\", so we need to ensure that the \"gold\" column for Ukraine shows a value of 0.\n\n3. **Silver Medals**: The claim mentions \"1 silver\", requiring us to verify that the \"silver\" column for Ukraine has a value of 1.\n\nNow, let's locate these details in the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: Ukraine is listed on Row 9.\n- **Columns to Check**:\n  - \"total\": Should be 2.\n  - \"gold\": Should be 0.\n  - \"silver\": Should be 1.\n\nChecking Row 9:\n- The \"nation\" column confirms it's Ukraine.\n- The \"total\" column shows a value of 2, which matches the claim.\n- The \"gold\" column shows a value of 0, which matches the claim.\n- The \"silver\" column shows a value of 1, which matches the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are verified as true based on the table data, we conclude that the claim is TRUE. Here is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
