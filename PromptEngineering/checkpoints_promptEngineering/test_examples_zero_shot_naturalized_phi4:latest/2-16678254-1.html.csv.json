The result of the game was a win (\"W\") with a score of 65 - 20.\n\nWe'll evaluate these conditions using the provided data:\n\n- **Week**: We are looking for row 8, as it corresponds to week 8 based on the table's naturalized format (indexing starts from 0).\n\n- **Result and Score**: For row 8:\n  - The \"result\" should be a win (\"W\").\n  - The score should be 65 - 20.\n\nNow let's check Row 8:\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Week: 8 (Correct)\n  - Date: November 13, 1949\n  - Opponent: New York Bulldogs\n  - Result: W 65 - 20 (Matches the claim)\n  - Record: 4 - 4\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are met in Row 8, the statement is verified as TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to check these conditions include:\n- The \"week\" column for confirming it's Week 8.\n- The \"result\" and score details within that week.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of it against the data in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"there be a result of w 65 - 20 after week 9 on november 13 , 1949\".\n\n1. **\"after week 9\":**\n   - This implies that we should look at weeks 10, 11, and 12 for the results.\n\n2. **\"on november 13 , 1949\":**\n   - We need to check if there is a result on this specific date in the table.\n\n3. **\"a result of w 65 - 20\":**\n   - The game should have resulted in a win with a score of 65-20.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Check for results after week 9:**\n   - Week 10: November 27, 1949 (green bay packers) -> Result: \"w 41 - 21\"\n   - Week 11: December 4, 1949 (los angeles rams) -> Result: \"w 31 - 27\"\n   - Week 12: December 11, 1949 (chicago bears) -> Result: \"l 52 - 21\"\n\n2. **Check for the specific date November 13, 1949:**\n   - From Row 8: Date is indeed November 13, 1949.\n   - The result on this date is \"w 65 - 20\", and it matches the claimed score.\n\n3. **Determine if this result occurred after week 9:**\n   - Week 9 ends on November 20, 1949.\n   - Therefore, the game on November 13, 1949 (week 8) is not \"after\" week 9 but before it.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim specifies that the win with a score of 65-20 should occur after week 9. However, this particular result occurred in Week 8, which is before week 9. Therefore, the condition specified by \"after week 9\" is not met.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are from Row 8 (index 7), which contain the date and result for November 13, 1949.",
