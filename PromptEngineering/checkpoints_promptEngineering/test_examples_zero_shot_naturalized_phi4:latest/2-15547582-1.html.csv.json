We focus on those columns across these rows:\n\n- **Row 1 (Fianna F\u00e1il)**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel\n\n- **Row 6 (Independent)**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
