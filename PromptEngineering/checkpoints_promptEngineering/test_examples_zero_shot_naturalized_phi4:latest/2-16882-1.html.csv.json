    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"subsidiary be primarily locate in the uk,\" we need to evaluate the locations and types of companies listed in the table.\n\nThe relevant criteria for evaluating this claim include:\n1. The type of company must be a subsidiary.\n2. We need to check where these subsidiaries are incorporated (i.e., their location).\n\nWe'll go through each row of the table, focusing on entries where the \"type\" is \"subsidiary,\" and record whether they are incorporated in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.\n\n1. **Row 1: cobalt ground solutions**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: United Kingdom\n\n2. **Row 2: cygnific**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n3. **Row 6: klm asia**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Taiwan\n\n4. **Row 7: klm catering services**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n5. **Row 8: klm cityhopper**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n6. **Row 9: klm cityhopper uk**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: United Kingdom\n\n7. **Row 10: klm equipment services**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n8. **Row 11: klm financial services**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n9. **Row 12: klm flight academy**\n   - Type: Subsidiary\n   - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n10. **Row 13: klm health services**\n    - Type: Subsidiary\n    - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n11. **Row 14: klm uk engineering**\n    - Type: Subsidiary\n    - Incorporated in: United Kingdom\n\n12. **Row 15: martinair**\n    - Type: Subsidiary\n    - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\n13. **Row 17: transaviacom**\n    - Type: Subsidiary\n    - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n\nNow, let's count the subsidiaries and see where they are primarily incorporated:\n\n- Subsidiaries incorporated in the United Kingdom: 3 (rows 1, 9, 14)\n- Subsidiaries not incorporated in the United Kingdom: 10 (rows 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17)\n\nSince there are more subsidiaries incorporated outside the UK than within it, the claim is FALSE. The relevant rows and columns for this analysis are \"type\" and \"incorporated in.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
