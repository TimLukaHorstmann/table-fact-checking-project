    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ec erkersreuth in position 3 have 15 point\" is true or false, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The team named \"ec erkersreuth\" should be in position 3.\n2. The points for \"ec erkersreuth\" should be 15.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row and check these conditions against the relevant data:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Position: 1\n  - Name: ec amberg\n  - This row does not match either condition, so it is irrelevant for our verification.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Position: 2\n  - Name: ehc regensburg\n  - This row also does not match either condition and is thus irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Position: 3\n  - Name: ec erkersreuth\n  - Played: 12, Drawn: 1, Lost: 4, Points: 15\n  - This row matches both conditions:\n    - The name \"ec erkersreuth\" is in position 3.\n    - The points for \"ec erkersreuth\" are indeed 15.\n\n- **Row 4** and subsequent rows**: \n  - These rows do not need to be checked because the first relevant match (both conditions satisfied) has already been found in Row 3.\n\nGiven that both conditions are met by Row 3, we can conclude that the claim is true.
