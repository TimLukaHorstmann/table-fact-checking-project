    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"wales be the opposing team with the against of 9\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table and verify if there is a row where:\n\n1. The \"opposing teams\" column has the value \"wales\".\n2. The \"against\" column in that same row has the value \"9\".\n\nLet's examine each relevant row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Opposing Teams: france\n  - Against: 15\n  - This does not match our criteria.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Opposing Teams: wales\n  - Against: 9\n  - This matches both conditions in the claim.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Opposing Teams: scotland\n  - Against: 0\n  - This does not match our criteria.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Opposing Teams: ireland\n  - Against: 9\n  - Although \"against\" is 9, the opposing team is not \"wales\".\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Opposing Teams: new zealand\n  - Against: 16\n  - This does not match our criteria.\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2 where both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, we can construct the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
