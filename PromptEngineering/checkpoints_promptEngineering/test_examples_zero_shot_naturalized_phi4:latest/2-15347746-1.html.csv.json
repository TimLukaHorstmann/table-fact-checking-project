This supports part of the claim.\n\n2. **Round and Team Check**:\n   - Round: Landon Cohen was picked in round 7. This aligns with the claim.\n   - Team: However, he plays for Ohio, not Colorado. This contradicts the claim.\n\nSince one condition (the team being \"colorado\") is false, the overall claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are from Row 8:\n- Column: Round\n- Column: Position\n- Column: Team\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
