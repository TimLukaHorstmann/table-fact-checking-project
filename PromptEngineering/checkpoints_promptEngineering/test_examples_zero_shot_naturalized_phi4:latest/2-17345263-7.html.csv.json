If it matches, then we further verify if the attendance number is 80079.\n\nNow let's evaluate the rows one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: Opponent is \"virginia tech\" (not matching), so skip checking attendance.\n- **Row 2**: Opponent is \"chattanooga\" (not matching), so skip checking attendance.\n- **Row 3**: Opponent is \"ohio\" (not matching), so skip checking attendance.\n- **Row 4**: Opponent is \"army\" (not matching), so skip checking attendance.\n- **Row 5**: Opponent is \"uab\" (not matching), so skip checking attendance.\n- **Row 6**: Opponent is \"alabama\". Check the attendance, which is 80079. This row matches both conditions of the claim.\n- **Row 7 to Row 12**: None have \"alabama\" as the opponent.\n\nSince Row 6 satisfies both conditions (opponent being \"alabama\" and attendance being 80079), the claim is supported by this row in the table.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE.
