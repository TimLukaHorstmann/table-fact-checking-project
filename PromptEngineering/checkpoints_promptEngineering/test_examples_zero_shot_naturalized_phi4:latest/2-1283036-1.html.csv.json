Determine if this completion date is exactly five months after another screening's completion.\n\nLet's examine the table for these details:\n\n- **Screening Completed on June 30, 2006:**  \n  From Row 5, we see: \"screening started: 9 march 2006, screening completed: 28 april 2006,\" but this does not match.  \n  From Row 15, we find: \"screening started: 3 april 2006, screening completed: 2 june 2006,\" still not matching.  \n  Finally, from Row 18, it states: \"screening started: 33 out of 33, screening completed: 33 out of 33,\" which is irrelevant for specific dates.  \n  Correctly, in Row 3: \"screening completed: 3 march 2006\" and Row 17: \"screening completed: 30 june 2006.\" Thus, the relevant row is Row 17.\n\n- **Screening Completed on October 4, 2006:**  \n  None of the rows explicitly state \"October 4, 2006,\" but we can check for completions in October.  \n  From Row 12: \"screening completed: 10 october 2006.\"  \n  From Row 13: \"screening completed: 13 october 2006.\"\n\nNow, let's verify the time difference:\n\n- **Row 17:** Screening completed on June 30, 2006.\n- **Closest Completion to October 4, 2006:** Row 12 has a completion date of October 10, 2006.\n\nCalculating the months between these dates:\n- From June 30, 2006, to October 10, 2006, is approximately 3.5 months, not exactly five months.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the screening complete on 30 june 2006 be start 5 month after the screening that be complete on 4 october 2006\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 17 for June 30, 2006 completion.\n- Rows 12 and 13 for October completions (though neither matches exactly with October 4).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"screening completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"screening completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"screening completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
