We need to check if there's a row corresponding to this team.\n\n2. **Pick 2**: The claim specifies pick number 2. Therefore, we should look for a row where \"pick\" equals 2.\n\n3. **Player: Cam Yeow**: Finally, the player chosen is stated as Cam Yeow. We need to ensure that in the identified row, the \"player\" column contains this name.\n\nNow let's go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - CFL Team: Calgary Stampeders\n  - Pick: 1\n  - This does not match any condition in our claim.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - CFL Team: Ottawa Renegades\n  - Pick: 2\n  - Player: Cam Yeow\n  - All parts of the claim are satisfied here. The team is indeed the Ottawa Renegades, the pick number matches, and the player chosen is Cam Yeow.\n\n- **Row 3 to Row 7**:\n  - None of these rows match the conditions outlined in the claim (i.e., both CFL Team and Pick).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the relevant cells supporting the truthfulness of the claim are found entirely within Row 2. \n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
