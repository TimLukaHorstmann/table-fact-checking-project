    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to examine specific cells in the provided table and compare them with the statement given.\n\nThe claim is: \"autumn gold have a 2007 - 08 of c and players' have 2007 - 08 of q\".\n\nLet's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. **\"Autumn Gold have a 2007-08 of c\"**\n   - Locate the row for \"autumn gold\".\n   - Find the column labeled \"2007 - 08\".\n   - Check if the value in this cell is \"c\".\n\n2. **\"Players' have 2007-08 of q\"**\n   - Locate the row for \"players'\".\n   - Find the column labeled \"2007 - 08\".\n   - Check if the value in this cell is \"q\".\n\nNow, let's examine these specific cells from the table:\n\n- For \"autumn gold\", Row 1:\n  - Column \"2007 - 08\" has the value \"c\". This supports the first part of the claim.\n\n- For \"players'\", Row 5:\n  - Column \"2007 - 08\" has the value \"q\". This supports the second part of the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table, so the entire claim is true.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n1. **Autumn Gold (Row 1, Column \"2007 - 08\")**\n   - Row index: 0 (since indexing starts from 0)\n   - Column name: \"2007 - 08\"\n\n2. **Players' (Row 5, Column \"2007 - 08\")**\n   - Row index: 4\n   - Column name: \"2007 - 08\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007 - 08\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007 - 08\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
