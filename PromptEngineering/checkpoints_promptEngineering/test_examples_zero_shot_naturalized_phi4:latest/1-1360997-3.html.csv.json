    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"d beadman be the jockey at rosehill and the weight be 57.5 kg\" is true or false, we must evaluate each condition against the data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify rows with the venue \"rosehill\":**\n   - Row 1: Venue = Rosehill\n   - Row 11: Venue = Rosehill\n\n2. **Check if D. Beadman is the jockey for those rows:**\n   - Row 1: Jockey = D. Beadman\n   - Row 11: Jockey = D.

Beadman, and the weight is 57.5 kg.\n- For Row 11, although the venue is Rosehill and the jockey is D. Beadman, the weight is not 57.5 kg but 58.0 kg.\n\nSince at least one row (Row 1) satisfies all conditions of the claim, it is sufficient to conclude that the claim can be true based on this evidence.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 1: Venue = Rosehill, Jockey = D. Beadman, Weight (kg) = 57.5\n- Row 11: Venue = Rosehill, Jockey = D.

Here, \"Platinum Scissors\" is listed as 2nd in the \"winner / 2nd\" column and this row matches both criteria of the time and the position of \"Platinum Scissors.\"\n\nSince Row 3 satisfies all conditions specified in the claim (time and position), we conclude that:\n\n- The table entry with a time of \"1:36.30\" indeed shows \"Platinum Scissors\" as second place.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Time from Row 3\n- Winner / 2nd column in Row 3\n\nThus, our JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner / 2nd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
