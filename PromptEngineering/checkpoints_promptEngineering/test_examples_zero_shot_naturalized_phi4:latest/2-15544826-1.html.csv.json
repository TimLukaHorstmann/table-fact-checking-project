    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to understand what a \"greg pursley score\" might refer to based on the context of the table provided. The table contains data related to racing performance over different years, with columns such as races, wins, top 5 finishes, and so forth.\n\nThe term \"greg pursley score\" is not directly explained in the table, but it seems reasonable to assume that this score could be a composite measure based on several of these metrics. However, without explicit details about how the score is calculated, we will need to infer from available data what might constitute such a performance score.\n\nConsidering typical measures for racing performance:\n- Wins are highly valuable.\n- Consistently high top 5 or top 10 finishes are also important.\n- Poles (pole positions) indicate strong starting positions.\n- Lower average start and finish numbers usually indicate better overall performance, as lower ranks in these averages mean starting and finishing closer to the front.\n\nNow let's compare the relevant data from the years 2002 and 2007:\n\n**Year 2002:**\n- Races: 10\n- Wins: 0\n- Top 5 finishes: 2\n- Top 10 finishes: 5\n- Poles: 0\n- Avg start: 9.2\n- Avg finish: 10.2\n- Season rank: 9th\n\n**Year 2007:**\n- Races: 1\n- Wins: 0\n- Top 5 finishes: 0\n- Top 10 finishes: 0\n- Poles: 0\n- Avg start: 22.0\n- Avg finish: 29.0\n- Season rank: 69th\n\nBy comparing these two years:\n1. In 2002, there were more races (10 vs. 1 in 2007), which provides a broader base for performance evaluation.\n2. The number of top 5 and top 10 finishes is greater in 2002 than in 2007 (top 5: 2 vs. 0; top 10: 5 vs. 0).\n3. The average start position was better in 2002 (9.2) compared to 2007 (22.0), and the average finish position was also superior in 2002 (10.2) compared to 2007 (29.0).\n4. The season rank is significantly higher for 2002 (9th) than for 2007 (69th).\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that the performance in 2002 was better across multiple metrics compared to 2007.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to determine that if \"greg pursley score\" reflects overall racing performance, it would indeed be lower in 2002 than in 2007 due to the inferior metrics of 2007.\n\nRelevant cells for this determination:\n- Year 2002: avg start (9.2), avg finish (10.2), top 5 finishes (2), top 10 finishes (5), season rank (9th)\n- Year 2007: avg start (22.0), avg finish (29.0), top 5 finishes (0), top 10 finishes (0), season rank (69th)\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"avg start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"avg finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
