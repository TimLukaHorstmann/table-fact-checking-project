    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"every team have several win,\" we need to examine each row in the table and focus specifically on the 'wins' column for each entry. The claim suggests that every team should have more than one win.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row 1:** Team: bvm minardi team, Wins: 0\n- **Row 2:** Team: bvm minardi team, Wins: 0\n- **Row 3:** Team: bvm minardi team, Wins: 4\n- **Row 4:** Team: bvm minardi team, Wins: 0\n- **Row 5:** Team: bvm minardi team, Wins: 0\n- **Row 6:** Team: manor motorsport, Wins: 0\n- **Row 7:** Team: manor motorsport, Wins: 0\n- **Row 8:** Team: bvm - target racing, Wins: 3\n- **Row 9:** Team: s fortec motorsport, Wins: 0\n\nFrom this analysis, we can observe that:\n\n- The team \"bvm minardi team\" has only one row (Row 3) where they have several wins (4 wins), but in all other rows involving them, they do not have any wins.\n- The team \"manor motorsport\" does not have any wins across both of its entries (Rows 6 and 7).\n- The team \"bvm - target racing\" has several wins (3 wins) in Row 8.\n- The team \"s fortec motorsport\" has no wins in Row 9.\n\nThe claim specifies that every team should have several wins, but as seen from the analysis:\n\n1. \"manor motorsport\" and \"s fortec motorsport\" do not meet this criterion at all.\n2. \"bvm minardi team\" only meets this criterion once across multiple entries.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because not every team has several wins.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
