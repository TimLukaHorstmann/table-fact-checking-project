    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table regarding the number of players from England and the United States during the second round.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that there are more players from England than from the United States during the event's second round.\n\n2. **Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to focus on the \"country\" column to identify the nationality of each player.\n   - Additionally, we should consider only the scores from the second round to verify participation in that specific round.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - The table provides the total score for both rounds (sum of two rounds) and the \"to par\" value, but not individual round scores directly. However, since each row represents a player's total performance over two rounds, we can infer participation.\n   - We need to count players from England and the United States.\n\n4. **Count Players by Country**:\n   - From the table:\n     - **United States**: Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk, Jason Dufner, Phil Mickelson, Arron Oberholser (5 players)\n     - **England**: Kenneth Ferrie (1 player)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are 5 players from the United States and only 1 player from England.\n   - Therefore, there are more players from the United States than from England during the event's second round.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because there are not more players from England than from the United States in the second round.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- We need to look at the \"country\" column for each row to verify the nationalities of the players.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
