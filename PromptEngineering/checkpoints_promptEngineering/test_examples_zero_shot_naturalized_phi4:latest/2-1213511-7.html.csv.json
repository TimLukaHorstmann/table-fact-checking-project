However, for the claim to be fully true, the player must also have Canadian nationality.\n\nThe player, Dale Smedsmo, is of United States nationality, not Canada. Therefore, the second condition is not met.\n\nGiven that both conditions are necessary and only one has been satisfied (the first), the entire claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to check for this evaluation were:\n- From Row 9: \"nationality\", \"nhl team\", and \"college / junior / club team\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the list of relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
