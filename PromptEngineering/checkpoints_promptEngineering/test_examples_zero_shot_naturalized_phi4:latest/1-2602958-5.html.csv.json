    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino direct more than 3 episodes together\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to identify relevant information concerning both directors for each episode.\n\n1. **Identify Rows Where Amy Sherman-Palladino is Director:**\n   - Row 1: Director = \"amy sherman - palladino\"\n   - Row 3: Director = \"matthew diamond\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 6: Director = \"matthew diamond\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 9: Director = \"jamie babbit\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 13: Director = \"stephen clancy\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 15: Director = \"marita grabiak\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 16: Director = \"jamie babbit\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 17: Director = \"daniel palladino\"\n   - Row 18: Director = \"michael zinberg\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 19: Director = \"matthew diamond\" (not relevant)\n\n2. **Identify Rows Where Daniel Palladino is Director:**\n   - Row 2: Director = \"chris long\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 4: Director = \"chris long\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 7: Director = \"chris long\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 8: Director = \"tom moore\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 12: Director = \"kenny ortega\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 14: Director = \"chris long\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 17: Director = \"daniel palladino\"\n   - Row 20: Director = \"chris long\" (not relevant)\n\n3. **Check for Rows Where Both Are Directors or Writers Together:**\n   We look at rows where both are involved in writing, as this might imply collaboration:\n   \n   - Row 1: Writer(s) = \"amy sherman - palladino\"\n   - Row 2: Writer(s) = \"daniel palladino\" (not relevant)\n   - Row 3: Writer(s) = \"amy sherman - palladino , daniel palladino\" (relevant for writing, not directing)\n   - Row 6: Writer(s) = \"amy sherman - palladino\"\n   - Row 9: Writer(s) = \"amy sherman - palladino\"\n   - Row 13: Director = \"daniel palladino\", Writer(s) = \"daniel palladino\" (relevant for directing and writing)\n   - Row 17: Director = \"daniel palladino\", Writer(s) = \"daniel palladino\" (relevant for directing but not collaborating with Amy Sherman-Palladino in this role)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   From the analysis, the only row where both Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino are involved together as directors is Row 17. There are no other rows where they direct an episode together.\n\nThus, the claim that \"Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino direct more than 3 episodes together\" is not supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Writer(s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Writer(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
