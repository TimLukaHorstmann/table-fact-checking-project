    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about whether there were no party flips in any district during the 1822 North Carolina House of Representatives election, we need to examine each row in the table and check for changes in the party holding the seat.\n\nThe key columns relevant to this evaluation are \"party,\" \"incumbent,\" and \"result.\" We specifically look for instances where an incumbent did not get re-elected, indicating a possible change in party control of that district. The term \"hold\" indicates no party flip when coupled with specific results or candidate details.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Incumbent: Hutchins G Burton (Democratic-Republican)\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - No party flip here as the incumbent was re-elected.\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Incumbent: William S Blackledge (Democratic-Republican) retired.\n   - Result: Democratic-Republican hold\n   - Indicates no party flip since the seat remained with the Democratic-Republicans after retirement.\n\n3. **Row 3**: \n   - Incumbent: Charles Hooks (Democratic-Republican)\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - No party flip as the incumbent was re-elected.\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - Incumbent: Weldon N Edwards (Democratic-Republican)\n   - Result: Re-elected with 100%\n   - Again, no party flip as the incumbent won re-election.\n\n5. **Row 5**: \n   - Incumbent: Archibald McNeill (Federalist) retired.\n   - Result: Federalist hold\n   - This indicates that despite retirement, the seat remained a Federalist one with John Culpepper winning, so no party flip.\n\n6. **Row 6**:\n   - Incumbent: Romulus M Saunders (Democratic-Republican)\n   - Result: Re-elected with 100%\n   - No party flip as the incumbent was re-elected.\n\n7. **Row 7**: \n   - Incumbent: John Long (Democratic-Republican)\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - No party flip since the incumbent retained his seat.\n\nIn each row, either the incumbents were re-elected or there was a hold by their respective parties upon retirement.
