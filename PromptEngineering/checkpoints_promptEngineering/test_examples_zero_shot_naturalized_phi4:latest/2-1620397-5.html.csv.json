    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the release date average 1 every 2 month,\" we need to analyze the release dates in the table and determine if, on average, a new series is released approximately every two months.\n\nHere's how we can break down the task:\n\n1. **Extract Release Dates**: Identify all the relevant cells containing the release dates from each row of the table.\n   \n2. **Calculate Time Intervals Between Releases**:\n   - Convert each month into a numerical format to simplify calculations (e.g., January = 1, February = 2, ..., December = 12).\n   - Calculate the number of months between consecutive releases.\n\n3. **Average Interval Calculation**:\n   - Sum up all the intervals calculated.\n   - Divide by the total number of intervals to find the average interval in months.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: Compare the calculated average with the claim's assertion of \"1 every 2 month.\"\n\nLet\u2019s go through these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Extract Release Dates**:\n   - Row 1: October 2011\n   - Row 2: November 2011\n   - Row 3: December 2011\n   - Row 4: May 2012\n   - Row 5: June 2012\n   - Row 6: July 2012\n   - Row 7: August 2012\n   - Row 8: September 2012\n\n2. **Calculate Time Intervals**:\n   - October to November = 1 month\n   - November to December = 1 month\n   - December to May = 5 months (December 2011 to December 2012 is 12 months; subtracting the remaining months gives 5)\n   - May to June = 1 month\n   - June to July = 1 month\n   - July to August = 1 month\n   - August to September = 1 month\n\n3. **Average Interval Calculation**:\n   - Total intervals: 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 months\n   - Number of intervals: 7\n   - Average interval = 11 / 7 \u2248 1.57 months\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The calculated average release interval is approximately 1.57 months.\n   - The claim suggests an average of 2 months per release.\n\nSince 1.57 months is less than 2 months, the statement that the releases occur \"on average, every 2 months\" is not accurate based on our calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because the actual average interval between releases is approximately 1.57 months, which is shorter than the claimed 2-month interval.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"released\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
