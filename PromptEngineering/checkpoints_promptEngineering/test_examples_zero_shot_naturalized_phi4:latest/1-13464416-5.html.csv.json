    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the team play on game 20 be the la lakers\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the relevant information in Row 20 of the table.\n\nThe specific elements to verify this claim include:\n- **Game number**: We must check that it corresponds with Game 20.\n- **Team**: This will confirm if the team mentioned for Game 20 is \"LA Lakers\".\n\nLet's examine these conditions:\n\n1. **Row Index**: The claim refers to \"game 20\". From the table, this corresponds directly to Row 5 (since the indexing starts from zero).\n   \n2. **Game Number Check**:\n   - In the table's format, each row begins with a column labeled \"game:\".\n   - For Row 5, under \"game:\", we have `20`, which matches Game 20 in the claim.\n\n3. **Team Name Check**:\n   - We need to check if the team name for this game is listed as \"LA Lakers\".\n   - In Row 5, under the column labeled \"team:\", we find \"la lakers\", which directly corresponds with \"the la lakers\" mentioned in the claim (note that case differences and spacing are negligible here).\n\nSince both conditions match exactly:\n- The game number for this row is 20.\n- The team listed is indeed \"LA Lakers\".\n\nThus, the entire condition of the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"LA Lakers be the team play in game 6,\" we need to examine the table provided and identify which row corresponds to Game 6.

Therefore, there are no relevant cells that correspond to Game 6. As a result, we cannot verify the claim using this table because it does not include information about Game 6.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE,\" and there are no relevant cells to list since the data for Game 6 is missing from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
