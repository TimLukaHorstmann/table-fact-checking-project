Check which of these fighters has the highest number of losses.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find Fighters with Exactly 21 Wins\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Row 1**: Rich Franklin has a record of \"21 - 6\", indicating 21 wins and 6 losses.\n- No other fighter in the table is mentioned to have exactly 21 wins.\n\nTherefore, Rich Franklin is the only fighter listed with 21 wins.\n\n### Step 2: Check Losses Among Fighters with 21 Wins\n\nSince Rich Franklin is the sole person with 21 wins, he automatically has the most losses among fighters with 21 wins. His record shows 6 losses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"Rich Franklin have the most loss among the fighter with 21 win.\" Given that he is the only one listed with 21 wins and has 6 losses, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells used to verify this:\n\n- Rich Franklin's record of wins and losses: **Row 1** (columns related to \"record\" or both \"21 - 6\")\n\nThe final JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output identifies the relevant cell that confirms Rich Franklin's record and validates the claim.",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine if Wanderlei Silva has the least number of losses among all fighters with 21 wins in the given table.\n\n1. **Identify Fighters with 21 Wins:**\n   - We will scan through each row of the table and look for rows where the \"record\" column indicates a fighter has achieved at least 21 wins (i.e., any record where the number before the dash is greater than or equal to 21).\n\n2. **Check Losses for Each Fighter with 21 Wins:**\n   - For every identified fighter, check their number of losses from the \"record\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Wanderlei Silva\u2019s Record:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Wanderlei Silva.\n   - Check his record and note his number of losses.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Compare Wanderlei Silva's losses with those of other fighters who have 21 wins to determine if he has the least number of losses.\n\n**Steps Applied:**\n\n- We look at each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 22:** \n   - Fighter: Kevin Randleman, Record: 7 - 1 (Less than 21 wins)\n\n2. **Row 23:** \n   - Fighter: Jeff Monson, Record: 6 - 1 (Less than 21 wins)\n\n3. Continue similarly for all rows until:\n\n4. **Row 8:** \n   - Fighter: Wanderlei Silva, Record: 8 - 5 (less than 21 wins)\n\n- Upon checking every row:\n  - No fighter has a record with 21 or more wins in the table.\n\nSince no fighters have achieved 21 wins, we cannot compare losses among them. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that Wanderlei Silva \"has the least loss\" as there are no other fighters to compare against for this condition in the provided data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is false because no fighter with 21 or more wins exists in the table; hence, we cannot evaluate Wanderlei Silva's losses relative to others with 21 wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This is found in Row 18: \n     - Record against Vitor Belfort with method \"decision (unanimous)\".\n   \n2. **Determine Opponents of These Fights**:\n   - From the identified fights, note the opponents. In this case, the opponent was Vitor Belfort.\n\n3. **Check Wins for Opponents**:\n   - We need to check if Wanderlei Silva is an opponent from any fight won by decision and compare his number of wins against other such opponents.\n   - Check if Wanderlei Silva appears in the table as a fighter Chuck Liddell defeated by decision: \n     - From Row 20, we see that Wanderlei Silva was defeated by Chuck Liddell via KO (punch) at Pride 14.\n\n4. **Verify Conditions**:\n   - Since there is only one opponent from a fight won by decision (Vitor Belfort), and Wanderlei Silva did not win any fights against Chuck Liddell by decision, we cannot compare the number of wins for them.\n   - Thus, the claim that Wanderlei Silva has the lowest number of wins amongst fighters defeated by decision is irrelevant because he wasn't defeated in such a manner.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim does not hold as there are no relevant comparisons to make regarding decisions.

Which fighters Chuck Liddell has faced with a decision outcome.\n2. How many wins each of these fighters has accumulated.\n\n**Steps for Verification:**\n\n- **Identify Decision Outcomes Against Chuck Liddell:**\n  - We look through the rows in the table for any fighter that fought against Chuck Liddell and check if the method was \"decision (unanimous)\" or similar decision outcomes.\n  - From the data, we observe that:\n    - Row 19: Fight between Chuck Liddell and Amar Suloev ended with a \"Decision (Unanimous)\" result for Liddell.\n    - Row 18: Fight against Vitor Belfort ended in a \"Decision (Unanimous)\" result for Liddell.\n\n- **Compile List of Fighters With Decisions Against Liddell:**\n  - Amar Suloev\n  - Vitor Belfort\n\n- **Count Wins for Each Fighter:**\n  - **Amar Suloev**: \n    - From Row 19, at the time of fighting Chuck Liddell, he had a record of \"10 - 1\" (meaning 10 wins).\n  \n  - **Vitor Belfort**:\n    - From Row 18, at the time of fighting Chuck Liddell, he had a record of \"11 - 1\" (meaning 11 wins).\n\n- **Include Noe Hernandez in List:**\n  - Noe Hernandez faced Chuck Liddell first (Row 29), resulting in a win for Liddell via decision.\n  - From Row 29, at the time of fighting Chuck Liddell, Noe Hernandez had a record of \"1 - 0\" (meaning 1 win).\n\n- **Rank Fighters by Number of Wins:**\n  - Vitor Belfort: 11 wins\n  - Amar Suloev: 10 wins\n  - Noe Hernandez: 1 win\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNoe Hernandez does not have the second-highest number of wins among fighters who faced Chuck Liddell with a decision outcome.
