    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding a specific match between Collingwood and North Melbourne on August 13th, 1966, we need to examine the relevant details from each row in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Date**:\n   - The claim specifies the date as \"August 13th, 1966.\" All rows in the table have this exact date, so every row is potentially relevant for further checking.\n\n2. **Locate the Home and Away Teams**:\n   - According to the claim, the home team should be Collingwood, and the away team should be North Melbourne.\n\n3. **Check Row by Row**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home Team: St Kilda\n     - Away Team: South Melbourne\n     - The teams don't match the claim.\n   \n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Home Team: Essendon\n     - Away Team: Fitzroy\n     - The teams don't match the claim.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Home Team: Collingwood\n     - Away Team: North Melbourne\n     - This row matches the claim exactly, with Collingwood as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team.\n\n   - **Rows 4 to 6**: \n     - Checking these rows is unnecessary once we have identified Row 3 as matching the claim. However, for completeness:\n       - All teams listed do not match the specified home (Collingwood) or away (North Melbourne) teams in the claim.\n\n4. **Conclude Verification**:\n   - The condition that \"on August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne while the home team was Collingwood\" is indeed true as per Row 3.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify this claim, the relevant cells are those specifying the date and both teams involved in each row. Specifically for the correct row (Row 3), these columns are necessary:\n- \"home team\": to confirm it matches \"Collingwood\".\n- \"away team\": to confirm it matches \"North Melbourne\".\n- \"date\": to ensure it is \"13 August 1966\".\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
