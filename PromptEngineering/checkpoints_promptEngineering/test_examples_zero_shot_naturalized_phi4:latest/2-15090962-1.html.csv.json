    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"all of the school be name after the city in which they be locate\" is true or false, we need to check each row of the table and verify whether the `school` name matches its corresponding `location`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - School: chesterton\n  - Location: chesterton\n  - The school name matches the location. \n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - School: crown point\n  - Location: crown point\n  - The school name matches the location.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - School: lake central\n  - Location: saint john\n  - The school name does not match the location.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - School: laporte\n  - Location: laporte\n  - The school name matches the location.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - School: merrillville\n  - Location: merrillville\n  - The school name matches the location.\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - School: michigan city\n  - Location: michigan city\n  - The school name matches the location.\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - School: portage\n  - Location: portage\n  - The school name matches the location.\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - School: valparaiso\n  - Location: valparaiso\n  - The school name matches the location.\n\nFrom this examination, we find that Row 3 does not satisfy the condition because \"lake central\" is not named after its location \"saint john\".
