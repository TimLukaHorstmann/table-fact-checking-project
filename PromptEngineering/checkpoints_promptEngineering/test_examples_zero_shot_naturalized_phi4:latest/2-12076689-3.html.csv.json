Then, for each occurrence of this attendance figure, we must check what the corresponding 'record' value is.\n\nBy inspecting the table:\n\n- Row 30 has an attendance of 19,131 and a record of \"28 - 25\".\n- There are no other rows with an attendance of 19,131.\n\nNow, comparing the actual record from row 30 (\"28 - 25\") to the claimed record (\"38 - 25\"), we find that they do not match. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo support this conclusion, we need references to specific cells in the table:\n\n- The attendance value of 19,131 can be found in Row 30 under the 'attendance' column.\n- The corresponding record at this row and attendance figure is \"28 - 25\" in the 'record' column.\n\nThus, the relevant cells that help us determine the truthfulness of the claim are:\n- Row index 29 (since indexing typically starts from zero), Column name 'attendance'.\n- Row index 29, Column name 'record'.\n\nHere is the resulting JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
