This title appears related to a location.\n\n    - **Row 2:** Title is \"nantucket\" and Original Air Date is February 4, 2005.\n      - Nantucket is an island in Massachusetts, thus this title clearly refers to a location.\n\n    - **Row 3:** Title is \"salem\" and Original Air Date is February 18, 2005.\n      - Salem could refer to multiple places, but it is widely known as a city in Massachusetts.

This title is definitely a location.\n\n    - **Row 6:** Title is \"ashland\" and Original Air Date is May 3, 2005.\n      - Ashland could refer to several places, but it's common as a city or town name. It does seem related to a location.\n\n    - **Row 7:** Title is \"coos bay\" and Original Air Date is May 13, 2005.\n      - Coos Bay is a city in Oregon, definitely referring to a specific place.\n\n    - **Row 8:** Title is \"south beach\" and Original Air Date is June 10, 2005.\n      - South Beach typically refers to an area in Miami, Florida. It's related to a location.\n\n    - **Row 9:** Title is \"ft lauderdale\" and Original Air Date is July 8, 2005.\n      - Fort Lauderdale is a city in Florida, directly referring to a specific place.\n\n    - **Row 10:** Title is \"san juan\" and Original Air Date is July 22, 2005.\n      - San Juan could refer to the capital of Puerto Rico or other places, but it's commonly known as a location.\n\n    - **Row 11:** Title is \"antigua\" and Original Air Date is August 12, 2005.\n      - Antigua can refer to several locations, such as an island in the Caribbean. It seems related to a location.\n\n    - **Row 12:** Title is \"new york city\" and Original Air Date is December 2, 2005.\n      - New York City is a well-known major city, clearly referring to a specific place.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll episode titles correspond with known locations or place names.
