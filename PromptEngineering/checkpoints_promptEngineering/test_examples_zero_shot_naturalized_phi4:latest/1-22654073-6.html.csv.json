Therefore, it corresponds to the game mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Checking if Washington Wizards Played at Verizon Center**:\n   - In Row 3, the team listed is \"new york knicks\", not \"washington wizards\".\n   - The location attendance for this game is \"madison square garden\", not \"verizon center\".\n\nSince both conditions about the team and venue are incorrect in Row 3, we can conclude that the match on November 6 was not by Washington Wizards at Verizon Center.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

This indicates that LeBron James and Mo Williams both had high point scores. \n  - The specific score of LeBron James isn't directly mentioned here, but we know he's part of the high points listing alongside Mo Williams.\n\n- **Score Analysis**:\n  - Since Mo Williams is also listed with a high score of 21, it implies that LeBron James scored more than 21 points (as they are both considered \"high points\").\n  - However, the claim specifies that LeBron James must have scored over 34 points alone. The presence of Mo Williams in the high points column indicates that LeBron James did not score more than 34 points by himself since Mo Williams is also listed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that LeBron James alone had over 34 points on November 14, but given that another player (Mo Williams) shares the \"high points\" distinction with a score of 21, it implies LeBron James scored 34 or fewer points alone. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n- Row 6, Column: \"date\"\n- Row 6, Column: \"high points\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
