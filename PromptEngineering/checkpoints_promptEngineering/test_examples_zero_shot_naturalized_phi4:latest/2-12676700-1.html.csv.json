    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim:\n\n\"Before week 6, attendance at San Diego Charger game total 13000.\"\n\n1. **Identify relevant weeks**: The claim specifies \"before week 6.\" This means we are interested in games from weeks 1 to 5.\n\n2. **Locate the San Diego Chargers game**: We need to find any game involving the San Diego Chargers before week 6.\n\n3. **Check attendance for those games**:\n   - From the table, Row 3 corresponds to week 3 with the opponent being \"San Diego Chargers\" and an attendance of 13000.\n\n4. **Verify total attendance before week 6**:\n   - Since there is only one game against the San Diego Chargers before week 6 (week 3), we check its attendance.\n   - The attendance for this game is exactly 13000.\n\nSince the condition matches perfectly with the claim, the statement is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are from Row 3, specifically the \"opponent\" and \"attendance\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
