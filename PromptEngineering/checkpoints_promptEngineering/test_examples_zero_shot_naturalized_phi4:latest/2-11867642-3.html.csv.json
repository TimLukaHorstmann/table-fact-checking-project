    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"May 2 be the only date where the score be 7 - 3\", we need to examine each row in the table and focus specifically on the 'score' column, which details the outcomes of games.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this task is the \"score\" column because it contains information about game scores that can be compared against the score mentioned in the claim (7 - 3).\n\n2. **Check Each Row's Score**:\n   - Row 1: May 1, score: 6 - 1\n   - Row 2: May 2, score: 3 - 2\n   - Row 3: May 3, score: 3 - 0\n   - Row 4: May 4, score: 7 - 1\n   - Row 5: May 5, score: 7 - 1\n   - Row 6: May 6, score: 3 - 1\n   - Row 7: May 7, score: 9 - 8\n   - Row 8: May 9, score: 7 - 1\n   - Row 9: May 10, score: 9 - 6\n   - Row 10: May 11, score: 5 - 4\n   - Row 11: May 12, score: 8 - 4\n   - Row 12: May 13, score: 2 - 0\n   - Row 13: May 14, score: 2 - 1\n   - Row 14: May 16, score: 9 - 3\n   - Row 15: May 17, score: 7 - 2\n   - Row 16: May 18, score: 9 - 8\n   - Row 17: May 19, score: 9 - 4\n   - Row 18: May 20, score: 7 - 6\n   - Row 19: May 21, score: 1 - 0\n   - Row 20: May 22, score: 15 - 5\n   - Row 21: May 23, score: 7 - 3\n   - Row 22: May 24, score: 6 - 2\n   - Row 23: May 26, score: 3 - 0\n   - Row 24: May 27, score: 7 - 0\n   - Row 25: May 28, score: 5 - 4\n   - Row 26: May 29, score: 7 - 3\n   - Row 27: May 30, score: 8 - 3\n   - Row 28: May 31, score: 3 - 2\n\n3. **Analyze the Results**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"May 2 be the only date where the score be 7 - 3\".\n   - Upon reviewing each row's 'score', we find that on May 2, the score is 3 - 2, not 7 - 3.\n   - Additionally, there are two instances (Rows 21 and 26) where the score is 7 - 3: one for May 23 and another for May 29.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the condition \"May 2 be the only date where the score be 7 - 3\" does not hold because:\n   - On May 2, the score is not 7 - 3.\n   - There are other dates (May 23 and May 29) with a score of 7 - 3.\n\nThe claim is false. The relevant cells for verification include all rows' scores, but specifically the scores on May 2 (Row 2), May 23 (Row 21), and May 29 (Row 26).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
