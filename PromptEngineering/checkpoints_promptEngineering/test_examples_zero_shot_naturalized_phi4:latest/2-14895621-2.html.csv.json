The table does not explicitly list any outcomes or years directly related to a world championship victory.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim requires a world championship win in 1980, which is not supported by the data provided. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 4** for verifying the partnership, year, venue, and outcome.\n- **Rows 2 and 6** to confirm the partnership with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n- **Row 1** (header) to understand what \"world championships\" means in terms of columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
