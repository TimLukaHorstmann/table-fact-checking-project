    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Edgerrin James being the number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall, we need to verify these two conditions using the table provided:\n\n1. **Check if Edgerrin James was picked as the 4th pick in the first round:**\n   - The relevant columns for this condition are \"round\", \"pick\", and \"name\".\n   - We look at Row 1:\n     - Round is 1.\n     - Pick is 4.\n     - Name is Edgerrin James.\n\n2. **Check if Edgerrin James was the 4th overall pick:**\n   - The relevant columns for this condition are \"overall\" and \"name\".\n   - We look at Row 1:\n     - Overall is 4.\n     - Name is Edgerrin James.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied by the information in Row 1 of the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from Row 1 that verify these conditions include \"round\", \"pick\", \"overall\", and \"name\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
