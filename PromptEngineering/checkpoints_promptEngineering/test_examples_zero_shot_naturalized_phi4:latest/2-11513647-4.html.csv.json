To verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Giants:**\n   - Check each row for the \"opponent\" column to find any games listed as being against the Giants.\n   - Relevant rows:\n     - Row 15: June 18, opponent: Yankees\n     - Row 16: June 19, opponent: Yankees\n     - Row 17: June 20, opponent: Yankees\n     - Rows 24-27: Dates are June 27 to June 30, opponents are Dodgers and Mariners.\n   - Conclusion: No games against the Giants between June 15 and June 30.\n\n2. **Identify Games Against Mariners:**\n   - Check each row for the \"opponent\" column to find any games listed as being against the Mariners.\n   - Relevant rows:\n     - Row 28: June 28, opponent: Mariners\n     - Row 29: June 29, opponent: Mariners\n     - Row 30: June 30, opponent: Mariners\n   - Conclusion: Three games against the Mariners between June 15 and June 30.\n\n3. **Comparison of Games Played:**\n   - Giants: 0 games\n   - Mariners: 3 games\n\nBased on this analysis, the Rockies played more games against the Mariners (3) than against the Giants (0) during the specified period.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.
