Identify the row in the table where the denomination is \"one rupee\":\n   - Row 1 has the denomination \"one rupee\".\n\n2. Check if the weight for this row matches the claimed weight:\n   - The table states that the weight for \"one rupee\" (Row 1) is 10 g.\n\n3. Check if the size for this row matches the claimed size:\n   - The table states that the size for \"one rupee\" (Row 1) is 28 mm.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the information in Row 1 of the table, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Weight: Row 1, \"weight\"\n- Size: Row 1, \"size\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weight\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"when the rupee be the denomination the weight be 12 g,\" we need to examine the table provided and specifically look for entries related to a denomination of one rupee.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim concerns the weight when the denomination is \"one rupee.\"\n   - From the table, Row 1 corresponds to the denomination \"one rupee.\"\n\n2. **Check Weight in Identified Row**:\n   - In Row 1, the relevant column for weight is labeled as \"weight.\"\n   - According to this row, the weight of a coin with a denomination of one rupee is specified as \"10 g.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim states that the weight should be \"12 g\" when the denomination is one rupee.\n   - However, based on the data in Row 1, the actual weight is \"10 g.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the table specifies a weight of 10 g for the denomination of one rupee and not 12 g, the claim does not hold true.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are those that provide information about both the denomination and the weight in Row 1.\n   - These are: \n     - \"denomination\" column in Row 1\n     - \"weight\" column in Row 1\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"denomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
