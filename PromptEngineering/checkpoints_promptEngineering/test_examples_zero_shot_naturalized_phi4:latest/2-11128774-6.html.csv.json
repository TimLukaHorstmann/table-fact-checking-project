The date when NY Rangers visited Vancouver.\n2. The visiting team for the game against Vancouver on February 24.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- **Row 4** and onwards show games involving Vancouver as the home team.\n- **Row 10** specifically lists a match with \"date: february 24, visitor: ny rangers, score: 4 - 5, home: vancouver,\" which directly confirms that NY Rangers were indeed the visitors to Vancouver on February 24.\n\nSince Row 10 provides evidence supporting the claim about both the date and the visiting team, we can conclude:\n\n- The claim is true.\n- The relevant cell for verification is in Row 10 under columns \"date,\" \"visitor,\" and \"home.\"\n\nTherefore, here's the JSON response based on our analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response confirms the claim is true and identifies the relevant cells needed for verification.",
