    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"19136 fan attend san antonio spur game at the air canada centre on four separate occasions during March 2009,\" we need to verify three conditions:\n\n1. The attendance of 19,136 fans for games against the San Antonio Spurs.\n2. These games occurred at the Air Canada Centre.\n3. This happened four times in March 2009.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the table data:\n\n### Condition 1: Attendance of 19136 Fans\n- **Row 8**: The attendance is 19,136 for the game against San Antonio on March 16.\n- **Row 9**: The attendance is 19,136 for the game against Chicago on March 18. This does not involve the Spurs and is irrelevant to this condition.\n- **Row 10**: The attendance is 19,136 for the game against Utah on March 20. Again, this does not involve the Spurs.\n- **Row 11**: The attendance is 18,561 for the game against Minnesota on March 22. This does not meet the required attendance figure.\n- **Row 12**: The attendance is 19,136 for the game against LA Lakers on March 24. Not relevant to this condition as it's not against the Spurs.\n\nThe only game meeting the first part of Condition 1 (attendance of 19136) and involving the San Antonio Spurs occurred in Row 8.\n\n### Condition 2: Location - Air Canada Centre\n- **Row 13**: The game took place at the Air Canada Centre on March 27, but it was against Toronto.\n  \nThe only mention of the Air Canada Centre is in Row 13, which does not involve San Antonio Spurs. Thus, no games against the Spurs occurred at this venue.\n\n### Condition 3: Four Occasions\n- Based on our analysis above, there are no four separate instances where both conditions (attendance and location) coincide with a game against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nIn conclusion, after verifying each part of the claim against the table data:\n\n- There is only one instance where the attendance was 19,136 for a game against the San Antonio Spurs.\n- None of these games took place at the Air Canada Centre.\n- Hence, there are no four separate occasions matching all parts of the claim.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the claim is **FALSE**. Here is the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
