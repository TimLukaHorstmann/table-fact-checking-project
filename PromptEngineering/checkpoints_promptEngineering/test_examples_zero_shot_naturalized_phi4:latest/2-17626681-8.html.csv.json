Identify the relevant rows:\n   - The first part of the claim refers to the date 17 September 2008, which corresponds to Row 1 in the table.\n   - The second part of the claim refers to the date 30 September 2008, which corresponds to Row 2.\n\n2. Extract the attendance figures from these rows:\n   - From Row 1: The attendance for 17 September 2008 is 74,944.\n   - From Row 2: The attendance for 30 September 2008 is 10,346.\n\n3. Calculate the difference in attendance between these two dates:\n   - Difference = Attendance on 17 September 2008 - Attendance on 30 September 2008\n   - Difference = 74,944 - 10,346 = 64,598\n\n4.
