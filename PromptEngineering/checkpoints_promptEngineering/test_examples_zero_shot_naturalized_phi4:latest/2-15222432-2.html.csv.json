The claim states: \"the s\u00e3o paulo team score 15 point in 16 game.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We are interested in the S\u00e3o Paulo team's points and games played.\n\n2. **Locate S\u00e3o Paulo Team Data**:\n   - The table is structured with each row representing a team. We need to find the row where the team is S\u00e3o Paulo.\n   - According to the table, Row 6 corresponds to the S\u00e3o Paulo team.\n\n3. **Verify Points**:\n   - In Row 6, check the \"points\" column for S\u00e3o Paulo.\n   - The points listed are 16.\n\n4. **Verify Games Played**:\n   - Also in Row 6, verify the \"played\" column for S\u00e3o Paulo.\n   - The number of games played is 16.\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim Against Data**:\n   - The claim states S\u00e3o Paulo scored 15 points, but the table shows they have 16 points.\n   - Therefore, the claim about points (15) does not match the actual data (16).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the points do not match, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The relevant cells are in Row 6, specifically under the \"points\" and \"played\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
