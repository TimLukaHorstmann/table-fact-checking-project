    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of it against the table:\n\n1. **Condition:** Pittsburgh must be the visitor for a game.\n2. **Condition:** The team must have more than 24 points after this game.\n3. **Condition:** The attendance for the game must be 14,995.\n\nLet's go through the rows one by one to find any games where Pittsburgh is the visitor and check if the conditions are met:\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Visitor: Pittsburgh\n  - Attendance: 14995\n  - Points after the game: 22 (not more than 24)\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Visitor: Pittsburgh\n  - Attendance: 17250\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Visitor: Pittsburgh\n  - Attendance: 16324\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Visitor: Pittsburgh\n  - Attendance: 14995\n  - Points after the game: 25 (more than 24)\n\nIn Row 9, all conditions are satisfied:\n- Pittsburgh is the visitor.\n- The attendance is 14,995.\n- The points after this game are 25, which is more than 24.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Pittsburgh be the Montreal visit with more than 24 point and 14995 attendee after December 19\", we need to check specific conditions against the table.\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Montreal**: We look for rows where Pittsburgh is the home team and Montreal is the visitor.\n   - Row 11: date: December 25, visitor: Montreal, score: 2 - 4, home: Pittsburgh\n\n2. **Check Date Condition**: The match should be after December 19.\n   - Row 11's date (December 25) satisfies this condition.\n\n3. **Verify Points Condition**: Check if the points are more than 24.\n   - In Row 11, the points are 27, which is indeed greater than 24.\n\n4. **Check Attendance Condition**: The attendance should be 14995.\n   - In Row 11, the attendance is 7778, not 14995.\n\nSince the attendance condition (14995) is not met, even though the date and points conditions are satisfied, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this claim include:\n- Date column to ensure it's after December 19.\n- Points column to check if they are more than 24.\n- Attendance column to verify if it matches 14995.\n- Visitor and Home columns to confirm the match involves Pittsburgh vs. Montreal.\n\nThe relevant cells from Row 11 are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
