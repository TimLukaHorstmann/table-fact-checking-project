    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the actor of the character ariadne oliver be hugh fraser,\" we need to verify two pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Identify the actor who plays the character Ariadne Oliver.\n2. Confirm whether this actor is Hugh Fraser.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows and columns in the table:\n\n- **Row 5** provides information about the character Ariadne Oliver:\n  - Actor: Zoe Wanamaker\n  - Character: Ariadne Oliver\n\nFrom Row 5, we see that Zoe Wanamaker is the actor who plays the character Ariadne Oliver. The claim states that the actor of Ariadne Oliver is Hugh Fraser.\n\n- **Row 2** provides information about Hugh Fraser:\n  - Actor: Hugh Fraser\n  - Character: Arthur Hastings\n\nFrom Row 2, we see that Hugh Fraser is not associated with the character Ariadne Oliver; instead, he plays Arthur Hastings.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because Zoe Wanamaker, not Hugh Fraser, is the actor for Ariadne Oliver.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"character\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"actor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
