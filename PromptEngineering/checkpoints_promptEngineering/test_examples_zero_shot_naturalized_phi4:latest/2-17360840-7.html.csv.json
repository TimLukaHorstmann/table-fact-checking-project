Verify if the attendance for this game is 10750.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the relevant section of the table:\n\n- **Row 11** mentions the opponent as \"buffalo sabres\" with an attendance of 15611.\n  \nSince we are specifically looking for the game against \"buffalo sabres,\" Row 11 is relevant to our claim. According to this row, the attendance is 15611, not 10750.\n\nThus, based on the table data:\n- The opponent \"buffalo sabres\" indeed played in Game 47.\n- However, their attendance was recorded as 15611 and not 10750.\n\nGiven these findings, the claim that \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is from Row 11 under the columns \"opponent\" and \"attendance.\"\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote: The index is offset by one since JSON arrays are zero-indexed, while the table's rows start from 1.",
