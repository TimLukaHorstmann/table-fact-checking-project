The term \"final pick\" typically refers to the last pick in each round.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1: Michael Young (Round 1, Pick 24)\n     - Row 2: Ronnie Williams (Round 2, Pick 47)\n     - Row 3: Rick Carlisle (Round 3, Pick 70)\n     - Row 4: Kevin Mullin (Round 4, Pick 93)\n     - Row 5: Todd Orlando (Round 5, Pick 116)\n     - Row 6: Steve Carfino (Round 6, Pick 139)\n     - Row 7: Mark Van Valkenburg (Round 7, Pick 162)\n     - Row 8: Champ Godboldt (Round 8, Pick 184)\n     - Row 9: Joe Dixon (Round 9, Pick 206)\n     - Row 10: Dan Trant (Round 10, Pick 228)\n   - Ronnie Williams was the second pick in Round 2, not a final pick.\n\n2. **\"rick carlisle\"**\n   - Check if Rick Carlisle was a \"final pick\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Rick Carlisle is listed as Round 3, Pick 70.\n   - He was not the last pick in his round.\n\n3. **\"michael young\"**\n   - Check if Michael Young was a \"final pick\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Michael Young is listed as Round 1, Pick 24.\n   - He was not the last pick in his round.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Ronnie Williams, Rick Carlisle, and Michael Young were among the final picks by the Celtic in the 1984 draft. Based on the analysis above, none of these players were final picks in their respective rounds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify this claim, we need to check the \"round\" and \"pick\" for each player mentioned:\n\n- Ronnie Williams: Row 2\n- Rick Carlisle: Row 3\n- Michael Young: Row 1\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
