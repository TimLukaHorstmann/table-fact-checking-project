The writers for this episode should be \"Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson\".\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Production Code: `3t7459` (not a match with `3t7458`)\n  - Written By: Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson\n  - Since the production code does not match, this row is irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 11** (since Row 9 doesn't have the code):\n  - Production Code: `3t7460` (not a match with `3t7458`)\n  - Written By: Al Septien & Turi Meyer\n  - Since the production code does not match, this row is irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - Production Code: `3t7458` (matches with `3t7458`)\n  - Written By: Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson\n  - Both conditions are satisfied in this row.\n\nThus, Row 12 satisfies both conditions of the claim.
