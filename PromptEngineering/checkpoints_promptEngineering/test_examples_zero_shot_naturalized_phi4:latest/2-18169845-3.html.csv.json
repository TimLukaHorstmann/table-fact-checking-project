Whether \"The Addams Family Musical\" was nominated for the Tony Awards in both the categories of Outstanding Music and Outstanding Lyrics.\n2. Whether it did not win in these categories.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition:\n\n**Condition 1: Nominations at the Tony Award**\n- Check the rows related to the Tony Award (awards with \"tony award\" mentioned).\n- According to Row 1, Andrew Lippa was nominated for the category of Outstanding Original Score.\n- According to Row 7, Andrew Lippa was nominated for both Outstanding Music and Outstanding Lyrics at the Drama Desk Awards. We need similar entries under the Tony Award.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Row 1**: This row shows a nomination in the category of Best Original Score (related to music), but not specifically Outstanding Music.\n- No rows mention \"Outstanding Music\" or \"Outstanding Lyrics\" for the Tony Award; however, Row 8 mentions Andrew Lippa nominated under Outstanding Lyrics at the Drama Desk Awards.\n\n**Condition 2: Winning Status**\n- There are no entries in any Tony Award category that indicate a win for either Outstanding Music or Outstanding Lyrics.\n\nBased on these evaluations:\n- The claim states \"The Addams Family Musical\" was nominated but did not win. For the Tony Awards, we find it was nominated for Best Original Score (related to music), and there is no specific mention of winning any awards in this category.\n- However, the claim about nominations specifically mentions Outstanding Music and Outstanding Lyrics under the Tony Award, which are not listed as nominated categories.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are those concerning the Tony Award nominations and results:\n- Row 1 (category: best original score)\n- Since there's no specific mention of Outstanding Music or Outstanding Lyrics in the Tony Awards, we consider related Drama Desk nominations to understand if they were recognized elsewhere. However, these do not negate the fact that for the claim focusing on Tony Awards specifically, these categories are unmentioned.\n\nSince \"Outstanding Music\" and \"Outstanding Lyrics\" at the Tony Award are not listed as nominated categories in the table, the claim is false based on the lack of nomination evidence for those specific awards.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nExplanation:\n- The relevant cells include those checking Tony Awards and related categories since the claim pertains to these awards.\n- Rows 0 and 1 are checked for Tony Award nominations.\n- Rows 7 and 8 from Drama Desk Awards show context but aren't directly verifying the claim about Tony Awards.",
