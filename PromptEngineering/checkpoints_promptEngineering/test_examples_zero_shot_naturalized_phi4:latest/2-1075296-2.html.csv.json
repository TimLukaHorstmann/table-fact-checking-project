    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main conditions:\n\n1. Michael Schumacher's constructor is Ferrari.\n2. Michael Schumacher has an average grid number of 1 with a time/retire of 1:32:35.101.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the table data:\n\n### Condition 1: Michael Schumacher's Constructor\n- **Row 1**: The driver is Michael Schumacher, and the constructor is Ferrari.\n- This condition is satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2: Average Grid Number of 1 and Time/Retire\n- **Grid Number**: For Michael Schumacher (Row 1), the grid number is 1.\n- Since there's only one entry for Michael Schumacher, his average grid number is indeed 1.\n  \n- **Time/Retire**: For Michael Schumacher (Row 1), the time/retired is 1:32:35.101.\n\nBoth parts of Condition 2 are satisfied as well.\n\nSince both conditions required by the claim are met based on Row 1, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 1**: \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"grid\", and \"time / retired\" columns are relevant to verify the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
