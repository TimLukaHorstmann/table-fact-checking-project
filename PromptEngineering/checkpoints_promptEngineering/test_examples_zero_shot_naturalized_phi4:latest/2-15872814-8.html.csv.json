Whether the result of that game was a win ('W').\n\nLet's identify the relevant row and columns in the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Date Check**: We look at the \"date\" column to find the entry corresponding to April 8.\n- **Score Check**: Within the same row, we need to check the \"score\" column to confirm if it matches \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n\nFrom the table provided:\n- Row 4 corresponds to the game on April 8. \n- In this row, the date is listed as \"april 8\", and the score is given as \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\", which confirms both the date and the score match the claim.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- The cell in Row 4 under the column \"date\" should be \"april 8\".\n- The cell in Row 4 under the column \"score\" should be \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n\nSince both conditions of the claim match the information in the table, the claim is verified as true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
