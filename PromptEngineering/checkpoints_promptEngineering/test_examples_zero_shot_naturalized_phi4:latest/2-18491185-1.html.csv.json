    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the first episode air on 7 / 02 / 08\" is true or false, we need to verify the relevant details from the table:\n\n1. Identify which row corresponds to the \"first episode.\"\n2. Check the date associated with this episode.\n\nFrom the given table:\n- Row 1 corresponds to \"episode: one.\"\n\nRelevant information for verification:\n- The date for Row 1 is \"7 / 02 / 08.\"\n\nNow, let's match these findings against the claim:\n\nThe claim states that the first episode aired on \"7 / 02 / 08.\" Based on our check of Row 1, which corresponds to the first episode, it indeed has a date of \"7 / 02 / 08.\"\n\nThus, the information in the table supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cells for verification are those containing the episode identifier and its airing date from Row 1:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"espn2 air episode one on 7 / 21 / 08,\" we need to evaluate two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Network Condition**: The network must be ESPN2 for episode one.\n2. **Date Condition**: Episode one should have aired on July 21, 2008.\n\nLet's analyze each condition against the provided table:\n\n### Network Condition\n- According to Row 1, \"episode: one\" is indeed broadcasted on the network \"espn2.\"\n  \nRelevant cell for this condition:\n- Row Index: 0 (considering 0-based indexing)\n- Column Name: \"network\"\n\n### Date Condition\n- Row 1 specifies that episode one aired on \"7 / 02 / 08.\"\n\nThe claim states it aired on \"7 / 21 / 08,\" which does not match the date in the table for episode one.\n\nRelevant cell for this condition:\n- Row Index: 0 (considering 0-based indexing)\n- Column Name: \"date\"\n\n### Conclusion\nThe network condition is met, but the date condition is not. Therefore, the claim is false because episode one did not air on July 21, 2008; it aired on July 2, 2008.\n\nHere is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"network\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
