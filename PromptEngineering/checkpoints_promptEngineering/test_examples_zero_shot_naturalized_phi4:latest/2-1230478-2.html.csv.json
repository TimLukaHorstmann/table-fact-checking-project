    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Phyllis Nelson charting two times in 1985 is true or false based on the provided table, let's break down the conditions of the claim and verify them against the data.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Year**: The claim specifies that this happened in 1985.\n- **Charting Twice**: It mentions Phyllis Nelson was able to chart two times with her songs in that year.\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n1. **Row 3** (year: 1985)\n   - Single: \"i don't know\"\n   - US Hot 100: 61\n   - US Dance: 1\n   - US R&B: 65\n\n2. **Row 4** (year: 1985)\n   - Single: \"i like you\"\n   - US Hot 100: 61\n   - US Dance: 1\n   - US R&B: 65\n\n### Verification:\n- Both Row 3 and Row 4 are for the year 1985, satisfying the first condition of the claim.\n- In both rows (Row 3 and Row 4), the singles \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" have charted in at least one category. Specifically, they appear in US Hot 100, US Dance, and US R&B.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPhyllis Nelson indeed charted two different songs (\"i don't know\" and \"i like you\") in 1985 across the given categories (US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 3: Columns \"year\", \"single\", \"us hot 100\", \"us dance\", \"us r&b\"\n- Row 4: Columns \"year\", \"single\", \"us hot 100\", \"us dance\", \"us r&b\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
