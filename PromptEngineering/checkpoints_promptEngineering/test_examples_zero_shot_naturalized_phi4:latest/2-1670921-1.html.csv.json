    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in 1997, Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuria do not battle,\" we need to check if there is an entry in the table where both conditions (year being 1997 and partners being Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuria) are met.\n\n1. **Identify the Year Condition:** \n   - The claim specifies the year \"1997\". We should look for any row that mentions this year either directly or within a range that includes it (e.g., 1996/97).\n\n2. **Check Partner Names:**\n   - According to the claim, we need to see if Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuria are mentioned as battling partners in that particular year.\n\n3. **Examine Table Rows:**\n\n- Row 1:\n  - Season: 2008\n  - Partners: gc smith and neil mckenzie\n  - Does not match the condition.\n  \n- Row 2:\n  - Season: 1997\n  - Partners: roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuriya\n  - Matches both year and partner conditions. This row contradicts the claim.\n\n- Rows 3 to 10 do not need detailed checking because we already found a contradiction in Row 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of Row 2 directly refutes the claim, as it shows that Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuria did battle in 1997.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. We need to provide the relevant cell for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that Row 2 contradicts the claim by having both the specified season and battling partners.",
