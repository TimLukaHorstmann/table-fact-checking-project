    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if there are any songs in the table from the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest that were performed in Danish.\n\nThe relevant column for this verification is \"language\" because it indicates the language in which each song was performed. We will go through each row and examine this column to see if any entries say \"danish.\"\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- Row 1: Language is Italian.\n- Row 2: Language is Dutch.\n- Row 3: Language is French.\n- Row 4: Language is French.\n- Row 5: Language is Swedish.\n- **Row 6**: Language is Danish. (This entry confirms that there was a song performed in Danish.)\n- Row 7: Language is French.\n- Row 8: Language is German.\n- Row 9: Language is German.\n- Row 10: Languages are German and Italian.\n\nSince Row 6 has the language as \"danish,\" this means at least one of the songs was indeed performed in Danish, contradicting the claim that none of the songs were Danish.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE. The relevant cell for verification is found in Row 6 under the column \"language.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
