(Row 25)\n- **Year 1996**: Player: Kirby Puckett, Position: Outfielder. (Row 26)\n- **Year 1997**: Player: Eric Davis, Position: Outfielder. (Row 27)\n- **Year 1998**: Player: Sammy Sosa, Position: Outfielder. (Row 28)\n- **Year 1999**: Player: Tony Gwynn, Position: Outfielder. (Row 29)\n\nFrom this examination:\n- In 1995, the position is not \"outfielder\" but \"shortstop.\"\n- From 1996 to 1999, the position for each year is \"outfielder.\"\n\nSince there was a non-outfielder in 1995, the claim that an outfielder won every year from 1995 to 1999 is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
