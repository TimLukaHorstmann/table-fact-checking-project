    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to analyze the provided table and check two specific conditions:\n\n1. Punt Road Oval should have a crowd of 30,000.\n2. Western Oval should be next in terms of crowd size with a count of 20,000.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row from the table:\n\n- **Row 2** (Punt Road Oval): \n  - Venue: \"punt road oval\"\n  - Crowd: 30,000\n\n- **Row 4** (Western Oval):\n  - Venue: \"western oval\"\n  - Crowd: 20,000\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n1. The claim states that Punt Road Oval has a crowd of 30,000, which matches the information from Row 2.\n2. It also claims Western Oval is next with a crowd of 20,000. Comparing all the rows:\n   - Row 1 (Lake Oval): 13,000\n   - Row 2 (Punt Road Oval): 30,000\n   - Row 3 (Brunswick Street Oval): 14,000\n   - Row 4 (Western Oval): 20,000\n   - Row 5 (Princes Park): 32,000\n   - Row 6 (Arden Street Oval): 18,000\n\nThe largest crowd is at Princes Park with 32,000, making Punt Road Oval the second highest with 30,000. Thus, Western Oval with 20,000 is indeed next after Punt Road Oval.\n\nBased on this analysis, both conditions in the claim are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In Australian rules football, scores are given in two parts: goals and behinds. A goal equals 6 points while a behind is worth 1 point.\n   - Hawthorn\u2019s total score is 60 (which is from 9 goals and 6 behinds).\n   - Geelong\u2019s total score is 71 (from 10 goals and 11 behinds).\n\n4. **Goal Comparison:**\n   - Compare the number of goals scored by hawthorn and geelong:\n     - Hawthorn has 9 goals.\n     - Geelong has 10 goals.\n   - For hawthorn's score to be higher by 1.5 goals than that of geelong, hawthorn should have 11.5 goals (since 10 + 1.5 = 11.5).\n   - However, it is not possible to have half a goal in this context; thus, we must check whether the score in terms of goals alone could make hawthorn's total higher by 1.5 goals.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since hawthorn only has 9 goals and geelong has 10 goals, it is not possible for hawthorn to have a score that is higher by 1.5 goals than geelong.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells used for this verification are:\n- Row 1: \"away team score\" (for hawthorn)\n- Row 2: \"away team score\" (for geelong)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the relevant information from the table:\n\n- The claim states: \"The crowd in arden street oval be 4000 less than the crowd who watch at the brunswick street oval.\"\n\nFrom this statement, we can identify two key pieces of information:\n1. The crowd size at Brunswik Street Oval.\n2. The crowd size at Arden Street Oval.\n\nThese are located in the \"crowd\" column for each respective row.\n\nNow, let's extract and compare these values from the table:\n\n- **Brunswick Street Oval** (Row 3):\n  - Crowd: 14,000\n\n- **Arden Street Oval** (Row 6):\n  - Crowd: 18,000\n\nNext, we calculate whether the crowd at Arden Street Oval is indeed 4,000 less than that at Brunswick Street Oval:\n\n- Difference in crowds = Crowd at Brunswik Street Oval - Crowd at Arden Street Oval\n- Difference = 14,000 - 18,000 = -4,000\n\nThe calculated difference of -4,000 means that the crowd at Arden Street Oval is actually 4,000 more than that at Brunswick Street Oval, not less. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWe identify the relevant cells used to verify this:\n\n- Row 3, \"crowd\": 14,000\n- Row 6, \"crowd\": 18,000\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE, and these are the relevant cells from which we derived our conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
