    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the table, we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. The home team's score is 19.11 (125).\n2. The away team is North Melbourne.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table and verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Home team: Collingwood\n  - Home team score: 19.11 (125)\n  - Away team: South Melbourne\n\n  This row satisfies the first condition but not the second, as the away team is South Melbourne, not North Melbourne.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home team: Carlton\n  - Home team score: 8.8 (56)\n  - Away team: Melbourne\n\n  Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home team: St Kilda\n  - Home team score: 14.13 (97)\n  - Away team: Footscray\n\n  Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home team: Fitzroy\n  - Home team score: 9.13 (67)\n  - Away team: Geelong\n\n  Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home team: Richmond\n  - Home team score: 4.10 (34)\n  - Away team: Hawthorn\n\n  Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Home team: North Melbourne\n  - Home team score: 5.5 (35)\n  - Away team: Essendon\n\n  This row has North Melbourne as the home team, not the away team, and the score does not match either.\n\nNone of the rows satisfy both conditions simultaneously: a home team score of 19.11 (125) with North Melbourne as the away team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying the claim:\n- Row 1: Home team score (19.11 (125)) and Away team (South Melbourne)\n- Row 6: Away team (Essendon)\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
