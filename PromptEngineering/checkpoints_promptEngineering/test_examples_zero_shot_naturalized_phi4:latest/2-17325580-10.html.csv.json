    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine whether the team that won each game scored under 100 points in at least 50% of the games listed.\n\nFirstly, let's identify the relevant columns and rows:\n- We need to consider only the games where the team won (indicated by 'w' in the \"score\" column).\n- For these winning games, we will check the team's score (the first number before the dash '-' in the \"score\" column).\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Team lost ('l'), so it is not relevant.\n2. **Row 2**: Team lost ('l'), so it is not relevant.\n3. **Row 3**: Team won ('w'). Score: 101 - The team scored more than 100 points.\n4. **Row 4**: Team won ('w'). Score: 98 - The team scored under 100 points.\n5. **Row 5**: Team won ('w'). Score: 102 - The team scored more than 100 points.\n6. **Row 6**: Team won ('w'). Score: 107 - The team scored more than 100 points.\n7. **Row 7**: Team won ('w'). Score: 117 - The team scored more than 100 points.\n8. **Row 8**: Team lost ('l'), so it is not relevant.\n\nNow, let's count the number of winning games and how many of those had scores under 100:\n- Total winning games: Rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (5 games)\n- Games with score under 100: Row 4\n\nPercentage calculation:\n- Number of games won with a score under 100 points = 1\n- Percentage = (1/5) * 100% = 20%\n\nThe percentage is 20%, which is less than the required 50%.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Both the highest and lowest assist numbers are achieved by Darnell Jackson.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table with respect to these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: High Assists: Delonte West (7)\n- **Row 2**: High Assists: Lebron James (5)\n- **Row 3**: High Assists: Lebron James (6)\n- **Row 4**: High Assists: Lebron James (7)\n- **Row 5**: High Assists: Lebron James (10)\n- **Row 6**: High Assists: Lebron James (7)\n- **Row 7**: High Assists: Maurice Williams (8)\n- **Row 8**: High Assists: Wally Szczerbiak (8)\n\nFrom this data, we can see:\n- The highest number of assists in a single game is 10 by Lebron James (Row 5).\n- The lowest number of assists recorded is 5 by Lebron James (Row 2).\n\nThe claim states that the highest number of assists is 11 and the lowest is 4. Additionally, it claims both were achieved by Darnell Jackson. However:\n- There are no instances where assists reached 11.\n- There are no instances where assists were as low as 4.\n- The player with the highest assists (10) is Lebron James, not Darnell Jackson.\n- Darnell Jackson does not have any recorded high assist value.\n\nGiven these findings, the claim is FALSE.
