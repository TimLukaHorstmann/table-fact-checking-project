    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the knight Gallop is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. **External Weapon**: The claim states that Gallop's external weapon should be \"two shortswords.\"\n2. **Shield Animal**: The claim states that Gallop's shield animal should be a \"falcon.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant row for the knight named Gallop in the table:\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - **Knight**: Gallop\n  - **External Weapon**: sword\n  - **Shield Animal**: cerberus\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that:\n- The external weapon listed is \"sword,\" not \"two shortswords.\"\n- The shield animal is \"cerberus,\" not \"falcon.\"\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim are met, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for verifying the claim:\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - **Column**: external weapon (value: sword)\n  - **Column**: shield animal (value: cerberus)\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"external weapon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"shield animal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
