The score listed for this row is \"l 50 - 48\". This indicates a loss (\"l\" stands for loss).\n3. The specified score \"50 - 48\" matches exactly with what's stated in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by Row 3 of the table: it matches the date, the score is correctly noted as 50-48, and it confirms a loss occurred.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for this verification are from Row 3 in the columns \"date\", \"score\", and implicitly \"game\" (for row identification).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
