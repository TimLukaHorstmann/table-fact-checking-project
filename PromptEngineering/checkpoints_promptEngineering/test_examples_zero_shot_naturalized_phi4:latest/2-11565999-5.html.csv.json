    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify specific details from the table regarding track 9.\n\n### Claim:\n\"The song title for track 9 be just a little bit\"\n\nThis claim involves two conditions:\n1. The track number should be 9.\n2. The song title should be \"just a little bit\".\n\nLet's examine these conditions with respect to the provided table:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Track Number:**\n   - We need to check if row 9 (since the rows are indexed starting from 1) corresponds to track number 9.\n   - From the table, row 9 mentions \"track: 9\".\n\n2. **Song Title:**\n   - In row 9, we need to verify that the song title is \"just a little bit\".\n   - The table indicates for row 9: \"song title: just a little bit\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n- Row 9 has track number 9.\n- The song title in row 9 is indeed \"just a little bit\".\n\nTherefore, based on this verification, the claim is fully supported.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify the claim, we need to check two columns for row 9:\n- Column: `track`\n- Column: `song title`\n\nThus, the relevant cells are from row index 8 (since it's a zero-based indexing in programming terms) and the specified column names.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Confirm if this title matches \"just a little bit.\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant row for track 23:\n\n- **Row 23**: \n  - Track: 23\n  - Recorded: 10 / 30 / 76\n  - Original issue: moody blue\n  - Song Title: he'll have to go\n  - Time: 4:30\n\nFrom the data in row 23, we see that the song title is \"he'll have to go,\" not \"just a little bit.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo verify this, the relevant cell information needed is:\n\n- The song title for track 23 from column \"song title\" in row 23.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The index is zero-based as per typical programming conventions for row indexing.",
