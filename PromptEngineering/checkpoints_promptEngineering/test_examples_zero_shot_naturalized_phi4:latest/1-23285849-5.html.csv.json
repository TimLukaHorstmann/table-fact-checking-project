    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"attendance of all games at the Pepsi Center be over 19000\" is true or false, we need to examine each game held at the Pepsi Center in the table and check their attendance figures.\n\nRelevant steps:\n\n1. Identify which games were played at the Pepsi Center by checking the \"location attendance\" column for entries that mention \"pepsi center\".\n2. For these identified games, extract the corresponding attendance numbers.\n3. Verify if each of these attendance numbers is over 19000.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 1: Game 3 has an attendance of 15823 at Pepsi Center.\n- Row 10: Game 13 has an attendance of 19359 at Pepsi Center.\n- Row 11: Game 14 has an attendance of 16307 at Pepsi Center.\n- Row 12: Game 15 is played at Target Center, not the Pepsi Center.\n- Row 13: Game 16 has an attendance of 19155 at Pepsi Center.\n\nNow let's verify each relevant game:\n- For Game 3 (Row 1), the attendance is 15823, which is less than 19000. This already disproves the claim.\n- For Game 13 (Row 10), the attendance is 19359, which meets the condition of being over 19000.\n- For Game 14 (Row 11), the attendance is 16307, which is less than 19000 and also disproves the claim.\n- For Game 16 (Row 13), the attendance is 19155, which meets the condition.\n\nSince Games 3 and 14 at the Pepsi Center do not meet the condition of having an attendance over 19000, the claim is false. The relevant cells for verification are from rows with \"pepsi center\" in their location attendance, specifically examining the \"location attendance\" column values.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
