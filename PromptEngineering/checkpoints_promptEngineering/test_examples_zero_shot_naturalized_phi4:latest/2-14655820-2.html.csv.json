Although this win was against the Vikings, it doesn't have a 25-point margin.\n\n- **Row 11**: Opponent is San Diego Chargers; Result is W (34-0). This win has a point difference of 34 points, but the opponent is not either Minnesota Vikings or Buffalo Bills.\n\nAfter checking all relevant rows, we find that there are no instances where the Packers won by 25 points or more against either the Minnesota Vikings or the Buffalo Bills in the given table. Therefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this analysis pertain to both the \"opponent\" and \"result\" columns for each week when checking if the win margin was at least 25 points specifically against the Minnesota Vikings or Buffalo Bills.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the packer game with the highest attendance was against Baltimore on September 22,\" we need to compare the attendance figures for all games listed in the table and identify if the game against Baltimore has the highest figure.\n\n1. **Extract relevant information:** We should look at the 'attendance' column across all rows, as this directly pertains to verifying which game had the highest attendance.\n\n2. **Compare attendance figures:**\n   - Week 1 (September 15): Attendance = 56,267\n   - Week 2 (September 22) against Baltimore Colts: Attendance = 41,252\n   - Week 3 (September 29): Attendance = 47,292\n   - Week 4 (October 6): Attendance = 56,267\n   - Week 5 (October 13): Attendance = 47,499\n   - Week 6 (October 21): Attendance = 50,623\n   - Week 7 (October 27): Attendance = 51,775\n   - Week 8 (November 3): Attendance = 56,267\n   - Week 9 (November 10): Attendance = 46,567\n   - Week 10 (November 17): Attendance = 47,924\n   - Week 11 (November 24): Attendance = 56,267\n   - Week 12 (December 1): Attendance = 42,030\n   - Week 13 (December 8): Attendance = 47,475\n   - Week 14 (December 15): Attendance = 10,020\n\n3. **Identify the highest attendance:** From the extracted data, we can observe that there are multiple games with an attendance of 56,267, which is higher than any other game's attendance figure.\n\n4. **Check if Baltimore Colts' game has the highest attendance:** The attendance for the game against the Baltimore Colts (Week 2) was 41,252, which is not the highest when compared to the others.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that the game with the highest attendance was against Baltimore is false because several other games had higher attendance figures.\n  \nThus, the relevant cells are those in the 'attendance' column for all rows to verify this conclusion.
