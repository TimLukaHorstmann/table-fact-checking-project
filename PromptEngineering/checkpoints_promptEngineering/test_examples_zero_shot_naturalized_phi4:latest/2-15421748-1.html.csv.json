The team in the fifth position.\n2. That this team has a goal difference of 0.\n\nWe will verify these points using the data from the table:\n\n- **Position**: We need to check the row corresponding to the fifth position in the table.\n- **Goal Difference**: For the identified row, we need to confirm that the value in the \"difference\" column is indeed 0.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row Identification**:\n   - Row 5 corresponds to the team in the fifth position.\n\n2. **Verification of Goal Difference**:\n   - In Row 5, we check the \"difference\" column. The value here is 0.\n\nGiven this analysis, both conditions of the claim are satisfied: \n- The row for the fifth position is correctly identified (Row 5).\n- The goal difference in this row is indeed 0.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim:\n- Row index 4 (as indexing typically starts from 0), \"difference\" column with a value of 0.\n- Additionally, it's useful to confirm the position, so we also consider:\n- Row index 4, \"position\" column with a value of 5.\n\nHere is the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, we must identify which row actually has the lowest difference value.\n\nComparing all differences:\n- The lowest difference is -17 from Row 6 (Position 6).\n\nTherefore, position 5 does not have the lowest difference; instead, position 6 does.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all rows where 'difference' values are provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
