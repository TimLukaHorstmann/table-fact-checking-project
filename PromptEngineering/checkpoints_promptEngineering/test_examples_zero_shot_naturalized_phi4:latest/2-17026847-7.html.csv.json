    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"on average, there be 2709 crowd attendance when the home team be vida,\" we need to analyze the relevant data in the table.\n\n1. Identify the rows where the home team is \"vida.\" According to the table:\n   - Row 3: home = vida\n\n2. Look at the attendance for these matches:\n   - Row 3: attendance = 2709\n\n3. Calculate the average attendance for matches where \"vida\" is the home team. Since there's only one match, the average attendance is simply the attendance of that match:\n   - Average attendance = 2709\n\n4. Compare this calculated average with the claim value of 2709.\n\nSince the calculated average attendance (2709) matches the claimed average attendance (2709), the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer is \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cell for verification is from Row 3, under the column \"attendance.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
