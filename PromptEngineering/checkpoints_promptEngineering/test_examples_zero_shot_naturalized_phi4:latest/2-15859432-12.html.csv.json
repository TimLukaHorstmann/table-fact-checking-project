The block value is 340.\n3. The spike value is 353.\n\nWe'll go through each row and examine these specific columns (weight, block, spike) to see if there is any row meeting all the criteria.\n\n- **Row 1:** Weight = 95, Block = 316, Spike = 351\n- **Row 2:** Weight = 86, Block = 320, Spike = 340\n- **Row 3:** Weight = 101, Block = 335, Spike = 356\n- **Row 4:** Weight = 98, Block = 319, Spike = 337\n- **Row 5:** Weight = 89, Block = 330, Spike = 353\n- **Row 6:** Weight = 98, Block = 326, Spike = 354\n- **Row 7:** Weight = 89, Block = 331, Spike = 345\n- **Row 8:** Weight = 95, Block = 331, Spike = 351\n- **Row 9:** Weight = 94, Block = 333, Spike = 353\n- **Row 10:** Weight = 104, Block = 332, Spike = 357\n- **Row 11:** Weight = 94, Block = 340, Spike = 353\n- **Row 12:** Weight = 103, Block = 335, Spike = 353\n\nUpon reviewing the rows:\n- Row 9 has a weight of 94 and spike of 353 but block is 333.\n- Row 11 matches all conditions: weight = 94, block = 340, spike = 353.\n\nThus, there exists at least one row where all three specified conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- From Row 11: Weight (column name \"weight\"), Block (column name \"block\"), Spike (column name \"spike\").\n\nHere's the JSON object with our answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"weight\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"block\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"spike\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table and check if there exists a player who has both:\n\n- A spike value of 353.\n- A block value of 340.\n\nIf such a player is found, their weight must be checked. If no weight exists for this combination (i.e., it doesn't appear or is zero), then we verify the claim as true. Otherwise, if any non-zero weight is associated with these spike and block values, the claim is false.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Spike = 351, Block = 316 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 2**: Spike = 340, Block = 320 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 3**: Spike = 356, Block = 335 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 4**: Spike = 337, Block = 319 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 5**: Spike = 353, Block = 330 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 6**: Spike = 354, Block = 326 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 7**: Spike = 345, Block = 331 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 8**: Spike = 351, Block = 331 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 9**: Spike = 353, Block = 333 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 10**: Spike = 357, Block = 332 - Doesn't match.\n- **Row 11**: Spike = 353, Block = 340 - Matches!\n  - Check weight: Weight = 94 (non-zero).\n- **Row 12**: Spike = 353, Block = 335 - Doesn't match.\n\nIn row 11, the player with a spike of 353 and a block of 340 has an associated non-zero weight value.
