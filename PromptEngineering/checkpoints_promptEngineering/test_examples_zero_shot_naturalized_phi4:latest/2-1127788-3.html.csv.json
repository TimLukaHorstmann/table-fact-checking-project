    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Rafael M\u00e1rquez's scoring record in international competitions for specific years (2001, 2009, and 2012), we need to examine the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012.\"\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The phrase \"did not remain scoreless\" means that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored at least one goal during those years.\n   \n2. **Identify Relevant Years**:\n   - We need to check for goals in 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - The table lists dates of matches, scores at particular times (\"score\"), results of entire games (\"result\"), and competition types.\n   \n4. **Check Each Year Individually**:\n\n   - **2001**: \n     - No entries in the table for the year 2001.\n\n   - **2009**: \n     - Row 9 corresponds to 28 March 2007, which is not relevant.\n     - There are no other rows with dates from 2009.\n\n   - **2012**:\n     - No entries in the table for the year 2012.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no records of Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring in the years 2001, 2009, and 2012 based on this data, he did remain scoreless during these years.\n   \n6. **Determine Truth Value**:\n   - The claim is that he \"did not remain scoreless\" in these years. However, since he did remain scoreless in all three specified years (based on available data), the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - No specific rows match 2001, 2009, or 2012; thus, no rows are directly relevant to this claim regarding scoring.\n   \nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
