The \"engine(s)\" column includes \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv\".\n2. The \"tyres\" column is marked as \"f\".\n\nLet's evaluate each row against these criteria:\n\n- **Row 1**: Engine: \"ford cosworth dfv\", Tyres: \"f\". The engine does not match.\n- **Row 2**: Engine: \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv\", Tyres: \"f\". Both conditions are met here.\n- **Row 3** to **Row 14**: We do not need to check these rows because we have already found a match in Row 2.\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in Row 2. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the March 741 chassis having F tires and 6 points, we need to examine the relevant rows from the provided table.\n\nThe claim specifies two conditions:\n1. The March 741 chassis should have \"F\" as its tire type.\n2. It should have 6 points.\n\nWe will look at each row that mentions the March 741 chassis:\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Year: 1974\n  - Chassis: march 741\n  - Engine(s): ford cosworth dfv\n  - Tyres: g\n  - Points: 6\n\nFrom Row 5, we observe:\n- The chassis is indeed \"march 741\".\n- It has \"g\" tires, not \"F\".\n- It has 6 points.\n\nThe tire condition (\"F\") specified in the claim does not match the information from the table, which states that the March 741 had \"g\" tires. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 5 for \"chassis\" (to confirm it's March 741).\n- Row index 5 for \"tyres\" (to check if they are \"F\").\n- Row index 5 for \"points\" (to ensure it has 6 points).\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
