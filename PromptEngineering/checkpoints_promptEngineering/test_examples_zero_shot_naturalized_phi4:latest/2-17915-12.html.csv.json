However, based on the table, he was a runner-up five times.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those with the \"outcome\" column where the value is \"runner - up.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
