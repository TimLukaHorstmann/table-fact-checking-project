    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main aspects:\n\n1. Identify the length of \"sleepless nights (featuring vince gill)\" from the table.\n2. Compare this length with the lengths of all other songs listed in the table to see if it is indeed the longest.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Extract the Length of \"Sleepless Nights\"\n\nFrom Row 4:\n- Song title: \"sleepless nights (featuring vince gill)\"\n- Length: 4:21\n\n### Step 2: Compare with Other Songs\n\nNow, we need to compare this length with all other songs in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: Length is 2:18\n- **Row 2**: Length is 2:46\n- **Row 3**: Length is 2:59\n- **Row 4**: Length is 4:21 (already noted)\n- **Row 5**: Length is 4:00\n- **Row 6**: Length is 2:35\n- **Row 7**: Length is 2:35\n- **Row 8**: Length is 3:06\n- **Row 9**: Length is 3:30\n- **Row 10**: Length is 3:06\n- **Row 11**: Length is 3:23\n- **Row 12**: Length is 2:40\n- **Row 13**: Length is 2:50\n- **Row 14**: Length is 2:53\n- **Row 15**: Length is 3:14\n- **Row 16**: Length is 2:38\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe length of \"sleepless nights (featuring vince gill)\" is 4:21, which is longer than any other song listed in the table.
