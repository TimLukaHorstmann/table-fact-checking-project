According to the table, this information can be found in Row 11:\n  - Row 11: pick: 245, player: aniket dhadphale, position: left wing, nationality: united states, nhl team: san jose sharks, college / junior / club team: marquette electricians (maaamhl).\n\n- **NHL Team Verification**: From the same row (Row 11), we see that Aniket Dhadphale is indeed listed as a player for the San Jose Sharks.\n\n- **Nationality Verification**: In Row 11, the nationality of Aniket Dhadphale is confirmed to be \"United States.\"\n\nSince all parts of the claim are verified against the data in Row 11 and they match perfectly with what is stated in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used for verification:\n\n- \"player\" column in Row 11.\n- \"nhl team\" column in Row 11.\n- \"nationality\" column in Row 11.\n\nThus, the JSON response reflecting our analysis would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `row_index` is 10 because it follows zero-based indexing in programming contexts (Row 11 corresponds to index 10).",

Whether the player's name is Mark Polak.\n2. Whether this player's position is indeed \"centre.\"\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Mark Polak:**\n   - We scan through each row in the given table, looking specifically at the \"player\" column to find any entry that matches \"Mark Polak.\"\n   \n2. **Verify the Position of Mark Polak:**\n   - Once we identify the row where \"player\" is \"Mark Polak,\" we check the corresponding \"position\" value to see if it matches \"centre.\"\n\n### Checking Each Row:\n\n- **Row 1:** Player is Tero Lehtera, not Mark Polak.\n- **Row 2:** Player is Tommi Miettinen, not Mark Polak.\n- **...**\n- **Row 21:** Player is Neil Savary, not Mark Polak.\n- **Row 22:** Player is Sergei Berezin, not Mark Polak.\n- **Row 23:** Player is Tomas Holmstrom, not Mark Polak.\n- **Row 24:** Player is Mikhail Kazakevich, not Mark Polak.\n- **Row 25:** Player is Scott Swanjord, not Mark Polak.\n- **Row 26:** Player is Radoslav Kropac, not Mark Polak.\n\nFinally:\n\n- **Row 21 (Corrected index should be Row 20):** Here, we find that the player's name is indeed \"Mark Polak.\"\n\n3. **Verify Position:**\n   - In Row 20, check the \"position\" column value for Mark Polak. The entry indicates \"centre.\"\n\nSince both conditions are met\u2014namely, finding \"Mark Polak\" in the table and verifying his position as \"centre\"\u2014the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Mark Polak's player position be centre\" is true based on the information provided in Row 20 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
