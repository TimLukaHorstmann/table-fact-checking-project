    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"Hans Herrmann scored fairly well with the Porsche 718 / 2,\" we need to analyze relevant information from the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Hans Herrmann's Entry**:\n   - From Row 1, we see that Hans Herrmann entered in the year 1953 with a Veritas Meteor chassis and a Veritas L6 engine.\n   - His points scored are 0.\n\n2. **Check Porsche 718 / 2 Entries**:\n   - The claim mentions \"Porsche 718 / 2.\" We need to identify entries involving this chassis.\n   - From the table, Row 10 shows Porshe System Engineering using the Porsche 718 / 2 chassis in the year 1960 and scoring 1 point.\n   - In Row 11, Porshe System Engineering used a similar chassis (Porsche 718 / 2) again but scored 0 points.\n\n3. **Determine Hans Herrmann's Association with Porsche 718 / 2**:\n   - There is no entry in the table where Hans Herrmann is associated with the Porsche 718 / 2.\n   - His only mentioned chassis is the Veritas Meteor, and he has no connection to the Porsche 718 / 2 based on this data.\n\n4. **Assess the Claim \"Scored Fairly Well\"**:\n   - The claim implies that Hans Herrmann had some positive results with the Porsche 718 / 2.\n   - Since there is no record of him driving or scoring points with the Porsche 718 / 2, he cannot have scored well (or at all) with it.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is false. The relevant cells for verifying this conclusion are:\n\n- Hans Herrmann's entry to check his chassis and points: Row 1.\n- Entries for the Porsche 718 / 2 to confirm there is no connection to Hans Herrmann: Rows 10 and 11.\n\nHere is the JSON output based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
