The primary details that relate to this claim are:\n\n1. **Year Made**: This tells us when the locomotives were manufactured.\n2. **Years Withdrawn**: These are the years during which these locomotives were withdrawn from service.\n\nLet's review Row 2 for \"Hercules\" against these criteria:\n- The year range given for manufacture is 1851 - 1854.\n- The withdrawal years are stated as 1875 - 1884.\n\nThe claim suggests that \"1872 - 1884 be the year for Hercules.\" This implies a specific timeframe during which the locomotives were presumably in use or relevant. However, from the data:\n- None of the Hercules locomotives would have been active between 1872 and 1874 because they were manufactured by 1854 at the latest, and there is no information about their years of service starting specifically from 1872.\n- They started being withdrawn in 1875, which partially overlaps with the claim's period (from 1875 to 1884).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The years 1872 - 1874 do not align with any specific mention or activity related to Hercules locomotives as they were already manufactured by then.\n- The overlap from 1875 to 1884, while partially matching the claim's end period (the withdrawal period), does not substantiate that this is a defining \"year for Hercules\" as it represents their phase-out rather than peak relevance or usage.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported because:\n- The start year 1872 lacks any specific contextual backing from the table.\n- Only part of the claim's timeframe (from 1875 to 1884) relates to withdrawal, not a broader significance suggested by the phrase \"be the year for.\"\n\nThe relevant cells in the table are thus those relating to when Hercules was made and withdrawn:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Year Made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Years Withdrawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
