Linda Fratianne should be listed with the rank of 1.\n2. Anett P\u00f6tzsch should be ranked second.\n\nLet's examine these requirements by checking relevant entries in the table:\n\n- **Row 1** contains the entry for Linda Fratianne, which shows a \"rank\" of 1, thus satisfying the condition that she is the winner.\n- **Row 2** contains the entry for Anett P\u00f6tzsch with a \"rank\" of 2, confirming her position as second.\n\nThese two rows directly address all parts of the claim. Therefore, based on this analysis:\n\n- Linda Fratianne indeed has rank 1.\n- Anett P\u00f6tzsch is ranked 2nd in the table.\n\nGiven that both conditions align with the information in the table, the claim is supported by the data provided. Consequently, we can conclude that the statement \"Linda Fratianne be the winner and Anett P\u00f6tzsch be rank in second place in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championship\" is TRUE.\n\nThus, the relevant cells from which this conclusion is drawn are:\n\n- Row 1: For Linda Fratianne's rank of 1.\n- Row 2: For Anett P\u00f6tzsch's rank of 2.\n\nThe final JSON output reflecting these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
