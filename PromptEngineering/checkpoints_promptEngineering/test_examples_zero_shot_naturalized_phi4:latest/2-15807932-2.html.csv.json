    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"there's no country that have 1 gold and a rank smaller than 2,\" we need to verify if there is any nation in the table with exactly one gold medal and a rank less than 2.\n\nHere are the steps for verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We focus on columns related to 'rank' and 'gold' because these directly relate to the claim.\n  \n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Japan has a rank of 1 and 5 gold medals. This does not satisfy the condition of having exactly 1 gold medal.\n   - **Row 2**: Netherlands has a rank of 2 and 1 gold medal. The rank is not smaller than 2, so this doesn't satisfy the claim's conditions.\n   - **Row 3**: Germany has a rank of 3 and 0 gold medals, which does not meet the condition of having exactly 1 gold medal.\n   - **Row 4**: South Korea also has a rank of 3 and 0 gold medals, again not meeting the criteria.\n   - **Row 5**: Soviet Union has a rank of 5 and 0 gold medals. This doesn't satisfy the requirement for 1 gold.\n   - **Row 6**: Great Britain has a rank of 6 and 0 gold medals, which does not match the condition either.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: No country in the table has exactly one gold medal with a rank smaller than 2.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
