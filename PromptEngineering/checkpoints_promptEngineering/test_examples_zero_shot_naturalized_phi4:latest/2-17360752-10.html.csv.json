The primary focus is whether game 82's score matches what is expected (which it does), but this needs to happen \"before\" a certain timeframe.\n\nGiven game 82 itself occurs on date 11, which is not before date 7, the claim's condition (\"hold before date 7\") doesn't apply as no part of the table or any logic suggests that game 82 should have a score of 2 - 3 specifically because it was played before date 7.
