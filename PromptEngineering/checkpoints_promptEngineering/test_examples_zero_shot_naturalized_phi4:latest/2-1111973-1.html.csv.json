    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the vctp 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon do not have 75 km / h (47 mph) as the vcrt\", we need to analyze the table in relation to the specified columns and rows.\n\n1. **Identify relevant information:**\n   - The claim involves two components:\n     a. \"vctp 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon\"\n     b. \"vcrt\" which is related to speed, specifically 75 km/h (47 mph).\n\n2. **Locate the relevant data in the table:**\n\n   - From Row 2:\n     - The entry for `vctp` mentions \"20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon\".\n     - There is no mention of this specification under `vcrt`.\n\n   - From Row 5, which lists speeds:\n     - `vctp` has a speed of 75 km/h (47 mph).\n     - `vcrt` also has a speed of 75 km/h (47 mph).\n\n3. **Analyze the claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the vctp 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon do not have 75 km / h (47 mph) as the vcrt\".\n   - This implies we need to determine if the speed of `vctp` is incorrectly attributed to `vcrt`.\n\n4. **Determine truthfulness:**\n   - The `vctp` indeed has a speed of 75 km/h (47 mph), and so does `vcrt`.\n   - However, the claim suggests that the autocannon specification under `vctp` should not be associated with the speed listed for `vcrt`. Since both `vctp` and `vcrt` independently have the same speed value but there's no direct linkage or confusion between their specifications in the table, the statement is consistent as per its wording.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true because the specification of \"20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon\" under `vctp` does not imply it shares any speed attribute with `vcrt`, despite both having the same numerical value for speed.\n\n6. **Relevant cells in the table:**\n   - Row 2, Column `vctp`: Contains \"20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon\".\n   - Row 5, Columns `vctp` and `vcrt`: Both list speeds of 75 km/h (47 mph).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"vctp\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"vctp\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"vcrt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
