    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check if there is any school in the table that has a basketball score (`bask`) greater than zero while simultaneously having an indoor track score (`indoor track`) of zero and a swimming score (`swimming`) of five.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Basketball Score > 0**: We need to identify rows where `bask` is not zero.\n2. **Indoor Track Score = 0**: For those identified rows, check if `indoor track` is zero.\n3. **Swimming Score = 5**: Finally, for the remaining rows, verify that `swimming` equals five.\n\nNow, let's examine each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Cleveland State)**:\n  - `bask`: 2\n  - `indoor track`: -\n  - `swimming`: 0\n\n- **Row 2 (Detroit)**:\n  - `bask`: 3\n  - `indoor track`: 4\n  - `swimming`: -\n\n- **Row 3 (Green Bay)**:\n  - `bask`: 28\n  - `indoor track`: -\n  - `swimming`: 9\n\n- **Row 4 (Milwaukee)**:\n  - `bask`: 4\n  - `indoor track`: 9\n  - `swimming`: 3\n\n- **Row 5 (UIC)**:\n  - `bask`: 0\n  - `indoor track`: 0\n  - `swimming`: 0\n\n- **Row 6 (Valparaiso)**:\n  - `bask`: 0\n  - `indoor track`: 0\n  - `swimming`: 0\n\n- **Row 7 (Wright State)**:\n  - `bask`: 0\n  - `indoor track`: 0\n  - `swimming`: 5\n\n- **Row 8 (Youngstown State)**:\n  - `bask`: 0\n  - `indoor track`: 3\n  - `swimming`: 0\n\nFrom this analysis, no row satisfies all three conditions simultaneously: a non-zero basketball score, an indoor track score of zero, and a swimming score of five.\n\nThus, the claim is true.
