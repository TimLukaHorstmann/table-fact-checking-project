    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"black - out be on on the same channel at 9:30 and then 10:00\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided for relevant information about the program \"black - out.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Program in the Table**: We need to find where \"black - out\" appears in the table.\n\n2. **Check Time Slots**: According to the claim, \"black - out\" should be on at 9:30 and then again at 10:00.\n\n3. **Verify Consistency Across Rows**:\n   - The program must appear in the same channel (same row) at both 9:30 and 10:00.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: No mention of \"black - out.\"\n- **Row 2**: No mention of \"black - out.\"\n- **Row 3**: No mention of \"black - out.\"\n- **Row 4**: No mention of \"black - out.\"\n- **Row 5**: No mention of \"black - out.\"\n- **Row 6**:\n  - At 9:00, \"black - out\" is listed.\n  - At 9:30, there's \"le grand journal,\" not \"black - out.\"\n  - At 10:00, \"fin du monde\" is listed.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that in Row 6, \"black - out\" appears at 9:00 but does not appear at 9:30 or 10:00. Therefore, the claim that \"black - out be on on the same channel at 9:30 and then 10:00\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 6, Column for 9:00 (\"black - out\")\n- Row 6, Column for 9:30 (\"le grand journal\")\n- Row 6, Column for 10:00 (\"fin du monde\")\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"9:00\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"9:30\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"10:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
