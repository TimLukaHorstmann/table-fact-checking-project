We need to check if the position listed for this player is \"right wing\".\n\n3. **Pick Number**: The claim specifies that he was drafted with the 146th pick. Therefore, we must confirm that the pick number associated with \"rene lambert\" is 146.\n\nLet's verify these conditions using the table:\n\n- **Row 3** contains:\n  - Pick: 146\n  - Player: rene lambert\n  - Position: right wing\n\nAll parts of the claim are satisfied in Row 3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are from Row 3 for \"pick\", \"player\", and \"position\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"right wing, rene lampert, be pick 145th,\" we need to examine specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. **Player Name and Position:**\n   - The claim mentions \"ren\u00e9 lambert\" as playing at the position of \"right wing.\" We should locate a row where both the player's name is \"rene lambert\" and the position is \"right wing.\"\n\n2. **Pick Number:**\n   - According to the claim, \"rene lambert\" should be the 145th pick. We need to find a row that indicates the pick number as 145 for this player.\n\nLet's check each condition against the table:\n\n- **Condition 1:** The player is \"ren\u00e9 lambert.\"\n  - Row 3 has the player named \"rene lambert.\"\n\n- **Condition 2:** The position of \"rene lambert\" is \"right wing.\"\n  - In Row 3, it confirms that \"rene lambert's\" position is indeed \"right wing.\"\n\n- **Condition 3:** The pick number should be 145.\n  - However, in Row 3, the pick number for \"rene lambert\" is 146, not 145.\n\nSince the third condition (the pick number being 145) does not hold true based on the table, the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- The cell containing the player's name \"rene lambert\" in Row 3.\n- The cell with position \"right wing\" in Row 3.\n- The cell with pick number 146 in Row 3.\n\nThus, the JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
