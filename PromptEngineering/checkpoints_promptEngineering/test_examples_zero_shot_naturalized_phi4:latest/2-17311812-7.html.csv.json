Specifically, we will focus on the 'score' column for each game entry, which indicates whether it was a win (indicated by 'w') or a loss (indicated by 'l'). \n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Score is 'l', indicating a loss.\n2. Row 2: Score is 'w', indicating a win.\n3. Row 3: Score is 'l', indicating a loss.\n4. Row 4: Score is 'l', indicating a loss.\n5.
