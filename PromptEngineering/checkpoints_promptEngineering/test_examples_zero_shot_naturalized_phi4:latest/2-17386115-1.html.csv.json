    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round,\" we need to break down and verify each component of the statement against the given table:\n\n1. **Identify the Player**: The claim mentions \"Ken Irvin.\" We must find his entry in the table.\n\n2. **Verify the Round**: The claim states that Ken Irvin was picked in the \"fourth round.\" Therefore, we need to check the 'round' column for his row to confirm if it is indeed 4.\n\n3. **Confirm Pick Number**: Although the statement does not specify a pick number, understanding typical draft order can help verify accuracy within the same round. However, since the claim only specifies \"in the fourth round,\" the specific pick number isn't necessary unless further verification is needed for clarity.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n- Row 5 states: Round: 4, Pick: 109, Player: Ken Irvin\n\nFrom this row:\n- The player is indeed \"Ken Irvin.\"\n- He was picked in the \"fourth round,\" which matches the claim.\n- Since only the round is specified in the claim and it matches, the statement holds true.\n\nThus, the relevant information to verify the truth of the claim can be found in Row 5 for both 'round' and 'player':\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the claim and verify it against the provided table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **\"in 1st round\"** - This part indicates that we should look for an entry where the \"round\" is equal to 1.\n2. **\"ken irvin be draft\"** - This implies that Ken Irvin should be listed as a player drafted in the first round.\n\n### Verification Against the Table:\n- **Checking the Round:**\n  - We need to find if there's any row where `round` equals 1. \n  - From the table, Row 1 has `round: 1`.\n\n- **Checking the Player Name:**\n  - In Row 1, the player listed is Ruben Brown.\n  - Ken Irvin appears in a different row (Row 5), not in the first round.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that Ken Irvin was drafted in the first round. However, upon examining the table, Ken Irvin is actually drafted in the fourth round, not the first. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- The relevant cells to verify this are those related to the round and player name.\n  - Row 1: `round: 1`, `player: ruben brown`\n  - Row 5: `round: 4`, `player: ken irvin`\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
