    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the at90s1200 chip have a frequency of 12 mhz,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to locate rows that mention the chip named \"at90s1200.\"\n\n2. **Examine Identified Rows:**\n   - Look for the specific column related to frequency (labeled as \"frequency\" in the table) within these identified rows.\n   \n3. **Verify Claim Against Data:**\n   - The claim states that the frequency of the at90s1200 chip is 12 MHz. We need to check if this matches the frequency listed in the relevant row.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- **Row 1** contains a chip named \"at90s1200.\"\n- In **Row 1**, under the column labeled \"frequency,\" it lists \"12.\"\n\nThis supports the claim, as the frequency of the at90s1200 is indeed listed as 12 MHz.\n\nThus, we have determined that the relevant data in the table confirms the claim. The relevant cell for this verification is:\n\n- Row index: 1 (since row numbering typically starts from 1)\n- Column name: \"frequency\"\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each condition in the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Identify the chip \"at90s1200\"**:  \n   - According to Row 1, the chip \"at90s1200\" has a frequency of 12 MHz.\n\n2. **Check if any chips have a frequency greater than 12 MHz**:\n   - The claim asks about chips with frequencies \"more than 12 MHz\". We need to check each row to see if there are any chips with frequencies greater than 12 MHz.\n   - From the table, all chips have frequencies of 10 or 8 MHz. None exceed 12 MHz.\n\n3. **Determine if \"at90s1200\" is the chip with the smallest frequency among those with more than 12 MHz**:\n   - Since no chip has a frequency greater than 12 MHz, there are no candidates to compare against \"at90s1200\".\n\nGiven that there are no chips with frequencies greater than 12 MHz, the claim is vacuously true. There are no other chips with frequencies exceeding 12 MHz, so \"at90s1200\" does not need to be compared with any others for this condition.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim include:\n- The frequency of \"at90s1200\".\n- Frequencies of all other chips to ensure none exceed 12 MHz.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
