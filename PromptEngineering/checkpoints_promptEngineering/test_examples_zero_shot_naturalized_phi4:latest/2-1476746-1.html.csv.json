    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"la ronde be direct by roger vadim,\" we need to identify and verify the relevant details from the table:\n\n1. **English Title**: The claim mentions \"la ronde.\" We need to find this title in the English titles column.\n2. **Director**: The claim states that Roger Vadim directed it. We should check if he is listed as the director for the corresponding film.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- First, locate \"la ronde\" in the English titles column. It appears in Row 4.\n  \n- Next, verify the director for the entry in Row 4. The table lists Roger Vadim as the director of \"la ronde.\"\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied: \n- The English title \"la ronde\" matches with Row 4.\n- Roger Vadim is indeed listed as the director for this film.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the information in the table. \n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"english title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Roger Vadim directed La Ronde in 1966,\" we need to check specific details from the table regarding both the director and the year for the film \"La Ronde.\"\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row(s) related to \"La Ronde\":**  \n   - According to Row 4, \"La Ronde\" is listed with an English title of \"circle of love,\" an original title of \"la ronde,\" a country of France, and a director of Roger Vadim.\n\n2. **Verify the year associated with this entry:**\n   - The same row (Row 4) specifies that the year for \"La Ronde\" is 1965.\n\n3. **Compare these details to the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Roger Vadim directed \"La Ronde\" in 1966.\n   - While the director matches, the year does not; it should be 1965 according to the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is incorrect because the year specified (1966) does not match the year provided in the table (1965).\n\nHere's the JSON output with relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
