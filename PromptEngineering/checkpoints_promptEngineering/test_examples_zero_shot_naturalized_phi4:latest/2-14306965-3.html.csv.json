    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"gold be not smaller than zero for the nation of kazakhstan (kaz) so the total be more than zero,\" we need to break down and verify each part against the provided table.\n\n1. **Condition 1**: \"gold be not smaller than zero for the nation of kazakhstan (kaz)\"\n   - We locate the row corresponding to Kazakhstan (KAZ).\n   - From Row 5: `nation: kazakhstan (kaz), gold: 0, silver: 2, bronze: 0, total: 2`.\n   - The \"gold\" value for Kazakhstan is indeed 0, which satisfies the condition of being not smaller than zero.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: \"so the total be more than zero\"\n   - We need to check if the \"total\" for Kazakhstan is greater than zero.\n   - From Row 5 again: `total: 2`.\n   - The total number of medals (13) for Kazakhstan is indeed more than zero.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied according to the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- For the first condition regarding \"gold not smaller than zero,\" we check the gold count for Kazakhstan.\n- For the second condition about the total being greater than zero, we check the total medals for Kazakhstan.\n\nThus, the relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 5, Column: gold\n- Row 5, Column: total\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is 4 because indexing starts from 0 in programming contexts.",
