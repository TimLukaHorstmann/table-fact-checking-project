    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of the statement against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Opponent Check**: The claim states that \"kansas city chief\" was the opponent in week 14.\n   - From Row 4 and Row 14, we can see:\n     - In Week 4: Opponent is \"Kansas City Chiefs\"\n     - In Week 14: Opponent is \"Kansas City Chiefs\"\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is true.\n\n2. **Attendance Check**: The claim states that the attendance was 74,524 in week 14 against Kansas City Chiefs.\n   - From Row 14, the attendance for the game in Week 14 is listed as 77,778.\n   - The claim's stated attendance (74,524) does not match the table's data (77,778).\n\nSince the attendance figure provided in the claim does not match the actual recorded attendance for that week, the entire claim is false.\n\nNow, we will identify the relevant cells from the table to verify this:\n\n- **Row 14**:\n  - Column \"opponent\": Confirms Kansas City Chiefs as the opponent.\n  - Column \"attendance\": Provides the actual attendance figure (77,778) which contradicts the claimed attendance (74,524).\n\nBased on these observations, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
