    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"rider fred launchbury from east germany reach a speed of 84.25 mph,\" we need to verify two conditions in the table:\n\n1. **Rider's Name**: We need to check if there is a rider named Fred Launchbury.\n2. **Country**: For this rider, we must confirm that their country is East Germany.\n3. **Speed**: Finally, we need to ensure the speed recorded for this rider is 84.25 mph.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 1**: The rider is Dieter Braun from West Germany with a speed of 89.27 mph. This does not match any part of our claim.\n- **Row 2**: The rider is B\u00e3rje Jansson from Sweden with a speed of 86.56 mph. This also does not match.\n- **Row 3**: The rider is Gunter Bartusch from East Germany with a speed of 85.93 mph. Although the country matches, the rider's name and speed do not.\n- **Row 4**: The rider is Steve Murray from the United Kingdom with a speed of 84.65 mph. None of these match our claim.\n- **Row 5**: The rider is Fred Launchbury from the United Kingdom with a speed of 84.25 mph. Here, we have the correct name and speed but not the country (it should be East Germany, but it's listed as the United Kingdom).\n- **Rows 6 to 10**: None of these rows match all parts of the claim.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that while Fred Launchbury does reach a speed of 84.25 mph, he is associated with the United Kingdom, not East Germany. Therefore, the claim is false because the country condition is not satisfied.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The row where Fred Launchbury appears (Row 5) for his name, country, and speed.\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
