    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville,\" we need to examine all rows in the table for entries where the \"lbsc name\" is \"granville.\" Then, among these entries, we must identify which one has the smallest \"1st lbsc no.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 'granville' as the Lbsc Name:**\n   - We need to find all rows where the \"lbsc name\" column is \"granville.\"\n   - From the table, we find:\n     - Row 32 has \"salisbury\"\n     - Row 33 has \"northcote\"\n     - **Row 36** has \"hampden\"\n\n2. **Check for 'granville' in Lbsc Name:**\n   - Upon further inspection, it seems I made an error; let's correct this:\n   - The only row with \"granville\" as the lbsc name is Row 32.\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest 1st lbsc Number for 'granville':**\n   - For Row 32, the \"1st lbsc no\" is 216.\n   - Since Row 33 and Row 36 do not have \"granville,\" we only need to consider Row 32.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 217 should be the lowest \"1st lbsc number\" with the name \"granville.\"\n   - However, for \"granville,\" the \"1st lbsc no\" is 216 (from Row 33), not 217.\n   - Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is from Row 32, where the \"lbsc name\" is \"granville.\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
