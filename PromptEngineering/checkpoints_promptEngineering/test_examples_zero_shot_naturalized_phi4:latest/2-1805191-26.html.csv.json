The claim states:\n\n\"The district of Missouri 2 and Missouri 6 first elected a Republican in 1996.\"\n\nWe will verify this by checking two conditions for each district:\n1. Whether the party is \"republican.\"\n2. Whether they were first elected in 1996.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 2** corresponds to Missouri 2.\n  - Party: Republican\n  - First Elected: 2000\n\n- **Row 6** corresponds to Missouri 6.\n  - Party: Republican\n  - First Elected: 2000\n\nBoth districts have incumbents from the \"republican\" party, but neither was first elected in 1996. Instead, both were first elected in 2000.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the condition that they were first elected in 1996 does not hold for either district.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first_elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first_elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
