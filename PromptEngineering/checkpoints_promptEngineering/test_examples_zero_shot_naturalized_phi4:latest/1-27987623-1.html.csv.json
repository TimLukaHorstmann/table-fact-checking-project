If it was the most-watched episode of the season with 8.01 million viewers.\n\n**Step 1: Determine if \"Something Good Coming\" is the last episode aired**\n\n- We need to look at the \"series episode\" and \"original air date\" columns to confirm that \"Something Good Coming\" is indeed the final episode.\n- From Row 21, we see:\n  - Series Episode: 45\n  - Original Air Date: May 25, 2011\n\nThis indicates that \"Something Good Coming\" is the last aired episode in terms of both series and air date.\n\n**Step 2: Verify if it was the most-watched episode**\n\n- We need to compare the viewership numbers from all episodes.\n- The claim states that this episode had 8.01 million viewers, but we need to verify this against the \"US viewers (in million)\" column in Row 21:\n  - US Viewers: 5.01 million\n\nThis shows a discrepancy because it only had 5.01 million viewers.\n\n**Step 3: Check for any episode with higher viewership**\n\n- We check each row's viewership to find the maximum value.\n- From the table, the highest viewership is in Row 1:\n  - \"All Mixed Up\" had 8.32 million viewers on September 22, 2010.\n\nThis confirms that another episode was more popular than \"Something Good Coming.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe claim is false because:\n\n- \"Something Good Coming\" is indeed the last episode aired.\n- It did not have 8.01 million viewers; it had 5.01 million viewers.\n- Another episode (\"All Mixed Up\") had higher viewership.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Days from November 24, 2010, to December 8, 2010:\n   - November has 30 days.\n   - From November 24 to November 30 is 6 days.\n   - Adding the 8 days in December gives us 14 days.\n\n2. Days from December 8, 2010, to January 5, 2011:\n   - December has 31 days.\n   - From December 8 to December 31 is 23 days.\n   - Adding the 5 days in January gives us 28 days.\n\nNow, summing these intervals:\n\n- November 24 to December 8: 14 days\n- December 8 to January 5: 28 days\n\nTotal break = 14 + 28 = 42 days\n\nThe claim states there is a 26-day break between episodes 9, 10, and 11.
