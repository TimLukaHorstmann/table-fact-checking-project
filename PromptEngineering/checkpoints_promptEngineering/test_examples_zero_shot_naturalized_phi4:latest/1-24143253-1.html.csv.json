This is incorrect because:\n\n- Neither Mona Graham nor Karl Malden had a combined marriage duration close to 71 years.\n- Mona Graham's longest marriage was 9 years, and Karl Malden's was 6 years.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"deceased spouse\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"length of marriage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"deceased spouse\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"length of marriage\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
