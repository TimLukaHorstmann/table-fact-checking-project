According to the table data, Row 28 contains a player with this name.\n- In Row 28, we check the \"Date of Birth\" column. It states \"2 November 1987\", which matches \"November 2, 1987\".\n- We also check the \"Position\" column in the same row, which indicates \"fly-half\".\n\nAll conditions are satisfied by the information in Row 28.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. The JSON object representing this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date of birth\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nNote: The row index is adjusted to account for zero-based indexing used in programming contexts.",
