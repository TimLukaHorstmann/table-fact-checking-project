The table provided only contains medal counts for various nations and does not include any information about the number or type of swimming events contested during those games. Therefore, there are no relevant cells within this table that can be used to verify the truthfulness of the claim.\n\nThus, the claim cannot be verified as TRUE based on the data in the table, leading us to conclude it is FALSE with respect to this specific dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Additionally, it is ranked 1st, matching the statement.\n  \n- **Event Context**:\n  - The table does not mention any specific event or year related to these results. It only provides ranking and medal counts without specifying that these are from \"the swimming of 1952 Summer Olympics.\"\n\nSince the second part of the claim\u2014specifically mentioning the event \"swimming\" and the year \"1952\"\u2014cannot be verified with the given table, we cannot confirm the entire statement as true based solely on this information.

The column labeled \"total\" in each row indicates the sum of these medals for that particular nation.\n\nTo verify the claim:\n- We need to calculate the total number of medals awarded by summing up the values in the \"total\" column for all nations listed in the table.\n- This involves checking each row's \"total\" value and adding them together.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1.
