    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"w109.015 be the chassis code with the lowest number built,\" we need to focus on the cells in the table that contain both the chassis codes and the numbers built for each model.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns:\n   - **Chassis Code**: This column contains the values \"w109.015\", \"w109.016\", etc.\n   - **Number Built**: This column contains the numerical values corresponding to the number of units built for each chassis code.\n\n2. Extract and compare the numbers from the \"Number Built\" column:\n   - Row 1: Chassis Code = w109.015, Number Built = 2.369\n   - Row 2: Chassis Code = w109.016, Number Built = 2.519\n   - Row 3: Chassis Code = w109.018, Number Built = 6.526\n   - Row 4: Chassis Code = w109.056, Number Built = 9.483\n   - Row 5: Chassis Code = w109.057, Number Built = 2.533\n\n3. Compare the numbers to find the lowest:\n   - The values are 2.369, 2.519, 6.526, 9.483, and 2.533.\n   - The lowest number is 2.369.\n\n4. Verify if this corresponds to \"w109.015\":\n   - Yes, Row 1 with Chassis Code \"w109.015\" has the Number Built of 2.369, which is indeed the lowest among the given values.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"w109.015 be the chassis code with the lowest number built\" is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row 1: Chassis Code and Number Built\n- Row 2: Number Built\n- Row 3: Number Built\n- Row 4: Number Built\n- Row 5: Number Built\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"number built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main components:\n\n1. Identify the model with the highest number built.\n2. Calculate how many fewer units were produced for the \"300sel 3.5\" compared to this model.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row 1 (300sel): Number Built = 2,369\n- Row 2 (300sel): Number Built = 2,519\n- **Row 3 (300sel 6.3)**: Number Built = 6,526\n- **Row 4 (300sel 3.5)**: Number Built = 9,483\n- Row 5 (300sel 4.5): Number Built = 2,533\n\n1. The model with the highest number built is \"300sel 3.5\" from Row 4 with 9,483 units.\n\n2. Next, we calculate how many fewer \"300sel 3.5\" units were produced compared to this model. Since \"300sel 3.5\" itself has the highest number built, there isn't another model with more units built than it.\n\nThe claim states that the \"300sel 3.5\" has 2,957 fewer numbers built than the model with the highest number built. However, since \"300sel 3.5\" is indeed the model with the highest production, it cannot have fewer units built than itself.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row 4: Number Built (for identifying the highest and checking its own count)\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 5: Number Built (to ensure no other model exceeds Row 4)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"number built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
