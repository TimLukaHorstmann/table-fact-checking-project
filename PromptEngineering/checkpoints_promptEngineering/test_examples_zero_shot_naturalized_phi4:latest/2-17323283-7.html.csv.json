Identify the row corresponding to game 75:\n   - From the table, row 14 is associated with game 75.\n\n2. Check the opponent in row 14:\n   - The opponent listed for game 75 (row 14) is \"minnesota north stars.\"\n\n3. Compare this information with the claim:\n   - The claim states that the opponent for game 75 should be \"minnesota north star.\"\n   - The table shows the opponent as \"minnesota north stars\" (note the plural form).\n\nSince there is a discrepancy in the singular versus plural form of \"north star,\" the claim does not match exactly.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Among those identified games, find the game with the lowest game number.\n3. Compare this game number to the one mentioned in the claim (76).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Games after March 2 against Detroit Red Wings:**\n  - From the table, we have two rows where the opponent is \"detroit red wings\":\n    - Row 5: Date = March 11, Game Number = 67\n    - Row 8: Date = March 16, Game Number = 70\n    - Row 14: Date = March 29, Game Number = 76\n\n- **Game numbers after March 2:**\n  - The games played against the Detroit Red Wings after March 2 are those on March 11 (Game 67) and March 16 (Game 70), as they both fall after March 2.\n  - The game on March 29 has a number of 76, but we need to check if it's indeed the lowest among these.\n\n- **Identifying the lowest game number:**\n  - From the games identified above, the lowest game number is 67 (March 11).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that the lowest game number after March 2 with Detroit Red Wings as the opponent is 76.
