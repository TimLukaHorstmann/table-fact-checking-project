    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"ligier - ford be the constructor of the car that win on august 10\", we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Identify which race occurred on August 10.\n2. Check the constructor for the winner of that specific race.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the data provided in the table:\n\n- First, locate the row with the date \"8 august\" (as dates are in month-day format). This corresponds to Row 9.\n  \n- Next, check two columns from Row 9: \n  - The \"race winner\" column indicates who won that race. According to the data, Alan Jones was the winner of the German Grand Prix on August 10.\n  - The \"constructor\" column shows which constructor's car won. For this race, the winning constructor is Williams-Ford.\n\nNow we compare the retrieved information with the claim:\n- The claim mentions \"ligier - ford be the constructor\", but from Row 9, we see that the constructor was actually \"williams - ford\".\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n1. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - From Row 9: \n     - Column \"date\" for confirming it is indeed August 10.\n     - Column \"race winner\" to identify who won (Alan Jones).\n     - Column \"constructor\" to verify which constructor's car won (Williams-Ford).\n\n2. **Verification**: The claim that Ligier-Ford was the constructor of the winning car on August 10 is incorrect since Williams-Ford was the actual constructor.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"race winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
