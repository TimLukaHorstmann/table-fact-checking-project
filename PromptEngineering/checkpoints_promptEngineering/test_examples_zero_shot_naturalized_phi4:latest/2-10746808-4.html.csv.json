Therefore, the claim about Collingwood losing by 5 points is incorrect.\n\n3. **Crowd Size**: The claim states there were 15,000 spectators.\n   - In Row 1: crowd is listed as 15000.\n\nThe conditions in the claim do not fully match the data provided. Specifically, while the number of spectators and teams playing are correct, the outcome (Collingwood losing by 5 points) does not hold true according to the scores given.\n\nThus, the relevant cells from the table for this evaluation include:\n- Row 1, home team: Collingwood\n- Row 1, away team: Melbourne\n- Row 1, home team score: 12.12 (84)\n- Row 1, away team score: 12.7 (79)\n- Row 1, crowd: 15000\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
