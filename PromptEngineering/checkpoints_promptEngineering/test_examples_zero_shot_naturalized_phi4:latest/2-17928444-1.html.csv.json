    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the attendance during Week 16 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season, we need to verify whether the given attendance for that week is indeed the least compared to all other games listed in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: We are interested in the \"attendance\" column across all rows since this will allow us to compare the attendance figures of each game during the season.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for Week 16**:\n   - For Row 9 (Week 16), the claim states that the attendance is 74,192. However, according to the table, the actual attendance for Week 16 is 43,145.\n\n3. **Compare Attendances Across All Games**:\n   - We need to compare this attendance figure of 43,145 with those listed in all other rows (Weeks 1 through 15).\n   - According to the data provided:\n\n     - Row 1: Attendance = 73,564\n     - Row 2: Attendance = 73,899\n     - Row 3: Attendance = 73,996\n     - Row 4: Attendance = 47,629\n     - Row 5: Attendance = 73,984\n     - Row 6: Attendance = 48,112\n     - Row 7: Attendance = 74,192\n     - Row 8: Attendance = 44,160\n\n   - Comparing these values, we see that the attendance of 43,145 (Week 16) is indeed the lowest.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states Week 16 has \"the least amount in attendance of 74,192,\" which implies that it claims the highest possible incorrect figure for this context.\n   - Since the actual attendance of 74,192 was recorded during Week 7 and not Week 16, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to include all \"attendance\" entries across each row since they are relevant to validating the least attendance claim.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
