    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate each condition mentioned in it against the provided table data:\n\n1. **Identify names associated with \"real canoe\":**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2: Name is Mario Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda; Club in 2012 is Real Canoe.\n     - Row 4: Name is Bal\u00e1zs Szir\u00e1nyi; Club in 2012 is Real Canoe.\n\n2. **Verify the names mentioned in the claim:**\n   - The claim states that the two players associated with \"Real Canoe\" are Bal\u00e1zs Szir\u00e1nyi and Mario Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, which matches our findings from step 1.\n\n3. **Check positions for these two players:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2 (Mario Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda): Position is 'd' (defender).\n     - Row 4 (Bal\u00e1zs Szir\u00e1nyi): Position is 'cf' (center forward).\n\n4. **Validate position claim in the statement:**\n   - The claim states that they play \"cf and gk\" positions.\n   - We found from step 3 that Mario Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda plays 'd', not 'gk'.\n   - Bal\u00e1zs Szir\u00e1nyi plays 'cf', which matches one of the claimed positions.\n\nSince Mario Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda does not play a goalkeeper ('gk') position, the claim is false. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- For confirming names associated with \"Real Canoe\" and their respective positions:\n  - Row 2: Columns for Name (Mario Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda) and Position ('d').\n  - Row 4: Columns for Name (Bal\u00e1zs Szir\u00e1nyi) and Position ('cf').\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
