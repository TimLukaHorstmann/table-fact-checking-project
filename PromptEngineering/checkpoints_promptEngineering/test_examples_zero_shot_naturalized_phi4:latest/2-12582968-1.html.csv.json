    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich never threw for greater than 78 m\" is true or false, we need to examine the \"notes\" column in each row of the provided table. This column contains the distance measurements for Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's throws at various competitions.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant cell:\n\n- **Row 1**: notes: 61.51 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 2**: notes: 64.20 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 3**: notes: 66.41 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 4**: notes: 71.26 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 5**: notes: 74.53 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 6**: notes: 73.77 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 7**: notes: 70.56 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 8**: notes: 74.47 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 9**: notes: 77.17 m (less than 78 m)\n- **Row 10**: notes: 79.36 m (greater than 78 m)\n\nThe claim states that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich never threw for greater than 78 meters, but in Row 10, the recorded throw is 79.36 meters, which contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
