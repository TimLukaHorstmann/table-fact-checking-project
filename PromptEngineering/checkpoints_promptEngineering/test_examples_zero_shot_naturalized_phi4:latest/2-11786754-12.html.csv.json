    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard,\" we need to check each row in the table for players who meet both conditions: having more than 0 touchdowns and receiving more than 135 yards.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Rob Turner):**\n  - Touchdowns (TDs): 4 (greater than 0)\n  - Yards: 171 (greater than 135)\n  - Average: 10.6\n\n- **Row 2 (Lenzie Jackson):**\n  - Touchdowns (TDs): 0\n  - Yards: 171\n  - Since touchdowns are not greater than 0, this row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 3 (Kevin Ingram):**\n  - Touchdowns (TDs): 1 (greater than 0)\n  - Yards: 135 (not greater than 135)\n  - Since yards are not greater than 135, this row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 4 (Robert Quiroga):**\n  - Touchdowns (TDs): 2 (greater than 0)\n  - Yards: 16 (not greater than 135)\n  - Since yards are not greater than 135, this row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 5 (Terrence Stubbs):**\n  - Touchdowns (TDs): 0\n  - Since touchdowns are not greater than 0, this row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 6 (Josh Jeffries):**\n  - Touchdowns (TDs): 3 (greater than 0)\n  - Yards: 58 (not greater than 135)\n  - Since yards are not greater than 135, this row is not relevant.\n\nOnly Row 1 meets both conditions. The average for Rob Turner is 10.6, not 5.3. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are from Row 1:\n\n- \"yards\" column (171 yards)\n- \"td 's\" column (4 touchdowns)\n- \"avg\" column (10.6 average)\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"td 's\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
