Identifying which row(s) correspond to Season 1.\n2. Checking if the Production Code for that row is \"am01\".\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n- **Identify Rows Corresponding to Season 1:**\n  - We need to find rows where the `season` column equals 1.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 2 has `season: 1`.\n\n- **Verify Production Code for Season 1:**\n  - Once we identify the row(s) corresponding to Season 1, we check the `production code` for that row.\n  \nFor Row 2:\n- The `production code` is \"am01\".\n\nThis matches exactly with what the claim states. Therefore, the condition given in the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

According to the table:\n   - Row 15 shows that \"forbidden fruits\" was directed by Jeremy Kagan.\n\n3. **Original Air Date**: The claim specifies March 2, 1998. According to the table:\n   - Row 15 indicates that \"forbidden fruits\" originally aired on March 2, 1998.\n\nThe claim is referring to a single episode with specific attributes: title (\"the forbidden fruit\"), director (Jeremy Kagan), and air date (March 2, 1998). The row in the table that matches all these conditions is Row 15. \n\n- The title \"forbidden fruits\" closely aligns with \"the forbidden fruit\" mentioned in the claim.\n- Jeremy Kagan is indeed listed as the director for this episode.\n- The air date of March 2, 1998, matches perfectly.\n\nGiven these checks, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 15.
