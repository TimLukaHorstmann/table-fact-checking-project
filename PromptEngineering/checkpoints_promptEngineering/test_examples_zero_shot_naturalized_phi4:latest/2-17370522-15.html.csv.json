However, rows 3, 4, and 5 have undisclosed fees, which means they might also involve transfer fees even if not explicitly stated as non-zero amounts. Therefore, Marcello Trotta is not definitively the only one with a transfer fee.\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are other players (Alex Pla, Jorge Guinovart, and J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan) whose transfer fees are undisclosed, indicating potential fees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The positions of both players are indeed listed as MF.\n2. Both transfers occurred within the specified timeframe (2008-09).\n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n#### Check Positions\nThe claim specifies that both Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart play in the MF position.\n\n1. **Alex Pla**:\n   - Locate the row for Alex Pla.\n   - According to Row 3: `pos: mf`, confirming he played as a midfielder.\n   \n2. **Jorge Guinovart**:\n   - Locate the row for Jorge Guinovart.\n   - According to Row 4: `pos: mf`, confirming he also played as a midfielder.\n\n#### Check Transfer Dates\nThe claim mentions that these transfers occurred during the 2008-09 season, implying their transfer dates should fall within this timeframe (starting in September 2008 and ending in August 2009).\n\n1. **Alex Pla**:\n   - The date is given as `20 oct 2008` in Row 3.\n   - This falls within the specified season.\n\n2. **Jorge Guinovart**:\n   - The date is also given as `20 oct 2008` in Row 4.\n   - This too falls within the specified season.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth players are listed as midfielders (MF), and their transfer dates fall within the 2008-09 football season. Therefore, the claim that \"in the 2008 - 09 Manchester City FC season, Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart both play the MF position\" is supported by the information in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify this, we consider the following relevant cells:\n- Row 3: `pos` column for Alex Pla.\n- Row 4: `pos` column for Jorge Guinovart.\n- Row 3: `date` column for Alex Pla.\n- Row 4: `date` column for Jorge Guinovart.\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
