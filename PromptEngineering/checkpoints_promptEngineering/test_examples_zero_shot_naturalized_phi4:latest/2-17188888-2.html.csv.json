    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the number of games played in each final before and including the year 1947.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"score in the final\" because it shows how many games were played during each match. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Row 1 (Year 1942):** Score: 2 - 6, 2 - 6, 2 - 6\n  - Number of games = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n\n- **Row 2 (Year 1946):** Score: 6 - 3, 6 - 1, 6 - 1\n  - Number of games = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18\n\n- **Row 3 (Year 1947):** Score: 3 - 6, 6 - 3, 10 - 8, 4 - 6, 6 - 3\n  - Number of games = 3 + 6 + 18 + 4 + 6 = 37\n\nNow, let's compare these totals to see if the claim is true:\n\n- Total number of games before 1947 (including 1942 and 1946):\n  - 1942: 9 games\n  - 1946: 18 games\n  - Total = 9 + 18 = 27\n\n- Number of games in 1947:\n  - 37 games\n\nThe total number of games before the 1947 championship is 27, which is less than the 37 games played in the 1947 championship. Therefore, the claim that \"the most number of game occur before the 1947 championship\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are those that contain the scores for each year:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
