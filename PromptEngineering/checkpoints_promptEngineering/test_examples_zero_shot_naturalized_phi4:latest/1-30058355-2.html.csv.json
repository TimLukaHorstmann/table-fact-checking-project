Check each row in the table to find the relevant data:\n   - For **Monday, August 22** (Column: \"mon 22 aug\"):\n     - Row 3 (Grant Wagstaff): 20'20.54 111.285 mph\n     - Row 4 (Stephen McKnight): 20'39.32 110.599 mph\n     - Row 5 (Andrew Brady): 20'35.58 109.930 mph\n     - Row 6 (Paul Smyth): 20'07.69 112.470 mph\n     - Row 7 (David Lumsden): -- no time\n     - Row 8 (Andy Fenton): 19'52.86 113.868 mph\n     - Row 9 (Dan Sayle): 20'22.05 111.148 mph\n\n   - For **Wednesday, August 24** (Column: \"wed 24 aug\"):\n     - Row 3 (Grant Wagstaff): 20'07.24 112.511 mph\n     - Row 4 (Stephen McKnight): 20'12.61 112.013 mph\n     - Row 5 (Andrew Brady): 19'52.95 113.859 mph\n     - Row 6 (Paul Smyth): 19'59.73 113.216 mph\n     - Row 7 (David Lumsden): -- no time\n     - Row 8 (Andy Fenton): -- no time\n     - Row 9 (Dan Sayle): 19'56.16 113.553 mph\n\n3. Verify the claim:\n   - The claim states \"20'22.05 111.148 mph show for wed 24 aug.\" This corresponds to Dan Sayle's performance on Monday, August 22, not Wednesday.\n   - It also claims that \"19'56.16.113.553 mph\" is for Monday, August 22. This actually matches Dan Sayle\u2019s time and speed on Wednesday, August 24.\n\n4.
