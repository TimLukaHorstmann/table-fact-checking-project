    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to compare the information in the table with the statements made in the claim.\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"Dumbarton have an area of 6.20\"\n- \"Clarendon have an area of 492.84\"\n\nWe will verify these claims by looking at the \"area km\u00b2\" column for both Dumbarton and Clarendon from the table:\n\n1. **For Dumbarton:**\n   - The row corresponding to Dumbarton is Row 13.\n   - According to the table, the area for Dumbarton is 375.06 km\u00b2.\n\n2. **For Clarendon:**\n   - The row corresponding to Clarendon is Row 15.\n   - According to the table, the area for Clarendon is 492.84 km\u00b2.\n\nNow let's compare these values with those in the claim:\n- The claim states that Dumbarton has an area of 6.20 km\u00b2, but the table shows it as 375.06 km\u00b2.\n- The claim correctly states that Clarendon has an area of 492.84 km\u00b2, which matches the table.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (Dumbarton's area), the entire claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row 13, \"area km 2\" for Dumbarton.\n- Row 15, \"area km 2\" for Clarendon.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
