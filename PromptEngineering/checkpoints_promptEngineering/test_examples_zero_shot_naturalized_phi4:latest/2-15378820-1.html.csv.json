    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim that \"the chargers finished the 1980 regular season with an 11 - 7 record,\" we need to analyze the table's data focusing on two key aspects: the number of wins and losses recorded throughout the season.\n\n1. **Examine Wins and Losses:** The table provides a record for each game played by listing either \"w\" (win) or \"l\" (loss). We must count the total number of games resulting in a win and those resulting in a loss.\n\n2. **Count Wins:**\n   - Row 1: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 2: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 3: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 4: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 7: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 9: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 11: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 12: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 13: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 15: Result is \"w\"\n   - Row 16: Result is \"w\"\n\n   Total Wins = 11\n\n3. **Count Losses:**\n   - Row 5: Result is \"l\"\n   - Row 6: Result is \"l\"\n   - Row 8: Result is \"l\"\n   - Row 10: Result is \"l\"\n   - Row 14: Result is \"l\"\n\n   Total Losses = 5\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:** The claim states an 11-7 record, which implies 11 wins and 7 losses.
