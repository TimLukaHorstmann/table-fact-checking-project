The event: Glover Trophy.\n3. Any mention of a car or team placement (e.g., \"place first\").\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **Check for Date and Event**:\n  - Row 28 corresponds to the date \"6th april 1952,\" event \"glover trophy.\" \n  - Row 29 also matches this date and event but with a different year: \"6th april 1953.\"\n  \n- **Examine Entries Related to Race Placements**:\n  - Row 28 mentions two drivers, Reg Parnell (\"ret\") and Ken Wharton (\"1\"). Since the claim involves placing first, we look at the \"race\" column.\n  - In Row 29, there is an entry for driver Ken Wharton with a race placement of \"1.\" This suggests he placed first.\n\n- **Check for Car/Team Information**:\n  - The table does not explicitly mention \"BRM Type 15\" or any specific cars in the relevant rows. It only lists drivers and their placements without specifying the car model.\n  \n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile Ken Wharton is recorded as placing first on April 6, 1953, there's no explicit connection to \"the brm type 15.\" Without additional information confirming that Ken Wharton drove a BRM Type 15 in this event, we cannot conclusively verify the claim based solely on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"race\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"race\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the brm type 15 be present at the april 6 , 1952 gran premio del valentino\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine relevant data points in the table for that specific date and event.\n\nThe claim focuses on two main aspects:\n1. The presence of \"brm type 15\" at the event.\n2. The event being held on April 6, 1952, specifically named as \"gran premio del valentino.\"\n\nLet's analyze these aspects based on the table:\n\n- **Date and Event Verification:**\n  - Row 19 specifies:\n    - Date: 6th April 1952\n    - Event: Gran Premio del Valentino\n    - Circuit: Valentino Park\n\nThis matches the date and event mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Driver Information Check:**\n  - The table lists drivers for this event (row 19) as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, and Ken Wharton.\n  - None of these entries mention \"brm type 15.\"\n\n- **Car Information Check:**\n  - The table does not specify any car models or types in the listed columns. It only provides information about the date, event, circuit, drivers, and race outcomes.\n\nSince there is no column specifying car models like \"brm type 15\" within the given data, we cannot verify whether \"brm type 15\" was present at the event from the table alone. Therefore, the claim lacks sufficient support based on the available information in the table.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct response to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and identify instances where Reg Parnell drove a BRM Type 15.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that \"Reg Parnell be the driver of the BRM Type 15 on 5 different occasions.\"\n\n2. **Relevant Information in the Table**:\n   - We need to check each row for entries where the driver is Reg Parnell.\n   - Additionally, we must verify if he drove a BRM Type 15 during these races.\n\n3. **Examine Each Relevant Row**:\n   - Look at all rows where \"Reg Parnell\" appears in the driver column.\n   - Check any additional information provided (such as race results) to see if it specifies the car type (BRM Type 15).\n\n4. **Table Analysis**:\n   - Rows with Reg Parnell as a driver are: Row 4, Row 5, Row 6, Row 10, Row 11, Row 12, Row 13, Row 14, Row 17, and Row 18.\n   - None of these rows provide explicit information about the car model (BRM Type 15).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without specific data indicating that Reg Parnell drove a BRM Type 15 on any occasion in the table, we cannot verify the claim based solely on the given information.\n   - Since there is no mention of the BRM Type 15 associated with Reg Parnell in these rows, we conclude that the claim lacks sufficient evidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim \"Reg Parnell be the driver of the BRM Type 15 on 5 different occasions\" is FALSE.
