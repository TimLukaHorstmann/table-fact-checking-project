    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down what it states and compare it against the given table data:\n\n**Claim:** \"10 player total be draft by the indianapolis colt\"\n\nThis claim suggests two conditions:\n1. A total of 10 players were drafted.\n2. The team mentioned is the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Number of Players:**\n   - The table lists the following rows (each corresponding to one player):\n     - Row 1\n     - Row 2\n     - Row 3\n     - Row 4\n     - Row 5\n     - Row 6\n     - Row 7\n     - Row 8\n     - Row 9\n\n   There are a total of 9 rows, which means only 9 players were drafted according to this table.\n\n2. **Team Identification:**\n   - The claim specifies the \"Indianapolis Colts.\" However, the table does not provide any information about the team that conducted the draft.\n   \nSince neither condition is fully satisfied (only 9 players are listed and there is no mention of the Indianapolis Colts), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify the total number of players drafted:\n- The relevant columns for each row are \"round\" and \"overall,\" which confirm individual player entries. However, since we're counting rows, any column will suffice to identify a distinct player entry in the table.\n\nTherefore, each row index from 1 through 9 is relevant for verifying the total count of players.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe JSON object with the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
