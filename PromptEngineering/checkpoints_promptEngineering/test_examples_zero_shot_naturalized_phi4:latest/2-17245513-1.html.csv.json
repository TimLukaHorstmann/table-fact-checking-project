Therefore, the entire claim is TRUE.\n\nNow we will list out the relevant cells:\n\n1. **Row Index**: 7 (corresponds to Row 8 in a zero-indexed system)\n   - **Column Name**: place (to verify \"t7\")\n2. **Row Index**: 7\n   - **Column Name**: money (to verify \"$7500\")\n\nThe final JSON response based on this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim about the table, let's break down each part of the claim and verify it against the data provided in the naturalized format.\n\n### Claim:\n\"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis , who have 10875\"\n\n#### Breakdown:\n1. **Place is t7 for Peter Oosterhuis**:\n   - We need to identify if there is a row where the `place` column has \"t7\" and the `player` column contains \"Peter Oosterhuis\".\n   - From Row 8: The place is indeed \"t7\", and the player is \"Peter Oosterhuis\".\n\n2. **Money is 10875 for Peter Oosterhuis**:\n   - We need to check if in the row identified above, the `money` column has the value \"10875\".\n   - From Row 8: The money listed is \"7500\", not \"10875\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe first condition of the claim (place being t7 for Peter Oosterhuis) is true. However, the second condition regarding the prize money (having 10875) is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the verification against the table data, the overall claim is **FALSE**.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index 8, Column name \"place\": Confirms player Peter Oosterhuis has place t7.\n- Row index 8, Column name \"money\": Shows that the money is not 10875 but 7500.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates the specific rows and columns that were checked to verify the claim, leading to the conclusion that it is false.",
