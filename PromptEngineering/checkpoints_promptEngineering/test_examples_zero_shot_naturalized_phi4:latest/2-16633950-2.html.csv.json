The team mentioned is \"Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs.\"\n2. They are claimed to have scored \"36 points.\"\n3. This event took place during the \"1994 NSWRFL Grand Final.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row that corresponds to the 1994 NSWRFL Grand Final.\n   - From the table, Row 5 has the details: \"details: 1994 nswrl grand final.\"\n\n2. **Check the Points Scored by Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs:**\n   - In Row 5:\n     - The column \"premiers\" lists \"canberra raiders,\" indicating they were the winning team.\n     - The column \"runners up\" lists \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs,\" indicating they were the losing team.\n     - The total points scored in this match (sum of both teams' scores) are given as \"score: 36 - 12.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Score for Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs:**\n   - In Row 5, the score is listed as \"36 - 12.\"\n   - Since \"canberra raiders\" were the premiers (winners), they scored 36 points.\n   - Therefore, the \"runners up,\" \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs,\" must have scored 12 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs scored 36 points.
