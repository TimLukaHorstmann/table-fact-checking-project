    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"just under 3 century pass before southwark have the tallest building or structure,\" we need to evaluate the timeline provided in the table for when Southwark had its tallest structure.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The claim is specifically about \"Southwark.\" Therefore, we focus on rows mentioning \"Southwark.\"\n   - Row 3 mentions \"Southwark Cathedral\" with years as tallest from 1666 to 1677.\n   - Row 10 mentions \"Shard London Bridge\" in Southwark with the start year of 2010.\n\n2. **Calculate Time Difference:**\n   - The period when Southwark had its first known tallest structure was from 1666 to 1677 (Row 3).\n   - The next occurrence is in 2010, as per Row 10.\n   - Calculate the time between 1677 and 2010:\n     \\[\n     2010 - 1677 = 333 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - \"Just under 3 century\" implies slightly less than 300 years.\n   - The actual period is 333 years, which is more than 3 centuries (300 years).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that just under 3 centuries pass before Southwark has the tallest building or structure is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 3: \"years as tallest\" and \"location\"\n   - Row 10: \"years as tallest\" and \"location\"\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
