Specifically, we should focus on the columns related to date, opponent, score, loss, and record for these dates.\n\nLet's evaluate the relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 23 (May 26):** \n  - Date: May 26\n  - Opponent: Angels\n  - Score: 6 - 2\n  - Result: Loss (losses are recorded by the losing pitcher, not the overall game outcome)\n  - Record after this game: 25 - 19\n\n- **Row 24 (May 28):**\n  - Date: May 28\n  - Opponent: Athletics\n  - Score: 8 - 4\n  - Result: Loss (losses are recorded by the losing pitcher, not the overall game outcome)\n  - Record after this game: 25 - 20\n\n- **Row 22 (May 25):** \n  - Date: May 25\n  - Opponent: Angels\n  - Score: 5 - 0\n  - Result: Not a loss for the Blue Jays; they won this game.\n\nTo verify if there were three consecutive losses, check the games on:\n\n- **May 26 (Row 23):** Loss to Angels\n- **May 27:** No game played (not in the table)\n- **May 28 (Row 24):** Loss to Athletics\n\nThe Blue Jays did not play a game on May 27, which breaks any possibility of three consecutive losses. They lost on May 26 and again on May 28, but there was no game on May 27.\n\nThus, the claim is false as they did not lose three consecutive games between May 25th and May 28th, 1991.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
