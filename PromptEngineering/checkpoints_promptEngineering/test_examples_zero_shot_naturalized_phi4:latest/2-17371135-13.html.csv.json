This row applies since Chicago hosts Detroit. The decision-maker listed here is \"osgood\".\n   - Row 4: Home is \"chicago\". This row applies since Chicago hosts Detroit. The decision-maker listed here is \"conklin\".\n   - Row 5: Home is \"detroit\", so this row does not apply.\n\n3. **Verify Decision-Maker:**\n   - In the relevant rows where Chicago hosts Detroit (Row 3 and Row 4):\n     - In Row 3, Osgood is the decision-maker.\n     - In Row 4, Conklin is the decision-maker.\n\nThe claim specifically states that \"Conklin wins the decision when Chicago hosts Detroit.\" Since there is one instance (Row 4) where this condition is met, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table, let's break down each component of the claim and verify it with the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim mentions \"the game on may 24\". We need to find Row 4 in the table, which corresponds to May 24.\n\n2. **Home Team**: The claim states that \"chicago play as home team.\" In Row 4 of the table, it specifies \"home: detroit,\" meaning Detroit is the home team and Chicago is the visitor. Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Visitor Team**: Consistent with the above point, since Detroit is the home team on May 24, Chicago must be the visitor team. This aligns correctly with the table's information.\n\n4. **Decision**: The claim states \"the decider be conklin.\" According to Row 4 in the table, the decision was indeed made by Conklin.\n\nGiven that the claim incorrectly identifies Chicago as the home team when they were actually the visitor team on May 24, we can determine that the overall claim is false.\n\nNow let's list out the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row 4, \"date\" corresponds to \"may 24\".\n- Row 4, \"home\" corresponds to \"detroit\", which indicates Chicago was not the home team.\n- Row 4, \"visitor\" would confirm Chicago as the visitor (not directly needed since \"home\" suffices).\n- Row 4, \"decision\" corresponds to \"conklin\".\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
