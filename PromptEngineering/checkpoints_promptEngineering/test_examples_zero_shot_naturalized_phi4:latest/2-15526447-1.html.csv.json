    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"The most teams competed at Donington Park in 1996 and 1997,\" we need to compare the number of teams for each season mentioned in the table.\n\n1. Identify relevant information:\n   - We need the \"teams\" column from each row in the table.\n   \n2. Extract data:\n   - Row 6 (1996): Donington Park, 13 teams\n   - Row 7 (1997): Donington Park, 13 teams\n\n3. Compare with other seasons to ensure no season had more teams than these two:\n   - Row 1 (1990): 17 teams\n   - Row 2 (1991): 18 teams\n   - Row 3 (1992): 14 teams\n   - Row 4 (1993): 15 teams\n   - Row 5 (1994): 18 teams\n   - Row 6 (1996): 13 teams\n   - Row 7 (1997): 13 teams\n   - Row 8 (1998): 5 teams\n\n4.
