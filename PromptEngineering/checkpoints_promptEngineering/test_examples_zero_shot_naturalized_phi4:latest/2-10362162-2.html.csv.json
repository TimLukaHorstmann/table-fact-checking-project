Here's a breakdown:\n\n- The table starts at Week 1 and ends at Week 18.\n- Each row corresponds to a specific week of the season, and each week has an associated opponent and result.\n- There are no gaps in the sequence of weeks listed (i.e., there is no missing entry for any week between Week 1 and Week 18).\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the team played every week from Week 1 to Week 18. Therefore, there were not two weeks in which the team did not play.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those listing each week number:\n\n- Row Indexes: 0 through 15\n- Column Name: \"week\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because all weeks from 1 to 18 have corresponding game entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"The game on November 14, 1993, had the highest attendance of any game with 54,215 attendees.\"\n2. We first identify the relevant row for the date mentioned in the claim:\n   - Row 11 corresponds to the week 11 entry where the date is November 14, 1993.\n   - The attendance listed for this game is 67,329.\n\n3. Next, we compare this attendance number with all other games' attendances to verify if it's indeed the highest:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance = 44,120\n- Week 2: Attendance = 57,921\n- Week 4: Attendance = 61,746\n- Week 5: Attendance = 63,071\n- Week 6: Attendance = 54,215 (matches the number in the claim)\n- Week 8: Attendance = 64,677\n- Week 9: Attendance = 53,428\n- **Week 11**: Attendance = 67,329 (date mentioned in the claim)\n- Week 12: Attendance = 40,848\n- Week 13: Attendance = 53,030\n- Week 14: Attendance = 63,216\n- Week 15: Attendance = 63,321\n- Week 16: Attendance = 54,773\n- Week 17: Attendance = 59,236\n- Week 18: Attendance = 42,836\n\n4. The highest attendance number in the table is for the game on November 14, 1993 (67,329), not 54,215.\n\n5. Therefore, the claim that \"the game on November 14, 1993, had the highest attendance of any game with 54,215 attendees\" is false because:\n   - The actual attendance number for this date was 67,329.\n   - Another game (Week 6) indeed had an attendance of 54,215, but it was not the highest.\n\nBased on these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The relevant cells include the attendance for both Week 11 (November 14) and Week 6 (October 10), as these are directly related to verifying the claim.",
