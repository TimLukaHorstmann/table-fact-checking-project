    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"liu song be not rank higher in 2007 / 2008 than in 2009 / 2010\" is true or false, we need to compare the rankings for these specific years.\n\nThe table provides information across multiple rows and columns where each row appears to represent a different category of data. To evaluate this claim, we should focus on the categories that are related to ranking:\n\n1. **Row 16 (\"former ranking tournaments\")**: This seems relevant as it might contain historical ranking data.\n2. **Row 22 (\"former non - ranking tournaments\")**: Although these tournaments were not ranking in recent times, they might provide context or historical data.\n\nWe need to check the rankings for \"2007 / 2008\" and \"2009 / 2010\". Since there are no explicit numerical ranks provided directly within each row's cell that we can compare (e.g., numbers representing rank positions), we will assume that any specific mentions of ranking performance (\"a\", \"lq\", \"nr\", etc.) might indirectly indicate a comparative position.\n\n- **Row 16**:\n  - Column for \"2007 / 2008\": Value is \"former ranking tournaments\"\n  - Column for \"2009 / 2010\": Value is \"former ranking tournaments\"\n\nBoth columns contain the same non-specific value, which doesn't provide any direct information about rank change or difference.\n\n- **Row 22**:\n  - Column for \"2007 / 2008\": Value is \"former non - ranking tournaments\"\n  - Column for \"2009 / 2010\": Value is \"former non - ranking tournaments\"\n\nAgain, both columns contain the same value with no specific rank data.\n\nSince neither of these rows provides explicit information about numerical rankings or changes in ranking between 2007/2008 and 2009/2010, we cannot definitively say that Liu Song was not ranked higher in one period than another based solely on this table. Therefore, without more direct evidence (such as specific rank positions), the claim remains unsupported.\n\nThus, our conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"2007 / 2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"2007 / 2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 2010\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are considered from rows that describe former or potential ranking information. However, since no explicit ranks were given to support the claim directly, the answer is \"FALSE\".",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about Liu Song's ranking between the seasons 2005/06 and 2009/10, we need to analyze the specific rows in the table that contain information about rankings for these two periods.\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Ranking Information**:\n   - The first row of the table provides the numerical rankings for each season.\n   - We are interested in comparing the ranks for 2005/06 and 2009/10.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - For 2005/06, locate the ranking value in column \"2005 / 06\".\n   - For 2009/10, locate the ranking value in column \"2009 / 10\".\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Determine if Liu Song's rank in 2009/10 is at least 40 places lower than it was in 2005/06.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - From Row 0 (Ranking row):\n     - The ranking for 2005/06 is 45.\n     - The ranking for 2009/10 is 85.\n   - Calculate the difference: 85 - 45 = 40.\n   - Since the rank in 2009/10 is exactly 40 places lower than in 2005/06, the claim holds true.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is supported by the data provided. The relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"2005 / 06\" (Ranking: 45)\n- Row 0, Column \"2009 / 10\" (Ranking: 85)\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2005 / 06\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about Liu Song's best ranking in the 2008/09 season being in the top 50, we need to carefully analyze the table provided. The relevant information will be found under a specific column that contains numerical values or rankings, as this is where one would expect data on performance or ranking.\n\nLet's break down the steps required:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Column**: We are looking for a column that provides information about Liu Song's ranking or similar numeric measures of his performance. The table has columns with names like \"former ranking tournaments,\" \"not held,\" and others, but we need one that contains numerical rankings or related data.\n\n2. **Locate the 2008/09 Data**: Once the relevant column is identified, we need to focus on the row corresponding to the 2008/09 season to check Liu Song's performance during that period.\n\n3. **Check if Ranking Was Top 50**: The claim specifically states that Liu Song was in the top 50. Therefore, we need to verify if the data for 2008/09 reflects a ranking within this range (i.e., between 1 and 50).\n\n4. **Verify Across All Relevant Seasons**: To confirm that 2008/09 was indeed his best ranking season, it would be prudent to check other seasons where rankings are available to ensure none of them fall into the top 50 as well.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The column with numerical values appears to be the first unnamed column in each row, which contains numbers such as \"90\", \"76\", \"60\", etc. These numbers likely represent Liu Song's world ranking for each respective season.\n  \n- For the 2008/09 season, the value is \"60\". This indicates that Liu Song was ranked 60th during this period.\n\n- Since a rank of 60 is not within the top 50, Liu Song did not achieve his best ranking in 2008/09. Furthermore, we need to ensure no other seasons had a better (i.e., lower number) ranking than 60 that fell into the top 50 range. The lowest rank listed that falls below 60 and is within the top 50 is \"3r\" for 2009/10, which stands for 3rd round but does not specify an exact numerical world ranking.\n\nThus, Liu Song was never ranked in the top 50 during any of the seasons provided. Therefore, the claim that his best ranking was in 2008/09 when he made it into the top 50 is false.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Row Index 7** corresponds to the season 2008/09 with a rank of 60.\n- **Row Index 22** (or any other lower ranking within top 50) is checked for further verification that no better ranking exists in the table.",
