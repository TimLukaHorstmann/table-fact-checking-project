This does not involve Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n- **Step 2: Check for Any Match Between Everton and Tottenham Hotspur**\n  - Look through all rows for any match involving \"everton\" vs. \"tottenham hotspur\".\n  - Row 8 involves West Bromwich Albion (home) vs. Tottenham Hotspur (away), with a score of 1 - 0. Everton is not involved in this match.\n\n- **Step 3: Determine the Biggest Margin of Victory**\n  - Calculate the margin of victory for each match:\n    - Row 1: 2\n    - Row 2: 1\n    - Row 3: 2\n    - Row 4: 4\n    - Row 5: 0 (draw)\n    - Row 6: 2 (replay)\n    - Row 7: 1\n    - Row 8: 1\n    - Row 9: 3\n    - Row 10: 1\n    - Row 11: 1\n    - Row 12: 0 (draw, replay needed)\n    - Row 13: 2 (replay)\n    - Row 14: 6\n    - Row 15: 1\n    - Row 16: 2\n    - Row 17: 1\n    - Row 18: 3\n  - The largest margin of victory is 6 goals, which occurred in Row 14 (Crystal Palace vs. Everton).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Everton did not defeat Tottenham Hotspur with a score of 6 - 0.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are from Row 8 and Row 14:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"away_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
