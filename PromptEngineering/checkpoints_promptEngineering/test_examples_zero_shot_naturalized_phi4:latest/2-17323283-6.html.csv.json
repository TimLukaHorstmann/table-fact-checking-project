    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the Philadelphia Flyers' record as of February 23rd is true or false, we need to extract relevant information from the table provided:\n\n1. Identify the row in which the game against the Philadelphia Flyers took place.\n2. Check the date and ensure it matches February 23rd.\n3. Verify that the team's record on this date is indeed \"40 - 11 - 10\".\n\nFrom the given table:\n- **Row 13**: This row contains information about a game played on February 23rd against the Philadelphia Flyers, with a score of 4 - 3 and a record of 40 - 11 - 10.\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are satisfied by this row. The relevant cells for verifying the claim include:\n- **Row Index**: 12 (since it corresponds to Row 13 in natural language)\n- **Column Names**:\n  - \"opponent\" to check that it is indeed the Philadelphia Flyers.\n  - \"february\" to confirm the date as February 23rd.\n  - \"record\" to verify that it matches \"40 - 11 - 10\".\n\nGiven these checks, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
