Identify the row in the table that corresponds to the specified date range.\n   - Row 7 corresponds to the manager Steve Corica (caretaker) with a management period from November 12, 2012, to November 27, 2012.\n\n2. Check the number of matches managed and lost during this period:\n   - According to Row 7: \n     - \"managed\": 2\n     - \"lost\": 2\n\n3. Validate the claim against these figures:\n   - The table indicates that Steve Corica (caretaker) indeed managed 2 matches.\n   - All 2 of those matches were lost.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data from Row 7, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- From Row 7: \n  - The column \"managed\" indicating 2 matches managed.\n  - The column \"lost\" indicating 2 matches lost.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"managed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
