The game where Pittsburgh Penguins won 7 - 2 indeed has this largest margin of victory in terms of goal difference.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the largest margin of victory corresponds to a scoreline of 7 - 2, with a 5-goal difference which matches Row 5.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nFor verifying this claim, we need to check all rows for \"score\" and determine the margins.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify several key aspects of the claim:\n\n1. **Team Names**: The claim mentions \"Pittsburgh Penguin\" while the table shows \"Pittsburgh Penguins\". This discrepancy alone suggests a potential issue with the claim.\n\n2. **Series Details**:\n   - The claim states that this is the \"Wale Conference Final\", but the table does not specify which conference these teams belong to.\n   - The series should have been part of a playoff, as the term \"Conference Final\" implies it was in the final stage of a conference's playoffs.\n\n3. **Outcome**:\n   - The claim mentions that Pittsburgh Penguins won an \"even game\". This suggests they won one of the games with an even score (e.g., 2-1).\n   - Reviewing the scores in the table:\n     - May 1: 3 - 6 (Bruins win)\n     - May 3: 4 - 5 OT (Penguins win)\n     - May 5: 1 - 4 (Penguins win)\n     - May 7: 1 - 4 (Penguins win)\n     - May 9: 7 - 2 (Penguins win)\n     - May 11: 3 - 5 (Penguins win)\n\n   The Penguins won games with scores of 4-5 OT, 1-4, 1-4, 7-2, and 3-5. None of these are even-numbered scores.\n\n4. **Season**:\n   - The claim refers to the \"1990/91 season\". The table does not provide any information about the season.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The team name discrepancy (Penguin vs Penguins).\n- No mention of a conference in the table.\n- The series outcome does not include an even-score win by Pittsburgh.\n- Lack of season information.\n\nThe claim is inconsistent with the data provided in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nRelevant cells to verify these points are those related to scores and records:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
