    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check each team's score during the first leg and identify if more than two teams have the same score.\n\nLet's examine the \"1st leg\" scores for all rows:\n\n- **Row 1:** Botswana Defence Force XI - Mbabane Highlanders: Score = 1 - 1\n- **Row 2:** Arsenal (Maseru) - Eleven Arrows FC: Score = 3 - 0\n- **Row 3:** CD El\u00e1 Nguema - Primeiro de Agosto: Score = 2 - 3\n- **Row 4:** LPRC Oilers - Mighty Blackpool: Score = 1 - 0\n- **Row 5:** ASC Police - AS Real Bamako: Score = 1 - 1\n- **Row 6:** Port Autonome - Sporting Clube da Praia: Score = 0 - 0\n- **Row 7:** Saint-George SA - Al Ittihad: Score = 2 - 1\n- **Row 8:** Saint-Louis FC - Young Africans: Score = 1 - 3\n- **Row 9:** Sahel SC - Postel Sport: Score = 2 - 1\n- **Row 10:** Tourbillon FC - Forces Arm\u00e9es CA: Score = 0 - 0\n\nNow, let's count the occurrences of each score:\n\n- **Score 0 - 0:** Occurs in Row 6 and Row 10 (2 times)\n- **Score 1 - 1:** Occurs in Row 1 and Row 5 (2 times)\n- **Score 1 - 0:** Occurs in Row 4 (1 time)\n- **Score 3 - 0:** Occurs in Row 2 (1 time)\n- **Score 2 - 3:** Occurs in Row 3 (1 time)\n- **Score 2 - 1:** Occurs in Row 7 and Row 9 (2 times)\n- **Score 1 - 3:** Occurs in Row 8 (1 time)\n\nThe scores that appear more than once are:\n- Score 0 - 0: 2 occurrences\n- Score 1 - 1: 2 occurrences\n- Score 2 - 1: 2 occurrences\n\nNone of these scores occur more than twice. Therefore, there is no score during the first leg that appears for more than two teams.\n\nThe claim states \"there be more than 2 team that have the same score during the 1st leg,\" which implies at least one score must appear three or more times. Since this condition is not met, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells where scores of 0-0, 1-1, and 2-1 occur:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
