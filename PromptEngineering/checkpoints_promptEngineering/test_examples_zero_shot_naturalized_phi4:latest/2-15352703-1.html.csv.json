    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university,\" we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table: the draft pick number and the college associated with that pick.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the row where the `pick` is 155.\n   - From this row, we need to check the value of the `college` column.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - **Row 5**: The table indicates that in round 6, pick number 155 was for a player named John Nies, and his college is listed as Arizona.\n\n3. **Verify Claim Conditions:**\n   - The draft pick number 155 indeed comes from the entry where the `college` is \"arizona.\"\n   - This matches the condition specified in the claim, which mentions \"arizona university.\" While the table lists it simply as \"arizona,\" it can be inferred that this refers to Arizona University (commonly known as the University of Arizona).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conditions of the claim are fully supported by the data in row 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify which college had the last draft pick.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"Arizona be the college who have the last draft pick.\" This means we are looking for the college associated with the highest pick number in the table.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - We need to check the \"pick\" column to find the highest pick number.\n   - We also need to check the \"college\" column to verify which college corresponds to that highest pick number.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Pick 16, College: Fresno State\n   - Row 2: Pick 43, College: Louisville\n   - Row 3: Pick 70, College: Arizona\n   - Row 4: Pick 101, College: LSU\n   - Row 5: Pick 155, College: Arizona\n   - Row 6: Pick 167, College: Minnesota - Duluth\n   - Row 7: Pick 171, College: Carson - Newman\n   - Row 8: Pick 182, College: Syracuse\n   - Row 9: Pick 209, College: UCLA\n   - Row 10: Pick 239, College: Duke\n   - Row 11: Pick 266, College: UCLA\n   - Row 12: Pick 293, College: Northwestern State, LA\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Pick**:\n   - The highest pick number in the table is 293.\n\n5. **Verify the College for the Highest Pick**:\n   - The college associated with pick 293 (Row 12) is Northwestern State, LA.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Arizona does not have the last draft pick; Northwestern State, LA does.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those containing the highest pick number and its associated college:\n     - Row 12, Column \"pick\"\n     - Row 12, Column \"college\"\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
