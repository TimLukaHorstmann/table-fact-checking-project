    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Librado Andrade had a fight with Terry Smith.\n2. This fight happened before his fight with Marcus Harvey.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions using the relevant columns: \"opponent\" and \"date\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Identify the row where Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith:**\n  - Check each row to see if the opponent is \"Terry Smith\".\n  - According to Row 32, there is a fight with Terry Smith on date 2000 - 04 - 13.\n\n- **Identify the rows where Librado Andrade fought Marcus Harvey:**\n  - There are two entries for fights with Marcus Harvey:\n    - Row 30: Date 2000 - 08 - 17\n    - Row 35: Date 1999 - 08 - 14\n\n- **Determine if the fight with Terry Smith occurred before the first fight with Marcus Harvey:**\n  - The date of the fight with Terry Smith (Row 32) is 2000 - 04 - 13.\n  - Compare this to the dates of fights with Marcus Harvey:\n    - Row 30's date is after the fight with Terry Smith (2000 - 08 - 17).\n    - Row 35's date (1999 - 08 - 14) is before the fight with Terry Smith.\n\nSince the condition requires that the fight with Terry Smith happened before any of Librado Andrade\u2019s fights with Marcus Harvey, and it indeed happens before the first occurrence on 2000 - 08 - 17 but after the second on 1999 - 08 - 14, the claim is only partially true. The claim implies there should be no fight with Marcus Harvey prior to Terry Smith, which isn't correct due to Row 35.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\". \n\nThe relevant cells that verify this are from:\n- Row 32 for the fight with Terry Smith.\n- Rows 30 and 35 for the fights with Marcus Harvey.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
