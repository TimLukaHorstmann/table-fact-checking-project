    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the claim and compare it against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **\"5 of the 7\"**: This implies that there should be a total of 7 entries (rows) in the table.\n2. **\"2003 PGA Championship players\"**: We need to check if any player listed won in 2003.\n3. **\"have to par +11\"**: For those players who won in 2003, we need to verify if their \"to par\" value is +11.\n\n### Table Verification:\n- The table has 7 rows, so the first condition (\"5 of the 7\") is satisfied by the number of entries.\n- We need to check each row for the year 2003 and the corresponding \"to par\" values.\n\n#### Row-by-row Analysis:\n1. **Row 1**: Year won: 1993 (not 2003)\n2. **Row 2**: Year won: 1997 (not 2003)\n3. **Row 3**: Year won: 1996 (not 2003)\n4. **Row 4**: Year won: 1991 (not 2003)\n5. **Row 5**: Year won: 1986 (not 2003)\n6. **Row 6**: Year won: 1988 (not 2003)\n7. **Row 7**: Year won: 2002 (not 2003)\n\nNone of the rows indicate a player who won in 2003.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since no players listed won in 2003, it is impossible for \"5 of the 7\" to have a \"to par +11\" value based on the year 2003.\n- The claim is therefore **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this claim, we need to check the \"year won\" and \"to par\" columns for each row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
