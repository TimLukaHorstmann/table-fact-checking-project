The relevant column for this is \"matches.\"\n- **Goals Scored**: Verify that the number of goals scored by \"miguel zapata\" is 17. The relevant column for this is \"goals.\"\n\nNow, let's extract and verify these cells from Row 1:\n- **Row Index**: 0 (since indexing typically starts at 0)\n- **Column Name for Matches Played**: \"matches\"\n- **Column Value for Matches Played**: 28\n- **Column Name for Goals Scored**: \"goals\"\n- **Column Value for Goals Scored**: 17\n\nThe table confirms that \"miguel zapata\" played 28 matches and scored 17 goals.
