    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Fred Funk's score be 6 stroke higher than John Adam's score,\" we need to compare their scores from the provided table.\n\nFirstly, identify Fred Funk and John Adams in the table:\n\n- **Row 7**: Fred Funk has a score of 70 + 72 + 67 = 209.\n- **Row 6**: John Adams has a score of 70 + 70 + 69 = 209.\n\nNow, calculate the difference between their scores:\n\n- Fred Funk's score: 209\n- John Adams' score: 209\n\nThe difference in their scores is:\n\\[ 209 - 209 = 0 \\]\n\nAccording to the claim, Fred Funk's score should be 6 strokes higher than John Adam's score. However, as calculated above, there is no difference in their scores; they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the relevant information from the table:\n\n- **Row 7**: Fred Funk's score (column: \"score\").\n- **Row 6**: John Adams' score (column: \"score\").\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
