    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Jessica Ennis be the guest on Andrew and Jack's guest episode broadcast on 4 May 2012,\" we need to verify two main conditions using the provided table:\n\n1. The episode broadcast date is 4 May 2012.\n2. Jessica Ennis was the guest for Andrew and Jack in this episode.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row to find where these conditions are met:\n\n- **Row 3** contains:\n  - \"episode: 05x03\"\n  - \"first broadcast: 4 may 2012\" \u2014 This matches the date specified in the claim.\n  - \"andrew and jacks guest: jessica ennis\" \u2014 This confirms that Jessica Ennis was indeed the guest for Andrew and Jack on this episode.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied by Row 3, we can conclude the claim is true. The relevant cells from this row to verify the claim are:\n- Column \"first broadcast\" with value \"4 may 2012\"\n- Column \"andrew and jacks guest\" with value \"jessica ennis\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we must focus on identifying whether the first broadcast date for the episode featuring Jessica Ennis as Andrew and Jack's guest is before May 2012.\n\n1. **Identify relevant row**: We need to find the row where \"jessica ennis\" is listed under \"andrew and jacks guest.\" According to the table, this is in Row 3.\n\n2. **Verify first broadcast date**: In Row 3, we check the column labeled \"first broadcast\" for the date associated with Jessica Ennis's episode. The given date is \"4 may 2012.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim states that the broadcast should be before May 2012.\n   - The first broadcast date in Row 3 is \"4 may 2012,\" which is not before May 2012; it is within May 2012.\n\nSince the condition of being \"before May 2012\" is not met (the date is on May 4, 2012), the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for this determination are:\n- Row 3, column \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n- Row 3, column \"first broadcast\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
