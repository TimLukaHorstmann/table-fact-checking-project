The table provides entries with years from 1956 to 2008.\n   - By scanning through the rows, we find that row 17 corresponds to the year 2004.\n\n2. **Check the Relevant Column**:\n   - According to the claim, we need to verify the \"1st leg\" score for the year 2004.\n   - In naturalized format tables like this one, columns are labeled as \"year,\" \"winner,\" \"runners-up,\" \"aggregate,\" \"1st leg,\" and \"2nd leg.\"\n   - For row 17 (the year 2004), we need to examine the value in the \"1st leg\" column.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - From the table, for row 17, the entry under the \"1st leg\" column is \"0 - 2.\"\n   - The claim states that the \"1st leg\" score should be \"4 - 1.\" However, the actual value in the table is \"0 - 2.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the value \"0 - 2\" does not match the claimed value \"4 - 1,\" the statement is false.\n\nThe relevant cell that needed to be checked is located at row index 16 (considering zero-based indexing) under the column name \"1st leg.\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
