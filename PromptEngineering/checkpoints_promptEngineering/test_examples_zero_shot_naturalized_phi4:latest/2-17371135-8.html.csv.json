    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. Identify if there was a scoreless game for the Detroit team during February 2009.\n2. Verify if this scoreless game occurred on February 27, 2009, against Los Angeles.\n\nLet's analyze each row relevant to these conditions:\n\n- **Row 7**: This entry shows that Detroit played away against Columbus with a score of 2 - 3 on February 13, so it is not scoreless.\n- **Row 8**: Detroit was at home and won against Colorado with a score of 6 - 5 on February 15; this is also not scoreless.\n- **Row 11**: This row shows an away game for Detroit against Minnesota with a score of 2 - 5, hence not scoreless.\n- **Row 14**: Detroit played away against Nashville and lost 0 - 8. While this indicates that Detroit did not score any goals in the match (hence it was scoreless from their perspective), it does not occur on February 27 or involve Los Angeles.\n\nNow, let's focus specifically on the game mentioned in the claim:\n- **Row 13**: This row shows a home game for Detroit against Los Angeles with a score of 1 - 2 on February 27. While this is a close match, it is not scoreless as Detroit scored one goal.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude:\n\n- There was indeed a scoreless game from Detroit's perspective in Row 14 (0 - 8 against Nashville).\n- However, the game that occurred on February 27, 2009, against Los Angeles (Row 13) was not scoreless.\n\nThus, the claim is false because while there was a scoreless game, it did not occur on February 27 against Los Angeles.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"5 game in the 2008 - 09 season be play at home in detroit\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify if there were exactly 5 games played at home by Detroit during February of the 2008-09 NHL season.\n\nThe relevant columns for this task are \"date\", \"home\", and potentially \"record\", since they help identify whether a game was played at home in Detroit. We will specifically look at these columns to see how many entries match the condition where \"home\" is \"detroit\".\n\nHere's how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games for Detroit**:\n   - Look through each row and check if the \"home\" column value is \"detroit\".\n   \n2. **Count the Number of Such Entries**:\n   - Count the number of rows where the \"home\" column is \"detroit\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- Row 1: home = detroit\n- Row 2: home = detroit\n- Row 3: home = detroit\n- Row 4: home = pittsburgh (not counted)\n- Row 5: home = nashville (not counted)\n- Row 6: home = detroit\n- Row 7: home = columbus (not counted)\n- Row 8: home = detroit\n- Row 9: home = detroit\n- Row 10: home = detroit\n- Row 11: home = minnesota (not counted)\n- Row 12: home = detroit\n- Row 13: home = detroit\n- Row 14: home = nashville (not counted)\n\nCounting the rows where \"home\" is \"detroit\", we find there are 9 such games.\n\nThe claim states that only 5 games were played at home in Detroit, but our analysis shows there are actually 9.
