    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the raptor record remain below 500 for the month of March,\" we need to analyze the 'record' column in each row corresponding to games played during March.\n\nThe relevant information is as follows:\n- The table contains records for games numbered from 61 to 73.\n- Games 61 through 73 are all played within the month of March, as indicated by their dates (March 1 to March 29).\n- We need to check the 'record' column for these rows to determine if the team's record remained below .500.\n\nA team's record is represented in a format like \"wins - losses.\" For the Raptors to have a record below .500, they must have fewer wins than losses. Let's extract and interpret the records from March:\n\n1. Game 61: Record = 23-38 (Wins < Losses)\n2. Game 62: Record = 23-39 (Wins < Losses)\n3. Game 63: Record = 23-40 (Wins < Losses)\n4.

Game 72: Record = 27-45 (Wins < Losses)\n13. Game 73: Record = 28-45 (Wins < Losses)\n\nIn each case, the number of wins is less than the number of losses for all games in March.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the 'record' column from game 61 to 73, we conclude that the Raptors' record remained below .500 for the entire month of March.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Chris Bosh have the second most high points in March\" is true or false, we need to analyze the \"high points\" for each game in March and identify how many times Chris Bosh had the highest points, as well as who else achieved the highest points during that month.\n\nLet's review each row relevant to this claim:\n\n1. **March 1**: High points are listed as Chris Bosh (28).\n2. **March 3**: High points are Andrea Bargnani and Chris Bosh (25).\n3. **March 6**: High points are Chris Bosh (34).\n4. **March 8**: High points are Chris Bosh (30).\n5. **March 11**: High points are Andrea Bargnani (21).\n6. **March 13**: High points are Chris Bosh (27).\n7. **March 15**: High points are Andrea Bargnani (27).\n8. **March 16**: High points are Chris Bosh (18).\n9. **March 20**: High points are Chris Bosh (35).\n10. **March 22**: High points are Chris Bosh.\n11. **March 25**: High points are Andrea Bargnani (23).\n12. **March 27**: High points are Chris Bosh (21).\n13. **March 29**: High points are Chris Bosh (31).\n\nFrom this data, we can count the number of times each player achieved the highest points in March:\n\n- **Chris Bosh**: Achieved the highest points on March 1, 6, 8, 13, 16, 20, 22, 27, and 29.

Therefore, we need to check rows 1 through 6 as these correspond to the games played during this period.\n   \n2. **Check Game Outcomes**:\n   - **Row 1 (March 1)**: Team: Dallas; Outcome: Loss\n   - **Row 2 (March 3)**: Team: Houston; Outcome: Loss\n   - **Row 3 (March 6)**: Team: Miami; Outcome: Loss\n   - **Row 4 (March 8)**: Team: Utah; Outcome: Loss\n   - **Row 5 (March 11)**: Team: Philadelphia; Outcome: Loss\n   - **Row 6 (March 13)**: Team: Detroit; Outcome: Loss\n\n3. **Determine Number of Wins**:\n   - From the analysis, all games from March 1 to March 13 resulted in losses for the Raptors.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that the Raptors won only once during this period.
