Identify the row corresponding to Week 3:\n   - From Row 3, we see: `week: 3`, `date: october 9 , 1960`.\n\n2. Check if \"October 9, 1960\" is indeed associated with Week 3:\n   - The date in Row 3 matches the claim.\n\n3. Evaluate the logical structure of the claim:\n   - The phrase \"be the date after week 3\" suggests that October 9, 1960, should come chronologically after the end of Week 3.\n   - However, since October 9, 1960 is the date for Week 3 itself, it cannot be a date following Week 3.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The claim is logically incorrect because October 9, 1960 is not after Week 3; it is during Week 3.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells are those that provide information about the week and date for Row 3:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
