    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on the games against Miami and identify the players with the highest rebounds in those specific matchups.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Miami**: \n   - Look for rows where the team is listed as \"miami\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 5: game 77, date: April 8\n     - Row 9: game 81, date: April 15\n\n2. **Check Rebound Statistics**:\n   - For each identified game, examine the \"high rebounds\" column to see who had the highest rebounds.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy (14) have the highest rebound against Miami.\n   - Check if either player is listed as having the highest rebounds in any of the games against Miami.\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Game: 77\n  - High Rebounds: Michael Bradley (8)\n  - Jelani McCoy is not mentioned for this game.\n\n- **Row 9**:\n  - Game: 81\n  - High Rebounds: Jerome Williams (17)\n  - Neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy are listed as having the highest rebounds.\n\nFrom this analysis, neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy had the highest rebounds in any of the games against Miami. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
