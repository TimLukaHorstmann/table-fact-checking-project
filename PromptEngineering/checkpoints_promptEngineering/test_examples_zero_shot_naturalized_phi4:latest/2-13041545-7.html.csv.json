    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two conditions across the table:\n\n1. Identify all games with a score of 3 - 5.\n2. Compare their attendance figures to determine if 36,438 is indeed the highest.\n\nLet's analyze each row relevant to these conditions:\n\n- **Row 7:** Score: 6 - 3 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 8:** Score: 8 - 6 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 9:** Score: 1 - 2 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 10:** Score: 8 - 5 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 11:** Score: 4 - 7 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 12:** Score: 2 - 4 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 13:** Score: 6 - 3 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 14:** Score: 5 - 2 (13) (Not relevant)\n- **Row 15:** Score: 3 - 7 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 16:** Score: 3 - 2 (Relevant, Attendance: 30,294)\n- **Row 17:** Score: 6 - 4 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 18:** Score: 1 - 3 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 19:** Score: 4 - 1 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 20:** Score: 7 - 1 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 21:** Score: 12 - 6 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 22:** Score: 5 - 6 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 23:** Score: 2 - 7 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 24:** Score: 3 - 4 (Relevant, Attendance: 13,544)\n- **Row 25:** Score: 2 - 4 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 26:** Score: 3 - 10 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 27:** Score: 0 - 1 (Not relevant)\n- **Row 28:** Score: 3 - 5 (Relevant, Attendance: 36,438)\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Row 16 has a score of 3 - 2 with an attendance of 30,294.\n- Row 24 has a score of 3 - 4 with an attendance of 13,544.\n- Row 28 has a score of 3 - 5 with an attendance of 36,438.\n\nThe claim states that 36,438 is the highest attendance for a game with a score of 3 - 5.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the provided table data:\n\n1. **Check for Turnbow's Loss (4 - 8):**\n   - The claim states \"turnbow (4 - 8) take the loss.\" This means we must find a row where the \"loss\" column reads \"turnbow (4 - 8).\"\n\n2. **Verify Record of 54 - 61:**\n   - The claim further specifies that this game ends with a record of \"54 - 61.\"\n\nLet's go through the table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Date: August 13\n  - Opponent: Atlanta Braves\n  - Score: 4 - 7 (not relevant, but noted)\n  - Loss: turnbow (4 - 8) \u2705\n  - Attendance: 34718\n  - Record: 55 - 62 (does not match the required record of 54 - 61)\n\n- **Row 11 is the only row where Turnbow's loss condition is met, but the record at that time does not match \"54 - 61\".**\n\nNow we'll check if there are any other rows that satisfy both conditions:\n\n- We systematically review each row and find:\n  - No other instance of turnbow (4 - 8) in the \"loss\" column.\n  - The game ending with a record of \"54 - 61\" occurs on **Row 11** after checking all previous entries, but Turnbow is not associated with this record.\n\nSince no row satisfies both conditions simultaneously (Turnbow's loss and the 54 - 61 record), the claim is false. Therefore, we identify relevant cells to support our conclusion:\n\n- The \"loss\" column in Row 11: turnbow (4 - 8).\n- The \"record\" column in Row 11: 55 - 62.\n- The \"record\" column in Row 11 just before this game: 54 - 61.\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify games with a score of \"1 - 3\".\n2. Among these identified games, check if there is one with an attendance figure of \"10226\" and ensure it's the smallest such attendance.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games with Score \"1 - 3\"\nWe need to examine each row for a score that matches \"1 - 3\":\n\n- Row 17 has a score of \"6 - 4\", not \"1 - 3\".\n- Row 18 has a score of \"1 - 3\", which matches the condition.\n- Check other rows, but none have this exact score.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Attendance for Identified Games\nFrom the previous step, only Row 18 has a score of \"1 - 3\". Now we verify its attendance:\n\n- **Row 18**: The attendance is \"41222\".\n  \nWe've found one game with a score of \"1 - 3\" and an attendance of \"41222\". \n\n### Step 3: Verify the Claim About Attendance\nThe claim states that \"10226 be the smallest attendance of a game that have a score of 1 - 3\". We only identified one such game (Row 18), with an attendance of \"41222\".\n\nTherefore, since no games have an attendance of \"10226\" with a score of \"1 - 3\", and the game we found has an attendance higher than \"10226\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The score column for Row 18.\n- The attendance column for Row 18.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
