Payton had 8 high assists specifically on March 10.\n\nLet's break down the relevant information from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Total High Assists by G. Payton\nWe need to find each game where G. Payton was noted as having the highest number of assists and sum these values.\n\n- **Game 59 (March 3):** G. Payton had 9 high assists.\n- **Game 60 (March 5):** G. Payton had 12 high assists.\n- **Game 62 (March 8):** G. Payton had 7 high assists.\n- **Game 63 (March 10):** G. Payton had 5 high assists.\n- **Game 64 (March 11):** G. Payton had 9 high assists.\n- **Game 65 (March 15):** G. Payton had 8 high assists.\n- **Game 67 (March 19):** G. Payton had 11 high assists.\n\nSumming these values gives us the total number of high assists by G. Payton:  \n9 + 12 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 11 = 61\n\n### Step 2: Check Specific Game on March 10\nNow, we need to verify if G. Payton had exactly 8 high assists in the game on March 10.\n\n- **Game 63 (March 10):** According to the table, G. Payton had 5 high assists.\n\nThe claim states that G. Payton had 8 high assists on March 10, but according to the data, he only had 5.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince G. Payton did not have 8 high assists on March 10 and the total number of high assists for G.
