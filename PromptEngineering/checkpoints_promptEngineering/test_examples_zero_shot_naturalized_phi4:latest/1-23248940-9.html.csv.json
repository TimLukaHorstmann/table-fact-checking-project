Here's why:\n- Row 1: 24 - 23\n- After 3 games (to reach Row 4), the record becomes 25 - 25.\n  - This implies 1 win and 2 losses occurred between Row 1 and Row 4.\n\nCombining these results with those from Rows 5 to 10, we get:\n- Wins: 2 (Rows 5 & 7) + 2 (before Row 5) = 4 wins\n- Losses: 2 (Rows 9 & 10) + 3 (before Row 5) = 5 losses\n\nTherefore, the overall record is not 3 wins and 7 losses.

The key point is whether any other value of high rebounds for Bobcats matches or exceeds 20 as the second highest count after identifying the maximum.\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - High Rebounds: Gerald Wallace (10) \n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - High Rebounds: Nazr Mohammed (17)\n   \n3. **Row 3**:\n   - High Rebounds: Boris Diaw (8)\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - High Rebounds: Nazr Mohammed (10)\n\n5. **Row 5**:\n   - High Rebounds: Nazr Mohammed (20) \n\n6. **Row 6**:\n   - High Rebounds: Gerald Wallace, Boris Diaw (10)\n   \n7. **Row 7**:\n   - High Rebounds: Tyrus Thomas (12)\n   \n8. **Row 9**:\n   - High Rebounds: Gerald Wallace (12)\n\n9. **Row 10**:\n   - High Rebounds: Gerald Wallace (8)\n\nNow, let's list the high rebound values for Bobcat players in descending order:\n\n- Nazr Mohammed: 20\n- Nazr Mohammed: 17\n- Gerald Wallace: 12\n- Tyrus Thomas: 12\n- Gerald Wallace: 10\n- Nazr Mohammed: 10\n- Boris Diaw, Gerald Wallace: 10\n- Gerald Wallace: 8\n- Boris Diaw: 8\n\nThe highest rebound count is 20 by Nazr Mohammed. The second highest count is 17 (also by Nazr Mohammed). Therefore, the second most rebounds by a Bobcat player in one game do not equal 20.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
