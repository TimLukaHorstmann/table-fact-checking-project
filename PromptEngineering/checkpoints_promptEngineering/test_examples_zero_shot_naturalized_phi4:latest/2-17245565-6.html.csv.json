    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 2 players scored under par at the 1971 US Open\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data focusing on two columns: \"score\" and \"to par\". Specifically, we are looking for entries where the value in the \"to par\" column indicates a score under par. A negative number in this context means that the player scored under par.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Player Jim Simons has a score of \"71 + 71 + 65 = 207\", and \"to par: -3\". The \"to par\" value is negative, indicating he scored under par.\n- **Row 2**: Player Jack Nicklaus has a score of \"69 + 72 + 68 = 209\", and \"to par: -1\". This also indicates he scored under par.\n- **Row 3**: Player Bobby Nichols has a score of \"69 + 72 + 69 = 210\", and \"to par: e\". An even to par (\"e\") means the player scored exactly on par, not under it.\n- **Rows 4 to 7**: All players (Lee Trevino, George Archer, Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson) have scores that are \"+1\" over par. Therefore, they did not score under par.\n- **Rows 8 to 10**: Similarly, these players (Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin) all scored \"2\" over par.\n\nFrom this analysis, only two players, Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus, have scores under par as indicated by their negative \"to par\" values. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying this claim are from Row 1 and Row 2 in the \"to par\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"more than 3 golfers scored under par on three separate rounds,\" we need to analyze each player's individual round scores in relation to par and check if they scored under par (a negative score) on at least three different rounds.\n\n1. **Jim Simons**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 71, To Par = -3\n   - Round 2: Score = 71, To Par = -3\n   - Round 3: Score = 65, To Par = -7\n   - Jim Simons scored under par on all three rounds.\n\n2. **Jack Nicklaus**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Round 2: Score = 72, To Par = +0\n   - Round 3: Score = 68, To Par = -2\n   - Jack Nicklaus scored under par on two rounds.\n\n3. **Bobby Nichols**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Round 2: Score = 72, To Par = +0\n   - Round 3: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Bobby Nichols scored under par on two rounds.\n\n4. **Lee Trevino**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 70, To Par = +0\n   - Round 2: Score = 72, To Par = +2\n   - Round 3: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Lee Trevino scored under par on one round.\n\n5. **George Archer**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 71, To Par = +0\n   - Round 2: Score = 70, To Par = -1\n   - Round 3: Score = 70, To Par = +0\n   - George Archer scored under par on one round.\n\n6. **Jim Colbert**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Round 2: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Round 3: Score = 73, To Par = +3\n   - Jim Colbert scored under par on two rounds.\n\n7. **Bob Erickson**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 71, To Par = +0\n   - Round 2: Score = 67, To Par = -3\n   - Round 3: Score = 73, To Par = +3\n   - Bob Erickson scored under par on one round.\n\n8. **Ken Still**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 71, To Par = +0\n   - Round 2: Score = 72, To Par = +2\n   - Round 3: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n   - Ken Still scored under par on one round.\n\n9. **Larry Hinson**:\n   - Round 1: Score = 71, To Par = +0\n   - Round 2: Score = 71, To Par = +0\n   - Round 3: Score = 70, To Par = -1\n   - Larry Hinson scored under par on one round.\n\n10. **Bruce Devlin**:\n    - Round 1: Score = 72, To Par = +2\n    - Round 2: Score = 69, To Par = -1\n    - Round 3: Score = 71, To Par = +0\n    - Bruce Devlin scored under par on one round.\n\nJim Simons is the only golfer who scored under par in all three rounds. The claim states \"more than 3 golfers,\" which means at least four golfers must have achieved this feat. Only Jim Simons qualifies, so the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the scores and to-par information for each round of Jim Simons, as he is the only player meeting the criteria partially (three rounds under par).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
