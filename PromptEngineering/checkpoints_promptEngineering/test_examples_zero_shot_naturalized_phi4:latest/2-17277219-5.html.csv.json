The player should be Gary Player.\n2. His country should be South Africa.\n3. His place should be T4.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition against the data provided in the table:\n\n- **Condition 1:** Check if there is a row with the player \"gary player\".\n  - Relevant cell: Row 6, Column \"player\" shows \"gary player\".\n\n- **Condition 2:** Verify that Gary Player\u2019s country is South Africa.\n  - Relevant cell: Row 6, Column \"country\" confirms it as \"south africa\".\n\n- **Condition 3:** Confirm that Gary Player's place is T4.\n  - Relevant cell: Row 6, Column \"place\" indicates \"t4\".\n\nAll conditions are satisfied by the data in row 6.
