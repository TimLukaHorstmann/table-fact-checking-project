    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about North Carolina's scores in the table, we need to verify two specific pieces of information mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. The preliminaries score for North Carolina should be 8.068.\n2. The evening gown score for North Carolina should be 8.472.\n\nWe will identify the relevant row and columns from the naturalized format table to check these conditions against the provided values.\n\nFirst, locate North Carolina's data in the table:\n- The row corresponding to \"north carolina\" is Row 8.\n\nNext, verify each condition using the appropriate column:\n\n1. **Preliminaries score for North Carolina**:\n   - According to the claim: 8.068\n   - From the table (Row 8): preliminaries = 8.068\n\n2. **Evening gown score for North Carolina**:\n   - According to the claim: 8.472\n   - From the table (Row 8): evening gown = 8.472\n\nBoth conditions match the values provided in the table, so the entire claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, we conclude that the answer is \"TRUE\". The relevant cells are from Row 8 for both the preliminaries and evening gown columns.\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based, so Row 8 in the naturalized table corresponds to `row_index` 7.",
