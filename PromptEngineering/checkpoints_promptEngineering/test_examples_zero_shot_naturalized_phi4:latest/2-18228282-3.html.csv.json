    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"1972 be the year when rowan barrett be bear,\" we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table and match them with the components of the claim.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The phrase is informal and seems to suggest that 1972 is significant for Rowan Barrett, specifically referring to his birth year.\n   - \"Bear\" in this context could be interpreted as a metaphorical way of saying he was born or it indicates significance in relation to him.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Table Data**:\n   - We need to find the row where Rowan Barrett is listed and check if 1972 is mentioned as his year of birth.\n   - The table provides information in columns such as \"player,\" \"height,\" \"position,\" \"year born (age),\" and \"current club.\"\n\n3. **Locating Rowan Barrett's Data**:\n   - From the table, we identify that Rowan Barrett is listed in Row 6.\n\n4. **Checking Year of Birth for Rowan Barrett**:\n   - In Row 6, under the column \"year born (age): november 24 , 1972 (age41),\" it explicitly states that his birth year is 1972.\n   - This confirms the part of the claim regarding the year 1972.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The data in Row 6 supports the claim that 1972 is significant as Rowan Barrett's birth year.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year born (age)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
