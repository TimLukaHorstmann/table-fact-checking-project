    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Winfield Scott has allegiance with the USA\" is true or false, we need to identify and verify specific information from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Winfield Scott's Row:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Winfield Scott,\" so we locate his entry in the table.\n   - From the given data, Row 4 corresponds to \"name: winfield scott.\"\n\n2. **Check Allegiance:**\n   - We need to verify the \"allegiance\" column for Winfield Scott's row to confirm if it states \"USA.\"\n   - In Row 4 of the table, the \"allegiance\" is listed as \"usa.\"\n\nSince the allegiance in Row 4 under the \"allegiance\" column is indeed \"usa,\" this supports the claim. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this information is located at:\n- **Row Index:** 3 (since row indices start from zero)\n- **Column Name:** \"allegiance\"\n\nHere's the JSON output for the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"allegiance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
