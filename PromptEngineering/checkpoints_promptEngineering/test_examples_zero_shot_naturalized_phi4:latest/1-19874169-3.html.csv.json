    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro be the branding for the call sign dxyr,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Check if there is a row where the `branding` is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\"\n2. Verify that this same row has the `callsign` as \"dxyr.\"\n\nLet's go through each relevant row in the provided table to see which one meets both conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Branding: yes! fm 101.1\n  - Callsign: dwys\n\n  This does not match the required branding.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Branding: yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\n  - Callsign: dzvm\n\n  This does not match the required branding.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Branding: yes! fm 91.1 boracay\n  - Callsign: dyyr\n\n  This does not match the required branding.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Branding: yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\n  - Callsign: dyyd\n\n  This does not match the required branding.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Branding: yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\n  - Callsign: dxyr\n\n  Both conditions are satisfied in this row, as it matches both the required branding and callsign.\n\nSince Row 5 satisfies both conditions of having \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" as the branding and \"dxyr\" as the callsign, we can conclude that the claim is true. The relevant cells for verification are from Row 5 in both the `branding` and `callsign` columns.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to identify and verify relevant information in the table related to this claim.\n\nThe claim involves two main conditions:\n1. The presence of a broadcasting entity with the branding \"yes! fm\".\n2. A frequency value of 101.1 MHz associated with that branding.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 1** has the following details:\n  - Branding: yes! fm\n  - Frequency: 101.1 mhz\n\nThese conditions match exactly what is stated in the claim. The broadcasting entity with \"yes! fm\" branding indeed broadcasts at a frequency of 101.1 MHz.\n\nFor verification, the relevant cells from Row 1 are:\n- Column \"branding\": matches \"yes! fm\"\n- Column \"frequency\": matches \"101.1 mhz\"\n\nThese confirm that the claim is supported by the data in the table. There's no need to check other rows because they either do not match both conditions or are redundant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE based on these verifications.
