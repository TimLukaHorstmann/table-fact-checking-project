    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the man of the match against Slough Jets on a specific date, we need to examine relevant entries in the provided table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"the man of the match against the slough jets on the 2nd be lukas smital.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Conditions**:\n   - Opponent: \"slough jets\"\n   - Date: \"2nd\"\n   - Man of the Match: \"lukas smital\"\n\n### Verification Against Table:\n\nWe will examine each row to find entries that match these conditions.\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Date: 1st, Opponent: slough jets\n  - The date does not match (2nd), so this row is irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: 2nd, Opponent: slough jets\n  - Man of the Match: paul dixon\n  - This row matches the opponent and date conditions. However, the man of the match is \"paul dixon\", not \"lukas smital\". \n\nSince the man of the match in Row 2 does not match the claim (it should be \"lukas smital\" but it's \"paul dixon\"), we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 2, columns related to checking the conditions: \n  - Date\n  - Opponent\n  - Man of the Match\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"man of the match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
