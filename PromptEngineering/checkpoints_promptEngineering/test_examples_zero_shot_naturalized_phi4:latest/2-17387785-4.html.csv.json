    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 8 player contracts will end after 2012\" is true or false, we need to analyze the \"contracted until\" column for each row in the table. We'll count how many players have their contract ending after 2012.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Contracted until 2011.\n2. **Row 2**: Contracted until 2010.\n3. **Row 3**: Contracted until 2010.\n4. **Row 4**: Contracted until 2010.\n5. **Row 5**: Contracted until 2009.\n6. **Row 6**: Contracted until 2009.\n7. **Row 7**: Contracted until 2010.\n8. **Row 8**: Contracted until 2009.\n9. **Row 9**: Contracted until 2009.\n10. **Row 10**: Contracted until 2012.\n11. **Row 11**: Contracted until 2011.\n12. **Row 12**: Contracted until 2009.\n13. **Row 13**: Contracted until 2010.\n14. **Row 14**: Contracted until 2011.\n15. **Row 15**: Contracted until 2009.\n16. **Row 16**: Contracted until 2010.\n17. **Row 17**: Contracted until 2011.\n18. **Row 18**: Contracted until 2009.\n19. **Row 19**: Contracted until 2011.\n20. **Row 20**: Contracted until 2010.\n21. **Row 21**: Contracted until 2011.\n22. **Row 22**: Contracted until 2009.\n23. **Row 23**: Contracted until 2010.\n24. **Row 24**: Contracted until 2010.\n25. **Row 25**: Contracted until 2009.\n26. **Row 26**: Contracted until 2011.\n27. **Row 27**: Contracted until 2010.\n28. **Row 28**: Contracted until 2010.\n29. **Row 29**: Contracted until 2010.\n30. **Row 30**: Contracted until 2011.\n31. **Row 31**: Contracted until 2009.\n\nNow, count the players with contracts ending after 2012:\n\n- **Row 10**: Contracted until 2012 (not after 2012).\n\nNo players have contracts ending after 2012.
