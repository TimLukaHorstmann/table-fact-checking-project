    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season\", we need to evaluate specific conditions mentioned in the claim using relevant data from the provided table.\n\n**Conditions to Check:**\n1. The player is Lionel Messi.\n2. He has a rank of 2.\n3. He scored 73 goals.\n4. This occurred during the 2011/12 season.\n\nLet's verify these against the table:\n\n- **Row Verification for Lionel Messi in 2011/12 Season**:\n  - Row 1: \n    - `name`: lionel messi\n    - `season`: 2011 / 12\n    - `rank`: 1\n    - `goals`: 73\n\nFrom this row, we see that Lionel Messi scored 73 goals in the 2011/12 season. However, his rank for that season is 1, not 2.\n\n- **Further Verification**:\n  - We should check other rows to ensure there's no conflicting information about Messi having a rank of 2 during this season.\n  - Row 3 and Row 2 both pertain to seasons involving Lionel Messi (2011/12 and 2012/13 respectively), but neither shows him ranked at position 2 in the 2011/12 season.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe claim incorrectly states that Lionel Messi had a rank of 2 during the 2011/12 season when he actually held a rank of 1. Therefore, the claim is false based on this discrepancy.\n\nRelevant cells from the table for verifying the claim are in Row 1, specifically under columns `name`, `season`, `rank`, and `goals`.\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
