    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Celtic and Omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to check each row for matches involving Celtic FC and AC Omonia in their respective columns related to the club name and the score of the first leg.\n\nHere's how we will verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We are interested in two columns: \"club\" (to identify whether Celtic or Omonia played) and \"1st leg\" (to check if they scored 0 - 1).\n\n2. **Inspect Each Row**:\n   - Check the \"club\" column to see if it mentions either \"celtic\" or \"ac omonia\".\n   - For those rows, examine the \"1st leg\" score to determine if it was 0 - 1.\n\n3. **Relevant Rows**:\n   - Row 16: \n     - Club: Celtic\n     - 1st Leg: 0 - 1 (Matches our condition of interest)\n   - Row 17:\n     - Club: AC Omonia\n     - 1st Leg: 0 - 1 (Also matches our condition)\n\nBased on the inspection, both Celtic and AC Omonia had a first leg score of 0 - 1 in their respective entries in rows 16 and 17. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Row indices in the JSON response are zero-based as per typical programming conventions (i.e., row 16 in the table is at index 15).",
