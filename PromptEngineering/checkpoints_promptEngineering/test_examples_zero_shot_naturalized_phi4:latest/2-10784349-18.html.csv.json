Therefore, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Part 2: Lowest Crowd\n- **Row 1:** Crowd is 20,555.\n- **Row 2:** Crowd is 16,800.\n- **Row 3:** Crowd is 15,500.\n- **Row 4:** Crowd is 27,100 (venue is Junction Oval).\n- **Row 5:** Crowd is 21,895.\n- **Row 6:** Crowd is 14,151.\n\nThe lowest crowd is indeed 14,151. However, the venue for this crowd size is Brunswick Street Oval, not Junction Oval as stated in the claim. Therefore, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince one part of the claim (the location of the lowest crowd) is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Dates are relevant to verify all matches 22 August 1964.\n- Crowds and venues are relevant to identify the lowest crowd and its venue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
