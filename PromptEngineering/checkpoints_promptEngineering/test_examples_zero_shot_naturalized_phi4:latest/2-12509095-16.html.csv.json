    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check each row in the table for occurrences of a player named John Isner playing on a grass surface from 2009 to 2013.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows and columns**: The relevant column here is \"player\" (to find entries for John Isner), \"surface\" (to verify if it's grass), and \"event year\" (to ensure it falls between 2009 and 2013). We should examine each row to check these conditions.\n\n2. **Examine each row**:\n   - Row 1: player is 2009; irrelevant.\n   - Row 2: player is Ga\u00ebl Monfils; irrelevant.\n   - Row 3: player is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga; irrelevant.\n   - Row 4: player is Andy Roddick; irrelevant.\n   - Row 5: player is 2010; irrelevant.\n   - Row 6: player is Nikolay Davydenko; irrelevant.\n   - Row 7: player is 2011; irrelevant.\n   - Row 8: player is David Ferrer; irrelevant.\n   - Row 9: player is 2012; irrelevant.\n   - Row 10: player is Roger Federer; irrelevant.\n   - Row 11: player is Novak Djokovic; irrelevant.\n   - Row 12: player is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga; irrelevant.\n   - Row 13: player is Janko Tipsarevi\u0107; irrelevant.\n   - Row 14: player is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga; irrelevant.\n   - Row 15: player is Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych; irrelevant.\n   - Row 16: player is 2013; irrelevant.\n   - Row 17: player is Milos Raonic; irrelevant.\n   - Row 18: player is Novak Djokovic; irrelevant.\n   - Row 19: player is Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro; irrelevant.\n\nNone of the rows mention John Isner as the player. Therefore, there are no instances where John Isner played on a grass surface between 2009 and 2013 according to this table.\n\nBased on the examination above, the claim that \"John Isner play[ed] on a grass surface a total of 3 times from 2009 to 2013\" is not supported by any data in the table. Therefore, the answer is FALSE, and no relevant cells are applicable since John Isner is not mentioned at all.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"a minority of the events have been played in the United States,\" we need to determine how many unique events are listed and identify which ones took place in the United States.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns for this evaluation are `event` (to identify the event) and `surface` or additional details provided within the same cell to determine the location of the event (specifically checking if it includes \"United States\").\n\n2. **List Unique Events:**\n   - 2009\n   - Indian Wells\n   - Washington\n   - US Open\n   - Beijing\n   - Paris\n   - Davis Cup (Fribourg, Switzerland)\n   - Davis Cup (Roquebrune-cap-Martin, France)\n   - Olympics (London, England)\n   - Winston-Salem\n   - Cincinnati\n\n3. **Determine Events in the United States:**\n   - Indian Wells (Row 2) is in the United States.\n   - Washington (Row 3) is in the United States.\n   - US Open (Row 4) is in New York, United States.\n   - Winston-Salem (Rows 14 and 15) are in the United States.\n   - Cincinnati (Rows 17, 18, and 19) are in the United States.\n\n4. **Count Unique Events:**\n   - Total unique events: 11\n     - 2009, Indian Wells, Washington, US Open, Beijing, Paris, Davis Cup (Fribourg), Davis Cup (Roquebrune-cap-Martin), Olympics (London), Winston-Salem, Cincinnati\n\n5. **Count Events in the United States:**\n   - Total events in the United States: 6\n     - Indian Wells, Washington, US Open, Winston-Salem, Cincinnati (noted multiple times but counted as one unique event)\n\n6. **Determine Majority or Minority:**\n   - A minority means less than half. With 11 total unique events, more than half would be at least 6.\n   - Since there are exactly 6 events in the United States, this is not a minority (it's exactly half).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"a minority of the events have been played in the United States\" is FALSE because the number of events held in the United States equals half of the total unique events, not less than half.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
