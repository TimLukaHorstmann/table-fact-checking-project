    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, let's break it down:\n\n**Claim:** \"3 of the people tie for ninth place be from the united state\"\n\nThis means we need to check:\n1. If exactly 3 players are tied for ninth place.\n2. If all these players are from the United States.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- **Row 9, Row 10, Row 11, and Row 12** correspond to players tied for ninth place (indicated by \"t9\" in the \"place\" column).\n  \nWe need to check:\n- The country of each player in these rows.\n\n**Relevant Rows:**\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Player: paul azinger\n  - Country: united states\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Player: hubert green\n  - Country: united states\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Player: tom kite\n  - Country: united states\n\n- **Row 12:** \n  - Player: jos\u00e9 mar\u00eda olaz\u00e1bal\n  - Country: spain\n\nFrom the information above:\n- Rows 9, 10, and 11 have players from the United States.\n- Row 12 has a player from Spain.\n\nThus, there are indeed 3 players from the United States tied for ninth place, but there is also a fourth player (from Spain) in the tie. Therefore, not all players tied for ninth place are from the United States.\n\nThe claim that \"3 of the people tie for ninth place be from the united state\" is misleading because it implies exclusivity to 3, while ignoring the presence of another player from a different country.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The claim is **FALSE** since not all tied players are from the United States (there's one from Spain).\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
