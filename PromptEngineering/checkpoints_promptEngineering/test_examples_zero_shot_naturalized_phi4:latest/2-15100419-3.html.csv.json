In this context, since the pick number is 18 within Round 4, it can be considered relatively low for that round because lower numbers indicate earlier selections.\n\nThus, the relevant cells from Row 4 are:\n- `pick`: 18\n- `college`: cornell\n\nThese pieces of information confirm that a player from Cornell was indeed selected with pick number 18 in Round 4, which supports the claim about having a \"low pick.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
