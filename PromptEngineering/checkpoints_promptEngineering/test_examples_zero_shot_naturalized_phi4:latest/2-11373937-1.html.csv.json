The locomotive identified as \"bl27\" should have a serial number of \"83 - 1011\".\n2. The livery for this locomotive should be \"pacific national blue & yellow\".\n\nLet's examine these step-by-step using the relevant rows and columns from the naturalized table:\n\n- **Locomotive Identifier**: We need to find the row where \"locomotive\" is \"bl27\". From the table:\n  - Row 2 contains \"locomotive: bl27\", so this row is relevant.\n\n- **Serial Number Verification**: For row 2, we check if \"serial no\" matches \"83 - 1011\".\n  - Row 2 indeed has \"serial no: 83 - 1011\". This confirms that the locomotive in question is correctly identified.\n\n- **Livery Verification**: Next, we need to confirm that the livery for row 2 is \"pacific national blue & yellow\".\n  - Row 2 lists the livery as \"pacific national blue & yellow\".\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the information in row 2 of the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.
