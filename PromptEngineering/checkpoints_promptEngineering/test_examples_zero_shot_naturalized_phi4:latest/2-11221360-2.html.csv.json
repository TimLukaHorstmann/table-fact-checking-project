Check if this KO loss occurred in the same tournament as the drawn match.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Identifying the KO Loss:**\n\n- We look for a row where the method is \"KO\". \n- According to Row 14, we have:\n  - `method`: \"ko (punch)\"\n  \nThis indicates that there was indeed a loss by KO against Takeshi Inoue.\n\n**Identifying the Drawn Match:**\n\n- Look for a row where the result is a draw.\n- From Row 9, we find:\n  - `res`: \"draw\"\n  - The event is \"pip - east vs west\"\n\nThis confirms that there was a drawn match at the event \"pip - east vs west\".\n\n**Checking if Both Occurred in the Same Tournament:**\n\nNow, compare the events for both matches:\n\n- KO Loss (Row 14):\n  - `event`: \"shooto\"\n  \n- Drawn Match (Row 9):\n  - `event`: \"pip - east vs west\"\n\nThe KO loss and the drawn match occurred in different tournaments (\"shooto\" and \"pip - east vs west\", respectively).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the defeat by a KO did not occur in the same tournament as the drawn match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
