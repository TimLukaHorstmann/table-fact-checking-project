Identify which row corresponds to the place \"jacksonville.\"\n2. Verify that the \"round\" value for this row is indeed 11.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps:\n\n- Look at each row in the table and find where the \"place\" column has the value \"jacksonville.\" \n- Check the corresponding \"round\" column value for this row to see if it matches the number 11, as stated in the claim.\n\nFrom the table provided:\n- Row 11 lists the place as \"jacksonville.\"\n- In Row 11, the round is indeed listed as 11.\n\nThis confirms that the claim is supported by the data. Therefore, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n1. The \"place\" column in Row 11, which has the value \"jacksonville.\"\n2. The \"round\" column in Row 11, which has the value 11.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the required information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index is zero-based, so Row 11 corresponds to an index of 10.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the standing in the second week onwards be 3rd\" is true or false, we must analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - Each row represents a race event with several attributes such as round number, date, place, finishing position, total points accumulated up to that round, and current standing in the championship.\n   \n2. **Identifying the Second Week Onwards:**\n   - The \"second week onwards\" refers to rounds starting from the second one listed in the table. In this case, it is Row 2 onward (starting with Round 2).\n\n3. **Checking the Standing Column for Each Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to check if the \"standing\" column value is 3rd for all rows starting from Row 2.\n\n4. **Examination of Each Row Starting From Row 2:**\n\n   - **Row 2 (Round 2):** standing = 4th\n     - Not 3rd, so the claim fails here.\n   - Since we've found a counterexample in Row 2 itself where the standing is not 3rd, there's no need to check further rows. The condition has already been violated.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Because at least one row from the second week onwards does not have a standing of 3rd (Row 2 has a standing of 4th), the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - Row index for each relevant check begins with Row 2.\n   - The relevant column to verify the claim is \"standing\".\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"standing\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
