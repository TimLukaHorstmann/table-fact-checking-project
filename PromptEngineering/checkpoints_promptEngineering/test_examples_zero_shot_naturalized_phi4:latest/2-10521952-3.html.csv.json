    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table, let's break down each part of the claim and verify it against the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Result**: \"when the result be 1 - 1\"\n   - We need to find a row where the \"result\" column is \"1 - 1\".\n\n2. **Date**: \"the date be 8 october 2010\"\n   - The corresponding date for the above condition should match this.\n\n3. **Score**: \"with a score of 3 - 1\"\n   - For the same row, check if the \"score\" column is \"3 - 1\".\n\n4. **Venue**: \"venue of pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\"\n   - The venue for this match should be \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n\n### Verification against the Table:\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Result: 2 - 1 (not matching)\n  \n- **Row 2**:\n  - Result: 8 - 0 (not matching)\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Result: 3 - 0 (not matching)\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Result: 4 - 0 (not matching)\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Result: 5 - 0 (not matching)\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Result: 5 - 0 (not matching)\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Result: 3 - 1 (matching)\n  - Date: 16 october 2012 (not matching \"8 october 2010\")\n  - Score: 1 - 1 (matches the claim for score)\n  - Venue: pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest (matches the venue)\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The result condition is only met in Row 7.\n- However, the date does not match; it should be \"8 october 2010\", but it is actually \"16 october 2012\".\n- Due to this mismatch in the date, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object with relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
