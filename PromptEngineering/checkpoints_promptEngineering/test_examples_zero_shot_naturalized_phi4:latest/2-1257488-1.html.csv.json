    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table in relation to the claim. The claim states: \"the match held on January 26, 2006, the result be 2 - 1.\"\n\nWe must check two pieces of information from the table:\n1. The date of the match.\n2. The result of that match.\n\nThe relevant row for this claim is Row 8 since it mentions a match with the following details:\n- Date: January 26, 2006\n- Result: 2 - 1\n\nLet's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Date Check:** \n  - In Row 8, the \"date\" column specifies \"January 26, 2006,\" which matches the date in the claim.\n\n- **Result Check:**\n  - In Row 8, the \"result\" column shows \"2 - 1,\" which also matches the result given in the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion:\n- The cell containing the date: Row 8, Column \"date\"\n- The cell containing the result: Row 8, Column \"result\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the required information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that in a zero-indexed format (common for programming), Row 8 corresponds to `row_index: 7`.",
