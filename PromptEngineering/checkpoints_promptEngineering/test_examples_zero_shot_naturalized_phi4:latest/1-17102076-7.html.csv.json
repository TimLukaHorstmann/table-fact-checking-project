    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about game 35's score is true or false, we need to focus on the specific row and column in the table that contains information about the scores for each game.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row:**\n   - The claim references \"game 35,\" so we must locate Row 3 in the table as it corresponds to this game number.\n\n2. **Identify the relevant column:**\n   - We are specifically interested in the \"score\" column because it details the outcome of each game, including any overtime results.\n\n3. **Verify the claim against the table data:**\n   - In Row 3, under the \"score\" column, we find the entry is listed as \"l 90 - 98 (ot).\" This matches exactly with what the claim states (\"the score of game 35 be l90 - 98 (ot)\").\n\nSince the information in the table directly supports the claim regarding the score of game 35, the answer to the verification process is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Explanation:**\n  - The row index used in JSON starts from 0. Therefore, Row 3 in natural language corresponds to index 2.\n  - Only one cell is relevant here because we are verifying a specific score for a single game, which requires only the content of the \"score\" column for that particular row.",
