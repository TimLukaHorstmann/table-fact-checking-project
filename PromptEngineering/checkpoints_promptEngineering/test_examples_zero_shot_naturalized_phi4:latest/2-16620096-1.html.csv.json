The fall months are September, October, and November.\n\n- Eug\u00e8ne Schaus's term starts on 6 February 1969, which is in winter.\n- \u00c9mile Krieps's first term starts on 15 June 1974, which is in summer.\n- \u00c9mile Krieps's second term starts on 16 July 1979, which is also in summer.\n- Marc Fischbach's term starts on 20 July 1984, which is again in summer.\n- Jacques Poos's term starts on 14 July 1989, which is in summer.\n- Alex Bodry's first term starts on 13 July 1994, which is in summer.\n- Alex Bodry's second term starts on 26 January 1995, which is in winter.\n\nNone of the start dates fall within the fall months.

Therefore, we consider Row 6 and Row 7 for his term.\n   - Row 6: alex bodry was the minister from 13 July 1994 to 26 January 1995 under Jacques Santer but continued until 7 August 1999 under Jean-Claude Juncker.\n   - Row 7: alex bodry served as a minister from 26 January 1995 to 7 August 1999 under Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n2. **Other Prime Ministers**:\n   - **Pierre Werner**: Rows 1 and 3, ministers are eug\u00e8ne schaus and \u00e9mile krieps respectively.\n   - **Gaston Thorn**: Row 2, minister is \u00e9mile krieps.\n   - **Jacques Santer**: Rows 4, 5, and 6, ministers are marc fischbach, jacques poos, and alex bodry (until 26 January 1995).\n\nCount of Ministers:\n- **Jean-Claude Juncker**: Alex Bodry is the only minister who served entirely under him (Row 7). In Row 6, Alex Bodry's service partially overlaps with Jacques Santer.\n- **Pierre Werner**: Served with eug\u00e8ne schaus and \u00e9mile krieps (2 ministers).\n- **Gaston Thorn**: \u00c9mile Krieps was the minister (1 minister).\n- **Jacques Santer**: Marc Fischbach, Jacques Poos, and Alex Bodry (3 ministers).\n\nConclusion:\nJean-Claude Juncker had 1 full-term minister, whereas Jacques Santer had 3 different ministers during his terms.\n\nThe claim is FALSE.
