Therefore, this covers years 1940 through 1946 inclusively with \"not held.\"\n- No other rows mention the 1947-1949 period directly, but based on the pattern that follows (Row 16 starts at 1939), it's reasonable to conclude that no additional games were mentioned for the remaining part of the decade.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- From the table, only one row (Row 15) explicitly covers years 1940 through 1946 as \"not held.\"\n- The absence of other entries from 1947 to 1949 implies no races were noted in those years either.\n- Therefore, there are **zero** games listed as being held during the entire decade of the 1940s.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"only 3 games were held in the 1940s\" is incorrect.
