    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table provided, we need to assess two specific aspects mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **Time Difference**: The claim states there is a \"0.179 second\" difference between Vadim Menkov and Mathieu Goubel. We should calculate the actual time difference between these athletes using their times from the table.\n\n2. **Athlete Identification**: Confirm that the athletes mentioned (Vadim Menkov from Uzbekistan and Mathieu Goubel from France) are in the specified ranks (1st and 2nd respectively).\n\nLet's evaluate these points with data from the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Athletes: Vadim Menkov\n  - Country: Uzbekistan\n  - Time: 3:56.793\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Athletes: Mathieu Goubel\n  - Country: France\n  - Time: 3:56.972\n\n### Calculating the Time Difference:\n\nConvert both times to seconds for easier calculation:\n- Vadim Menkov's time = 3 minutes and 56.793 seconds = \\( (3 \\times 60) + 56.793 = 236.793 \\) seconds\n- Mathieu Goubel's time = 3 minutes and 56.972 seconds = \\( (3 \\times 60) + 56.972 = 236.972 \\) seconds\n\nNow, calculate the difference:\n- Difference = Mathieu Goubel's time - Vadim Menkov's time\n- Difference = 236.972 - 236.793 = 0.179 seconds\n\n### Verification Against Claim:\n\n1. The calculated difference of 0.179 seconds matches the claim.\n2. Vadim Menkov is indeed ranked 1st and Mathieu Goubel is ranked 2nd, as specified in the table.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied; therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe need to refer to the relevant cells from the table that contain information about ranks, athletes, countries, and times to verify this claim. The pertinent details were found in:\n\n- **Row 1**: Athlete (Vadim Menkov), Country (Uzbekistan), Time (3:56.793)\n- **Row 2**: Athlete (Mathieu Goubel), Country (France), Time (3:56.972)\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, \"athletes\"\n- Row 1, \"country\"\n- Row 1, \"time\"\n- Row 2, \"athletes\"\n- Row 2, \"country\"\n- Row 2, \"time\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"athletes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"athletes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
