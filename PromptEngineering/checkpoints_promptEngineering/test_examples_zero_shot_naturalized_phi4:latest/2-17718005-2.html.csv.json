    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the Warrington Town team's position and their goals against statistic, we need to examine two specific conditions in the table:\n\n1. **Position Check**: The claim states that the Warrington Town team is in the 4th position.\n2. **Goals Against Check**: It further claims they have 45 goals against.\n\nLet's verify these points using the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Position Check\n- Look at Row 4, which contains information about Warrington Town:\n  - The `position` column value is 4.\n\nThis confirms that the team is indeed in the 4th position, as claimed.\n\n### Goals Against Check\n- In Row 4, check the `goals against` column:\n  - The value listed is 45.\n\nThis matches the claim regarding goals against.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are verified to be true using the relevant data from Row 4. Therefore, the entire claim is supported by the table.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the examination of the specified cells in the table. Here's the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- The row index is adjusted to zero-based indexing as typically done in programming.\n- `Row 4` corresponds to `row_index: 3`.\n- The relevant columns are `position` and `goals against`.",
