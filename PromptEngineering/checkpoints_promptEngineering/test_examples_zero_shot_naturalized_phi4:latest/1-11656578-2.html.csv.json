Confirm if this voivodeship's area is indeed 6,266 km\u00b2.\n\nLet's go through the table row by row and identify the relevant information:\n\n- **Row 45 (Warsaw Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 32\n- **Row 47 (Wroc\u0142aw Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 33\n- **Row 48 (Zamo\u015b\u0107 Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 47\n\nContinuing through the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Number of communes = 30\n- **Row 1**: Number of communes = 32\n- **Row 2**: Number of communes = 33\n- **Row 3 (Skierniewice Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 36\n- **Row 4 (Slupsk Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 31\n- **Row 5 (Suwa\u0142ki Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 42\n- **Row 6**: Number of communes = 50\n- **Row 7**: Number of communes = 46\n- **Row 8 (Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 46\n- **Row 9 (Tarn\u00f3w Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 41\n\nContinuing further:\n\n- **Row 10**: Number of communes = 41\n- **Row 11 (Toru\u0144 Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 41\n- **Row 12 (Wa\u0142brzych Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 30\n- **Row 13**: Number of communes = 32\n\nContinuing further:\n\n- **Row 14**: Number of communes = 30\n- **Row 15 (Warsaw Voivodeship)**: Repeated, number of communes = 32\n- **Row 16**: Number of communes = 33\n\nFinally, we find:\n\n- **Row 21 (Skierniewice Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 36\n- **Row 22 (S\u0142upsk Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 31\n- **Row 23 (Suwa\u0142ki Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 42\n- **Row 24**: Number of communes = 50\n- **Row 25**: Number of communes = 46\n\nContinuing through:\n\n- **Row 26 (Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 46\n- **Row 27 (Tarn\u00f3w Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 41\n- **Row 28**: Number of communes = 41\n\nAnd finally, we find:\n\n- **Row 30 (Skierniewice Voivodeship)**: Number of communes = 36\n- **Row 31**: This is the voivodeship with 51 communes.\n\nChecking **Row 31**:\n- Area in square kilometers (1998): 6,266 km\u00b2\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions from our claim.
