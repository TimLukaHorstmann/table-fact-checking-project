The tackle total of 132 for the New Orleans Saints is in the year 2008, not 2007.\n2. The lowest sack total for the New Orleans Saints from the given years (2008-2010) is indeed 1.0 in the year 2008.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim incorrectly associates the tackle total of 132 with the year 2007 instead of 2008.
