    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the series with the most episode air after 'as sure as fate'\", we need to identify which rows in the table correspond to shows airing after \"as sure as fate\" and then determine which of these has the highest number of episodes.\n\nLet's analyze each row for relevance:\n\n1. **Row 4** corresponds to \"as sure as fate\". This marks the reference point, so we consider all subsequent rows.\n   \n2. **Subsequent Rows**:\n   - Row 5: Airing date is 1 Jun - 31 Jul with 45 episodes.\n   - Row 6: Airing date is 3 Aug - 4 Sep with 25 episodes.\n   - Row 7: Airing date is 7 Sep - 25 Sep with 15 episodes.\n   - Row 8: Airing date is 28 Sep - 23 Oct with 20 episodes.\n   - Row 9: Airing date is 26 Oct - 18 Dec with 42 episodes.\n   - Row 10: Airing date is 21 Dec 1998 - 15 Jan 1999 with 20 episodes.\n\nWe now compare the number of episodes for these rows to determine which series has the most episodes:\n\n- **Row 5**: 45 episodes\n- **Row 6**: 25 episodes\n- **Row 7**: 15 episodes\n- **Row 8**: 20 episodes\n- **Row 9**: 42 episodes\n- **Row 10**: 20 episodes\n\nThe series with the most episodes after \"as sure as fate\" is from Row 5, which has 45 episodes.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nRelevant cells include:\n- The number of episodes for each row after \"as sure as fate\".\n- The airing date to confirm they air after \"as sure as fate\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"airing date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
