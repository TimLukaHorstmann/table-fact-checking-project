Away Team is Sydney. This matches the claim.\n   - Row 7: Home Team is Port Adelaide, not Carlton.\n\n3. **Verify the details in Row 6**:\n   - The home team is indeed Carlton.\n   - The away team is indeed Sydney.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are met in Row 6, the claim is true.\n\n4. **Identify relevant cells**: \n   - For the row where Carlton is the home team and Sydney is the away team (Row 6), we need to check:\n     - \"home team\" column to confirm it's Carlton.\n     - \"away team\" column to confirm it's Sydney.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are in Row 6 for both the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The home team is Carlton.\n2. The away team is Sydney.\n3. The date is Saturday, 19 July.\n\nNow, we will check Row 6 in the table:\n\n- **Home Team**: \"carlton\" (matches condition 1)\n- **Away Team**: \"sydney\" (matches condition 2)\n- **Date**: \"sunday , 20 july\" (does not match condition 3)\n\nThe date in Row 6 is Sunday, 20 July, which does not satisfy the claim's requirement of Saturday, 19 July.
