The key components in the claim are:\n\n1. **Opponent:** Cleber Luciano\n2. **Time Duration:** 7:57\n\nWe will look for these two pieces of information within the table:\n\n- First, identify the row where the opponent is \"cleber luciano.\"\n- Then verify if the time duration for this match is indeed \"7:57.\"\n\nLet's go through the relevant cells in the provided table:\n\n1. **Row 12** includes:\n   - Opponent: cleber luciano\n   - Time: 7:57\n\nGiven that Row 12 matches both conditions of the claim (opponent as Cleber Luciano and time duration as 7:57), we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThus, our answer should be structured in JSON format with:\n\n- The \"answer\" key indicating whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n- The \"relevant_cells\" key listing the row index and column names that support this conclusion.\n\nHere's the resulting JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about UFC 20's ending method, we need to identify the relevant row from the table and examine its details. Here is a step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim mentions \"UFC 20,\" so we should look for the event named \"ufc 20\" in the given table.\n   - By examining each row, we find that Row 11 matches the criteria as it states:\n     ```\n     Row 11: res: loss, record: 3 - 1, opponent: laverne clark, method: tko (cut), event: ufc 20, round: 1, time: 1:31.\n     ```\n\n2. **Examine the Method of Ending:**\n   - The claim asserts that \"the UFC 20 event end with a method of decision (unanimous).\"\n   - In Row 11, the \"method\" column states \"tko (cut),\" which stands for technical knockout due to cuts.\n   \n3. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - Since the method in Row 11 is \"tko (cut)\" and not \"decision (unanimous),\" the claim does not align with the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim about UFC 20 ending by a unanimous decision is false according to the table's information.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For this evaluation, the relevant cell in Row 11 from the \"method\" column was needed.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index starts at 0, so Row 11 in natural language corresponds to `row_index: 10` in zero-indexed format.",
