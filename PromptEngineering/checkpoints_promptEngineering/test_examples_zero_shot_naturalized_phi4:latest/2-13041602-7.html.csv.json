The claim states: \"in the 2005 milwaukee brewer season play the yankee only 2 time.\"\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Check Opponent Column**: We'll examine each row in the table for entries in the \"opponent\" column.\n2. **Count Occurrences of \"Yankees\"**: Determine how many times the Yankees appear as an opponent.\n\n### Examination of Table Rows:\n\nLet's go through each row and look at the \"opponent\" data:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is \"padres\"\n- Row 2: Opponent is \"padres\"\n- Row 3: Opponent is \"padres\"\n- Row 4: Opponent is \"padres\"\n- Row 5: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 6: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 7: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 8: Opponent is \"astros\"\n- Row 9: Opponent is \"astros\"\n- Row 10: Opponent is \"astros\"\n- Row 11: Opponent is \"diamondbacks\"\n- Row 12: Opponent is \"diamondbacks\"\n- Row 13: Opponent is \"diamondbacks\"\n- Row 14: Opponent is \"astros\"\n- Row 15: Opponent is \"astros\"\n- Row 16: Opponent is \"astros\"\n- Row 17: Opponent is \"cubs\"\n- Row 18: Opponent is \"cubs\"\n- Row 19: Opponent is \"cubs\"\n- Row 20: Opponent is \"cardinals\"\n- Row 21: Opponent is \"cardinals\"\n- Row 22: Opponent is \"cardinals\"\n- Row 23: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 24: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 25: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 26: Opponent is \"reds\"\n- Row 27: Opponent is \"pirates\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe opponent column does not list the Yankees as an opponent in any row. Therefore, the Brewers did not play against the Yankees at all during this period.\n\n### Claim Verification:\n\nSince there are zero occurrences of the Yankees, they were not played even once, let alone twice. Hence, the claim that the Brewers played the Yankees only two times is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
