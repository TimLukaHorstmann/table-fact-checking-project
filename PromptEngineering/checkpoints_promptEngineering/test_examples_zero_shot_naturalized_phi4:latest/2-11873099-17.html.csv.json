This might imply a match in a foreign country if the home team is international.\n\n3. **Competition or Tour & Opponent Columns**:\n   - We specifically look for matches labeled under `competition or tour` as \"american tour\" and check the `opponent` to confirm they are teams based in the USA.\n   \n4. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Competition is \"pre-season\", ground is \"a\". This does not provide evidence of being in the USA, so it's irrelevant for our claim.\n   - **Row 2**: Part of \"american tour\" against Guadalajara (Chivas de Guadalajara), ground \"n\". While this team is Mexican, we keep an eye out for matches within the USA.\n   - **Row 3**: Also part of \"american tour\" against America (Club Am\u00e9rica), ground \"n\". Similarly, a Mexican club, not in the USA.\n   - **Row 4**: Part of \"american tour\", played against New York Red Bulls on ground \"a\". The opponent is a US-based team and matches the criteria of being held in the USA.\n   - **Row 5 & Row 6**: These are labeled as \"friendly\" with opponents from Egypt (Al-Ahly) and South Africa (Mamelodi Sundowns), respectively. Grounds marked \"a\" do not indicate a match in the USA.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only Row 4 satisfies all conditions: it is part of an American tour, against a US-based team, and was played on ground \"a\", indicating an away game likely in the opponent's home country (USA).\n\nBased on this analysis, only one match from the table took place in the USA.\n\nThus, the claim that \"3 matches took place in the USA\" is FALSE.
