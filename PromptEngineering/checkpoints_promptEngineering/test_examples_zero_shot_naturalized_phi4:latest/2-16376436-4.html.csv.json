    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table data, let's break down each condition in the claim and compare it with the relevant rows from the table:\n\n1. **Game Number**: The claim refers to \"game 17\". However, there is no \"week: 17\" in the table; the last entry is for \"week: 16\".\n\n2. **Teams Involved**: \n   - Claim mentions the teams as \"los angeles raider\" and \"san diego charger\".\n   - From the table:\n     - The Los Angeles Raiders are playing against the San Diego Chargers in week 7 (Row 7) and again in week 17 (Row 16).\n   \n3. **Score**: \n   - Claim states a score of \"w 17 - 12\".\n   - From the table:\n     - In Row 7, Los Angeles Raiders vs. San Diego Chargers: Score is \"w 24 - 9\".\n     - In Row 16, Los Angeles Raiders vs. San Diego Chargers: Score is \"w 17 - 12\".\n\n4. **Attendance**: \n   - Claim mentions an attendance of \"62593\".\n   - From the table:\n     - In Row 7, attendance is \"60569\".\n     - In Row 16, attendance is \"62593\".\n\nThe claim is describing a game with specific details that match only one entry in the provided data: week 17 (Row 16) against the San Diego Chargers, with a score of \"w 17 - 12\" and an attendance of \"62593\". However, there are two issues:\n- There is no \"game 17\" listed explicitly; instead, it's labeled as \"week 17\", but considering the context that weeks correspond to games, this can be accepted.\n- The claim incorrectly refers to \"los angeles raider\" in singular form (\"raider\") instead of plural form (\"raiders\"), but this is a minor grammatical discrepancy and doesn't affect factual correctness.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Game 17 exists as week 16 in the table.\n- All other conditions (teams, score, attendance) match correctly for Row 16.\n\nTherefore, despite the slight phrasing difference regarding \"Raider\", everything else checks out with the data. Thus, based on relevant content matching:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states there were \"5 game play in September.\"\n2. It provides specific scores for these games: \"w 23 - 20\", \"w 38 - 31\", \"w 24 - 7\", \"w 28 - 24\", and \"w 17 - 12\".\n\nLet's analyze each of these conditions:\n\n- **Games in September**: The table shows three games played in September (weeks 1, 2, and 3) with the following scores:\n  - Week 1: w 14 - 9\n  - Week 2: w 17 - 13\n  - Week 3: w 20 - 3\n\n  There are only three games played in September, not five.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Weeks 8 and 10, we need to carefully examine each row corresponding to these weeks in the table for information about games or opponents.\n\n1. **Review Week 8**:\n   - Check if there is a row labeled as \"week: 8\".\n   - Verify whether this row includes a date, opponent, result, and attendance details.\n   \n2. **Review Week 10**:\n   - Similarly, check if there is a row labeled as \"week: 10\" (which we can see exists).\n   - Ensure that the information provided for week 10 includes all necessary game details.\n\n### Analysis of Table Rows:\n\n- **Weeks in Table**:\n  - The table entries are structured such that each row represents a distinct game.\n  - Weeks from 1 to 17 are detailed, with explicit results and attendance numbers where applicable.\n  \n- **Examine Week 8**:\n  - A search through the given rows reveals no entry corresponding to \"week: 8\".\n  - No opponent, date, result, or attendance information exists for this week.\n\n- **Verify Week 10**:\n  - The table explicitly lists a row for \"week: 10\", with detailed game information against the Green Bay Packers.\n  - Therefore, week 10 does have a recorded game and an opponent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Based on the data, Week 8 lacks any record of a game or opponent in the provided table, aligning with the claim for that part.\n- However, Week 10 does have a recorded game against the Green Bay Packers, contradicting the claim for this week.\n\nThus, since Week 10 has an entry and contradicts the claim, the overall statement is **FALSE**.
