The location of each game (game site).\n2. Counting how many games were held at Texas Stadium compared to other locations.\n\nLet's analyze the provided rows:\n\n- Row 1: Game site is Texas Stadium.\n- Row 2: Game site is Busch Memorial Stadium.\n- Row 3: Game site is Texas Stadium.\n- Row 4: Game site is Texas Stadium.\n- Row 5: Game site is Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.\n- Row 6: Game site is Astrodome.\n- Row 7: Game site is Texas Stadium.\n- Row 8: Game site is Texas Stadium.\n- Row 9: Game site is Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.\n\nNow, count the occurrences of games played at Texas Stadium:\n- Texas Stadium appears in rows 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (5 times).\n\nCount total number of games listed (total rows):\n- There are a total of 9 games.\n\nDetermine if the majority were at Texas Stadium:\n- \"Majority\" means more than half. Since there are 9 games, more than half would require at least 5 games to be held at Texas Stadium.\n- With exactly 5 out of 9 games played at Texas Stadium, this constitutes a majority (since 5 is greater than half of 9).\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\nNow, list the relevant cells for verification:\n- For rows where the game site is Texas Stadium: Rows 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.\n- The relevant column to check in these rows is \"game site.\"\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Margin = 24 - 7 = 17 points.\n- **Week 3**: Result is W 14 - 9. Margin = 14 - 9 = 5 points.\n- **Week 4**: Result is W 31 - 14. Margin = 31 - 14 = 17 points.\n- **Week 5**: Result is W 24 - 10.

Let's verify each of these weeks:\n\n1. **Week 2:** Result is \"w 24 - 7\" (Win).

Therefore, even if we were considering this row, the claim would still fail here since a win is not a loss.\n6. **Week 7:** Not relevant due to previous non-losses.\n\nSince week 2 did not have a loss ('L'), it is impossible for there to be six consecutive losses from weeks 2 through 7.\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm this analysis are the \"result\" columns for rows (weeks) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7:\n\n- Row 2: Result - \"w 24 - 7\"\n- Row 3: Result - \"w 14 - 9\"\n- Row 4: Result - \"w 31 - 14\"\n- Row 5: Result - \"w 24 - 10\"\n- Row 6: Result - \"w 37 - 7\"\n- Row 7: Result - \"w 21 - 7\"\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
