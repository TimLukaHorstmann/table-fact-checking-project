Finally, verify that no other actresses have won this award and ensure it occurred in 1988.\n\nLet's evaluate the table:\n\n- **Whoopi Goldberg**:\n  - Row 14: Year 1986, Actor: Whoopi Goldberg, Award: Best Actress - Drama, Result: Won (irrelevant as it is drama).\n  - Row 13: Year 1993, Award category is \"best actress - musical or comedy,\" and the result is nominated, not won.\n\n- **Other Entries**:\n  - Row 5: Year 1969, Actor: Abbey Lincoln, Result: Nominated.\n  - Row 10: Year 1975, Actor: Diahann Carroll, Result: Nominated.\n  - Row 11: Year 1981, Actor: Irene Cara, Result: Nominated.\n  - Row 12: Year 1984, Actor: Jennifer Beals, Result: Nominated.\n  - Row 18: Year 1994, Actor: Angela Bassett, Result: Won (relevant as it won but not by Whoopi Goldberg).\n  - Row 28: Year 2010, Actor: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Result: Nominated.\n\nFrom the table, there is an entry where \"best actress - musical or comedy\" was won in 1994 by Angela Bassett. Therefore, the claim that only Whoopi Goldberg has won this award is false. Additionally, no entry indicates a win for Whoopi Goldberg in 1988; her win was in 1986 for Best Actress - Drama.\n\nThus, based on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
