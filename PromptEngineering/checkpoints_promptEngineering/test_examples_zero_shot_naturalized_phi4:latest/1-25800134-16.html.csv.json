We will check each row of the table to see if Jim Byrnes is mentioned in the \"writer(s)\" column for all episodes.\n\nLet's review the entries:\n\n- Row 1: writer(s) = anthony lawrence\n- Row 2: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 3: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 4: writer(s) = jack miller\n- Row 5: writer(s) = calvin clements, jr\n- Row 6: writer(s) = ron bishop\n- Row 7: writer(s) = ron bishop\n- Row 8: writer(s) = william blinn\n- Row 9: writer(s) = arthur dales\n- Row 10: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 11: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 12: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 13: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 14: writer(s) = william kelley\n- Row 15: writer(s) = richard fielder\n- Row 16: writer(s) = colley cibber\n- Row 17: writer(s) = william kelley\n- Row 18: writer(s) = jack miller\n- Row 19: writer(s) = calvin clements, sr\n- Row 20: writer(s) = jim byrnes\n- Row 21: writer(s) = ron honthaner\n- Row 22: writer(s) = calvin clements\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that Jim Byrnes is not listed as the writer for all episodes. He is only credited as a writer in rows 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. The relevant cells are those with \"writer(s)\" containing entries that do not list Jim Byrnes as the sole or contributing writer for each episode where he is not credited:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
