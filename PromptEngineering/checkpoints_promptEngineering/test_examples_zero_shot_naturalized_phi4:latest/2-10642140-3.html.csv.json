    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two main parts of it:\n\n1. **\"More than 4 countries tie for 10th place\":** \n   - We need to check how many nations are listed with a rank of 10.\n   \n2. **\"Each win a bronze medal\":**\n   - For each nation tied at the 10th position, we should verify that they have won exactly one bronze medal.\n\nLet's evaluate this against the table:\n\n- The relevant rows for checking the rank and number of bronze medals are:\n  - Row 10: \"rank: 10 =\", nation: \"burkina faso\", bronze: 1\n  - Row 11: \"rank: 10 =\", nation: \"ivory coast\", bronze: 1\n  - Row 12: \"rank: 10 =\", nation: \"gabon\", bronze: 1\n  - Row 13: \"rank: 10 =\", nation: \"madagascar\", bronze: 1\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Number of countries tied for 10th place:** There are four nations (Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Madagascar) listed as having rank 10.\n  \n- **Bronze medals won by each country at this rank:** Each of these four nations has exactly one bronze medal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied.
