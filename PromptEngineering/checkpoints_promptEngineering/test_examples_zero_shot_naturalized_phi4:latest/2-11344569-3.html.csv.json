    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze it against the provided table data.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Claim:** \"in 2009 cyprus win the most gold medal with 59\"\n\n#### Conditions in the Claim:\n1. The year is specified as 2009.\n2. Cyprus is claimed to have won the most gold medals.\n3. The number of gold medals won by Cyprus is stated as 59.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Year Verification:**\n   - The table does not specify any years; it only contains medal counts for various nations without a temporal reference. Therefore, we cannot verify or refute the year part (2009) using this data alone.\n\n2. **Most Gold Medals Verification:**\n   - We need to check if Cyprus indeed has the highest gold medal count in the table.\n   - From Row 1, Cyprus has 59 gold medals.\n   - Checking other rows:\n     - Row 2: Iceland has 32 gold medals.\n     - Row 3: Luxembourg has 26 gold medals.\n     - Row 4: Monaco has 7 gold medals.\n     - Row 5: San Marino has 4 gold medals.\n     - Row 6: Malta has 3 gold medals.\n     - Row 7: Liechtenstein has 2 gold medals.\n     - Row 8: Andorra has 1 gold medal.\n   - Cyprus, with 59 gold medals, indeed has the highest count among all listed nations.\n\n3. **Gold Medal Count Verification for Cyprus:**\n   - The table shows that Cyprus won 59 gold medals (Row 1).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The table supports the claim that Cyprus won the most gold medals with a total of 59.\n- However, the year \"2009\" is not verifiable from the data provided.\n\nSince we cannot confirm the temporal aspect of the claim due to lack of information in the table, we conclude that the entire claim cannot be fully supported as TRUE. Therefore, the answer must be FALSE because of the unverifiable year condition.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For verifying Cyprus's gold medal count: Row 1, \"gold\".\n- For checking if Cyprus has the most gold medals: All rows under the \"gold\" column are relevant for comparison.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
