The table does not explicitly state the brewery for each beer, so we assume that any mention of a specific beer across multiple entries implies its association.\n\n2. **Count Unique Beers Winning Awards:**\n   - Once identified, count how many unique beers from West Berkshire Brewery have won at least one award during the specified period (1995-2009).\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's go through the table and identify the beers that are likely associated with West Berkshire Brewery based on repeated mentions:\n\n- **Good Old Boy**:\n  - Appears in Rows: 1, 3, 4, 15, 28\n- **Dr Hexter's Healer**:\n  - Appears in Rows: 2, 7, 16, 23, 26, 27\n- **Maggs Magnificent Mild**:\n  - Appears in Rows: 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 25\n\nThese beers appear multiple times and are likely associated with West Berkshire Brewery.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and its awards between 1995 and 2009, we need to examine each instance where this beer has won a prize within the given timeframe. The claim asserts that every time \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" won a prize in that period, it was a gold medal.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant row from the table:\n\n1. **Row 5 (Year: 2002):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Gold Medal  \n   - This instance supports the claim as the prize is a gold medal.\n\n2. **Row 8 (Year: 2003):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Gold Medal  \n   - This instance also supports the claim, with another gold medal.\n\n3. **Row 10 (Year: 2004):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Overall Winner  \n   - Although \"Overall Winner\" is not a standard award category like \"Gold Medal,\" the context implies it is equivalent to winning, and no other specific prize type is mentioned. However, since it does not explicitly state \"Gold Medal,\" this may need careful consideration.\n\n4. **Row 11 (Year: 2005):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Gold Medal  \n   - This instance supports the claim with a gold medal award.\n\n5. **Row 13 (Year: 2005):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Gold Medal  \n   - Another supporting instance for the claim, as it is a gold medal.\n\n6. **Row 17 (Year: 2006):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Silver Medal  \n   - This instance contradicts the claim because the prize is not a gold medal but a silver one.\n\n7. **Row 18 (Year: 2006):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Silver Medal  \n   - Again, this contradicts the claim as it's another silver medal.\n\n8. **Row 25 (Year: 2008):**  \n   - Beer Name: Maggs Magnificent Mild  \n   - Prize: Silver Medal  \n   - This instance also contradicts the claim with a silver medal award.\n\nBased on the evaluation, there are several instances where \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" won prizes other than gold medals (silver medals in 2006 and 2008).
