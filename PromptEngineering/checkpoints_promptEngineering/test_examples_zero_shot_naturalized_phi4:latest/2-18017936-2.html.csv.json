    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the goal differences for each club in the table and check if only \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" and \"fc ditton - 2 daugavpils\" have a goal difference above 50.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We will focus on the \"goal difference\" column for each row to evaluate the claim.\n\n2. **Extract Goal Differences**:\n   - Row 1 (jfk olimps r\uce74ga): +96\n   - Row 2 (fc ditton - 2 daugavpils): +64\n   - Row 3 (skonto - 2 riga): +55\n   - Row 4 (vents pils - 2): +83\n   - Row 5 (r\uce74ga - 2): +30\n   - Row 6 (dinaburg - zemessardze daugavpils): +9\n   - Row 7 (fk valmiera): -3\n   - Row 8 (liepajas metalurgs - 2): +21\n   - Row 9 (fk jelgava): +4\n   - Row 10 (eirobaltija riga): +10\n   - Row 11 (j\ud070rmala - 2): +12\n   - Row 12 (tranz\uce74ts ventspils): -51\n   - Row 13 (multibanka riga): -24\n   - Row 14 (fk auda kekava): -51\n   - Row 15 (alberts riga): -82\n   - Row 16 (abuls smiltene): -173\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" has a goal difference of +96.\n   - \"fc ditton - 2 daugavpils\" has a goal difference of +64.\n   - \"skonto - 2 riga\" has a goal difference of +55, which is also above 50.\n   - \"vents pils - 2\" has a goal difference of +83, which is also above 50.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that only \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" and \"fc ditton - 2 daugavpils\" have a goal difference above 50. However, we found that \"skonto - 2 riga\" and \"vents pils - 2\" also have goal differences above 50.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
