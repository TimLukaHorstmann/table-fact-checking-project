    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tevita vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify two conditions from the row associated with Tevita Vaikona:\n\n1. The number of tries should be 25.\n2. The total points should be 100.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the naturalized table format:\n\n- Row 2: \n  - player: tevita vaikona\n  - position: wing\n  - tries: 25\n  - goals: 0\n  - points: 100\n\nFor Tevita Vaikona, according to this row:\n- The \"tries\" column indicates he scored 25 tries.\n- The \"points\" column shows a total of 100 points.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied by the information in Row 2. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data and is true.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- We identified Row 2 as the relevant row for Tevita Vaikona.\n- We checked the \"tries\" and \"points\" columns in this row to verify the claim.",
