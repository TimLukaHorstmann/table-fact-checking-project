A reference to a specific area measurement for \"saint - jacques\".\n2. An ambiguous term \"average area\" compared with \"census ranking\".\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We first locate the row corresponding to \"saint - jacques\". According to the table, this is Row 2.\n   - For Row 2: \n     - **Official name**: saint-jacques\n     - **Area (km\u00b2)**: 298.82\n     - **Census ranking**: 1531 of 5008\n\n2. **Assess Each Part of the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests a connection between \"average area\" and the census ranking for \"saint-jacques\".\n   - However, there is no calculation or explanation in the claim about how an average area would relate to a ranking number like 1531.\n   - In the table, the **census ranking** of 1531 of 5008 does not directly imply any average area. It seems to be referencing population rank.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Analysis**:\n   - The claim appears to conflate two unrelated metrics: \"area\" and \"census ranking\". \n   - There is no column or data point in the table that provides an \"average area of 1531\".\n   - Therefore, this specific statement about having an \"average area\" equaling a census rank number cannot be validated as true from the provided information.\n\n4. **Determine Relevance**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify the claim are those containing data for \"saint-jacques\", specifically concerning its area and census ranking.\n   \n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because it incorrectly associates an average area with a census ranking, which is not supported by any data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"official name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"census ranking\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
