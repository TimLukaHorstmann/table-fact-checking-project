    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate each part against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \n\"The closest game of the 1927 VFL season occurred at Glenferrie Oval between Hawthorn, who scored 9.6, and Richmond, who scored 9.2, in front of a crowd of 17,000.\"\n\nLet's break down the claim into specific conditions to check against the table:\n\n1. **Closest Game**: \n   - A \"closest game\" implies the smallest score difference between the home team and away team.\n   - We need to calculate the score differences for all games.\n\n2. **Location of Game**:\n   - The venue should be Glenferrie Oval.\n\n3. **Teams Involved**:\n   - Home Team: Hawthorn\n   - Away Team: Richmond\n\n4. **Scores**:\n   - Hawthorn scored 9.6.\n   - Richmond scored 9.2.\n\n5. **Crowd Size**:\n   - The crowd size should be 17,000.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Home Team: Hawthorn\n  - Away Team: Richmond\n  - Venue: Glenferrie Oval\n  - Scores: Hawthorn 9.6 (60), Richmond 9.2 (74)\n  - Score Difference: |60 - 74| = 14\n  - Crowd: 10,000\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: Essendon\n  - Away Team: South Melbourne\n  - Scores: Essendon 12.12 (84), South Melbourne 15.9 (99)\n  - Score Difference: |84 - 99| = 15\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: St Kilda\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne\n  - Scores: St Kilda 15.7 (97), North Melbourne 13.10 (88)\n  - Score Difference: |97 - 88| = 9\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team: Melbourne\n  - Away Team: Footscray\n  - Scores: Melbourne 10.13 (73), Footscray 7.9 (51)\n  - Score Difference: |73 - 51| = 22\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: Geelong\n  - Away Team: Fitzroy\n  - Scores: Geelong 12.15 (87), Fitzroy 12.8 (80)\n  - Score Difference: |87 - 80| = 7\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Home Team: Collingwood\n  - Away Team: Carlton\n  - Scores: Collingwood 13.5 (83), Carlton 14.11 (95)\n  - Score Difference: |83 - 95| = 12\n\nFrom the above calculations, the smallest score difference is in Row 5 with a difference of 7.\n\nNow, let's verify the claim against Row 1:\n\n- The venue is correct: Glenferrie Oval.\n- Teams involved are correct: Hawthorn and Richmond.\n- Scores match: Hawthorn 9.6 (60), Richmond 9.2 (74).\n- However, the crowd size is incorrect: It was 10,000, not 17,000.\n\nThe claim about the closest game is false because Row 5 has a smaller score difference. Additionally, the crowd size mentioned in the claim does not match the actual crowd size for the game at Glenferrie Oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
