In row 6, it states that the home team score for South Melbourne is indeed 12.10 (82).\n\n3. **Check Consistency with Date and Venue**:\n   - The claim specifies no date or venue, but consistency check can still be done by confirming the same date across all matches.\n   - All rows have the date \"13 july 1968,\" including row 6.\n\nThus, the conditions specified in the claim align perfectly with the data in row 6 of the table.
