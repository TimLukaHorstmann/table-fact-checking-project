They actually tie for fourth place with a score of 276 each but are indeed 4 under par.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For checking the \"place\":\n  - Row 4, Column \"place\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"place\"\n\n- For checking the \"score\":\n  - Row 4, Column \"score\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"score\"\n\n- For verifying \"to par\":\n  - Row 4, Column \"to par\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"to par\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"only 8 stroke separate the first place golfer from the twelfth place golfer,\" we need to focus on the scores of the golfers who finished in these positions.\n\n1. Identify the score of the first-place golfer:\n   - The table indicates that Vijay Singh is the first-place golfer with a total score of 271 (as calculated from 70 + 66 + 67 + 68).\n\n2. Identify the score of the twelfth-place golfer:\n   - According to the table, Tiger Woods is one of the twelfth place golfers with a total score of 279 (calculated from 66 + 72 + 70 + 71).\n\n3. Calculate the difference in scores between the first and twelfth place golfers:\n   - The score difference = Score of twelfth place golfer - Score of first place golfer\n   - This is 279 (Tiger Woods) - 271 (Vijay Singh) = 8 strokes.\n\nThe calculated score difference of 8 strokes supports the claim.
