The opponent is \"new york\".\n2. The score is \"112 - 106\".\n\n### Table Examination:\n\nLet's go through each row to see if any match both conditions from the claim.\n\n- **Row 18**: \n  - Opponent: new york\n  - Score: 111 - 106\n\nThe opponent matches, but the score does not (it should be 112 - 106).\n\nThere are no other rows with \"new york\" as the opponent or a score of \"112 - 106\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there is no row in the table where both conditions (\"new york\" as the opponent and the score being \"112 - 106\") are met, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include those related to the opponent and the score for each game. Specifically:\n\n- Row 18 contains information about a game with New York as an opponent and the score of that game.\n  \nThus, the relevant cell is in row 18 for both \"opponent\" and \"score\".\n\n### JSON Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis JSON object provides the answer to the claim and indicates which cells were checked to verify it.",
