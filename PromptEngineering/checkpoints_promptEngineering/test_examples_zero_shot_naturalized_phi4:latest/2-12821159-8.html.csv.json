    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two aspects of the claim against the table:\n\n1. The runner-up should be Rick Huiskamp.\n2. The margin of victory should be 10 strokes.\n\nNow let's examine the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Runner-up: Rick Huiskamp\n  - Margin of Victory: 10 strokes\n\nThe row matches both conditions specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row 3, column \"runner - up\": Matches \"rick huiskamp\".\n- Row 3, column \"margin of victory\": Matches \"10 strokes\".\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true. Here's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the conditions in the claim and verify them against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Rick Huiskamp as a runner-up**:\n   - The claim states that Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up in one of the tournaments.\n   - From Row 3: \"runner - up: rick huiskamp,\" we see that Rick Huiskamp is indeed listed as a runner-up.\n\n2. **Single-digit margin of victory**:\n   - The claim also specifies that the tournament where Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up should have had a single-digit margin of victory.\n   - From Row 3: \"margin of victory: 10 strokes,\" we see that the margin of victory is 10 strokes, which is not a single-digit number.\n\nSince the second condition (single-digit margin of victory) is not met, the claim as a whole is false. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 3, \"runner - up\" for Rick Huiskamp being listed as runner-up.\n- Row 3, \"margin of victory\" for checking the number of strokes.\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
