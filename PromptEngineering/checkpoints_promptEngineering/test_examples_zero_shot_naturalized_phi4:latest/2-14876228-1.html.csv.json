From the provided information:\n- Row 10 contains data about the team \"olimpia\".\n\nNext, let's verify the position:\n- In Row 10, under the \"position\" column, it states that \"olimpia\" is indeed in position 10.\n\nThen, we check the number of wins for \"olimpia\":\n- In Row 10, under the \"wins\" column, it indicates that \"olimpia\" has 2 wins.\n\nBoth conditions required by the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim \"olimpia, in position 10, have 2 win\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- The cell from Row 10 under the \"position\" column.\n- The cell from Row 10 under the \"wins\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and the list of relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that row indices are zero-based in this context.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the condition stated in the claim and check it against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero.\" This implies that for teams positioned higher than 10 (i.e., positions 1 through 9), their total number of scored goals should sum up to zero.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Teams**: \n   - We need to consider only the teams with a position from 1 to 9 since these are the teams positioned higher than 10.\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - For each of these teams, extract the number of goals they scored.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Scored Goals**:\n   - Sum up the \"scored\" values for all teams from positions 1 to 9.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Check if this total is zero.\n\nNow, let's go through the table and perform these steps:\n\n- Row 1 (position: 1): scored = 30\n- Row 2 (position: 2): scored = 21\n- Row 3 (position: 3): scored = 25\n- Row 4 (position: 4): scored = 24\n- Row 5 (position: 5): scored = 22\n- Row 6 (position: 6): scored = 24\n- Row 7 (position: 7): scored = 21\n- Row 8 (position: 8): scored = 20\n- Row 9 (position: 9): scored = 16\n\nNow, calculate the total:\n\n\\[ \n30 + 21 + 25 + 24 + 22 + 24 + 21 + 20 + 16 = 203 \n\\]\n\nThe total number of goals scored by teams in positions higher than 10 is 203, which is not zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
