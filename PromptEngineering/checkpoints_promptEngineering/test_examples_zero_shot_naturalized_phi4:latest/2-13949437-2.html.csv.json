    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main parts:\n\n1. **Trend in Height and Floors:**\n   - The claim states that as buildings increase in height, they also generally increase in the number of floors, with one exception.\n   \n2. **Exception Regarding Union Bank of California Tower:**\n   - It claims that when the Union Bank of California tower became the tallest in 1969 at a height of 268 feet, it had 10 stories fewer than the previously tallest building.\n\nLet's break down these components:\n\n### Part 1: Trend in Height and Floors\n\nWe need to check if each successive building (by years as tallest) generally has more floors than its predecessor, with only one exception:\n\n- **Wells Fargo Building (1907 - 1911):** 12 floors\n- **Yeon Building (1911 - 1913):** 15 floors (increase)\n- **American Bank Building (1913 - 1927):** 15 floors (same as Yeon, not an increase but not a decrease either)\n- **Public Service Building (1927 - 1962):** 16 floors (increase)\n- **Hilton Portland Hotel (1963 - 1965):** 22 floors (increase)\n- **Harrison West Condominium Tower (1965 - 1969):** 25 floors (increase)\n- **Union Bank of California Tower (1969 - 1970):** 15 floors (decrease, this is the exception)\n- **Standard Insurance Center (1970 - 1972):** 27 floors (increase)\n- **Wells Fargo Center (1972 - present):** 41 floors (increase)\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that there is generally an increase in the number of floors as buildings become taller, with one exception at the Union Bank of California Tower.\n\n### Part 2: Exception Verification\n\nThe claim specifies that the Union Bank of California Tower had 10 stories fewer than the previously tallest building. Let's verify:\n\n- **Previously Tallest Building (Harrison West Condominium Tower):** 25 floors\n- **Union Bank of California Tower:** 15 floors\n\nDifference in floors = 25 - 15 = 10 floors, which confirms the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data:\n\n1. The general trend is an increase in floors with one exception (Union Bank of California Tower).\n2. The Union Bank of California Tower had exactly 10 fewer floors than its predecessor.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify which building held the title of \"tallest\" for the longest period before the current tallest building, Wells Fargo Center.\n2.
