    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze the relevant conditions in the claim:\n\n- The claim states: \"maxi be the only player on the list from eurasia.\"\n\nFirstly, identify which players are from Eurasia (countries located entirely in Europe and Asia). In this context, we consider countries with regions spanning both continents:\n1. Turkey is considered a Eurasian country.\n\nNext, check each row for the players' countries to see if any match this criterion:\n\n- **Row 3**: The player \"maxi\" is from Argentina (\"arg\"), which is not in Eurasia.\n- **Row 8**: The player \"r\u00fcst\u00fc\" is from Turkey (\"tur\"). Turkey is considered a Eurasian country.\n\nBased on the table:\n- There are two players: \"maxi\" and \"r\u00fcst\u00fc.\"\n- \"Maxi\" is from Argentina (not Eurasia).\n- \"R\u00fcst\u00fc\" is from Turkey (Eurasia).\n\nThus, \"maxi\" is not the only player from a country considered part of Eurasia. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n1. The row indicating \"maxi's\" country.\n2. The row indicating \"r\u00fcst\u00fc's\" country.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
