However, it does not explicitly mention Los Angeles in each row. \n   - To infer whether Los Angeles is the opposing team, we need to consider other details such as the location and series notation.\n\n2. **Location:**\n   - The locations given are \"Staples Center\" and \"New Orleans Arena.\" Staples Center is the home arena of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n   - In rows where the location is \"Staples Center,\" it suggests that the game was hosted by the team associated with Staples Center, which would be the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n3. **Date:**\n   - The dates provided are in April 2011 (17th to 26th).
