    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"when marseille be the first team , the first leg 's score be 3 - 1,\" we need to check whether Marseille is listed as the first team and what the corresponding score in the first leg was.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 8** corresponds to Marseille:\n  - `team 1`: marseille\n  - `1st leg`: 3 - 1\n\nThe claim specifies that when Marseille is \"the first team,\" the \"first leg's score be 3 - 1.\" In Row 8, Marseille is indeed listed as the first team, and the score for the first leg matches exactly with what the claim states (3 - 1).\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are met by the data in Row 8.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Row Index**: In the provided table format, rows are indexed starting from 0. Therefore, Row 8 in the naturalized description is represented by `row_index: 7`.\n- **Column Names**: The relevant columns for verifying the claim are `\"team 1\"` and `\"1st leg\"`, as they contain the information necessary to check if Marseille was the first team and what the score of the first leg was.",
