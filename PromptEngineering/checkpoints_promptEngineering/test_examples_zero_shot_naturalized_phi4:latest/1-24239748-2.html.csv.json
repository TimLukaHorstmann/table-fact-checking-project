However, the percent of total exports for \"vest\" is 15.0%, not 13.8% as stated in the claim.\n\nSince the second condition does not match (the percentage should be 13.8% but is actually 15.0%), the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 3, column \"exports (us mil)\"\n- Row 3, column \"percent of total exports\"\n- Row 4, column \"percent of total exports\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"exports (us mil)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"percent of total exports\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"percent of total exports\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
