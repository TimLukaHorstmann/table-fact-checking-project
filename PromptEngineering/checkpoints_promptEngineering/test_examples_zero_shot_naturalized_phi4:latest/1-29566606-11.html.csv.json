The program name is \"art attack.\"\n2. The original channel for this program was \"citv.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Row 4** corresponds to the program \"art attack.\"\n- In **Column 'original channel (s)'**, Row 4 states that the original channel was \"citv.\"\n\nThis matches both components of the claim: the program name and the original channel.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is true or false, we need to check the relevant details in the table:\n\n1. Identify the row related to the programme \"Big Brother\".\n2. Verify the date of return for this programme.\n3. Confirm that the new channel matches the information provided.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Row Identification:** \n  - The programme \"big brother\" is listed in Row 2.\n\n- **Check Date of Return:**\n  - In Row 2, under the column \"date of return\", the value is \"9 september 2011\".\n\n- **Channel Verification:**\n  - Although the channel information is relevant for completeness, it does not affect the truth value of this specific claim about the date.\n  - The new channel listed in Row 2 is \"channel 5\", which matches the expected change but is not directly needed to verify the date.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\". Based on the table, this information is correct as per Row 2. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
