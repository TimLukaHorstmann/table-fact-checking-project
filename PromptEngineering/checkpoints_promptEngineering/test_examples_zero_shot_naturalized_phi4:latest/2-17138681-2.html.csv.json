    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to carefully examine the table and identify entries where the condition \"rating / share (18 - 49): 3.2 / 8\" is met, then check if their corresponding viewership exceeds 12.42 million.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - The claim specifies a particular \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" value of \"3.2 / 8\". We need to find this exact match in the table.\n   - From examining each row, we identify that Row 6 has \"rating / share (18 - 49): 3.2 / 8\".\n\n2. **Check viewership for identified rows:**\n   - For Row 6, where \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" is \"3.2 / 8\", the viewers are listed as 12.42 million.\n\n3. **Assess the claim:**\n   - The claim states that there should be more than 12.42 million viewers for entries with this specific rating/share ratio.\n   - Since Row 6 has exactly 12.42 million viewers, it does not satisfy the condition of having \"more than\" 12.42 million viewers.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no entries in the table that meet both conditions specified by the claim (i.e., having a rating/share of 3.2/8 and more than 12.42 million viewers).\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include:\n- The \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" column for identifying the matching entries.\n- The \"viewers (millions)\" column for checking if any such entry exceeds 12.42 million viewers.\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rating / share (18 - 49)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that the claim is false and points to the relevant cells used in making this determination.",
