    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down and analyze each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Location Check**: The claim specifies \"edison international field of anaheim\". We need to find rows where the location matches this.\n\n2. **Date Check**: The claim mentions \"october 20\". We need to identify rows with this date.\n\n3. **Game Description**: The claim states \"the 2002 world series have its second long game\". This implies:\n   - It should be a World Series game.\n   - It is the second game played at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n   - It has the longest duration among games played there.\n\nLet's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Date: October 19\n  - Location: Edison International Field of Anaheim\n  - Time: 3:44\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: October 20\n  - Location: Edison International Field of Anaheim\n  - Time: 3:57\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Date: October 26\n  - Location: Edison International Field of Anaheim\n  - Time: 3:48\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Date: October 27\n  - Location: Edison International Field of Anaheim\n  - Time: 3:16\n\nFrom the above, Row 2 matches both the location and date specified in the claim.\n\nNext, we need to check if it is indeed the second game at this location and if it has the longest duration among those games:\n\n- **Games at Edison International Field of Anaheim**:\n  - Game 1 (Row 1): Time = 3:44\n  - Game 2 (Row 2): Time = 3:57\n  - Game 6 (Row 6): Time = 3:48\n  - Game 7 (Row 7): Time = 3:16\n\nGame 2 is indeed the second game at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n\nNow, let's compare the durations:\n- Row 1: 3:44 (224 minutes)\n- Row 2: 3:57 (237 minutes) - Longest\n- Row 6: 3:48 (228 minutes)\n- Row 7: 3:16 (196 minutes)\n\nRow 2 has the longest duration among these games.\n\nTherefore, all conditions of the claim are satisfied. The claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
