We will identify which row corresponds to a school with an establishment year of 1973 and check its associated note regarding location.\n\nHere are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Establishment Year 1973:**\n   - Review each row's \"established\" column to find the school established in 1973.\n   - From the table, we observe that Row 1 has a school named Henry Foss, which was established in 1973.\n\n2. **Check the Location Note:**\n   - Now, examine the \"notes\" column for Row 1 to verify its location.\n   - The note for Row 1 states that it is located in Central Tacoma.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- There is a school (Henry Foss) established in 1973.\n- The note confirms this school is located in Central Tacoma.\n\nThus, based on the data from the table, the claim is fully supported and is TRUE.
