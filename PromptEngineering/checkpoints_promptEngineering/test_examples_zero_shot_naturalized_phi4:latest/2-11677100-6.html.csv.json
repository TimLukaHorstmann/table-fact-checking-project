    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Adrian Gonzalez must be a Rhode Island resident.\n2. No other player picked in the first round of the 2000 MLB draft should be a Rhode Island resident.\n\nLet's analyze each row relevant to these conditions:\n\n- **Adrian Gonzalez (Row 9)**: \n  - Hometown is Chula Vista, CA.\n  - This confirms that Adrian Gonzalez is not from Rhode Island. \n\n- **Rocco Baldelli (Row 3)**:\n  - Hometown is Warwick, RI.\n  - This shows that there was a player from Rhode Island picked in the first round of the 2000 MLB draft.\n\nSince Rocco Baldelli is identified as a Rhode Island resident and Adrian Gonzalez is not, the claim that \"Adrian Gonzalez be the only rhode island resident pick in the first round draft\" is false. We specifically needed to check the hometowns of all players listed.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- Row 3 (Rocco Baldelli's hometown)\n- Row 9 (Adrian Gonzalez's hometown)\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
