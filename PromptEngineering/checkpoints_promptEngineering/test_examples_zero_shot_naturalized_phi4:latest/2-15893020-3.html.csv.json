    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Deon Kruis's batting average being 0.1 is true or false, we must examine the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim concerns \"Deon Kruis.\" According to the table, he is listed under row 17.\n\n2. **Check Required Columns:**\n   - The batting average formula for a cricket player is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Runs}}{\\text{(Innings Played - Not Out)}}\n     \\]\n   - For Deon Kruis, we need the following data from row 17:\n     - **Runs:** Total runs scored by the player.\n     - **Innings:** The number of innings played.\n     - **Not Out:** Number of times the player was not out.\n\n3. **Extract Data:**\n   - From Row 17 (Deon Kruis):\n     - Runs = 3\n     - Innings = 1\n     - Not Out = 1\n\n4. **Calculate Average:**\n   - Using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{3}{(1 - 1)} = \\frac{3}{0}\n     \\]\n   - Division by zero is undefined, indicating that an average cannot be calculated for Deon Kruis because he was not out in all his innings.\n\n5. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states the average is 0.1.\n   - Since the average calculation is undefined (division by zero), it cannot be 0.1 or any other number.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim \"average be 0.1 for Deon Kruis\" is false because an average cannot be calculated in this case.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"runs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"not out\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
