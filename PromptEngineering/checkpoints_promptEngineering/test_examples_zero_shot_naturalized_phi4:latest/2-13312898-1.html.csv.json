Identify if there's a player selected in Round 3.\n2. Check if that player is associated with the college \"Oklahoma.\"\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step-by-step using the given data:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Player from Round 3\n- According to the table, Row 3 has the following details:\n  - `round`: 3\n  - `pick`: 1\n  - `overall`: 26\n  - `name`: Buck McPhail\n  - `position`: Fullback\n  - `college`: Oklahoma\n\nThis row corresponds to Round 3, satisfying the first condition of being a player from this round.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying College Affiliation\n- The same Row 3 indicates that the college for \"Buck McPhail\" is \"Oklahoma.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by Buck McPhail, who was selected in Round 3 and attended Oklahoma. Thus, the claim \"the colt draft 3 player from oklahoma\" is indeed true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells that help us verify this claim are:\n- Row 3 for the `round` column: confirms it's Round 3.\n- Row 3 for the `college` column: confirms the college as Oklahoma.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `row_index` starts from 0, so Row 3 in the table corresponds to index 2.\n- The columns checked are `round` (to verify it's Round 3) and `college` (to confirm the affiliation with Oklahoma).",
