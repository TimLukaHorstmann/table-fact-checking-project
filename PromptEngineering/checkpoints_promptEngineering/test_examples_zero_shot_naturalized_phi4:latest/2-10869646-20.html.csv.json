    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"geelong do not play on August 17, 1974\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table and verify if there's a match involving the team Geelong on that specific date.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** \n   - The relevant columns for this task are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"date.\" These columns will help us determine whether Geelong played any games on August 17, 1974.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - We need to check each row in the table to see if \"geelong\" appears as either the home team or the away team on the date of interest (August 17, 1974).\n\n3. **Row Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Home Team: Essendon\n     - Away Team: North Melbourne\n     - Date: August 17, 1974\n     - Geelong is not involved.\n\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Home Team: Collingwood\n     - Away Team: Richmond\n     - Date: August 17, 1974\n     - Geelong is not involved.\n\n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Home Team: Carlton\n     - Away Team: Fitzroy\n     - Date: August 17, 1974\n     - Geelong is not involved.\n\n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Home Team: South Melbourne\n     - Away Team: Geelong\n     - Date: August 17, 1974\n     - Geelong is involved as the away team.\n     \n   - **Row 5:** \n     - Home Team: Melbourne\n     - Away Team: Footscray\n     - Date: August 17, 1974\n     - Geelong is not involved.\n\n   - **Row 6:** \n     - Home Team: Hawthorn\n     - Away Team: St Kilda\n     - Date: August 17, 1974\n     - Geelong is not involved.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - In Row 4, we find that Geelong was indeed the away team playing on August 17, 1974.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"geelong do not play on August 17, 1974\" is FALSE because there is a record of them playing on that date.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are from Row 4:\n     - Home Team (South Melbourne)\n     - Away Team (Geelong)\n     - Date (August 17, 1974)\n\nGiven this analysis, the JSON object with the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
