Therefore, they did not tie the same number of games.\n\nBased on this information:\n\n- **Answer**: FALSE\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - For Portuguesa: Row Index 7, Column Name \"drawn\"\n  - For Santos: Row Index 3, Column Name \"drawn\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
