Here, Young Africans won the first leg and drew the second leg.\n\n### Points Calculation:\n- **First Leg:** Young Africans scored 2 goals and conceded none, resulting in a win (3 points).\n- **Second Leg:** They drew with no goals for or against, earning 1 point.\n\nTotal points = 3 (win) + 1 (draw) = 4 points\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"the young african score 2 point,\" but according to the table, they actually scored 4 points.
