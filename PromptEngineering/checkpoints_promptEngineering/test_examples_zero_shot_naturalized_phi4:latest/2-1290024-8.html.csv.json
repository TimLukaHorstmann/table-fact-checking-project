    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate if the class `pp` type `4 - 4 - 0` locomotive is indeed the oldest make of steam locomotive in Ireland according to the given table.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that the `class pp`, with `type 4 - 4 - 0`, is the oldest make of steam locomotive in Ireland.\n   \n2. **Relevant Information from Table:**\n   - We need to check which class and type of locomotives were made first according to their date range (the \"date made\" column).\n   - Specifically, we need to focus on the rows where the `type` is either `4 - 4 - 0` or any other types if they have an earlier start year than `class pp`.\n\n3. **Extracting Relevant Data:**\n   - Row 1 (class: pp) has a date made from 1896 to 1911.\n   - We need to compare this with the \"date made\" columns of other rows, especially focusing on locomotives with type `4 - 4 - 0` since that is mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Rows:**\n   - Row 3 (class: q) has a date made from 1899 to 1904.\n   - Row 6 (class: ql) has a date made from 1904 to 1910.\n   - Row 5 (class: p) has a date made from 1904 to 1906.\n   - Row 13 (class: s) has a date made from 1913 onwards.\n   - Rows with type `0 - 6 - 0` and other types do not match the type specified in the claim, so they are irrelevant for determining if `pp` is the oldest within its type.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The earliest start year among all locomotives of type `4 - 4 - 0` is from row 1 (class pp) at 1896.\n   - No other `4 - 4 - 0` types were made before 1896 according to the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"the class pp type 4 - 4 - 0 locomotive be the oldest make steam locomotive of ireland\" is supported by the data provided in the table.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there are any locomotives with class \"d\" or \"dg\" and check their dates of manufacture and withdrawal against all other classes in the table. The key components of the claim involve identifying:\n\n1. Locomotives labeled as class \"d\" or \"dg\".\n2. Determining if these were the last ones made, i.e., they have the latest date among all locomotives.\n3. Checking if they are also the latest withdrawn, meaning their withdrawal dates are the most recent.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant part of the table:\n\n1. **Locomotive Class**: The claim specifically mentions classes \"d\" and \"dg\". We need to check if any row in the table matches these classes.\n   \n2. **Date Made**: If class \"d\" or \"dg\" exists, we must verify that their date made is later than any other locomotives' manufacture dates.\n\n3. **Date Withdrawn**: Similarly, for withdrawal dates, they should be the latest compared to all other rows if such a class exists.\n\nWe will examine each row in the table:\n\n- Rows 1 through 14 do not contain locomotives with classes \"d\" or \"dg\". Each row has different classes like \"pp\", \"pg\", \"q\", etc., but none match \"d\" or \"dg\".\n\nSince there are no entries for class \"d\" or \"dg\" in the table:\n\n- We cannot verify if they were made last, nor can we confirm their withdrawal dates.\n- As these classes do not exist within the provided data, it is impossible for them to be the latest manufactured or withdrawn locomotives.\n\nGiven this analysis, since classes \"d\" and \"dg\" are absent from the table, the claim cannot be supported. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells needed to verify this conclusion involve checking all rows under the \"class\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
