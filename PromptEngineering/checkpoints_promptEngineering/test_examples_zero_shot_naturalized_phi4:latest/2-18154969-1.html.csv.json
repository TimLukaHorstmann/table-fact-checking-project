    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the second leg scores in the provided table, we need to analyze each relevant row and column for information on teams scoring exactly \"1\" in their second-leg matches.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the results of the 2nd leg matches where the score is specifically \"1\" for one of the teams, as stated in the claim.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Team 2 (pobeda) scores 0-1. This row involves a loss with a score of 1.\n   - **Row 2**: Both legs are examined. The 2nd leg shows team 2 (sileks) scores 5, and team 1 (pelister) scores 3. No \"1\" here.\n   - **Row 3**: Team 2 (\u0161kendija hb) scores 2 in the 2nd leg, and team 1 (rabotni\u010dki) scores 1. This involves a loss with a score of 1.\n   - **Row 4**: Both teams have results shown: team 2 (bregalnica \u0161tip) scores 1 in the 2nd leg, and team 1 (belasica) scores 1 as well. This is a tie involving a \"1\".\n   - **Row 5**: Team 2 (borec mhk) scores 4 in the 2nd leg, and team 1 (karaorman) scores 1. This involves a loss with a score of 1.\n   - **Row 6**: Both legs are examined: team 2 (napredok) scores 0-1-0. No \"1\" here in terms of scoring exactly one goal for the first team.\n   - **Row 7**: Team 2 (ba\u0161kimi) scores 4, and team 1 (alumina) scores 1. This involves a loss with a score of 1.\n   - **Row 8**: Both legs are examined: team 2 (mad\u017eari solidarnost) scores 0-0. No \"1\" here for the second leg.\n\n3. **Count and Categorize**:\n   - Losses with a score of \"1\": Rows 1, 3, 5, 7.\n   - Ties involving a score of \"1\": Row 4 (both teams scored 1).\n   \n   The claim states there should be 6 losses where the team scores \"1\" and 1 tie. We have identified:\n   - 4 losses with a score of \"1\".\n   - 1 tie with a score of \"1\".\n\nThus, the table does not support having exactly 6 losses with a score of \"1\", only 4.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
