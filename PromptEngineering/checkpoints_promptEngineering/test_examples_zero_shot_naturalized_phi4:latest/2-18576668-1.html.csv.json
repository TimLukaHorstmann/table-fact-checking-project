    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if it is valid based on the given table. The claim states: \"the last 4 games in season 5 be hold in los angeles and london.\" We must verify two aspects of this statement:\n\n1. Identify the events that occurred during \"season 5.\"\n2. Check if these events were held in Los Angeles and London.\n\nLet's go through each step methodically:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Season 5\n\nThe table provides seasons with specific formats, such as \"1997 - 98\" for one season and simply \"2005\" for another. To identify \"season 5,\" we need to establish a pattern or numbering system based on the information available in the table.\n\n- The earliest season mentioned is \"1997 - 98.\"\n- Assuming each row denotes consecutive seasons, we can count the seasons as follows:\n  - Season 1: 1997 - 98\n  - Season 2: 1998 - 99\n  - Season 3: 1999 - 00\n  - Season 4: 2000 - 01\n  - Season 5: 2001 - 02\n\n### Step 2: Extract Events from Season 5 (2001-02)\n\nWe will list all the rows that pertain to the \"2001 - 02\" season:\n\n- **Row 8**: event type: grand prix, location: hong kong\n- **Row 9**: event type: masters, location: san diego\n- **Row 10**: event type: grand prix, location: fukuoka\n- **Row 11**: event type: grand prix, location: nagoya\n\n### Step 3: Verify Locations for the Last Four Events of Season 5\n\nThe claim specifically mentions that these events were held in Los Angeles and London. We need to verify if any of the last four games from the \"2001 - 02\" season were indeed located in these cities.\n\n- **Row 8** (hong kong): Not Los Angeles or London\n- **Row 9** (san diego): Not Los Angeles or London\n- **Row 10** (fukuoka): Not Los Angeles or London\n- **Row 11** (nagoya): Not Los Angeles or London\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNone of the last four events from Season 5 were held in Los Angeles or London. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are rows 8 through 11, specifically examining the \"location\" column for each.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 10 events in 2011\" is true or false, we need to focus on the rows of the table where the season is specified as \"2005\", because the year 2011 mentioned in the claim seems to have been a typographical error. The correct relevant season for verification should be 2005 based on the provided data.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Rows with Season 2005**: We will check each row where the season is \"2005\" and count the number of events listed.\n\n1. Row 17: \n   - Season: 2005\n   - Event Type: grand prix\n2. Row 18:\n   - Season: 2005\n   - Event Type: invitational\n3. Row 19:\n   - Season: 2005\n   - Event Type: pro tour\n4. Row 20:\n   - Season: 2005\n   - Event Type: pro tour\n\nThere are four events listed for the season \"2005\". \n\nSince there are no rows with the season labeled as \"2011\", and considering the context, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim intended to refer to the year 2005. Therefore, the statement about having \"10 events in 2011\" does not hold true based on the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
