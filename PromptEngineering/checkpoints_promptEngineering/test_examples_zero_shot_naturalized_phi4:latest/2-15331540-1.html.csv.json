    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the specific conditions stated in it: \n\n**Claim:** \"10 be the lost number when there be 57 against\"\n\nThis implies two conditions:\n1. The column labeled 'against' must have a value of 57.\n2. Corresponding to this row with 'against' equal to 57, the 'lost' column should have a value of 10.\n\nLet's examine the table data:\n\n- **Row 8:**\n  - against: 57\n  - lost: 10\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions of the claim. The relevant columns for this analysis are 'against' and 'lost'. Therefore, we can determine that the claim is true based on the information provided in Row 8.\n\nThus, our JSON response should reflect the verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Row Index:** Since tables are usually indexed starting from 1 in descriptions and many contexts, we adjust for a zero-based index as used in programming by subtracting one. Hence, row 8 becomes `row_index: 7`.\n- **Column Names:** 'against' and 'lost' are the columns relevant to verifying the claim.\n\nThis JSON object accurately reflects that the claim is verified true based on the data in Row 8 (index 7) of the table.",
