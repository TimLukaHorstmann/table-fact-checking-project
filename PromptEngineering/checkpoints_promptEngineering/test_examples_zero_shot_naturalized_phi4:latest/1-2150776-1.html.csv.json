We look through the table for this exact date.\n   - Row 23 has the year 2003 and not 1997.\n   - Row 22 mentions June 8, but it's in the year 2003, so this is not relevant.\n   - Row 16 matches both June 9, 2002, so we continue checking other rows.\n   - No row explicitly lists June 8, 1997. However, Row 17 has June 9, 2002, which isn't our target date.\n\n2. **Driver Verification**: The claim states that Jeff Gordon was the driver.\n   - Row 16 shows Tony Stewart as the driver for June 8, 2003.\n   - Row 15 lists Dale Jarrett as the driver for June 9, 2002.\n   - Row 17 mentions Jimmie Johnson for June 13, 2004.\n   - Row 16 (June 8, 2003) does not mention Jeff Gordon.\n\n3. **Laps Verification**: The claim specifies that Jeff Gordon drove 200 laps.\n   - Rows with 200 laps:\n     - Row 7: Geoff Bodine\n     - Row 17: Jimmie Johnson\n     - Row 21: Dale Jarrett\n     - Row 26: Jeff Gordon, but on June 10, 2007 (106 laps)\n     - Row 11: Geoff Bodine again\n     - Row 30: Jeff Gordon for June 12, 2011\n\nNone of these rows match the date June 8, 1997.
