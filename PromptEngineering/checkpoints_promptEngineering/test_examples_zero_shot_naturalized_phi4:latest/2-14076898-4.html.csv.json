    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the table and verify whether there is an instance where points equal 13, and the corresponding goal differences are both \"51 - 10\" and \"40 - 13\".\n\nLet's break down the relevant parts of the claim:\n\n1. **Points = 13**: The claim states that when the points are 13, certain conditions about goal difference should hold true.\n\n2. **Goal Differences**: According to the claim, if the points were 13, then two specific goal differences (\"51 - 10\" and \"40 - 13\") would occur.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n- We need to look for any row where the points are equal to 13. \n\nUpon checking each row:\n- Row 1: Points = 12\n- Row 2: Points = 12\n- Row 3: Points = 10\n- Row 4: Points = 7\n- Row 5: Points = 7\n- Row 6: Points = 6\n- Row 7: Points = 2\n- Row 8: Points = 0\n\nNone of the rows have points equal to 13. Therefore, there is no row that satisfies the condition where points are 13.\n\nSince we do not find any instance in the table where points equal 13, the conditions regarding goal differences (\"51 - 10\" and \"40 - 13\") being associated with points = 13 cannot be verified or supported by the data.\n\nThus, the claim is false because it assumes a situation that does not exist in the given table.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all those related to the 'points' column, as we needed to check if any row had points equal to 13. Therefore, every row's \"points\" cell was relevant for verification.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
