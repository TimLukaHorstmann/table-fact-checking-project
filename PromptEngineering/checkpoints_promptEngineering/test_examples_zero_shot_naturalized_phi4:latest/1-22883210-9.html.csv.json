    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the game number for cleveland be 71,\" we need to examine the relevant rows in the provided table to see if there is a match with the specified conditions:\n\n1. Identify rows where the team mentioned is \"Cleveland.\"\n2. Verify that these rows have a \"game\" number of 71.\n3. Ensure no discrepancies exist for other related information like scores, records, or dates.\n\nLet's go through the table systematically to verify this claim:\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Team: Cleveland\n  - Game Number: 61\n  - The game result is a loss (l), and Manu Ginobili scored the highest points. This row involves Cleveland but does not match game number 71.\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - Team: Atlanta\n  - No mention of Cleveland.\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - Team: Oklahoma City\n  - No mention of Cleveland.\n\n- **Row 13**:\n  - Team: Los Angeles Lakers\n  - No mention of Cleveland.\n\n- **Row 14**:\n  - Team: Cleveland\n  - Game Number: 71\n  - The game result is a win (w), with Manu Ginobili scoring the highest points. This row matches both conditions specified in the claim.\n\nAs per the examination, Row 14 meets all criteria for the claim regarding \"Cleveland\" and \"game number 71.\" \n\nTherefore, based on the data provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding whether both the Golden State game and the Oklahoma City game were played at AT&T Center with over 19,000 in attendance, we need to examine specific details from the relevant rows in the table.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Both games occurred at AT&T Center.\n2. The attendance for both games was over 19,000.\n\nLet's break down the examination of these conditions:\n\n**Golden State Game (Row 10):**\n- **Location Attendance:** \"at&t center 18581\"\n  - This confirms that this game was played at AT&T Center and had an attendance of 18,581.\n  \n**Oklahoma City Game (Row 12):**\n- **Location Attendance:** \"ford center 18203\"\n  - This indicates the game was not held at AT&T Center but rather Ford Center. Additionally, it had an attendance of 18,203.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The Golden State game did occur at AT&T Center with an attendance of over 19,000.\n- However, the Oklahoma City game did not occur at AT&T Center and also had an attendance less than 19,000.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are required to be true for the entire statement to hold, but only one part is satisfied, the overall claim is false.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\" with the relevant cells being those that verify the location and attendance details of these two games:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
