    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Thierry Boutsen finished the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix right after Marc Surer\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table data for both drivers:\n\n1. **Identify Thierry Boutsen's Position:**\n   - Look at Row 12 in the table.\n   - Check the \"laps\" and \"time / retired\" columns:\n     - Laps: 54\n     - Time/Retired: Suspension\n\n2. **Identify Marc Surer's Position:**\n   - Look at Row 10 in the table.\n   - Check the \"laps\" and \"time / retired\" columns:\n     - Laps: 65\n     - Time/Retired: Exhaust\n\n3. **Determine Finishing Order:**\n   - A driver is considered to have finished a race if they completed more laps than any other driver who did not retire or complete fewer laps.\n   - \"Not Classified,\" \"Did Not Finish\" (DNF), and specific reasons like \"exhaust\" or \"suspension\" indicate that the driver did not finish the race.\n\n4. **Analyze the Results:**\n   - Thierry Boutsen completed 54 laps but retired due to suspension, so he did not finish.\n   - Marc Surer completed 65 laps but retired due to exhaust issues, so he also did not finish.\n   - Both drivers are classified under \"Retired\" and thus did not complete the race.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither driver finished the race, Thierry Boutsen could not have finished right after Marc Surer.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because neither driver completed the race to establish a finishing order.\n  \nThe relevant cells for verification are from Row 10 and Row 12 under the \"laps\" and \"time / retired\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to carefully examine each part of it against the provided table:\n\n**Claim:** \"3 drivers compete in the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix be only able to complete 9 laps\"\n\nWe break this down into two main conditions:\n1. Identify the number of drivers who completed exactly 9 laps.\n2. Verify if there are precisely 3 such drivers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Drivers Who Completed Exactly 9 Laps:**\n   - We need to look at the \"laps\" column for each row and count how many rows have the value `9`.\n\n2. **Check Row Data:**\n   - Row 19 (Teo Fabi): 18 laps\n   - Row 20 (Jacques Laffite): 17 laps\n   - Row 21 (Jonathan Palmer): 13 laps\n   - Row 22 (Piercarlo Ghinzani): 12 laps\n   - **Row 23 (Stefan Johansson)**: 9 laps \n   - Row 24 (Pierluigi Martini): 1 lap\n   - Other rows have different numbers of laps.\n\n3. **Count Drivers Completing Exactly 9 Laps:**\n   - From the analysis above, only **Row 23** corresponds to a driver who completed exactly 9 laps.\n   - Therefore, there is only 1 driver (Stefan Johansson) with this attribute.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Statement:**\n   - The claim states that \"3 drivers\" completed exactly 9 laps.\n   - Our analysis shows only 1 driver did so.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because only one driver completed exactly 9 laps, not three as stated in the claim.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this JSON object:\n- The `answer` is set to `\"FALSE\"` because the condition of having exactly 3 drivers completing 9 laps is not met.\n- The `relevant_cells` list includes only Row 23 under the \"laps\" column since it's the only relevant data point for verifying the number of laps completed.",
