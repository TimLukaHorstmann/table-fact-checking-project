    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding a specific game held on November 19 during the 1990 World Cup qualifying rounds in California, we need to examine each relevant piece of information from the table and check it against the claim's conditions.\n\nThe claim states: \"the 1990 world cup qualify game hold in california be on november 19\".\n\nLet's break down this claim into its components:\n\n1. The competition should be \"1990 World Cup qualifying\".\n2. The venue should be in California.\n3. The date should be November 19.\n\nNow, let\u2019s verify these conditions against the table provided:\n\n- **Condition 1: Competition as \"1990 World Cup qualifying\"**\n\n  We need to find a row where the competition is \"1990 world cup qualifying\". Checking each row:\n  \n  - Row 4: The competition is listed as \"1990 world cup\", not qualifying.\n  \n  There are no rows specifically mentioning \"1990 world cup qualifying\".\n\n- **Condition 2: Venue in California**\n\n  We need a game held in California. Looking at the venue column:\n\n  - Row 1 lists the venue as \"torrance, california\".\n  \n  Only row 1 has a venue in California.\n\n- **Condition 3: Date on November 19**\n\n  Now we check for games played on November 19:\n  \n  - Row 2 lists the date as \"november 19\".\n\n  Only row 2 is dated November 19.\n\nNow let's combine these observations to see if any single row meets all three conditions:\n\n- **Row 1** satisfies Condition 2 (California) but not Conditions 1 and 3.\n- **Row 2** satisfies Condition 3 (November 19) but does not satisfy Conditions 1 and 2.\n\nNone of the rows meet all three conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no row indicating a \"1990 world cup qualifying\" game held in California on November 19.\n\nThus, our conclusion based on the verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response reflects that the claim is false and indicates which table cells were examined to determine this conclusion.",
