This implies two things:\n- We need to identify if Gilbert Arenas had any recorded assists on November 10.\n- We should verify whether this is indeed his lowest number of assists, especially in relation to other games.\n\nHere's how we can systematically check against the table:\n\n1. **Locate the row for November 10**:\n   - Row 6 corresponds to \"game: 8, date: november 13\", which is not relevant.\n   - Row 7 matches \"game: 9, date: november 16\", also irrelevant.\n   - Row 4 corresponds to \"game: 6, date: november 10\".
