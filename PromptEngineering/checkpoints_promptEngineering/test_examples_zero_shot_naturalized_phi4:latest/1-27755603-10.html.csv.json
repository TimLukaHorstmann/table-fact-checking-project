The claim specifically mentions two conditions:\n\n1. Rodney Stuckey led in scoring for at least two games.\n2. This occurred during a specific period of the 2010-2011 season.\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table to identify where Rodney Stuckey had the highest points scored:\n\n- **Row 1**: High points are by Rodney Stuckey (25).\n- **Row 2**: High points are by Austin Daye (22).\n- **Row 3**: High points are by Tayshaun Prince (20).\n- **Row 4**: High points are by Richard Hamilton (20).\n- **Row 5**: High points are by Richard Hamilton (20).\n- **Row 6**: High points are by Chris Wilcox (21).\n- **Row 7**: High points are by Richard Hamilton (24).\n- **Row 8**: High points are by Tayshaun Prince (16).\n- **Row 9**: High points are by Rodney Stuckey (22).\n- **Row 10**: High points are by Richard Hamilton (27).\n- **Row 11**: High points are by Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince (15).\n- **Row 12**: High points are by Richard Hamilton (23).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that Rodney Stuckey led in scoring in two games:\n\n- Game 1: March 1st, scored 25 points.\n- Game 9: March 20th, scored 22 points.\n\nThe claim is therefore supported by the data. Both conditions of the claim are satisfied as Rodney Stuckey indeed led in scoring for two games during this period.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
