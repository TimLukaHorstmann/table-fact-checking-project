This means episode 12 belongs to season 12, not season 3. Therefore, the claim about it being part of season 3 is incorrect.\n\n- **Verify Director**: Even though we don't need to check this since the season number already disproves the claim, for completeness, row 11 states that the director is Rick Morales.\n\nSince episode 12 is from season 12 and not season 3, the claim is false.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Identify which episode corresponds to the 15th episode in the third season.\n2. Check if this episode has a production code of 315.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim\n\n- **Identify the 15th Episode in Season 3:**\n  - The table is organized by both series number and season number.\n  - We need to find episodes that are part of the third season (i.e., \"no in season\": 3).\n  - The first episode in the third season is indicated as having a \"no in season\" value of 3, which corresponds to Row 2 with \"no in series\": 29.\n  - To determine the 15th episode overall in the third season, we need to consider that each row represents an episode. The first row (27-28) comprises two episodes, so these contribute 2 episodes to the total count.\n  - From Row 2 onward, every row corresponds to a single episode:\n    - Rows: \n      - 1 contributes 2 episodes,\n      - 2 contributes 1 episode (3rd season starts here),\n      - 3 contributes 1 more episode,\n      - 4 contributes 1 more episode,\n      - ...\n      - Continue until the cumulative count reaches 15.\n\n- **Calculate Cumulative Count:**\n  - Episodes from Row 1: 2 episodes\n  - Episode from Row 2 (Season 3 starts): 1 episode (cumulative: 3)\n  - Episode from Row 3: 1 more episode (cumulative: 4)\n  - Continue adding one for each subsequent row:\n    - Row 4: cumulative 5\n    - Row 5: cumulative 6\n    - ...\n    - Row 11: cumulative 12\n    - Row 12: cumulative 13\n    - Row 13: cumulative 14\n    - Row 14: cumulative 15\n\n- **Identify the Episode and Production Code:**\n  - The 15th episode in terms of overall count is found at Row 14.\n  - Check if this row corresponds to Season 3, which it does not since \"no in season\": 14.\n  - Thus, there is no 15th episode specifically within the third season.\n\n- **Verify Production Code:**\n  - The production code for Row 14 (41st series number) is 315, but this episode does not belong to Season 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"the 15th episode in the third season have production code 315.\" However, there is no such 15th episode within the third season itself.

For example, Row 2 has `no in season: 3`, which means it is episode 29 overall but the first episode of season 3.\n   - Therefore, episode 14 of season 3 would be the sum of the total episodes from previous seasons plus 13 additional episodes within season 3.\n\n2. **Determine Total Episodes Before Season 3:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 shows `no in series: 27 - 28`, meaning two episodes for season 2.\n     - This indicates that there are 28 episodes before season 3 starts at episode 29.\n\n3. **Calculate Episode Number:**\n   - The first episode of season 3 is numbered 29, so the 14th episode in season 3 will be `29 + 13 = 42`.\n\n4. **Verify Production Code for Episode 42:**\n   - From Row 15 in the table:\n     - It shows `no in series: 42`, and the production code is `316`.\n\n5. **Comparison to Claim:**\n   - The claim states that episode 14 in season 3 should have a production code of 315.\n   - According to our determination, this episode (number 42) has a production code of 316, not 315.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Row 2 (`no in series: 29`, `no in season: 3`) confirms the start of season 3.\n- Rows with `no in series: 42` (Row 15) confirm the production code.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
