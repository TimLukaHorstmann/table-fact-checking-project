    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether both South Melbourne and Fitzroy have scores between 30 and 40 points in their respective games from the table.\n\nThe scoring system in Australian rules football converts goals and behinds into points: a goal is worth 6 points, while a behind is worth 1 point. The score format given in the table (e.g., 8.11) represents goals and behinds respectively.\n\nLet's calculate the scores for both South Melbourne and Fitzroy:\n\n1. **South Melbourne**: \n   - Score: 8.13\n   - Calculation: \\(8 \\times 6 + 13 = 48 + 13 = 61\\) points\n\n2. **Fitzroy**:\n   - Score: 8.18\n   - Calculation: \\(8 \\times 6 + 18 = 48 + 18 = 66\\) points\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim:\n\n- South Melbourne has a score of 61 points.\n- Fitzroy has a score of 66 points.\n\nThe claim states that both teams have scores between 30 and 40 points.
