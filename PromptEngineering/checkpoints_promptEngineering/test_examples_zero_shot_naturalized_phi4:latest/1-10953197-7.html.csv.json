    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Robert J. Metoyer directed the episode with the production code 2398204,\" we need to identify and verify two critical pieces of information from the provided table: who directed a specific episode and its corresponding production code.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Production Code in Question:** \n   - The claim specifies a production code, which is \"2398204\". We must locate this exact number within the \"Production Code\" column to identify the relevant row (episode) for further inspection.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with the Specified Production Code:**\n   - Upon reviewing the table rows, we find that row 22 has the production code \"2398204\".\n\n3. **Verify Director Information:**\n   - In row 22, under the \"Director\" column, it is stated as \"Robert J. Metoyer\". This matches the director name mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince both conditions are met (the episode with production code 2398204 was directed by Robert J. Metoyer), we can confirm that the claim is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The relevant cells needed to verify this claim include:\n  - The cell containing the production code \"2398204\" which identifies the row.\n  - The cell in that identified row under the \"Director\" column, confirming who directed the episode.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are as follows:\n\n- **Row Index:** 22\n  - **Column Name for Production Code:** \"Production Code\"\n  - **Column Name for Director:** \"Director\"\n\nWith this information, we can construct the JSON response reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
