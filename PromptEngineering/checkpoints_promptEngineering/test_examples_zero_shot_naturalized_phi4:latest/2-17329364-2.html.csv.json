    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"manager miguel brindisi resign on sep 4 , 2008\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant details in the provided table.\n\n1. **Manager Name:** The claim specifies that Miguel Brindisi resigned. We need to check each row for a manager named Miguel Brindisi.\n2. **Manner of Departure:** The claim states that he resigned. Thus, we need to confirm if the manner of departure is \"resigned\" for this manager.\n3. **Date of Departure:** The specific date mentioned in the claim is September 4, 2008. We should verify if the date of departure matches this.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Manager: Sergio Ordu\u00f1a\n  - Date and Manner do not match.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Manager: Jos\u00e9 Trejo\n  - Date and Manner do not match.\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Team: Atlas\n  - Outgoing Manager: Miguel Brindisi\n  - Manner of Departure: Resigned\n  - Date of Departure: Sep 4, 2008\n\nThis row matches all the conditions specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells that support this conclusion:\n\n- Row 3, Column \"outgoing manager\": Matches the name \"miguel brindisi\".\n- Row 3, Column \"manner of departure\": Matches the manner \"resigned\".\n- Row 3, Column \"date of departure\": Matches the date \"sep 4 , 2008\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of departure\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"the outgoing manager for team necaxa is salvador reyes,\" we need to verify two key components from the table: \n\n1. Identify which row pertains to the team \"necaxa.\"\n2. Confirm if the \"outgoing manager\" in that specific row matches \"salvador reyes.\"\n\nLet's analyze each relevant aspect of the claim:\n\n- **Team Identification:** The claim specifies the team \"necaxa.\" According to the table, Row 6 contains information about this team.\n\n- **Outgoing Manager Verification:** For Row 6 (which corresponds to necaxa), we need to check the \"outgoing manager\" field. If it matches \"salvador reyes,\" then the claim is supported by the data.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells in the table that are needed for verification:\n\n- The cell containing the team name for Row 6 to ensure it is indeed \"necaxa.\"\n- The cell containing the outgoing manager's name for Row 6 to confirm if it matches \"salvador reyes.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, let\u2019s check these specific cells:\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Column \"team\": It must contain \"necaxa\" to match with the claim.\n  - Column \"outgoing manager\": It must be \"salvador reyes\" as specified in the claim.\n\nUpon verifying these conditions:\n- The team name for Row 6 is indeed \"necaxa.\"\n- The outgoing manager's name for Row 6 is \"salvador reyes.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming that the claim is TRUE.

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, checking if Miguel Brindisi was an outgoing manager:\n- **Row 3** shows that Miguel Brindisi was the outgoing manager for Atlas, but this does not affect the claim about him being hired as an incoming manager.\n\nThus, the claim is entirely unsupported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incoming manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date hired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
