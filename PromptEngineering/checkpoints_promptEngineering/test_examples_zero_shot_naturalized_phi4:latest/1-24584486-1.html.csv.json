    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"in 2009, there be a total of 24 race, 3 pole position, and 7 win\", we need to carefully analyze each part of this statement against the data provided in the table for the year 2009.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n\n1. **Total Races**: The claim states there were a total of 24 races.\n2. **Pole Positions**: The claim mentions a total of 3 pole positions.\n3. **Wins**: According to the claim, there should be a total of 7 wins.\n\n### Examination Against Table Data for 2009:\n\n#### Row 5:\n- **Series**: British Formula Renault 2.0\n  - Races: 20\n  - Wins: 8\n  - Poles: 10\n\n#### Row 6:\n- **Series**: Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup\n  - Races: 6\n  - Wins: 0\n  - Poles: 0\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **Total Races in 2009**:\n   - British Formula Renault 2.0: 20 races\n   - Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup: 6 races\n   - Total = 20 + 6 = 26 races\n\n2. **Total Pole Positions in 2009**:\n   - British Formula Renault 2.0: 10 poles\n   - Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup: 0 poles\n   - Total = 10 + 0 = 10 poles\n\n3. **Total Wins in 2009**:\n   - British Formula Renault 2.0: 8 wins\n   - Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup: 0 wins\n   - Total = 8 + 0 = 8 wins\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim of \"24 races\" is incorrect because the total is actually 26.\n- The claim of \"3 pole positions\" is incorrect since there are actually 10 poles.\n- The claim of \"7 wins\" is also incorrect as there were 8 wins.\n\nSince all three parts of the claim do not match the data from the table, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"races\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"poles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"races\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"poles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
