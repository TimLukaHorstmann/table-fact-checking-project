We need to find the row corresponding to \"Magdalena.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data for Magdalena:**\n   - Identify the row where the \"municipality\" column is \"magdalena.\"\n   - Check the value in the \"population (2010)\" column for this row.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Compare the extracted population value against the claimed population of 2900.\n   \nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- Magdalena is listed on Row 11.\n- The \"population (2010)\" for Magdalena in Row 11 is 22976.\n\nThe claim states that the population should be 2900, but according to the data, it is actually 22976.
