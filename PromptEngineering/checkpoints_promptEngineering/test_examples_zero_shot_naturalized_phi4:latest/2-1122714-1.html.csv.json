James Hunt completed 73 laps.\n\nWe will identify the relevant cells in the table that correspond to these conditions.\n\n- For condition 1, we look at the \"driver\" and \"grid\" columns for Row 1 because it mentions James Hunt as the driver.\n- For condition 2, again we refer to the \"driver\" and \"laps\" columns for Row 1 to verify if he completed 73 laps.\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n\n1. **Driver: James Hunt**\n   - In Row 1, the driver is listed as \"james hunt.\"\n   \n2. **Grid Position: 2**\n   - In Row 1, under the \"grid\" column, it shows \"2.\"\n\n3. **Laps Completed: 73**\n   - In Row 1, under the \"laps\" column, it shows \"73.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied based on Row 1 of the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
