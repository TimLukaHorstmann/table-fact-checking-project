We need to find a row where the player's name is \"Matan Naor\".\n   \n2. **Club**: According to the claim, Matan Naor should be associated with the club \"Ironi Nahariya\". We need to verify if his current club matches this.\n\n3. **Year Born**: The statement includes that he was born in 1980. Therefore, we need to check if the year of birth for this player is indeed 1980.\n\nLet's break down these checks against each row:\n\n- **Row 9**:\n  - Player: Matan Naor\n  - Height: 1.94\n  - Position: Forward\n  - Year Born: 1980\n  - Current Club: Ironi Nahariya\n\nThe data in Row 9 confirms that the player named Matan Naor is indeed from the club Ironi Nahariya and was born in the year 1980.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the information in Row 9, the claim is verified as TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- \"player\" column with value \"Matan Naor\"\n- \"current club\" column with value \"Ironi Nahariya\"\n- \"year born\" column with value \"1980\"\n\nThese correspond to row index 8 (as indices start from 0) and columns: \"player\", \"current club\", and \"year born\".\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"current club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year born\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
