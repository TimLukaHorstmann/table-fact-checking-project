We will check each player's position to see if anyone else besides John Brill has more than one listed position.\n\nLet's examine the data:\n\n- Row 1: Position is \"center\"\n- Row 2: Position is \"left wing\"\n- Row 3: Position is \"left wing\"\n- Row 4: Position is \"centre\" (note: spelling variation, but considered as single position)\n- Row 5: Position is \"left wing\"\n- Row 6: Position is \"defence\"\n- Row 7: Position is \"left wing\"\n- Row 8: Position is \"defence\"\n- Row 9: Position is \"left wing\"\n- Row 10: Position is \"right wing\"\n- Row 11: Position is \"defence\"\n- Row 12: Position is \"goalie\" (position name spelling variation)\n- Row 13: Position is \"left wing\"\n- Row 14: Position is \"right wing\"\n- Row 15: Position is \"centre\"\n- Row 16: Position is \"left / right wing\" - This player, John Brill, plays two positions.\n- Row 17: Position is \"defence\"\n- Row 18: Position is \"centre\"\n- Row 19: Position is \"defence\"\n- Row 20: Position is \"defence\"\n- Row 21: Position is \"right wing\"\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that only John Brill (Row 16) has two listed positions (\"left / right wing\").

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"50% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male,\" we first need to understand the context and examine each relevant piece of information from the table provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement refers to the gender distribution among players selected in a specific range of picks (43-63) during an NHL draft, presumably in 1989. The claim suggests that 50% of these players are male.\n\n2. **Gender Assumptions**:\n   - Historically and contextually, professional sports like hockey have predominantly been male-dominated leagues.\n   - The NHL, being a major league for men's ice hockey, implies all listed players are male unless stated otherwise.\n\n3. **Relevant Information from the Table**:\n   - Each row in the table represents a player selected between pick numbers 43 and 63.\n   - There are no columns indicating gender; however, given that this is an NHL draft list, it's reasonable to assume all listed players are male based on historical context.\n\n4. **Number of Players**:\n   - The table lists 21 players (from pick 43 to pick 63).\n\n5. **Verification of the Claim**:\n   - Since we are assuming all listed players are male due to the nature of the NHL, 100% of these players are male.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"50% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male\" is incorrect as it underestimates the actual percentage.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Since every row from pick 43 to pick 63 is relevant for verifying the gender assumption, we consider all rows.\n   - The columns related to player information (such as \"player\") are pertinent, but the critical aspect here is the understanding that they are male by context.\n\nThus, the claim is false. Here's the JSON representation of this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
