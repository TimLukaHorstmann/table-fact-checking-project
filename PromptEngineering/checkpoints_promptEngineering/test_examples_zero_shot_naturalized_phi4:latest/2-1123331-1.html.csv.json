    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"hydraulics, drive by damon hill, have a grid number bigger than 1,\" we need to analyze the table data relevant to Damon Hill's performance and his grid position.\n\n1. **Identify the row for Damon Hill:**\n   - From the naturalized format, Damon Hill is in Row 21.\n   \n2. **Check the retirement reason for Damon Hill:**\n   - According to Row 21, Damon Hill retired due to \"hydraulics.\"\n\n3. **Verify Damon Hill's grid number:**\n   - In Row 21, it states that his starting position (grid) was 7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim mentions two conditions:\n     a. Damon Hill drove with a hydraulic failure.\n     b. Damon Hill had a grid number bigger than 1.\n   - Both these conditions are satisfied as Row 21 confirms he retired due to \"hydraulics\" and his grid position was 7, which is indeed greater than 1.\n\nGiven the above analysis, both parts of the claim are true based on the data from Row 21. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
