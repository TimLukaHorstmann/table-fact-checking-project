    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no team score more than 110 points in a game\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and focus on the columns related to team scores.\n\nThe scoring system seems to be such that a score represented as A.B (where A and B are integers) translates into points via the formula: \\( \\text{Total Points} = A \\times 6 + B \\). We will use this method to calculate the total points for each row and check if any team scored more than 110 points.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Fitzroy (home team score): 13.16\n    - Points = \\(13 \\times 6 + 16 = 78 + 16 = 94\\)\n  - University (away team score): 11.7\n    - Points = \\(11 \\times 6 + 7 = 66 + 7 = 73\\)\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Essendon (home team score): 17.17\n    - Points = \\(17 \\times 6 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119\\)\n  - Melbourne (away team score): 8.11\n    - Points = \\(8 \\times 6 + 11 = 48 + 11 = 59\\)\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Collingwood (home team score): 10.10\n    - Points = \\(10 \\times 6 + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70\\)\n  - St Kilda (away team score): 7.9\n    - Points = \\(7 \\times 6 + 9 = 42 + 9 = 51\\)\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - South Melbourne (home team score): 18.12\n    - Points = \\(18 \\times 6 + 12 = 108 + 12 = 120\\)\n  - Richmond (away team score): 4.4\n    - Points = \\(4 \\times 6 + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28\\)\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Geelong (home team score): 5.9\n    - Points = \\(5 \\times 6 + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39\\)\n  - Carlton (away team score): 6.13\n    - Points = \\(6 \\times 6 + 13 = 36 + 13 = 49\\)\n\nFrom this analysis, Essendon scored 119 points and South Melbourne scored 120 points, both of which are more than 110 points.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Row 2: \"home team score\" (Essendon) and \"away team score\" (Melbourne)\n- Row 4: \"home team score\" (South Melbourne) and \"away team score\" (Richmond)\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
