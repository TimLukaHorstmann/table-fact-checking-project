    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"Orlando Magic have a good winning streak in games 35 through 41,\" we need to examine the game results for these specific games from rows 3 to 9 of the table.\n\n**Relevant Table Data:**\n\n- **Row 3 (Game 35):**\n  - Team: Washington\n  - Score: w 89 - 80 (OT) \n  - Record: 27 - 8\n\n- **Row 4 (Game 36):**\n  - Team: Atlanta\n  - Score: w 106 - 102 (OT)\n  - Record: 28 - 8\n\n- **Row 5 (Game 37):**\n  - Team: Atlanta\n  - Score: w 121 - 87 (OT)\n  - Record: 29 - 8\n\n- **Row 6 (Game 38):**\n  - Team: San Antonio\n  - Score: w 105 - 98 (OT)\n  - Record: 30 - 8\n\n- **Row 7 (Game 39):**\n  - Team: Sacramento\n  - Score: w 139 - 107 (OT)\n  - Record: 31 - 8\n\n- **Row 8 (Game 40):**\n  - Team: LA Lakers\n  - Score: w 109 - 103 (OT)\n  - Record: 32 - 8\n\n- **Row 9 (Game 41):**\n  - Team: Denver\n  - Score: w 106 - 88 (OT)\n  - Record: 33 - 8\n\n**Analysis of the Claim:**\n\nThe claim specifies a winning streak, which implies consecutive wins. From row 3 to row 9, the Orlando Magic have won each game, as indicated by the \"w\" in the score column for all these games. Additionally, their record consistently improves without any losses during this period (going from 27-8 after Game 35 to 33-8 after Game 41). This confirms a winning streak over these seven consecutive games.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data, as Orlando Magic won all games from game 35 through game 41 without any losses in between. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about Orlando Magic's scores in games 40 and 45, we need to check two main points from the table:\n\n1. **Highest Point Score in Game 40:**\n   - The claim states that the team scored their highest points in game 40 with a score of \"w 106 - 88 (ot).\" We must determine if this is indeed the highest point total they achieved across all games listed.\n\n2. **Least Amount of Points Scored in Game 45:**\n   - The claim asserts that they scored the least amount of points in game 45 with a final score of \"w 135 - 111 (ot).\" We need to verify if this is indeed the lowest point total for them across all games listed.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows:\n\n- **Game 40:**  \n  - Date: January 16\n  - Team: LA Lakers\n  - Score: w 109 - 103 (OT)\n  - Points scored by Orlando Magic: 109\n\n- **Other Games to Check for Highest Point Total:**\n  - Game 1: 86 points\n  - Game 3: 89 points\n  - Game 4: 106 points\n  - Game 5: 121 points (Highest point total)\n  - Game 6: 105 points\n  - Game 7: 139 points (New highest point total)\n  - Game 8: 109 points\n  - Game 9: 106 points\n  - Game 10: 80 points\n  - Game 11: 97 points\n  - Game 12: 135 points\n  - Game 13: 99 points\n\nFrom this, we see that the highest point total scored by Orlando Magic is in game 7 (139 points), not game 40.\n\n- **Game 45:**  \n  - Date: January 29\n  - Team: Cleveland\n  - Score: w 99 - 88 (OT)\n  - Points scored by Orlando Magic: 99\n\n- **Other Games to Check for Lowest Point Total:**\n  - Game 1: 86 points\n  - Game 2: 102 points\n  - Game 3: 89 points\n  - Game 4: 106 points\n  - Game 5: 121 points\n  - Game 6: 105 points\n  - Game 7: 139 points\n  - Game 8: 109 points\n  - Game 9: 106 points\n  - Game 10: 80 points (Lowest point total)\n  - Game 11: 97 points\n  - Game 12: 135 points\n  - Game 13: 99 points\n\nFrom this, we see that the lowest point total scored by Orlando Magic is in game 10 (80 points), not game 45.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim does not hold true.

A win would be indicated by an 'w' (win) and a loss by an 'l' (loss). The team mentioned in each row will help confirm it's Orlando Magic's game.\n\nLet's check each row for January games:\n\n- **Row 1**: Team: Miami, Score: w 86 - 76 (ot), Record after this game is 26 - 7. This indicates a win.\n- **Row 2**: Team: Toronto, Score: l 102 - 108 (ot), Record after this game is 26 - 8. This indicates a loss.\n- **Row 3**: Team: Washington, Score: w 89 - 80 (ot), Record after this game is 27 - 8. This indicates a win.\n- **Row 4**: Team: Atlanta, Score: w 106 - 102 (ot), Record after this game is 28 - 8.

This indicates a win.\n- **Row 9**: Team: Denver, Score: w 106 - 88 (ot), Record after this game is 33 - 8. This indicates a win.\n- **Row 10**: Team: Boston, Score: l 80 - 90 (ot), Record after this game is 33 - 9. This indicates a loss.\n- **Row 11**: Team: Miami, Score: l 97 - 103 (ot), Record after this game is 33 - 10. This indicates a loss.\n- **Row 12**: Team: Indiana, Score: w 135 - 111 (ot), Record after this game is 34 - 10. This indicates a win.\n- **Row 13**: Team: Cleveland, Score: w 99 - 88 (ot), Record after this game is 35 - 10.
