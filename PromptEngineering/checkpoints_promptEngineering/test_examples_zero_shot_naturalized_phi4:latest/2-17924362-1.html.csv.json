The claim specifically mentions \"the lowest attendance for a DENVER bronco game\" occurring \"at the san diego stadium.\"\n\nFirstly, let's extract relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Denver Broncos' home games**: \n   - Home games are identified by those where the 'game site' is 'mile high stadium.'\n   \n2. **List attendances for these home games**:\n   - Week 1: Attendance = 51858\n   - Week 2: Attendance = 52621\n   - Week 5: Attendance = 52590\n   - Week 7: Attendance = 52505\n   - Week 8: Attendance = 49919\n   - Week 11: Attendance = 44982\n   - Week 13: Attendance = 36860\n\n3. **Identify Denver Broncos' away games**:\n   - All other entries are away games as they have different 'game site' values.\n\n4. **Check the specific claim about attendance at San Diego Stadium**:\n   - The game in Week 9 was played at \"san diego stadium\" with an attendance of 26048.\n\nNow, compare these numbers:\n\n- Among all Denver Broncos home games, the lowest attendance is 36860 (Week 13).\n- At the San Diego Stadium, the attendance for the away game (Week 9) is 26048, which is indeed lower than any home game attendance recorded in the table.\n\nThus, the claim \"the lowest attendance for a DENVER bronco game in 1975 be at the san diego stadium\" is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell with Week 9's 'attendance' value.\n- All cells representing home games (mile high stadium) attendances.\n\nHere\u2019s the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss be 21\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that in 1975, the maximum number of points the Denver Broncos scored in any game they lost was 21.\n\n2. **Relevant Columns for Verification**:\n   - \"result\" column: To determine if a game resulted in a loss (marked by 'l').\n   - \"date\" column: To confirm that the games occurred in the year 1975.\n   - The points scored by the Denver Broncos, which can be inferred from the \"result\" string. For example, in \"w 37 - 33\", the first number represents the Broncos' score.\n\n3. **Filter Games Based on Criteria**:\n   - Identify rows where the result indicates a loss ('l').\n   - Ensure these losses occurred in 1975 by checking if the \"date\" falls within that year (September to December).\n\n4. **Extract and Compare Scores**:\n   - From the filtered games, extract the Broncos' score from the \"result\" column.\n   - Determine the maximum score among these losses.\n\nLet's apply this process to each row:\n\n- **Row 3**: Date: October 5, Result: l 14 - 38. This is a loss in 1975 with 14 points scored.\n- **Row 4**: Date: October 12, Result: l 9 - 20. This is a loss in 1975 with 9 points scored.\n- **Row 6**: Date: October 26, Result: l 13 - 26. This is a loss in 1975 with 13 points scored.\n- **Row 7**: Date: November 26, Result: l 17 - 42. This is a loss in 1975 with 17 points scored.\n- **Row 8**: Date: November 9, Result: l 16 - 17. This is a loss in 1975 with 16 points scored.\n- **Row 10**: Date: November 23, Result: l 21 - 35. This is a loss in 1975 with 21 points scored.\n- **Row 12**: Date: December 8, Result: l 10 - 17. This is a loss in 1975 with 10 points scored.\n\nAmong these losses, the highest score by the Broncos was 21 points (in Row 10).\n\nThus, the claim is true because the maximum points scored by the Denver Broncos in any loss during 1975 is indeed 21.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, without explicit mention in the table, we cannot confirm this definitively based solely on the data provided.\n\n3. **Finishing the Season**: The claim states \"finish the season with a win\". To verify this, we need to check if the last game of the season listed is a win for the Denver Broncos.\n   - Row 14 shows a game played on December 20 against the Miami Dolphins with a result of \"l 13 - 14\" (loss).
