    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must verify two main conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. Identify episodes with US viewership of exactly 5.7 million.\n2. Check if there are indeed four such episodes that correspond to the titles mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet's examine these steps using the table data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Episodes with 5.7 Million Viewers\nWe need to check each row for US viewers (million) equal to 5.7 and note down the corresponding episode details, particularly the title.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Row 1**: \"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\" has 5.7 million viewers.\n- **Row 7**: \"they shoot gilmores , don't they?\" has 5.7 million viewers.\n- **Row 8**: \"let the games begin\" has 5.7 million viewers.\n- **Row 16**: \"the big one\" has 5.7 million viewers.\n\nThese four episodes match exactly with those mentioned in the claim and all have 5.7 million viewers each.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify Titles\nCheck that these episodes' titles match the ones listed in the claim:\n\n- \"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\"\n- \"they shoot gilmores , don't they?\"\n- \"let the games begin\"\n- \"the big one\"\n\nAll four episode titles from the table correspond precisely to those mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe conditions of the claim are fully satisfied: there are four episodes with exactly 5.7 million viewers, and their titles match those specified.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n\n- **Row 1**: \"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\", column \"US viewers (million)\"\n- **Row 7**: \"they shoot gilmores , don't they?\", column \"US viewers (million)\"\n- **Row 8**: \"let the games begin\", column \"US viewers (million)\"\n- **Row 16**: \"the big one\", column \"US viewers (million)\"\n\nThus, based on this verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
