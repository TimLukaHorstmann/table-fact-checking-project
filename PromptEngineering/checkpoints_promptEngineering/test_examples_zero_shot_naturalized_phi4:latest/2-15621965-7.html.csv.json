For this claim to be true, both players must have overlapping tenure in Orlando during these specific years (2001, 2002, and 2003).\n\n- **Gordan Giri\u010dek:** His presence overlaps only with the year 2003.\n- **Drew Gooden:** Similarly, his presence overlaps only with the year 2003.\n\nNeither player was present for the entire span of 2001 to 2003; they were both in Orlando only starting from 2003. Therefore, the claim that they \"be both in Orlando from 2001 - 2003\" is false because neither player covered all three years within this range.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Gordan Giri\u010dek: \n  - Row 5, Column: Years in Orlando\n- For Drew Gooden: \n  - Row 6, Column: Years in Orlando\n\nThe JSON object reflecting the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
