The weight categories in the table (naturalized format) are:\n\n- Row 1: Finweight (-54 kg)\n- Row 2: Flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Row 3: Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Row 4: Lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Row 5: Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nThe lightest weight class mentioned in the table is \"Finweight,\" which corresponds to competitors weighing up to -54 kg. This means that athletes in this category weigh 54 kg or less, as they are competing at or below the 54 kg limit.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim against this information:\n\n- The claim states \"the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilograms.\"\n- The Finweight category allows competitors up to 54 kg.\n- Therefore, it is possible for competitors in the Finweight class to weigh exactly 54 kg or less.\n\nThus, the statement that the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilograms is false because there are competitors who weigh up to and possibly exactly 54 kilograms (in the Finweight category).\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 1: Event (-54 kg)\n- Additional events confirm higher weight limits but do not affect this conclusion.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The welterweight category is exactly at 80 kg, which means Sultan Kassymov competes at this weight limit.\n\nSince Sultan Kassymov's event is at 80 kg and not under it, the statement \"the heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kilograms\" is false.

Calculate the mean weight:\n   - Sum of weights = -54 + -58 + -63 + -74 + -80\n   - Total number of events (competitors) = 5\n\n3. Compute the sum:\n   \\[\n   -54 + (-58) + (-63) + (-74) + (-80) = -329\n   \\]\n\n4.
