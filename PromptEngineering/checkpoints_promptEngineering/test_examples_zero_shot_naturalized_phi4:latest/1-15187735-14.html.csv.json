    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the specific details provided in it against the corresponding data from the table.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- The claim states: \"segment c for netflix s07e05 show as sandwich s cookie.\"\n\nFrom this statement:\n1. We need to find row 5 of the given table because it corresponds to \"series ep: 14 - 05\", which is labeled as \"netflix: s07e05\".\n2. In that row, we are specifically interested in the value under the column \"segment c\".\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n- Locate row 5 of the table:\n  - Row 5 details: series ep: 14 - 05, episode: 174, netflix: s07e05, segment a: s surfboard, segment b: s sticker, segment c: sandwich s cookie, segment d: concrete roofing s tile.\n  \n- Check the value for \"segment c\" in row 5:\n  - The table shows that \"segment c\" is indeed \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\nSince this information from the table supports the claim completely, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For verification, we used the following cell:\n  - Row index: 4 (since indexing starts at 0, row 5 corresponds to index 4)\n  - Column name: \"segment c\"\n\nThus, the JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"segment c\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
