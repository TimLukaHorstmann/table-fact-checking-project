    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the power plant located at Ramakkalmedu having a total capacity of 25 MWE (MegaWatt Electric), we need to examine the relevant information in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Ramakkalmedu\" as the location, so we need to find this specific entry within the table.\n   - We also need to check if the \"total capacity (mwe)\" for this plant is indeed 25 MWE.\n\n2. **Search the Table:**\n   - Go through each row in the table and look for entries where the \"location\" column matches \"Ramakkalmedu.\"\n\n3. **Verification from the Table:**\n   - In Row 4, we have:\n     - Power Plant: ramakkalmedu\n     - Producer: subhash ltd\n     - Location: ramakkalmedu\n     - State: kerala\n     - Total Capacity (mwe): 25.0\n\n4. **Conclusion from the Data:**\n   - The entry in Row 4 matches both the location \"Ramakkalmedu\" and states that the total capacity is 25 MWE.\n   - Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For verification of the truth of the claim, we need the cells corresponding to the \"location\" and \"total capacity (mwe)\" from Row 4.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.
