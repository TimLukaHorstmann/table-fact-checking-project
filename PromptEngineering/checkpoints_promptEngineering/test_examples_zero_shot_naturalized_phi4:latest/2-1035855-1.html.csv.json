    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if Bethlehem Steel FC was a champion without playoffs for nine years according to the table provided.\n\n### Breakdown of Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that Bethlehem Steel FC won the championship \"with no playoff\" in 9 different years.\n\n2. **Analyzing Table Columns**:\n   - We need to focus on two columns: `reg season` and `playoffs`.\n   - A year where Bethlehem Steel FC is a champion with no playoffs can be identified by either:\n     - The `playoffs` column indicating \"champion (no playoff)\".\n     - The `reg season` column showing a high rank such as 1st, paired with the `playoffs` column stating \"no playoff\".\n\n3. **Reviewing Each Relevant Row**:\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Year: 1912 / 13\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Year: 1913 / 14\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Year: 1914 / 15\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Year: 1915 / 16\n     - Reg Season: 2nd, but Playoffs: No playoff, Challenge Cup: Champion.\n     - Conclusion: Does not meet the specific criteria of \"champion with no playoff\".\n\n   - **Row 8**: \n     - Year: 1918 / 19\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n   - **Row 9**:\n     - Year: 1919 / 20\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n   - **Row 10**: \n     - Year: 1920 / 21\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n   - **Row 12**:\n     - Year: 1922 / 23\n     - Reg Season: 2nd, but Playoffs: No playoff.\n     - Conclusion: Does not meet the specific criteria of \"champion with no playoff\".\n\n   - **Row 15**: \n     - Year: 1925 / 26\n     - Challenge Cup: Champion, but not specified as league champion.\n     - Conclusion: Does not clearly state \"league champion\", so does not count.\n\n   - **Row 16**:\n     - Year: 1926 / 27\n     - Playoffs: Champion (no playoff)\n     - Conclusion: Meets criteria.\n\n4. **Count of Relevant Years**: \n   - The relevant years where Bethlehem Steel FC was a champion with no playoffs are from Rows 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 16.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Bethlehem Steel FC belong to 3 different leagues over the years\" is true or false, we need to examine the 'league' column for each row in the table. The task requires us to identify all unique league names that Bethlehem Steel FC was a part of during these years.\n\n1. **Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 1**: League = \"aafba\"\n   - **Row 2**: League = \"aafba\"\n   - **Row 3**: League = \"aafba\"\n   - **Row 4**: League = \"alafc\"\n   - **Row 5**: League = \"alp\"\n   - **Row 6**: League = \"n/a\" (not considered as a valid league name)\n   - **Row 7**: League = \"nafbl\"\n   - **Row 8**: League = \"nafbl\"\n   - **Row 9**: League = \"nafbl\"\n   - **Row 10**: League = \"nafbl\"\n   - **Rows 11-12**: Refer to Philadelphia Field Club (not Bethlehem Steel FC, so irrelevant)\n   - **Row 13**: League = \"asl\"\n   - **Row 14**: League = \"asl\"\n   - **Row 15**: League = \"asl\"\n   - **Row 16**: League = \"asl\"\n   - **Row 17**: League = \"asl\"\n   - **Row 18**: League = \"n/a\" (withdrew)\n   - **Rows 19-20**: League = \"esl\"\n   - **Row 21**: League = \"acl (asl)\" (considered as a subcategory of \"asl\", so it's the same league)\n\n2. **Identifying Unique Leagues**:\n   - From the rows, the unique leagues identified are: \"aafba\", \"alafc\", \"alp\", \"nafbl\", \"asl\", and \"esl\".\n   - Bethlehem Steel FC is associated with six different leagues over these years.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that Bethlehem Steel FC belonged to 3 different leagues, but our analysis shows they were part of at least 6.\n   - Thus, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - We need to list all rows where the league information is provided (excluding references like \"see philadelphia field club\").\n\nHere's the JSON object with the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
