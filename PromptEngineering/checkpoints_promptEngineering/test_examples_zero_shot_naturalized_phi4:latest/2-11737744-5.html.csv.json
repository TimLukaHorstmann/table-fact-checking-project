    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"she be 6 and 10 in win loss during this open,\" we need to understand what it implies. The phrase \"6 and 10 in win-loss\" suggests a record of 6 wins and 10 losses over some period or specific tournaments.\n\nFirst, let's break down what information from the table is relevant:\n\n1. **Yearly Win-Loss Records:** We need to check if there are any years where her win-loss record is exactly 6-10.\n2. **Career Win-Loss Record:** The career total should also be checked for this specific win-loss record.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 5 provides the yearly win-loss records from 2007 to 2012 and the cumulative career win-loss record.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Yearly columns (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) in row 5.\n- The \"Career win - loss\" entry in row 5 to check if it ever matches 6-10.\n\nNow, let's examine these relevant cells:\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - 2007: 1 - 1\n  - 2008: 0 - 1\n  - 2009: 1 - 2\n  - 2010: 1 - 3\n  - 2011: 0 - 1\n  - 2012: 1 - 1\n  - Career win - loss: 4 - 12\n\nNone of the yearly records match a 6-10 record, and the career record is 4-12. Therefore, the claim that she has a \"6 and 10 in win-loss during this open\" is not supported by any data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
