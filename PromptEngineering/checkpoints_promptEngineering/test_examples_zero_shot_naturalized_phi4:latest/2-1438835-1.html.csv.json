Since \"4 - 1\" is higher than \"3 - 1\", this condition of the claim is satisfied.\n\n2. **\"The lowest away score be 0 - 0 on 2 occasions\":**\n   - We need to check all rows and count how many times an away score of \"0 - 0\" appears.\n   - Relevant rows are:\n     - Row 1: Away = 0 - 0\n     - Row 2: Away = 0 - 0\n\n   The \"0 - 0\" away score occurs in both Row 1 and Row 2, which satisfies the condition of occurring on two occasions.\n\n3. **\"In the 1995 - 96 season and the 2001 - 02 season\":**\n   - We need to ensure that all occurrences of \"0 - 0\" as an away score are indeed in these seasons.\n   - The relevant rows for this part are Row 1 (for 1995-96) and Rows 2, 3, 4 (for 2001-02), which have already been checked.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nWe need to identify relevant cells that were used to verify each part of the claim:\n\n- For the highest away score in 2001-02:\n  - Row 2: Away (0 - 0)\n  - Row 3: Away (4 - 1)\n  - Row 4: Away (0 - 1)\n\n- For the lowest away score of \"0 - 0\" on two occasions:\n  - Row 1: Away (0 - 0)\n  - Row 2: Away (0 - 0)\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
