    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the opponent be the yankee when the record be 4 - 5,\" we need to identify entries in the table where the team's record is specifically \"4 - 5\" and check which opponent they played against at that point.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant columns:\n\n1. **Record Column**: We are looking for rows where the record column value is \"4 - 5\".\n2. **Opponent Column**: Once we find the row with a record of \"4 - 5\", we will check the corresponding opponent in that same row to verify if it's \"yankee\".\n\nLet\u2019s go through the table:\n\n- Row 9 has a record of \"4 - 5\" and the opponent is \"yankees\".\n  \nThis matches our condition perfectly. Therefore, when the team had a record of \"4 - 5\", they were indeed playing against the Yankees.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is verified to be true.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Record is 4 - 5**: We must find a row in the table where the record is exactly \"4 - 5\".\n2. **Opponent and Date**: For the same row found above, check if the opponent is \"yankees\" on \"april 11\".\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- Row 9 has the following details:\n  - date: april 12\n  - record: 4 - 5\n\nThe record of \"4 - 5\" matches with row 9, but the date is April 12, not April 11. Therefore, this does not fulfill both conditions.\n\nNext, let's check Row 8:\n\n- Row 8 has the following details:\n  - date: april 11\n  - opponent: yankees\n  - record: 4 - 4\n\nRow 8 has the correct date and opponent but does not have a record of \"4 - 5\". Therefore, this row also does not fulfill both conditions.\n\nSince there is no single row in which both conditions (record being \"4 - 5\" and opponent being \"yankees\" on April 11) are satisfied simultaneously, we conclude that the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are from Rows 8 and 9:\n\n- Row 8: date, opponent, record\n- Row 9: date, record\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
