This satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\n### Checking Condition 2: \"be from the United State\"\n\n- **Row Index:** 0\n- **Column Name:** `country`\n\nAgain in Row 1, for the player Scott Hoch, the country is listed as United States.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Scott Hoch with a score under 66 be not from the United States,\" we need to check two conditions regarding Scott Hoch's record in the table:\n\n1. Whether Scott Hoch's score is under 66.\n2. Whether he is associated with the United States as his country.\n\nLet's go through the relevant information for each row that mentions Scott Hoch:\n\n- **Row 1** provides details about Scott Hoch:\n  - **Player**: scott hoch\n  - **Country**: united states\n  - **Score**: 66\n\nFrom this data, we can observe:\n- Scott Hoch's score is 66, which is not under 66.\n  \nTherefore, the condition of having a score \"under 66\" is not met by Scott Hoch. Since the claim specifies that for a player with a score under 66 to be from a different country than the United States, and since Scott Hoch does not meet the score criteria, we do not need to check his nationality further in this context.\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE** because there's no instance of Scott Hoch having a score under 66 that would violate the condition stated in the claim. \n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row 1: \"player\", which identifies the player as Scott Hoch.\n- Row 1: \"score\", which shows his score (66).\n- Row 1: \"country\", to confirm he is from the United States.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cell details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
