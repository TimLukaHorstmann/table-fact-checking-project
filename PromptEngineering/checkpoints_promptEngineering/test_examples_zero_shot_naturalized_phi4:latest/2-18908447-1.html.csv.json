This occurs in Row 4.\n\n2. **Condition: Pick after round 2 but before pick 183**\n   - From Row 4, we have:\n     - Round: 7\n     - Pick: 158\n   - We need to verify if this round and pick number satisfy \"after round 2\" and \"before pick 183\":\n     - \"After round 2\": Round 7 is indeed after Round 2.\n     - \"Before pick 183\": Pick 158 is before Pick 183.\n\n3. **Condition: Plays tight end position**\n   - From Row 4, we have:\n     - Position: tight end\n\nAll parts of the claim are satisfied by the information in Row 4.
