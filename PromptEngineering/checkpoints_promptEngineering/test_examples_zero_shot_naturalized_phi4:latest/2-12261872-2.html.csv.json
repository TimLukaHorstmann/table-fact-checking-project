    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must first understand what is being claimed and then verify it against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"only 2 rider lead stone classification in the 1945 Giro d'Italia.\"\n\nThis implies that there were only two different riders who led the Stone (mountains) Classification during the course of the event. However, we are given a table from a naturalized dataset for an unspecified edition of the Giro d'Italia.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"mountains classification\" column in each row since it indicates who leads the mountains classification at that stage.\n   \n2. **Count Unique Riders Leading Mountains Classification**:\n   - Traverse through each row, extract the rider(s) leading the mountains classification, and track how many unique riders appear across all stages.\n\n3. **Check the Table Data**: \n   - Row 1: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 2: giuseppe guerini\n   - Row 3: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 4: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 5: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 6: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 7: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 8: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 9: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 10: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 11: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 12: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 13: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 14: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 15: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 16: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 17: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 18: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 19: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 20: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 21: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 22: mariano piccoli\n   - Row 23: mariano piccoli\n\n4. **Determine Unique Riders**:\n   - From the table, the unique riders leading the mountains classification are \"giuseppe guerini\" and \"mariano piccoli.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim mentions two different leaders in the stone (mountains) classification, which matches our finding of two unique riders from the data.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table as there are indeed only 2 riders who lead the mountains classification at any stage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
