    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Number of Floors:** The building named \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building\" should have 31 floors.\n2. **Years as Tallest:** The same building should have been the tallest from the years 1970 - 1973.\n\nLet's break down each part:\n\n- From Row 2, we find:\n  - Name: \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building\"\n  - Floors: 31\n  - Years as Tallest: 1970 - 1973\n\nChecking the relevant conditions against this row:\n- The number of floors is indeed 31.\n- The years during which it was the tallest are exactly from 1970 to 1973.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim match perfectly with the data provided in Row 2. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table and can be considered TRUE.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells used for verification:\n\n1. The \"floors\" column in Row 2.\n2. The \"years as tallest\" column in Row 2.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be no building with less than 196 feet\" is true or false, we need to examine each row in the provided table for the column labeled \"feet.\" Specifically, we will verify if all entries under this column have a value of at least 196 feet.\n\nLet's review the relevant data:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Carlton Centre - 732 feet\n2. **Row 2**: Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1 / Trust Bank Building - 459 feet\n3. **Row 3**: Standard Bank Building - 455 feet\n4. **Row 4**: Schlesinger Building - 361 feet\n5. **Row 5**: Naspers Centre - 205 feet\n6. **Row 6**: Mutual Heights Building - 298 feet\n7. **Row 7**: Chamber of Mines Building - 262 feet\n8. **Row 8**: Union Buildings - 196 feet\n\nUpon reviewing the \"feet\" column, we find that all buildings have a height of at least 196 feet except for Row 5 (Naspers Centre), which has a height of only 205 feet. While 205 is greater than 196 and does not contradict the claim, it's important to note this discrepancy if there was any misunderstanding about potential values.\n\nThe minimum requirement specified by the claim is met because all values are equal to or exceed 196 feet. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"feet\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, according to Row 1 of the table, the city associated with the Carlton Centre is Johannesburg.\n\n3. **Floors Check**: The claim mentions that this building has 50 floors. According to Row 1 of the table, the \"carlton centre\" does indeed have 50 floors.\n\nThe critical contradiction here lies in the location: the Carlton Centre is located in Johannesburg, not Cape Town as claimed. Therefore, the entire claim is false because one essential part (the city) does not match the information from the table.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n\n- From Row 1:\n  - \"name\" matches with \"carlton centre.\"\n  - \"city\" should be Johannesburg, but the claim incorrectly states Cape Town.\n  - \"floors\" is correctly stated as 50 in both the claim and the table.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting the determination of the claim's truthfulness is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
