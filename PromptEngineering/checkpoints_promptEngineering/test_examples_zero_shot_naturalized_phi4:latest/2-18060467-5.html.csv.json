    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to check if Jay Haas is the only player with a total score of 141 in the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"the only player with a total score of 141 be jay haas.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify all players whose scores are listed as totaling 141:\n\n- Row 9: Mark Calcavecchia has a score of 74 + 67 = 141.\n- Row 10: Jay Haas has a score of 71 + 70 = 141.\n- Row 11: Davis Love III has a score of 70 + 71 = 141.\n- Row 12: Tom Watson has a score of 71 + 70 = 141.\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that there are four players with a total score of 141. Therefore, Jay Haas is not the only player with that score. The claim is false because multiple players (Mark Calcavecchia, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson) share the same total score as Jay Haas.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- For Jay Haas: Row 10, Column \"score\" shows his score of 141.\n- For Mark Calcavecchia: Row 9, Column \"score\" shows his score of 141.\n- For Davis Love III: Row 11, Column \"score\" shows his score of 141.\n- For Tom Watson: Row 12, Column \"score\" shows his score of 141.\n\nThese cells confirm that Jay Haas is not the only player with a total score of 141.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
