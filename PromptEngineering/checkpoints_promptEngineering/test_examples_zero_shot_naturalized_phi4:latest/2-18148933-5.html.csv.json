    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Frost be from United State\" is true or false, we need to check the relevant information about David Frost in the provided table.\n\nThe claim suggests that David Frost should be from the United States. Let's identify which cells in the table are necessary for verifying this claim:\n\n1. **Player**: We need to find the row corresponding to \"David Frost.\"\n2. **Country**: For that specific player, we must verify the country listed.\n\nNow, let's locate and examine these relevant details:\n\n- **Row 3** corresponds to David Frost.\n- In Row 3, under the column \"country,\" it is specified as \"south africa.\"\n\nBased on this information:\n- The claim states David Frost should be from the United States.\n- However, the table indicates he is from South Africa.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Row index is adjusted to be zero-based as typical in data processing.\n- The \"player\" cell confirms we are looking at the correct player, David Frost.\n- The \"country\" cell provides the information needed to verify his nationality.",
