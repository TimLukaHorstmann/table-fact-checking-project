    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"there be only 1 match in the 2008 belarusian premier league with the agg of 4 - 1,\" we need to analyze the table and focus on the 'agg' (aggregate) column, checking for matches that have an aggregate score of 4-1. Since the table is related to various football tournaments rather than specifically listing matches from the 2008 Belarusian Premier League, we should concentrate on identifying any relevant match results across all rows.\n\nHere's how we approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Aggregate Score 4 - 1**:\n   - We need to find any row where the 'agg' column equals \"4 - 1\".\n\n2. **Verify Specific Tournament Context**:\n   - The claim specifies that it should be a match from the \"2008 Belarusian Premier League.\" However, the table is about matches in UEFA competitions rather than domestic league games.\n\n3. **Check Each Row for Aggregate Score**:\n   - We review each row's 'agg' column to see if there are any entries with \"4 - 1\".\n\nLet's evaluate the relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 5**: The aggregate score is \"4 - 1\" between Legia Warszawa and Gomel.\n  \nNo other rows have an aggregate score of \"4 - 1\". \n\n**Conclusion on Context**:\nThe table does not mention any matches from the 2008 Belarusian Premier League, as it focuses on UEFA competitions. Therefore, even though there is one match with an aggregate score of 4-1 (Row 5), it doesn't pertain to the Belarusian Premier League.\n\nBased on this analysis, since no matches in the provided table are from the 2008 Belarusian Premier League, the claim cannot be verified as true within the context given by the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we must analyze each part of it in relation to the given table:\n\n1. **\"In the first qualifying round of the 2008 - 09 UEFA Champions League\"**: \n   - The table lists different rounds and stages of various competitions, including a \"first qualifying round.\" This round is not specifically for the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League but rather the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup. We need to verify if any team named \"valor\" (or similar) appears in this context.\n\n2. **\"Valor be able to win and then proceed to 3 more qualifying rounds\"**:\n   - To support this claim, we would expect to see a team named \"valor\" advancing through multiple qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League.\n   - We will check if there is any mention of a team called \"valur\" or similar in the table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 8**: \n  - It mentions a \"first qualifying round\" where \"bate borisov\" won against \"valur\" with an aggregate score of 3 - 0. This row is partially relevant as it involves \"valur,\" though not in the Champions League context.\n\n- **Rows 9, 10, and 11**:\n  - These rows describe subsequent rounds where \"bate borisov\" competes against different teams (anderlecht, levski sofia, real madrid) in the UEFA Champions League. \"Valur\" is not mentioned in these rounds.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n- **No mention of \"valor\" or similar advancing through multiple qualifying rounds of the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League**.\n- The only appearance of a team similar to \"valor\" (\"valur\") is in the first qualifying round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup, not the Champions League.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
