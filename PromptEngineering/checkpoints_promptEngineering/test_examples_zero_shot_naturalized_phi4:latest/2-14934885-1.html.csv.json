We will identify which dates and performers are relevant based on these criteria.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Dates:**\n   - The claim specifies \"before January 9, 1988.\" Therefore, we consider episodes with dates strictly earlier than January 9, 1988.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 has a date of February 2, 1988 (after January 9, 1988), so it is not relevant.\n     - Row 2 has a date of January 9, 1988. Since we need dates before this date, it is not considered.\n     - Row 3 has a date of January 16, 1988 (after January 9, 1988), so it is not relevant.\n\n   From the table's data, there are no episodes dated strictly before January 9, 1988. Thus, we have zero rows that fit this condition.\n\n2. **Examine Performers for Relevant Rows:**\n   - Given there are no rows with dates before January 9, 1988, there are no performers to check against the claim.\n\n3. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"Hugh Laurie was the 3rd performer\" before a specific date.\n   - Since there are no episodes dated before January 9, 1988, it is impossible for Hugh Laurie or any other performer to be listed as the 3rd performer in such an episode.\n\nThus, based on our analysis, the claim cannot be true because there are no episodes with dates prior to January 9, 1988. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells would only include those rows that have dates before January 9, 1988, but since none exist, no specific performer information needs to be considered.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
