Verify if Daniel Shirley and John Gordon indeed appear together in men's doubles more than once.\n2. Ensure no other individual in any men's doubles partnership appears with different partners more than once.\n\nLet's analyze the table by checking each row where men's doubles are mentioned:\n\n- **Row 5 (1994)**: Michael Helber, Michael Keck  \n- **Row 6 (1995)**: He Tim Chan, Siu Kwong  \n- **Row 7 (1996)**: Ma Che Kong, Chow Kin Man  \n- **Row 8 (1997)**: Ma Che Kong, Liu Kwok Wa  \n- **Row 9 (1998)**: Daniel Shirley, Dean Galt  \n- **Row 10 (2000)**: Daniel Shirley, John Gordon  \n- **Row 11 (2002)**: Daniel Shirley, John Gordon  \n- **Row 12 (2003)**: Ashley Brehaut, Travis Denney  \n- **Row 13 (2004)**: Suichi Nakao, Suichi Sakamoto  \n- **Row 14 (2005)**: Boyd Cooper, Travis Denney  \n- **Row 15 (2006)**: Eng Hian, Rian Sukmawan  \n- **Row 16 (2007)**: Chan Chong Ming, Hoon Thien How  \n- **Row 17 (2008)**: Chen Hung-Ling, Lin Yu-Lang  \n- **Row 18 (2009)**: Ruseph Kumar Sanave Thomas  \n- **Row 19 (2013)**: Angga Pratama, Rian Agung Saputro  \n\nNow, let's see how many times each individual appears in men's doubles across different partnerships:\n\n1. **Daniel Shirley**: Appears with Dean Galt (1998) and John Gordon (2000, 2002).\n2. **John Gordon**: Appears with Daniel Shirley (2000, 2002).\n\nThese are the only two partners who appear more than once together or individually in different partnerships.\n\nChecking for other individuals:\n\n- Michael Helber: Only appears with Michael Keck.\n- Michael Keck: Only appears with Michael Helber.\n- He Tim Chan: Only appears with Siu Kwong.\n- Siu Kwong: Only appears with He Tim Chan.\n- Ma Che Kong: Appears twice (1996, 1997) but both times different partners.\n- Chow Kin Man: Only appears with He Tim Chan.\n- Liu Kwok Wa: Only appears with Ma Che Kong.\n- Eng Hian: Only appears with Rian Sukmawan.\n- Rian Sukmawan: Only appears with Eng Hian.\n- Others appear only once or not more than once.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Daniel Shirley and John Gordon be the only men's double partner to appear more than 1 time\" is true.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"daniel shirley john gordon win the men 's double event 4 time as a team,\" we need to check the table for instances where Daniel Shirley and John Gordon appear together in the Men's Doubles category.\n\nLet's examine each row relevant to the Men's Doubles:\n\n- **Row 10 (Year: 2000):** \n  - Men's doubles: daniel shirley, john gordon\n- **Row 11 (Year: 2002):**\n  - Men's doubles: daniel shirley, john gordon\n\nFor Rows 10 and 11, Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are listed as a team. We need to find two more instances where they win together.\n\nContinuing the examination:\n\n- **Row 9 (Year: 1998):**\n  - Men's doubles: daniel shirley, dean galt\n- **Row 12 (Year: 2003):**\n  - Men's doubles: ashley brehaut, travis denney\n\nIn these rows, Daniel Shirley is listed but not with John Gordon.\n\n- **Row 8 (Year: 1997):**\n  - Men's doubles: ma che kong, liu kwok wa\n- **Row 13 (Year: 2004):**\n  - Men's doubles: suichi nakao, suichi sakamoto\n\nAgain, Daniel Shirley is not listed with John Gordon.\n\nAfter checking all relevant rows, we find that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon win the Men's Doubles event together only twice (in years 2000 and 2002).
