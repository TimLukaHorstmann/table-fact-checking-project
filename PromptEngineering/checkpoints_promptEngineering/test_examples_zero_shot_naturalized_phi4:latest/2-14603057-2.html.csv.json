According to the table format, each row corresponds to a specific school year with rows starting from 1988-89 onwards:\n   - School Year 1990-91 is in Row 3\n   - Therefore, School Year 2004-05 will be in Row 16.\n\n2. **Check Class A for Row 16:**\n   We need to check the value under \"Class a\" (capital 'A') for Row 16.
