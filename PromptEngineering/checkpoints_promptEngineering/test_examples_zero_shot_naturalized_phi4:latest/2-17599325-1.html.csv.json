There is exactly one race in July.\n3. There is exactly one race in October.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant condition using the data from the table:\n\n### Check for races in January:\n- **Row 1**: Date is \"27 january\", which indicates a race occurred in January.\n\nThere is only one race listed in January, so this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Check for races in July:\nReview all rows to see if any have dates in July. None of the rows have dates in July:\n\n- Row 2: February\n- Row 3: March\n- Row 4: April\n- Row 5: June\n- Row 6: August\n- Row 7: October\n- Row 8: November\n- Row 9: December\n\nThere are no races listed for July, so this condition is not satisfied.\n\n### Check for races in October:\n- **Row 7**: Date is \"23 october\", which indicates a race occurred in October.\n\nThere is only one race listed in October, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nSince the claim requires exactly one race in each of January, July, and October, but there are no races listed in July, the claim does not hold true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are:\n- Row 1 for January.\n- Rows without any July dates (all rows).\n- Row 7 for October.\n\nThus, the JSON object should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
