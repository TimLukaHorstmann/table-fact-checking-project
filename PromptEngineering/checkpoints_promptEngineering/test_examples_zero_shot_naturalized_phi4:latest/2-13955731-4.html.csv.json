The key pieces of information are:\n- **Date:** To determine when each game occurred.\n- **Opponent:** To check the opponent for games mentioned (specifically on June 8).\n- **Attendance:** To find which game had the highest attendance.\n\nWe'll go through each row, checking these columns:\n\n1. Rows with dates ranging from June 2 to June 30 are relevant because they encompass all the games in June.\n2. We need to specifically check if any game against the Brewers occurred on June 8 and compare its attendance with other games' attendances.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the table row by row:\n- **Row 1 (June 2):** Opponent is Cardinals, Attendance is 41685\n- **Row 2 (June 3):** Opponent is Cardinals, Attendance is 48252\n- **Row 3 (June 4):** Opponent is Cardinals, Attendance is 44594\n- **Row 4 (June 5):** Opponent is Brewers, Attendance is 13749\n- **Row 5 (June 6):** Opponent is Brewers, Attendance is 24595\n- **Row 6 (June 7):** Opponent is Brewers, Attendance is 15518\n- **Row 7 (June 8):** Opponent is Red Sox, Attendance is 31438\n\nFrom Row 7, we observe that the opponent on June 8 was not the Brewers but rather the Red Sox. Thus, the initial part of the claim regarding the opponent is incorrect.\n\nNext, to verify if June 8 had the highest attendance:\n- The highest attendance in the table is **48252** from Row 2 (June 3 against the Cardinals).\n\nSince the game on June 8 does not involve the Brewers and does not have the highest attendance, we can determine that the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify this are related to:\n- Date\n- Opponent\n- Attendance\n\nSpecifically:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object reflects that the claim is false and highlights which cells were examined to make this determination.",
