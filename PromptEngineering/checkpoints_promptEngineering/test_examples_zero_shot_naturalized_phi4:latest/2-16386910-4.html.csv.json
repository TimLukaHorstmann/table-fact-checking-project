    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each game involving the San Antonio Spurs as either visitors or at home before December 19, 1976, and check if they scored less than 100 points in any of those games.\n\nThe relevant rows for this period are:\n- Row 1: Visitor score = 116\n- Row 2: Visitor score = 105\n- Row 3: Visitor score = 98\n- Row 4: Home score = 106\n- Row 5: Home score = 120\n- Row 6: Home score = 121\n- Row 7: Home score = 111\n- Row 8: Visitor score = 102\n- Row 9: Visitor score = 101\n- Row 10: Visitor score = 105\n\nFrom these rows, we find that in Row 3, the San Antonio Spurs scored 98 points as visitors against the Phoenix Suns on December 5, 1976. This is less than 100 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.
