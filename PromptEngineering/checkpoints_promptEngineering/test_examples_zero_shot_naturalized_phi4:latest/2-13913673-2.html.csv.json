    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to analyze the relevant cells in the table concerning game postponements and rescheduling details.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"out of the whole season just 1 game be postpone, which be the april 23 match against the royal.\"\n\n### Relevant Conditions to Verify:\n1. **Number of Postponed Games**: The claim asserts that only one game was postponed for the entire season.\n2. **Specific Game Details**: The postponed game is specified as being on April 23 against the Royals.\n\n### Steps to Validate:\n\n1. **Identify Postponed Games**:\n   - We need to find any games marked with \"postponed\" in their score, loss, attendance, and record columns.\n   \n2. **Verify Specific Game Details**:\n   - Check if there is a game on April 23 against the Royals that was postponed.\n\n### Examination of Relevant Rows:\n\n- **Row 21**: This row details an event on April 23 against the Royals with entries marked as \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for april 24\" across the score, loss, attendance, and record columns. \n  - `date`: April 23\n  - `opponent`: royals\n  - The entire row is marked as postponed.\n\n- **Row 22**: This represents the rescheduled game originally set for April 23.\n  - It has a new date entry as April 24 with details of the match that took place on this day.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Number of Postponed Games**: \n  - Only one row (Row 21) is marked as postponed, which aligns with the claim's assertion about just one game being postponed.\n  \n- **Specific Game Details**:\n  - The details in Row 21 match the specifics given in the claim: a postponed game on April 23 against the Royals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table supports the claim that only one game was postponed, and it correctly identifies this game as occurring on April 23 against the Royals.

This score is the lowest among all games listed in the table.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Score for April 27 Against the Yankees\n\n- **Row 27**: The date is April 27, opponent is the Yankees, and the score is 1 - 0. This matches the claim.\n\n### Step 2: Determine if this is the Lowest Scoring Game\n\nTo determine if the game on April 27 is the lowest scoring game, we need to compare its total runs with all other games in the table:\n\n- Calculate the total runs for each game (sum of both teams' scores) and identify the minimum.\n\nHere are the relevant calculations for a few rows to illustrate the process:\n\n- **Row 1**: Score is 10 - 8. Total runs = 18.\n- **Row 2**: Score is 7 - 2. Total runs = 9.\n- ...\n- **Row 27**: Score is 1 - 0. Total runs = 1.\n\nContinue this process for all rows:\n\n- The lowest total runs found is indeed 1, which occurs on April 27 against the Yankees (Row 27).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we must analyze relevant data points from the table regarding attendance figures for games against the Yankees on April 29 and compare them to other entries.\n\n1. **Identify Attendance Figures:**\n   - The claim concerns a game on April 29 against the Yankees with an alleged highest attendance of 41,872.\n   - We'll extract the attendance numbers for all games listed in the table, focusing initially on the row corresponding to April 29.\n\n2. **Check Date and Opponent:**\n   - Locate the entry where the date is April 29. According to the table:\n     - Row 28 has the date April 29, with an opponent of Mariners.\n   - Attendance for this game is recorded as 13,827.\n\n3. **Verify the Claimed Game Details:**\n   - The claim states that on April 29 against the Yankees, the attendance was 41,872.\n   - However, there is no entry in the table for a game on April 29 against the Yankees; instead, it records a game against the Mariners with significantly lower attendance.\n\n4. **Find Maximum Attendance:**\n   - Scan all entries to find the highest attendance value:\n     - The maximum attendance recorded is 41,872, which corresponds to the game on March 31 (Row 1).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there's no entry for an April 29 Yankees game with the claimed attendance, and the actual highest attendance occurred on March 31 against another team, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are those pertaining to attendance figures for all games, specifically checking Row 1 for the highest value and confirming Row 28's details regarding date, opponent, and attendance:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
