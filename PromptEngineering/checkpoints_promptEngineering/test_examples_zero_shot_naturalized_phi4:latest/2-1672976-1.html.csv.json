    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to focus on two main points: \n\n1. The number of institutions listed in the table.\n2. Whether these institutions participate in the Big Ten Challenge.\n\nThe claim states that there are \"over 15 institution[s] that play in the Big Ten Challenge.\" First, let's count the number of institutions:\n\n- The table lists institutions from Row 1 to Row 16 (excluding the overall summary row at the bottom). This gives us a total of 16 different institutions.\n\nNext, we need to assess whether these institutions are part of the Big Ten Challenge. The Big Ten Challenge is an annual college basketball event that traditionally involves teams from the Big Ten Conference and other schools. From the list of institutions given:\n\n- Boston College Eagles\n- Clemson Tigers\n- Duke Blue Devils\n- Florida State Seminoles\n- Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\n- Maryland Terrapins\n- Miami Hurricanes\n- North Carolina Tar Heels\n- NC State Wolfpack\n- Notre Dame Fighting Irish\n- Pittsburgh Panthers (misspelled as \"Pitt\" in the table)\n- Syracuse Orange\n- Virginia Cavaliers\n- Virginia Tech Hokies\n- Wake Forest Demon Deacons\n\nNone of these teams are part of the Big Ten Conference. Additionally, none of them participate in the Big Ten Challenge, which is specifically for teams within or allied with the Big Ten.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are \"over 15 institutions that play in the Big Ten Challenge\" is false because:\n\n- No institution listed participates in the Big Ten Challenge.\n- Even if they did, there aren't over 15 of them participating since none do.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim concern the list of institutions and their conference affiliations (though not explicitly provided here). Since all necessary information can be deduced from the known conferences of these teams, we only need to verify the count of institutions:\n\n- Row indices from 1 to 16 contain institution names that are not part of the Big Ten Challenge.\n\nThus, the claim is false. Here's the JSON output reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"institution\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The list provided doesn't specify which schools belong to the Big Ten Conference. Therefore, we must assume either the table does not include any Big Ten teams or it needs cross-referencing with external data.\n2. **Teams with Zero Wins**: From the table, institutions that have zero wins are:\n   - Notre Dame Fighting Irish\n   - Pitt Panthers\n   - Syracuse Orange\n\nThese three teams indeed have no wins recorded in the table.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n- Identify rows where `wins` is 0.\n- Check if these teams belong to the Big Ten Conference (not specified here).\n  \nSince we don't have information on which schools are part of the Big Ten, and given that only those with zero wins were listed without any explicit affiliation mentioned in the table, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim based solely on this data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout additional context linking these teams to the Big Ten Conference, we can only verify they have zero wins. The claim requires specific affiliation information which is not provided in the table itself. \n\nTherefore, assuming the institutions with zero wins are from the Big Ten as per the claim's requirement without external verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes no external data about the Big Ten affiliation is considered since it's not available in the table itself.",
