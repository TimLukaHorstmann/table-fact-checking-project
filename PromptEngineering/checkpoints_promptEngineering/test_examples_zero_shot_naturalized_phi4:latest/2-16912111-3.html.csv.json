A week later, they lose to the Eskimos by a score of 36 - 22 on the road.\n\n**Steps for Verification:**\n- Identify all games involving Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos in the table.\n- Check if there is a game where Calgary defeats Edmonton with a score of 30 - 24 at home.\n- Verify if this victory was followed by a loss to Edmonton on the road one week later, with the score 36 - 22.\n\n**Relevant Rows from the Table:**\n1. **Week 14**: \n   - Opponent: Edmonton Eskimos\n   - Score: 30 - 23 (Calgary Stampeders win)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Attendance: 29794 (suggesting it might be a home game)\n\n2. **Week 15**:\n   - Opponent: Edmonton Eskimos\n   - Score: 36 - 22 (Calgary Stampeders loss)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Attendance: 40453 (indicating an away game due to higher attendance, typical for road games against large venues like Edmonton's)\n\n**Analysis of the Claim Against Table Data:**\n- In Week 14, Calgary defeated Edmonton 30 - 23 at home.\n- The next week (Week 15), Calgary lost to Edmonton 36 - 22 on the road.\n\n**Comparison with the Claim:**\n- Score in the claim for the win is 30 - 24; however, the table shows it as 30 - 23.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table provided, we must verify two specific conditions:\n\n1. **Attendance for the game on October 18 at Calgary Stampeders:** The claim states that \"30110 fans attended.\" We need to check Row 17 where:\n   - Week: 17\n   - Date: Oct 18\n   - Opponent: Calgary Stampeders\n   - Attendance: 30110\n\n2. **Attendance for the game on October 26 at Montreal Alouettes:** The claim states that \"20102 fans attended.\" We need to check Row 19 where:\n   - Week: 19\n   - Date: Oct 26\n   - Opponent: Montreal Alouettes\n   - Attendance: 20202\n\nNow, let's analyze these relevant cells:\n\n- For October 18 against the Calgary Stampeders, the attendance in Row 17 is indeed **30110**, which matches the claim.\n  \n- For October 26 against the Montreal Alouettes, the claim states that attendance was \"20102,\" but according to Row 19, the actual attendance was **20202**. This does not match the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (the attendance number for the game on October 26), the overall claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are those pertaining to the 'Attendance' in Rows 17 and 19.
