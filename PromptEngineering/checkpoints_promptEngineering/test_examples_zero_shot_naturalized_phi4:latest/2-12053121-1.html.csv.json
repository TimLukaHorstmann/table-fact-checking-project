    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate it against each relevant row in the table and verify all conditions:\n\n1. **Identify ships built in or after 1978**: The claim states \"most recent year build\" which implies that among qualifying rows, one with the latest build year should be identified.\n\n2. **Filter by years of service more recent than 2003**: Among those ships, we need to further filter down to those whose year of entry into service is after 2003.\n\n3. **Filter by knots less than 27**: Finally, among the remaining options from step 2, select those with a speed (knots) less than 27.\n\nLet's evaluate each row against these conditions:\n\n- Row 1: Built 1974 - Does not meet condition 1.\n- Row 2: Built 1981 - Meets condition 1. Entered service 1981 - Fails condition 2.\n- Row 3: Built 1969 - Fails condition 1.\n- Row 4: Built 1974 - Fails condition 1.\n- Row 5: Built 1976 - Fails condition 1.\n- **Row 6**: Built 1966 - Fails condition 1.\n- **Row 7**: Built 1975 - Fails condition 1.\n- **Row 8**: Built 1974 - Fails condition 1.\n- **Row 9**: Built 1975 - Fails condition 1.\n- **Row 10**: Built 1976 - Fails condition 1.\n- **Row 11**: Built 2002 - Meets condition 1. Entered service 2007 - Meets condition 2. Knots 30 - Fails condition 3.\n- **Row 12**: Built 2005 - Meets conditions 1 and 2 (entered service 2005). Knots 29 - Fails condition 3.\n- **Row 13**: Built 2001 - Meets condition 1. Entered service 2001 - Fails condition 2.\n- **Row 14**:\n  - Built 1978 - This is the most recent year of build that meets condition 1 among those who qualify for later checks.\n  - Entered service 2010 - Meets condition 2 (after 2003).\n  - Knots 21 - Meets condition 3.\n\nRow 14, with a build year of 1978 and satisfying all other conditions, is the only row that meets all criteria.
