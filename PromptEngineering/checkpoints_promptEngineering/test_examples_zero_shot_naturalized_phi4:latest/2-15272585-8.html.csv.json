    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we must evaluate each row in the table and identify whether Galina Voskoboeva played a total of three matches on a hard tennis court surface (either \"hard\" or \"hard (i)\"). We will focus specifically on the columns related to the outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - Surface: Hard (i) \u2014 This is a hard surface match.\n   - Outcome: Runner-up\n   - Score: 6-4, 4-6, 4-6 \u2014 Three sets were played.\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - Surface: Hard (i) \u2014 This is also a hard surface match.\n   - Outcome: Winner\n   - Score: 6-4, 6-2 \u2014 Two sets were played.\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - Surface: Clay \u2014 This is not a hard surface match, so it does not count towards the claim.\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - Surface: Hard \u2014 This is a hard surface match.\n   - Outcome: Runner-up\n   - Score: 6-7, 4-6 \u2014 Two sets were played.\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - Surface: Clay \u2014 Again, this is not a hard surface match.\n\n### Calculation:\nNow let's calculate the total number of games played on hard surfaces:\n\n- **Row 1:** Three sets mean \\(3 \\times (6 + 4) + (4 + 6) + (4 + 6) = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30\\) games.\n- **Row 2:** Two sets mean \\(6 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 18\\) games.\n- **Row 4:** Two sets mean \\(7 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 23\\) games.\n\nAdding these up, the total number of games played on hard surfaces is \\(30 + 18 + 23 = 71\\) games. \n\nThe claim states that she played a \"total of 3 game[s]\" on a hard court, which implies only three individual matches or sets were involved. However, she participated in five sets (three in Row 1 and two each in Rows 2 and 4) totaling 71 games, not just three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for determining this are related to the surface type and the scores of the matches on hard surfaces:\n\n- **Row 1:** Surface (hard (i)), Score\n- **Row 2:** Surface (hard (i)), Score\n- **Row 4:** Surface (hard), Score\n\nHere is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if Galina Voskoboeva played against any opponent more than once across all recorded matches in the table, except possibly on 6 June 2006.\n\nHere's how we can analyze each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Opponent: Matea Mezak\n   - We'll check if \"Matea Mezak\" appears again as an opponent in other rows.\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Opponent: Oleksandra Kravets\n   - Check for any other occurrence of \"Oleksandra Kravets.\"\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Opponent: Roberta Vinci\n   - Check if \"Roberta Vinci\" appears again.\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - Opponent: Lilia Osterloh\n   - Check for any other occurrence of \"Lilia Osterloh.\"\n\n5. **Row 5**:\n   - Opponent: Alice Canepa\n   - This match is dated 6 June 2006, where the claim allows a possible exception.\n\nNow, let's summarize our findings:\n\n- **Matea Mezak**: Only appears in Row 1.\n- **Oleksandra Kravets**: Only appears in Row 2.\n- **Roberta Vinci**: Only appears in Row 3.\n- **Lilia Osterloh**: Only appears in Row 4.\n- **Alice Canepa**: Appears only in Row 5.\n\nSince none of the opponents appear more than once, except for the allowed exception on 6 June 2006 (Row 5), the claim holds true.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
