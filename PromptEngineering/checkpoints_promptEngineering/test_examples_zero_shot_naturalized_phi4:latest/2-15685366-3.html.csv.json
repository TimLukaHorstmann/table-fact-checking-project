    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check the win percentages and losses for all seasons in the table provided. The claim states that a win percentage of 0.72 is the highest when there are exactly 22 losses.\n\n1. **Understanding Win Percentage Calculation:**\n   - Win percentage is calculated as `wins / (wins + losses)`.\n   - To find the win percentage with exactly 22 losses, we need to identify rows where the number of losses equals 22 and then calculate their respective win percentages.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - We will go through each row in the table and check for the condition `losses = 22`.\n   - For each qualifying row, compute the win percentage using the formula above.\n   - Identify if any of these calculated win percentages exceed 0.72.\n\n3. **Checking Each Relevant Row:**\n\n   - **Row 47 (Season 2017-18):** \n     - Losses = 21\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 48 (Season 2018-19):**\n     - Wins = 42, Losses = 30\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 49 (Season 2019-20):**\n     - Wins = 52, Losses = 19\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 50 (Season 2020-21):**\n     - Wins = 42, Losses = 30\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 51 (Season 2021-22):**\n     - Wins = 33, Losses = 49\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 52 (Season 2022-23):**\n     - Wins = 27, Losses = 55\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n4. **Finding Rows with 22 Losses:**\n\n   - **Row 29 (1996-97):** \n     - Wins = 40, Losses = 42\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 32 (1998-99):**\n     - Wins = 27, Losses = 23\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 37 (2004-05):** \n     - Wins = 62, Losses = 20\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 38 (2005-06):**\n     - Wins = 54, Losses = 28\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 39 (2006-07):** \n     - Wins = 61, Losses = 21\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 40 (2007-08):**\n     - Wins = 55, Losses = 27\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 41 (2008-09):** \n     - Wins = 46, Losses = 36\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 42 (2009-10):**\n     - Wins = 54, Losses = 28\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 43 (2010-11):** \n     - Wins = 40, Losses = 42\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 47 (2017-18):**\n     - Wins = 48, Losses = 34\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n   - **Row 48 (2018-19):**\n     - Wins = 42, Losses = 30\n     - Not relevant since losses are not 22.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   After checking all rows, there is no row with exactly 22 losses in the provided data set. Therefore, it is impossible for a win percentage of 0.72 to be associated with 22 losses because such a scenario does not exist in the table.\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as true since the condition (losses = 22) never occurs in the dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
