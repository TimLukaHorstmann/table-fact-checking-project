    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to check each part of the claim against the relevant data.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Closest Match**: The claim states that the closest match of the day was separated by only 4 points.\n2. **Teams and Scores**:\n   - Home team: Richmond with a score of 11.14 (80).\n   - Away team: Collingwood with a score of 13.4 (82).\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Identify Match Differences**: \n   - Calculate the point differences for each match in the table.\n     - Row 1: Geelong vs North Melbourne -> |172 - 97| = 75\n     - Row 2: Fitzroy vs Melbourne -> |107 - 88| = 19\n     - Row 3: South Melbourne vs St Kilda -> |94 - 69| = 25\n     - Row 4: Hawthorn vs Footscray -> |90 - 85| = 5\n     - Row 5: Richmond vs Collingwood -> |82 - 80| = 2\n     - Row 6: Essendon vs Carlton -> |140 - 78| = 62\n\n   The smallest difference is in **Row 5** with a point difference of 2.\n\n2. **Check Teams and Scores**:\n   - In Row 5, the home team (Richmond) scored 11.14 (80).\n   - The away team (Collingwood) scored 13.4 (82).\n\n3. **Match Point Difference in Claim**:\n   - The claim states a difference of 4 points.\n   - However, the actual point difference is 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe closest match was indeed between Richmond and Collingwood, but the point difference was 2, not 4 as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.
