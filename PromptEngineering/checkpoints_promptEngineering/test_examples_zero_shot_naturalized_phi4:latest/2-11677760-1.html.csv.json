    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"JR Reid be a player in the year 1985 - 1986,\" we need to check if JR Reid is listed as a player for that specific year within the given table.\n\nThe relevant information from the table includes:\n- The \"Year\" column, which specifies the time period each row represents.\n- The \"Player\" column, which lists the name of the basketball player associated with that year.\n\nWe must identify whether there's an entry where both the year is 1985 - 1986 and the player is JR Reid. \n\nFrom examining the table:\n1. In Row 6 (0-indexed), we have the following relevant information: \n   - \"Year\" column lists \"1985 - 1986\"\n   - \"Player\" column lists \"JR Reid\"\n\nThis row supports the claim that JR Reid was a player in the year 1985 - 1986. \n\nNo other rows match both conditions, and therefore, this is sufficient to support the claim.\n\nThus, based on the table data, the answer to the claim is TRUE.
