Jerzy Janowicz is the only opponent against whom \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin was a runner-up.\n\nLet's check these conditions against the provided table data:\n\n### Checking Each Row:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Roko Karanu\u0161i\u0107\n  - This row is not relevant as it does not involve \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin being a runner-up.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Karol Beck\n  - This row is also irrelevant for the same reason as above.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Outcome: Runner-Up\n  - Opponent: Jerzy Janowicz\n  - Date: 12 September 2010\n  - Tournament: Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France\n  - This row confirms that \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin was a runner-up against Jerzy Janowicz.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Matthias Bachinger\n  - This row is not relevant as it does not involve \u00c9douard being a runner-up.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment\n  - Again, this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n1.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games,\" we need to analyze each row of the table in relation to this statement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim suggests that Vasselin had a challenging match (\"fought hard\") and won all five matches listed in the table.\n   - \"Fought hard\" can be interpreted as having difficult matches, which might involve close scores or multiple sets where the opponent was competitive.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Outcome: Winner\n     - Score: 6-4, 6-4\n     - The match went to two straight sets with scores of 6-4 both times, suggesting it wasn't particularly difficult.\n   \n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Outcome: Winner\n     - Score: 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 1-0, ret.\n     - This match went to three sets with the opponent retiring in the third set after losing a first set and winning the second. The initial set was close, indicating some level of difficulty.\n\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Outcome: Runner-up\n     - Score: 6-3, 6-7 (8-10), 6-7 (6-8)\n     - Vasselin lost this match, so it doesn't support the claim that he won all five games.\n\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Outcome: Winner\n     - Score: 7-6 (11-9), 4-6, 6-1\n     - The first set was close and went to a tiebreak, suggesting it was competitive. However, Vasselin won the match.\n\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Outcome: Winner\n     - Score: 6-4, 6-3\n     - This match went to two straight sets with scores of 6-4 and 6-3, indicating a less challenging win.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Vasselin did not win all five matches; he lost one (Row 3).\n   - The claim that he \"fought hard\" can be supported by some matches being competitive (Rows 2 and 4), but not for all.\n   - Since the statement requires winning all five games, which is not true, the overall claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
