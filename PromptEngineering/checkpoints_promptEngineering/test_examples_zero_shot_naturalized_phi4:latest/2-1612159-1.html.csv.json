The entry is \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny.\"\n\nThe claim states \"protasov lyuti talalayev baldachny,\" which matches part of the full entry in Row 21, but it omits some names (\"lyutyi,\" \"balakhnin,\" and \"baidachny\").

The entry is \"13.\"\n\nThis condition matches exactly with the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe position condition is satisfied, but the head coach condition is not fully accurate due to missing names in the claim.
