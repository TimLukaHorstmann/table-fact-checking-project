Boston's record after this game.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **March 8 Game Outcome**:\n   - The relevant row is Row 4 with the date \"march 8\".\n   - According to the table, the score for the Washington vs. Boston game on March 8 was \"1 - 2\", indicating that Boston won.\n\n2. **Boston's Record After March 8 Game**:\n   - Before checking the record of Boston, we need to understand how records are updated.\n   - The table shows Washington's record after each game, but not Boston's directly.\n   - Row 4 indicates Washington\u2019s record was \"32 - 29 - 8\" after losing to Boston on March 8. This implies that:\n     - Before the game, Washington had a record of \"32 - 28 - 8\".\n     - A loss increases the number of losses by one.\n\n3. **Calculate Boston's Record**:\n   - We need to infer Boston's record from the information given about Washington.\n   - Before the March 8 game, Washington\u2019s record was \"32 - 28 - 8\". After losing to Boston on March 8, their record became \"32 - 29 - 8\".\n   - This means Boston won this game, so they gained one win.\n\n4. **Determine Boston's Record**:\n   - We need additional information about Boston\u2019s record before the March 8 game.\n   - However, based on Washington\u2019s records alone, we can infer that Boston's wins increased by one after March 8.\n   - From Row 2 (March 3), Washington won against Boston with a score of \"10 - 2\". At this point, Washington's record was \"31 - 28 - 8\".\n   - After the March 3 game, Boston\u2019s record would have been \"31 - X - Y\" (where X and Y are losses and ties respectively).\n   - By March 8, after winning against Washington, Boston's wins increased by one. Thus, if we assume no other games were played between these dates that affected their win count directly from the table, Boston\u2019s record would be \"32 - X - Y\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states Boston had a record of \"32 - 29 - 8\" after March 8.\n   - Given Washington's record changes and assuming no other wins/losses/ties for Boston between March 3 and March 8, Boston\u2019s record would indeed be \"32 - 29 - 8\".\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
