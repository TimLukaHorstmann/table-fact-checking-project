No other player should have a higher runs scored value than 13,589.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Check Ricky Ponting's runs scored.\n  - From Row 1: The runs scored by Ricky Ponting is indeed 13,589.\n\n- **Condition 2**: Verify if any other player has more runs than Ricky Ponting.\n  - We need to compare Ricky Ponting's runs (13,589) with the \"runs scored\" of all other players in subsequent rows:\n    - Adam Gilchrist: 9,595\n    - Mark Waugh: 8,500\n    - Steve Waugh: 7,569\n    - Michael Clarke: 7,375\n    - Michael Bevan: 6,912\n    - Allan Border: 6,524\n    - Matthew Hayden: 6,131\n    - Dean Jones: 6,068\n    - David Boon: 5,964\n    - Michael Hussey: 5,442\n    - Damien Martyn: 5,346\n    - Andrew Symonds: 5,088\n    - Shane Watson: 4,796\n    - Geoff Marsh: 4,357\n    - Mark Taylor: 3,514\n    - Darren Lehmann: 3,078\n\nAll the other players have run scores less than Ricky Ponting's 13,589.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Condition 1 is satisfied as Ricky Ponting scored 13,589 runs.\n- Condition 2 is also satisfied since no other player has a higher run score than 13,589.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the most run score be 13589 by ricky ponting\" is TRUE.
