Let's identify the relevant cells based on these checks:\n\n- The \"player\" column should have \"larry wright\".\n- The \"position\" column should have \"center\".\n- The \"nationality\" column should have \"canada\".\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n- Row 1, Column: player\n- Row 1, Column: position\n- Row 1, Column: nationality\n\nSince all conditions in the claim match the data from Row 1 of the table, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding \"round 2 will have a defensive player from estevan bruin (wchl),\" we need to examine the table data for any mention or implication about round 2.\n\nThe table provided has only one row per player selection, and it lists players selected in rounds 1 through 8. There is no information given for round 2 in this table; it starts with round 1 and skips directly to round 3. Therefore, there are no relevant data cells pertaining to a selection or any details about the players in round 2.\n\nThe claim specifies two conditions:\n1. The player must be selected in \"round 2.\"\n2. The player must play \"defense\" for \"estevan bruin (wchl).\"\n\nSince the table does not contain any entries for round 2, there is no information available to verify either condition of the claim. Consequently, we cannot find a defensive player from Estevan Bruins (WCHL) in round 2 because that round simply doesn't exist within this dataset.\n\nGiven this absence of data:\n- The answer is \"FALSE\" because the conditions are not supported by any entry for round 2.\n- There are no relevant cells to consider, as the table does not include information about a player selected in round 2.\n\nHere's the corresponding JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
