Footscray's victory condition:\n   - Check if Footscray is the away team with a higher score than Hawthorn.\n   - Verify that their winning margin (Footscray's score minus Hawthorn's score) is less than 70 points.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant part of the table:\n\n**Row 5:**\n- Home Team: St Kilda, Score: 10.12 (72)\n- Away Team: North Melbourne, Score: 9.24 (78)\n\nHere, North Melbourne won against St Kilda. Calculate their winning margin:\n- Winning Margin = 78 - 72 = 6 points\n\nSince 6 is less than 70, the condition for North Melbourne is satisfied.\n\n**Row 6:**\n- Home Team: Hawthorn, Score: 10.9 (69)\n- Away Team: Footscray, Score: 11.12 (78)\n\nHere, Footscray won against Hawthorn. Calculate their winning margin:\n- Winning Margin = 78 - 69 = 9 points\n\nSince 9 is less than 70, the condition for Footscray is satisfied.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are met; therefore, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify these conditions are:\n\n- Row 5: Away Team Score (Footnote: North Melbourne's score)\n- Row 5: Home Team Score (Footnote: St Kilda's score)\n- Row 6: Away Team Score (Footnote: Footscray's score)\n- Row 6: Home Team Score (Footnote: Hawthorn's score)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
