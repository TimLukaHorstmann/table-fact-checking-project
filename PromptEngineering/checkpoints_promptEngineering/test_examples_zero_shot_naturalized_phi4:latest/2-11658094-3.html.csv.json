    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"the location that be found in 1891 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina\", we need to check two conditions against the table:\n\n1. The institution must have been founded in 1891.\n2. It should have left its conference in 1975.\n\nLet's examine each row of the table for these specific conditions:\n\n- **Row 9:**\n  - Institution: lenoirrhyne university\n  - Location: hickory, north carolina\n  - Founded: 1891\n  - Left: 1975\n\nThis row matches both conditions:\n- The institution was founded in 1891.\n- It left its conference in 1975.\n\nNo other rows match both of these specific criteria. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data given in Row 9.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to dissect and verify each part against the provided table:\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n1. The institution must be a former private member.\n2. It was founded in 1839.\n3. It left its association in 1975.\n4. Its location is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Founded in 1839:** We look for institutions with this founding year. According to Row 10 (Longwood University), founded: 1839; however, its type is public.\n  \n- **Former private member:** This condition requires a check across all rows to identify private institutions that have left an association at some point.\n\n- **Left in 1975:** We examine the \"left\" column for entries marked as 1975. Several institutions match this criterion:\n  - Row 3: Catawba College\n  - Row 6: Elon University\n  - Row 9: Lenoir-Rhyne University\n  - Row 18: Wingate University\n\n- **Location is Hickory, North Carolina:** This can be verified by checking the \"location\" column for entries that match this city and state. According to Row 9 (Lenoir-Rhyne University), location: Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nNow we combine these conditions:\n1. Lenoir-Rhyne University is a private institution, fulfilling the former private member condition.\n2. It left an association in 1975, meeting this part of the claim.\n3. Its location is Hickory, North Carolina, satisfying this criterion.\n\nThe founding year for Lenoir-Rhyne University (1891) does not match the year 1839 mentioned in the claim. Therefore, there is no institution that satisfies all parts of the claim simultaneously.\n\nBased on these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
