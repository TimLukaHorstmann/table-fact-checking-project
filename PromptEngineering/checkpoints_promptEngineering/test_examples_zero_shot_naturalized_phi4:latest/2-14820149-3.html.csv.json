However, it lists the class as \"500cc\", not \"250cc\".\n    - Points for this row (year: 1991) are 121.\n  \n  - **For Year 1986**:\n    - From Row 3, the year is 1986 and the class is \"500cc\".\n    - The points here are indeed 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There are no points recorded for a \"250cc\" class in 1991; instead, it was a \"500cc\" class with 121 points.\n- Thus, the first part of the claim (\"8 points for the 1991 250cc class\") is incorrect.\n\nThe second part about the year 1986 having 4 points for the class (interpreted as \"500cc\") is correct based on the table data.\n\nGiven that at least one component of the claim does not hold true according to the table, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1. For the incorrect check in 1991 for \"250cc\" class:  \n   - Row index 7 and Column name \"points\"\n   - Row index 7 and Column name \"class\"\n\n2.

The answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe need to check the rows and columns that contain information about the year, class, and points for the `250cc` category.\n\n- Row 1: year 1984, class 250cc, points 0\n- Row 2: year 1985, class 250cc, points 8\n- Row 4: year 1987, class 250cc, points 46\n- Row 5: year 1988, class 250cc, points 221\n- Row 6: year 1989, class 250cc, points 98\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
