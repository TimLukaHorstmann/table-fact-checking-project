The table confirms this aspect for each player individually; however, it does not specify whether these wins occurred specifically in the year 1995 or over multiple years combined. Thus, while the number of wins matches the claim's description, we cannot confirm from the table alone that all these wins were achieved solely in 1995.\n\nGiven the data provided, we can verify only the number of wins but not their timing (specifically for the year 1995).
