    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"on july 29, sk brann host the champion league (q),\" we need to verify several aspects of the statement using the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The date mentioned in the claim is July 29. We should locate this date within the table and check if it matches any row's \"Date\" column entry.\n   \n2. **Event Type Verification**: The event type specified in the claim is the \"Champions League (q).\" This needs to match what is listed in the \"Tournament\" column for the corresponding date.\n\n3. **Home/Away Status Verification**: The claim asserts that SK Brann is hosting, meaning they are the home team on this particular date. Therefore, we should check if \"SK Brann\" appears in the \"Home Team Name\" column for the relevant row.\n\nLet's perform these verifications step by step:\n\n- First, locate the entry with the date July 29:\n  - The table lists an event on \"Date: july 29,\" which corresponds to \"Row 26.\"\n\n- Check if SK Brann is listed as the home team in this row:\n  - In Row 26, the \"Home Team Name\" column indicates \"SK Brann.\"\n\n- Verify that the tournament type matches \"Champions League (q)\":\n  - In Row 26, the \"Tournament\" column states \"Champions League (q).\"\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by Row 26. Thus, the information confirms that on July 29, SK Brann hosted a match in the Champions League qualifiers.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Home Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
