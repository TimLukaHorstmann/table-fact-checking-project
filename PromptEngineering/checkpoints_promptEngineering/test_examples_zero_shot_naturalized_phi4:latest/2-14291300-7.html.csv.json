We need to find the row where the date is March 13.\n   - From Row 6: `march: 13` matches.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: According to the claim, on March 13, the opponent should be \"Toronto Maple Leafs.\"\n   - From Row 6: `opponent: toronto maple leafs` confirms this part of the claim.\n\n3. **Points Check**: The claim states that the points should be 63.\n   - From Row 6: `points: 63` matches with the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are satisfied by Row 6 in the table:\n\n- Date is March 13.\n- Opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs.\n- Points total 63.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.
