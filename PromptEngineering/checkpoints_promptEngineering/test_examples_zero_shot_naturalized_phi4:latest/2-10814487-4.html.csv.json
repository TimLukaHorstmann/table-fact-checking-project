According to Row 20: \n     - The \"date\" is indeed \"15 / 04 / 07\".\n\n2. **Score Verification**:\n   - For Row 20, we check the \"score\":\n     - The score listed is \"34 - 8\", not \"52 - 22\".\n\n3. **Competition Verification**:\n   - Additionally for Row 20, verify the competition:\n     - The competition is listed as \"Super League XII\", which matches the claim.\n\nSince the score mentioned in the claim (\"52-22\") does not match the actual score recorded on that date (\"34-8\"), we conclude that the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Data Points:\n\n- **Row 20** was relevant to verify all aspects (date, score, and competition):\n  - \"date\": \"15 / 04 / 07\"\n  - \"score\": \"34 - 8\" (does not match the claimed score)\n  - \"competition\": \"Super League XII\"\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
