    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check each part of it against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Score Check**: The score should be \"5 - 4 (ot)\".\n2. **Location and Attendance Check**: The location and attendance must be \"montreal forum\".\n3. **Date Check**: There should be a date after May 10th with these conditions.\n\nLet's go through the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Score is \"4 - 2\", not matching.\n- **Row 2**: Score is \"5-2\", not matching.\n- **Row 3**: Score is \"1 - 2\", not matching.\n- **Row 4**: Score is \"3 - 4\", not matching.\n- **Row 5**: Score is \"5 - 1\", not matching.\n- **Row 6**: Score is \"2 - 5\", not matching.\n- **Row 7**: Score is \"5 - 4 (ot)\", location is \"montreal forum\". However, the date is May 10th, so it does not satisfy the condition of being after May 10.\n\nSince there are no rows with a score of \"5 - 4 (ot)\" and location \"montreal forum\" on a date after May 10, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 7: Score (\"5 - 4 (ot)\"), Location / Attendance (\"montreal forum\"), Date (\"may 10\").\n\nThus, the JSON object would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
