    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Didi Benami sing the song choice Angel before Lean on Me\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. Identify when Didi Benami performed each of these songs:\n   - For \"Angel,\" check which row(s) contain this song choice and if it's associated with a specific contestant.\n   - For \"Lean on Me,\" find the corresponding row where this song was performed.\n\n2. Check the weeks in which these performances took place to determine their order.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Song choice: Angel\n  - Original artist: Sarah McLachlan\n  - Week: Hollywood\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Song choice: Lean on Me\n  - Original artist: Bill Withers\n  - Week: Top 20 (10 women)\n\nThe table does not explicitly mention Didi Benami in relation to any specific song, so we rely on the assumption that she performed both \"Angel\" and \"Lean on Me\" based on the claim.\n\n3. Compare the weeks:\n   - \"Angel\" was performed during the Hollywood week.\n   - \"Lean on Me\" was performed during the Top 20 (10 women) week.\n\nGiven the structure of typical singing competitions, the \"Hollywood\" round occurs before the \"Top 20\" round. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Didi Benami sang \"Angel\" before she sang \"Lean on Me.\"\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the order of weeks in which these songs were performed.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, \"no one be not the last song choice\" means \"no one was the last song choice.\"\n   - We need to verify if \"no one\" was Didi Benami's last song choice.\n\n2. **Relevant Information from the Table:**\n   - We are looking for entries related to Didi Benami and her last performance.\n   - The table does not explicitly mention contestant names, but we can infer based on the sequence of weeks and results.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Row:**\n   - Rows 1-8 show various performances with results as \"advanced\" or \"safe,\" indicating these were not the final performances for any contestant.\n   - Row 9 is the only row where the result is not explicitly stated, but it shows a performance in the \"top 11\" week. This suggests it could be close to a contestant's last performance.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no explicit mentions of Didi Benami or her being eliminated after Row 9, we cannot definitively say that \"no one\" was her last song choice based on the table.\n   - However, since \"no one\" is listed in Row 3 with a result of \"advanced,\" it indicates she performed this song but did not perform it as her last song.\n\n5. **Final Determination:**\n   - The claim \"no one be not the last song choice for didi benami\" translates to \"no one was Didi Benami's last song choice.\"\n   - Since \"no one\" is not listed in Row 9 or any subsequent row as a song choice, it supports the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the available data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
