Both conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this information are found in Row 1 under the column \"Location / Attendance\".\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Game 32 and its points, we need to compare the points listed for each game in the table against the point value claimed for Game 32.\n\n1. **Extract Points for Each Game:**\n   - Game 26: 34 points\n   - Game 27: 36 points\n   - Game 28: 38 points\n   - Game 29: 39 points\n   - Game 30: 41 points\n   - Game 31: 43 points\n   - **Game 32: 45 points** (the game in question)\n   - Game 33: 47 points\n   - Game 34: 49 points\n   - Game 35: 49 points\n   - Game 36: 49 points\n   - Game 37: 51 points\n\n2. **Determine the Highest Number of Points:**\n   - The highest number of points recorded in any game is 51, which occurs in Game 37.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Game 32 has the highest number of points at 45.\n   - However, as determined from the data, Game 37 actually has a higher point value of 51.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a game with more points than Game 32, the claim that Game 32 has the highest number of points is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the \"points\" data across all games.\n   - Specifically, we need to check the \"points\" column for each row (game) to verify this.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the list of relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
