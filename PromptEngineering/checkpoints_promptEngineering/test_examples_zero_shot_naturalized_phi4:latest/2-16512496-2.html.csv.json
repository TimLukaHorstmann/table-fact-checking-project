    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"John Bowe wins fewer races than George Fury but wins more races than Dick Johnson,\" we need to examine the relevant cells from the table for the number of race wins by each mentioned driver.\n\n1. **Identify Wins for Each Driver**:\n   - **John Bowe**: \n     - Row 1: John Bowe is listed as the winner.\n     - Row 4: John Bowe is listed as the winner.\n   - Total Wins = 2\n\n   - **George Fury**:\n     - Row 7: George Fury is listed as the winner.\n   - Total Wins = 1\n\n   - **Dick Johnson**:\n     - Row 2: Dick Johnson is listed as the winner.\n     - Row 3: Dick Johnson is listed as the winner.\n     - Row 5: Dick Johnson is listed as the winner.\n     - Row 6: Dick Johnson is listed as the winner.\n   - Total Wins = 4\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - \"John Bowe wins fewer races than George Fury\": \n     - John Bowe has 2 wins, while George Fury has 1 win. This part of the claim is false because 2 (Bowe) is not less than 1 (Fury).\n   \n   - \"John Bowe wins more races than Dick Johnson\":\n     - John Bowe has 2 wins, and Dick Johnson has 4 wins. This part of the claim is also false because 2 (Bowe) is not greater than 4 (Johnson).\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For John Bowe: Rows 1 and 4 in the \"winner\" column.\n   - For George Fury: Row 7 in the \"winner\" column.\n   - For Dick Johnson: Rows 2, 3, 5, and 6 in the \"winner\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
