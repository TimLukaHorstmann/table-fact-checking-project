    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"among the players in df position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Players in the 'df' Position**: We first filter out all players who are listed with the position 'df'.\n\n2. **Compare League Goals for Each 'df' Player**:\n   - For each player identified as a defender ('df'), extract their number of league goals.\n   \n3. **Determine if Dave Sutton has the Most League Goals**:\n   - Compare Dave Sutton's league goal count to those of other players in the 'df' position to see if it is indeed the highest.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Players in the 'df' Position\n\n- **Row 1**: Jim Branagan, df\n- **Row 5**: Keith Hanvey, df\n- **Row 10**: Bernard Purdie, df\n- **Row 13**: Fred Robinson, df\n- **Row 17**: Dave Sutton, df\n- **Row 18**: Chris Topping, df\n\n### Step 2: Extract League Goals for 'df' Players\n\nFor each of these players:\n- **Jim Branagan** (Row 1): 0 league goals.\n- **Keith Hanvey** (Row 5): 2 league goals.\n- **Bernard Purdie** (Row 10): 0 league goals.\n- **Fred Robinson** (Row 13): 1 league goal.\n- **Dave Sutton** (Row 17): 6 league goals.\n- **Chris Topping** (Row 18): 0 league goals.\n\n### Step 3: Compare League Goals\n\n- Jim Branagan: 0\n- Keith Hanvey: 2\n- Bernard Purdie: 0\n- Fred Robinson: 1\n- Dave Sutton: 6\n- Chris Topping: 0\n\nDave Sutton has the highest number of league goals (6) among all players in the 'df' position.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is supported by the data.

The relevant column for this comparison is \"league goals.\"\n\n1. **Identify Tommy Smith's League Goals:**\n   - Row 14 corresponds to Tommy Smith.\n   - In the \"league goals\" column, Row 14 has a value of 0.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Players' League Goals:**\n   - We need to examine the \"league goals\" for all players in the table and find if any player has more than 0 league goals.\n\n3. **Check Each Player's League Goals:**\n   - Row 1 (Jim Branagan): 0\n   - Row 2 (Malcolm Brown): 2\n   - Row 3 (David Cowling): 10\n   - Row 4 (Peter Fletcher): 17\n   - Row 5 (Keith Hanvey): 2\n   - Row 6 (Peter Hart): 4\n   - Row 7 (Ian Holmes): 3\n   - Row 8 (Steve Kindon): 14\n   - Row 9 (Mick Laverick): 4\n   - Row 10 (Bernard Purdie): 0\n   - Row 11 (Andy Rankin): 0\n   - Row 12 (Ian Robins): 25\n   - Row 13 (Fred Robinson): 1\n   - Row 14 (Tommy Smith): 0\n   - Row 15 (Brian Stanton): 9\n   - Row 16 (Alan Starling): 0\n   - Row 17 (Dave Sutton): 6\n   - Row 18 (Chris Topping): 0\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Tommy Smith's league goals are 0.\n   - Other players have more than 0 league goals, with the highest being Ian Robins at 25.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Tommy Smith does not have the highest number of league goals; in fact, he has none.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
