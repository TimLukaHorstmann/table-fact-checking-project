    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the statement:\n\nClaim: \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests that in a specific year (\"when the record yard be 2249\"), the player \"vanderberg\" had 404 passing attempts while playing for \"iowa\".\n   - The key points to verify are: \n     - There is a year where Vanderberg (implicitly referring to Kyle Kramer, as he was the quarterback known by this nickname) played for Iowa.\n     - In that same year, his attempt count should be 404.\n     - Another specific year has a total passing yardage of 2249.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Table**:\n   - Row 1: Year is 2008; data is \"redshirt,\" indicating no participation.\n   - Row 2: Year 2009, attempts = 87, yards = 470.\n   - Row 3: Year 2010, attempts = 8, yards = 45.\n   - **Row 4**: Year 2011, attempts = 404, yards = 3022.\n   - **Row 5**: Year 2012, attempts = 389, yards = 2249.\n   - Row 6: College totals (irrelevant for this specific verification).\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - In 2011 (Row 4), Vanderberg had 404 passing attempts and the yardage was 3022.\n   - The year with 2249 total yards is 2012 (Row 5).\n   - There is no single year where both conditions (404 attempts and 2249 yards) are met.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim does not hold true because there isn't a year when Vanderberg had both 404 attempts and 2249 passing yards. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
