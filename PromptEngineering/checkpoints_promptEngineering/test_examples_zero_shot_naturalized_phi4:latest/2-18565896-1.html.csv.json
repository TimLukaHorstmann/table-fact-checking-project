Germany has 5 more gold medals than Sweden.\n2. Germany has 3 more silver medals than Sweden.\n\nWe will extract relevant information for these comparisons from the table:\n\n- **Gold Medals**:\n  - Germany's row (Row 4): Germany won 5 gold medals.\n  - Sweden's row (Row 12): Sweden won 0 gold medals.\n\n- **Silver Medals**:\n  - Germany's row (Row 4): Germany won 3 silver medals.\n  - Sweden's row (Row 12): Sweden won 3 silver medals.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each condition:\n\n1. **Gold Medal Comparison**:\n   - Germany: 5 gold medals\n   - Sweden: 0 gold medals\n   - Difference: \\(5 - 0 = 5\\)\n\n   This satisfies the claim that Germany has 5 more gold medals than Sweden.\n\n2. **Silver Medal Comparison**:\n   - Germany: 3 silver medals\n   - Sweden: 3 silver medals\n   - Difference: \\(3 - 3 = 0\\)\n\n   This does not satisfy the claim that Germany has 3 more silver medals than Sweden, as there is no difference in their counts.\n\nSince one of the conditions (the silver medal count) is not met, the entire claim is false. We will identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For gold medals: Rows 4 and 12, column \"gold\"\n- For silver medals: Rows 4 and 12, column \"silver\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, for completeness, let's verify the second part:\n\n- **France (Row 3)**: Gold = 6\n- The next highest after Russia's 8 is indeed France with 6.\n\nDespite France being correctly ranked second in terms of gold medals, the first part of the claim about Russia having the most gold medals is false.
