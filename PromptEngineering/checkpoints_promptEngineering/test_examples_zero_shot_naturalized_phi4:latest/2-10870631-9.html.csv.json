    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Francis II was the spouse of Elisabeth of Bavaria, who is the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies,\" we need to verify two main parts against the provided table:\n\n1. **Was Francis II the spouse of Elisabeth of Bavaria?**\n2. **Is Elisabeth of Bavaria the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies?**\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Check if Francis II was the spouse of Elisabeth of Bavaria.\n- Look at Row 6 for Elisabeth of Bavaria:\n  - Spouse column states \"francis joseph i\" (not Francis II).\n  \n#### Step 2: Verify if Elisabeth of Bavaria is the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.\n- Again, refer to Row 6 for Elisabeth of Bavaria:\n  - Father column states \"maximilian joseph, duke in bavaria.\"\n  - She should be compared with Row 2 which lists Maria Teresa (not Elisabeth) as the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Francis II was not the spouse of Elisabeth of Bavaria; instead, she was married to Francis Joseph I.\n- Elisabeth of Bavaria is not the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Her father is Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria.\n\nBased on these findings, both conditions in the claim are false. Therefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells used for verification from the table are:\n- Row 6, Column: Spouse (for Elisabeth of Bavaria's spouse)\n- Row 6, Column: Father (for Elisabeth of Bavaria's father)\n- Row 2, Column: Name and Father (to check who is actually Ferdinand I\u2019s daughter)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"spouse\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"father\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
