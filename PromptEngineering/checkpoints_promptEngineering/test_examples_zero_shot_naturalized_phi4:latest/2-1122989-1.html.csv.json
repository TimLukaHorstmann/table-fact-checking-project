Identify the column relevant to the claim: The \"laps\" column tells us how many laps each driver completed.\n2. Check the number of laps for Philippe Streiff:\n   - From Row 24, Philippe Streiff completed 0 laps.\n\n3. Compare with other drivers:\n   - We need to check if any other driver has a higher number of laps than 0.\n   - Drivers who finished the race (completed 52 laps) have the highest number of laps. For instance:\n     - Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet from Row 1 and Row 2 completed 52 laps each.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Since drivers like Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet, etc., completed more than 0 laps, Philippe Streiff does not have the highest number of laps.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
