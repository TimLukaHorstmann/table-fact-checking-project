    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding December 21's game between Pittsburgh and Minnesota, we must evaluate each condition within the claim against the table.\n\nThe claim has three conditions:\n1. \"18 point be accumulate on december 21\" - This refers to the points accumulated by Pittsburgh up until and including their game on December 21.\n2. \"when pittsburgh host minnesota\" - This indicates that Pittsburgh was the home team for a game against Minnesota on this date.\n3. \"in front of a crowd of 5307\" - This specifies the attendance at the game.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n1. Points Accumulated: \n   - The claim mentions that Pittsburgh had accumulated 18 points by December 21. According to Row 9, which corresponds to December 21, the record for Pittsburgh is \"6 - 18 - 6\" with 18 points listed. This matches the claim.\n\n2. Host vs. Minnesota:\n   - The claim states that Pittsburgh was hosting a game against Minnesota on December 21. In Row 9, it is indeed shown that on December 21, the home team (host) is Pittsburgh and the visitor is Minnesota, which aligns with the claim.\n\n3. Attendance of 5307:\n   - According to the claim, there should have been an attendance of 5307 for this game. The \"attendance\" column in Row 9 confirms that exactly 5307 people attended the Pittsburgh vs. Minnesota game on December 21.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are verified against the information provided in Row 9 of the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nNote that the row index is 8 because we start counting from zero. Thus, Row 9 in naturalized format corresponds to row index 8 in the JSON object.",
