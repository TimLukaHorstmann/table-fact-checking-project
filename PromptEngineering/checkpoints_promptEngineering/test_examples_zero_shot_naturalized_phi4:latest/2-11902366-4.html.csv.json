    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim that \"a shutout game be when a team do not score at all during a game the new jersey devil lose 3 games this way, score no point,\" we need to analyze each relevant condition in the table:\n\n1. **Definition of a Shutout Game**: A shutout game occurs when one team scores zero points.\n\n2. **New Jersey's Score**: We are specifically looking for instances where New Jersey did not score any points (score is 0 - X).\n\n3. **Game Outcome**: We need to ensure that in each identified shutout game, New Jersey lost the game (since their score would be zero).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: Score: 2 - 3, New Jersey scored 3 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 2**: Score: 1 - 2, New Jersey scored 2 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 3**: Score: 5 - 0, New Jersey scored 0 points and lost. This is a shutout loss.\n- **Row 4**: Score: 1 - 4, New Jersey scored 4 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 5**: Score: 1 - 2, New Jersey scored 2 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 6**: Score: 3 - 2, New Jersey scored 3 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 7**: Score: 4 - 2, New Jersey scored 2 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 8**: Score: 1 - 0, New Jersey scored 0 points and won. This is a shutout win, not a loss.\n- **Row 9**: Score: 6 - 2, New Jersey scored 6 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 10**: Score: 2 - 1, New Jersey scored 2 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 11**: Score: 3 - 0, New Jersey scored 3 points and won. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 12**: Score: 3 - 2, New Jersey scored 3 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 13**: Score: 2 - 4, New Jersey scored 4 points. Not a shutout.\n- **Row 14**: Score: 0 - 4, New Jersey scored 0 points and lost. This is a shutout loss.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- New Jersey had two shutout losses (Rows 3 and 14).\n\nThe claim states that New Jersey lost 3 games by not scoring any points, but we only found 2 such instances.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
