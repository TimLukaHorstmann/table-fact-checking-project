The table includes information about matches played on certain dates, with details like venue, scores, and competitions.\n\nThe claim states: \"Adnan Al Talyani played in the 1984 Gulf Cup half the amount of time as in the 1984 Asian Cup.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**:\n   - The table lists two relevant matches for Adnan Al Talyani:\n     - Two matches from the 1984 Gulf Cup (Row 1 and Row 2).\n     - One match from the 1984 Asian Cup (Row 3).\n\n2. **Analyze Match Participation**:\n   - For both competitions, we assume each listed match is complete (i.e., full match duration), since no specific details about individual player participation or playing time are given.\n   - In football, a standard match has a duration of 90 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Playing Time**:\n   - **1984 Gulf Cup**: \n     - Adnan Al Talyani played in two matches (Row 1 and Row 2).\n     - Total playing time = 2 matches \u00d7 90 minutes each = 180 minutes.\n   \n   - **1984 Asian Cup**:\n     - Adnan Al Talyani played in one match (Row 3).\n     - Total playing time = 1 match \u00d7 90 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that he played half the amount of time at the Gulf Cup compared to the Asian Cup.\n   - From our calculations: \n     - Gulf Cup playing time = 180 minutes\n     - Asian Cup playing time = 90 minutes\n   - This means Adnan Al Talyani actually played twice as much in the Gulf Cup as in the Asian Cup, not half.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE based on the provided data and logical calculations of playing times.\n\n6. **Relevant Rows and Columns**:\n   - The relevant information pertains to the competition column to identify the matches played under each tournament (1984 Gulf Cup and 1984 Asian Cup).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
