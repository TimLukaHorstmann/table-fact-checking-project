    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ann Strother (g) be from Connecticut\" is true or false, we need to examine specific data points in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim pertains to Ann Strother and her association with Connecticut. There are two aspects of this:\n   - Her nationality.\n   - Her college or country/team information.\n\n2. **Locate Ann Strother's Row**:\n   - From the table, Ann Strother is listed in row 5.\n\n3. **Check Relevant Columns for Ann Strother**:\n   - **Nationality**: We need to see if her nationality is Connecticut. However, since a person cannot be from a state as their nationality, this part of the claim does not make sense logically.\n   - **College / Country / Team**: This column indicates where she studied or played basketball, which could be relevant for verifying if she has any connection with Connecticut.\n\n4. **Examine Row 5**:\n   - Nationality: \"United States\" (not Connecticut).\n   - College / Country / Team: \"Connecticut\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim seems to confuse nationality with college affiliation. Ann Strother is not from Connecticut as a nationality, but she attended or played for Connecticut.\n   - Since the claim specifically uses the phrase \"be from Connecticut,\" which implies her place of origin rather than educational background, it does not align with the data.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table and the logical interpretation of the claim, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim about Ann Strother (g), we need to evaluate two conditions:\n\n1. **Nationality and College/Country/Team**: The claim states that \"ann strother (g) player be from connecticut.\" We should verify her nationality and college/country/team information.\n\n2. **Former WNBA Team**: The claim also asserts that she has \"never play on indiana fever.\" We need to check if \"indiana fever\" is listed as a former WNBA team for her.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the table:\n\n- **Row 5** contains the data for Ann Strother:\n  - Pick: 5\n  - Player: ann strother (g)\n  - Nationality: united states\n  - New WNBA Team: atlanta dream\n  - Former WNBA Team: indiana fever\n  - College / Country / Team: connecticut\n\n**Condition 1**: \n- The claim says she is \"from Connecticut.\" In the table, her college/country/team is listed as \"connecticut,\" which supports this part of the claim. However, her nationality is \"united states,\" not specifically \"Connecticut.\"\n\n**Condition 2**: \n- The claim states she has \"never play on indiana fever.\" However, the table lists \"indiana fever\" as her former WNBA team, directly contradicting this part of the claim.\n\nGiven that one condition (Condition 2) is false, the entire claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n- Row 5, Column: Nationality\n- Row 5, Column: College / Country / Team\n- Row 5, Column: Former WNBA Team\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
