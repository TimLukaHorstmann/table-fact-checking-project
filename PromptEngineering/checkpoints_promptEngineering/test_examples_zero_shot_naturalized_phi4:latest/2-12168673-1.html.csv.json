    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The winner in 2012 should be \"blueeyesintherein\".\n2. The owner for the year 2012 should be \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n\nLet's break down these steps using the relevant row and columns in the table:\n\n- **Identify the correct year**: The claim specifies the year as 2012.\n- **Locate the relevant row**: In the table, Row 1 corresponds to the year 2012.\n- **Check the winner for 2012**: Look at the \"winner\" column in Row 1. It should be \"blueeyesintherein\".\n- **Verify the owner for 2012**: Check the \"owner\" column in Row 1. The value should match \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions:\n\n- For Row 1 (year: 2012):\n  - The winner is listed as \"blueeyesintherein\".\n  - The owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in Row 1. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row index: 0 (since indexing starts at 0)\n- Column names: \"winner\" and \"owner\"\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Overbrook Farm and et al own winner Bleeyesintherin after 2009\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine each part of the claim in relation to the data:\n\n1. **Year Verification**: The claim mentions that the event occurs \"after 2009\". We should look at years greater than 2009.\n\n2. **Winner Name**: According to the claim, the winner is \"Bleeyesintherin.\" We need to identify if there's any entry with a similar name in the year after 2009.\n\n3. **Owner Verification**: The claim states that \"Overbrook Farm and et al\" are owners of the horse named Bleeyesintherin. We must verify ownership details for this specific winner.\n\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Year: 2012)**\n  - Winner: Blueeyesintherein\n  - Owner: Self / King / Morgenson / Travis , et al\n\nBlueeyesintherein in Row 1 is similar to the name mentioned in the claim but not an exact match. Additionally, the owners listed do not include Overbrook Farm.\n\n- **Other Rows (Years 2011 and Prior)**\n  - None of these rows have a winner's name that matches \"Bleeyesintherin.\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- There is no winner named Bleeyesintherin in any year after 2009.\n- Blueeyesintherein, although phonetically similar to Bleeyesintherin, has different owners (not including Overbrook Farm).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response with pertinent cell details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe analysis focused on the year after 2009 (specifically Row 1 for 2012) and checked both the winner's name and owner details to verify the claim.",
