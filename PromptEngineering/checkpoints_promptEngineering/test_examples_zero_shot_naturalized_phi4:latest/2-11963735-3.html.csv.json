    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two main parts: \n\n1. **Game Outcome**: The Trail Blazers losing to the Nuggets.\n2. **Record Change**: The Nuggets' record becoming 6 - 3 after this game.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 8** corresponds to the game between the Nuggets (home team) and the Trail Blazers (visitor).\n  - **Score**: 93 - 110, indicating that the Trail Blazers won.\n  - **Leading Scorer for Nuggets**: Carmelo Anthony with 25 points.\n  - **Attendance**: 13,289\n  - **Record after this game**: 6 - 3\n\nThe claim states that \"the trail blazer lose to the home team,\" which contradicts the score in Row 8 where the Trail Blazers won. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nFor completeness, let's verify the second part:\n\n- The record listed as 6 - 3 after this game is correct according to Row 8.\n\nSince the first condition (Trail Blazers losing) is not met, the entire claim is false.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
