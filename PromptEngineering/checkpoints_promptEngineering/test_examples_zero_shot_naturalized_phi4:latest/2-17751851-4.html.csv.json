    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the specific details mentioned in it against the provided table.\n\n**Claim:** \"The score in Gillingham's home game on 21 January 1982 be 0 - 1.\"\n\nLet's break down and check each part of this claim:\n\n1. **Team Involvement:**\n   - The claim specifies that the team involved is Gillingham.\n   \n2. **Home Game:**\n   - The claim mentions it as a home game for Gillingham.\n\n3. **Date:**\n   - The specified date in the claim is 21 January 1982.\n\n4. **Score:**\n   - The score mentioned in the claim is 0 - 1 (in favor of the away team).\n\nNow, we will verify these conditions against the table data:\n\n- From the table:\n  - Row 5 corresponds to Gillingham as the home team.\n  - The date for this game is listed as 23 January 1982, not 21 January 1982.\n  - The score of this match was indeed 0 - 1 in favor of West Bromwich Albion.\n\nThe key point here is the discrepancy in the date. According to the table, Gillingham's home game took place on 23 January 1982, not 21 January 1982 as stated in the claim.\n\nSince the date mentioned in the claim does not match with the data from the table, we can conclude that the entire claim is false based on the provided information.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to support this conclusion:\n\n- The row where Gillingham's game is recorded (Row 5) contains:\n  - Home team name: \"gillingham\"\n  - Date: \"23 january 1982\"\n  - Score: \"0 - 1\"\n\nThus, the claim about the date is inconsistent with the table data. Therefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
