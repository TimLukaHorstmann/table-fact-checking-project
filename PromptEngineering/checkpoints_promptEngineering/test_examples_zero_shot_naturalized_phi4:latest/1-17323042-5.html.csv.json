Identify instances where the team plays against Orlando.\n2. Confirm the outcomes (wins or losses) for each game against Orlando.\n3. Verify that after losing to Orlando for a second time, the record reflects a drop to 7 - 8.\n\n### Steps:\n- **Row 4** and **Row 15** contain games played against Orlando.\n- In Row 4: The team lost (score: l 88 - 98), resulting in the record changing from 2 - 3 to 2 - 4.\n- In Row 15: The team loses again (score: l 94 - 96), and the record changes from 7 - 7 to 7 - 8.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to \"after they lose to Orlando for a second time,\" which aligns with the sequence observed between Rows 4 and 15. After losing the first game against Orlando in Row 4, their record was 2 - 4.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific parts of it against the table:\n\n1. The team's record when they play Orlando on November 28.\n2. Ensure that there is a game against Orlando on November 28.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Game Date and Opponent\n\n- **Row 15** (November 26): This row shows a game against Orlando, but the date is incorrect for our claim as it mentions November 26 instead of November 28.\n- **Row 16** (November 28): This row has the correct date of November 28, but the opponent mentioned here is Boston, not Orlando.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Team Record\n\n- For games against Orlando:\n  - **Row 4**: The team lost to Orlando on November 6 with a record of 2-4.\n  - **Row 15**: The team lost to Orlando on November 26 with a record of 7-8.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"the team have a record of 7 - 8 when they play orlando on november 28\". \n\nFrom our verification:\n- There is no game against Orlando on November 28.\n- The team\u2019s record was 7-8 after playing Orlando, but it occurred on November 26.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because there is no game against Orlando on November 28.
