    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"more than 3 score from both home and away team be less than 10 point,\" we need to understand what it means in terms of the scores provided:\n\n1. **Understanding Scores**: In Australian rules football, a score is represented as two numbers (e.g., 18.12). The first number represents goals, each worth 6 points, and the second number represents behinds, each worth 1 point.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Points**: \n   - The total points for a team can be calculated using the formula: `total_points = (goals * 6) + behinds`.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Claim**:\n   - \"More than 3 score\" means more than 18 goals and some number of behinds.\n   - We need to check if such teams have a total point difference of less than 10 points compared to their opponent.\n\n4. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - For each row, calculate the total points for both the home team and the away team.\n   - Check if either team has more than 18 goals (i.e., more than 3 score).\n   - If so, check if the absolute difference in total points between the two teams is less than 10.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - North Melbourne: 10.20 \u2192 Points = (10 * 6) + 20 = 80\n  - South Melbourne: 17.11 \u2192 Points = (17 * 6) + 11 = 113\n  - Neither team has more than 18 goals.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Melbourne: 18.12 \u2192 Points = (18 * 6) + 12 = 120\n  - Richmond: 10.11 \u2192 Points = (10 * 6) + 11 = 71\n  - Melbourne has more than 3 score.\n  - Difference = |120 - 71| = 49 (not less than 10).\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Footscray: 8.11 \u2192 Points = (8 * 6) + 11 = 59\n  - Hawthorn: 7.15 \u2192 Points = (7 * 6) + 15 = 57\n  - Neither team has more than 18 goals.\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Fitzroy: 15.14 \u2192 Points = (15 * 6) + 14 = 104\n  - Geelong: 10.20 \u2192 Points = (10 * 6) + 20 = 80\n  - Neither team has more than 18 goals.\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - St Kilda: 14.12 \u2192 Points = (14 * 6) + 12 = 96\n  - Collingwood: 7.14 \u2192 Points = (7 * 6) + 14 = 56\n  - Neither team has more than 18 goals.\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Essendon: 17.21 \u2192 Points = (17 * 6) + 21 = 123\n  - Carlton: 9.8 \u2192 Points = (9 * 6) + 8 = 62\n  - Essendon has more than 3 score.\n  - Difference = |123 - 62| = 61 (not less than 10).\n\nIn conclusion, no row satisfies the condition where a team with more than 3 score has a point difference of less than 10 compared to their opponent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
