    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Corey Peters is indeed a defensive tackle.\n2. There should be no other defensive tackles with a pick number of 19.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table for relevant information:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Name: Sean Weatherspoon\n  - Position: Linebacker\n  - Pick Number: 19\n  - This is not relevant to the claim as it does not involve a defensive tackle.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Name: Corey Peters\n  - Position: Defensive Tackle\n  - Round: 3\n  - Pick Number: 19\n  - Overall: 83\n  - This row confirms that Corey Peters is a defensive tackle and has a pick number of 19. \n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Name: Mike Johnson\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Not relevant as it does not involve a defensive tackle.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Name: Joe Hawley\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Not relevant as it does not involve a defensive tackle.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Name: Dominique Franks\n  - Position: Cornerback\n  - Not relevant as it does not involve a defensive tackle.\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Name: Kerry Meier\n  - Position: Wide Receiver\n  - Not relevant as it does not involve a defensive tackle.\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Name: Shann Schillinger\n  - Position: Safety\n  - Not relevant as it does not involve a defensive tackle.\n\nFrom this examination, we can conclude:\n- Corey Peters is indeed the only player listed as a defensive tackle with a pick number of 19. \n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are from Row 2: \n- \"name\" (Corey Peters)\n- \"position\" (Defensive Tackle)\n- \"pick\" (19)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
