    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Jefferson takes 3 losses in June for the Mariners against the Blue Jays in the 1979 season,\" we must verify each component of this statement using the provided table.\n\n1. **Opponent**: The claim mentions games against the \"Blue Jays.\" In baseball, the team commonly known as the \"Mariners\" is an opponent that plays against the Toronto Blue Jays (often referred to as the \"Blue Jays\"). We need to find rows where the opponent is the \"Blue Jays.\"\n\n2. **Player**: The claim focuses on losses taken by \"Jefferson.\" We must identify rows where Jefferson is listed in the loss column.\n\n3. **Number of Losses**: The claim states that there are three losses, so we need exactly three instances meeting both criteria above.\n\n4. **Date Range**: The events occur in June, as specified in the claim and consistent with the date entries for all rows (June 1 to June 30).\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- Rows involve games against \"Mariners,\" \"Angels,\" \"Athletics,\" \"Yankees,\" \"Red Sox,\" and \"Orioles.\" The opponent \"Blue Jays\" is not mentioned in any of the rows.\n\nSince there are no entries for games played against the \"Blue Jays,\" the condition cannot be met, irrespective of other factors like player name or losses. Therefore, we do not need to check further details as this single mismatch with opponents invalidates the claim.\n\nThe relevant cells would have been associated with any mention of \"Jefferson\" taking a loss in a game recorded against the \"Blue Jays,\" but since no such games exist in the table, there are no relevant cells that support the claim. \n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

This indicates how many extra innings were played beyond the standard nine.\n\nWe'll go through each row and check if any scores have numbers in parentheses:\n\n1. **Row 3:** Score: 10 - 5, no extra innings.\n2. **Row 13:** Score: 10 - 2, no extra innings.\n3. **Row 23:** Score: 4 - 3 (11), indicates this game went into 11 innings, meaning it had 2 extra innings.\n4. **Row 27:** Score: 5 - 3 (10), indicates this game went into 10 innings, meaning it had 1 extra inning.\n\nFrom these observations, we find that:\n\n- **Row 23** and **Row 27** are the games that went into extra innings in June.\n- Both of these rows show that there were indeed 2 games with extra innings.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.

The Blue Jays' score (11) exceeds the opponent\u2019s score (2), so this is another win.\n\n- **Row 27**: Date is June 28, Opponent is Yankees, Score is 5 - 3 (10). Assuming the standard format where the first score listed is for the Blue Jays and the parenthetical score applies to extra innings, the Blue Jays won as their score (5) surpasses their opponent's score (3).\n\n- **Row 28**: Date is June 29, Opponent is Orioles, Score is 6 - 1. The Blue Jays' score (6) is greater than their opponent\u2019s score (1), marking another win.\n\n- **Row 29**: Date is June 29, Opponent is Orioles, Score is 4 - 0. The Blue Jays won since their score (4) exceeds the opponent's score (0).\n\n- **Row 30**: Date is June 30, Opponent is Orioles, Score is 2 - 0. The Blue Jays' score (2) surpasses the opponent\u2019s score (0), indicating a win.\n\nAll six games from June 25 to June 30 were won by the Blue Jays consecutively as per the game records provided in these rows.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of these relevant rows, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the blue jays play 3 games that go into extra innings in June of 1979,\" we need to identify which games went into extra innings from the given table. In baseball, a game goes into extra innings if it is tied after nine regular innings and continues until there's a winner.\n\nFrom the provided table, a game going into extra innings is indicated by parentheses around the inning count in the \"score\" column.\n\nLet's go through each row to check for games that went into extra innings:\n\n1. **Row 3**: The score is \"10 - 5,\" which does not indicate extra innings.\n2. **Row 13**: The score is \"10 - 2,\" with no indication of extra innings.\n3. **Row 23**: The score is \"4 - 3 (11),\" indicating this game went into the 11th inning.\n4. **Row 28**: The score is \"5 - 3 (10),\" indicating this game went into the 10th inning.\n\nFrom these observations, there are two games in June that went into extra innings:\n\n- Row 23: Mariners vs. Red Sox\n- Row 28: Yankees vs. Blue Jays\n\nThus, only 2 out of the 3 claimed games actually went into extra innings according to the table data.
