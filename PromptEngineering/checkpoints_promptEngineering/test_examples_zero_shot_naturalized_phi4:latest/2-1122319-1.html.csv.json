    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to break down the statement: \"1 grid have 105 lap and a time / retire of + 6.18\". Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Position**: The claim mentions \"1 grid\", which implies that the driver should start from position 1.\n\n2. **Laps Completed**: The driver must have completed 105 laps.\n\n3. **Time/Retired**: The time or reason for retirement is \"+ 6.18\".\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Grid Position = 1**: \n  - No driver in the table starts from grid position 1.\n\nSince no driver meets the first condition of starting from grid position 1, we can conclude that the claim is false without needing to check further. However, for completeness, let's verify the other conditions for all drivers who completed 105 laps:\n\n- **Drivers with 105 Laps**:\n  - Row 1: Driver Lorenzo Bandini, Constructor Ferrari, Time/Retired: 2:06:18.23, Grid: 7\n  - Row 2: Driver Richie Ginther, Constructor BRM, Time/Retired: + 6.18, Grid: 5\n\nNone of these drivers started from grid position 1.\n\nThus, the claim is false. The relevant cells to verify this are those related to the grid position and laps for all rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the table, we need to carefully analyze each condition presented in it:\n\nThe claim states:\n\"The number of grids (positions on the starting grid) with 104 laps and a time/retire of +6.18 is 1.\"\n\nLet's break down this statement into its components and verify them against the data provided:\n\n1. **Laps Condition**: The driver should have completed exactly 105 laps, as mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Time/Retired Condition**: The driver should have a time/retire value of \"+6.18\".\n\n3. **Grid Count Condition**: We need to check if there is exactly one entry that satisfies both conditions above.\n\nNow let's examine each row in the table to see which ones meet these criteria:\n\n- Row 1: \n  - Driver: Lorenzo Bandini, Constructor: Ferrari\n  - Laps: 105, Time / Retired: 2:06:18.23 (not +6.18), Grid: 7\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Driver: Richie Ginther, Constructor: BRM\n  - Laps: 105, Time / Retired: +6.18, Grid: 5 \n  - This row meets both the laps and time/retire conditions.\n\n- Rows 3 to 20 need not be checked further for \"laps\" as none of them have exactly 105 laps except Row 1 and Row 2 already reviewed. \n\nFrom our analysis:\n- Only **Row 2** matches both the laps (105) and time/retire (+6.18) criteria.\n\nThe claim specifies that there should be only one driver with these attributes, which is indeed satisfied by Row 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE as there is exactly one entry satisfying all specified conditions.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
