Bosone's cardinalatial order and title be \"cardinal - priest of S Anastasia\".\n2. He was elevated circa 1116.\n\nLet's verify these conditions:\n\n- For the first condition, we look at the column \"cardinalatial order and title\" in Row 5 to check if it matches the claim \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\". According to the table:\n  - Row 5: cardinalatial order and title is indeed listed as \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\".\n\n- For the second condition, we look at the column \"elevated\" in Row 5 to confirm if it matches \"circa 1116\". The table states:\n  - Row 5: elevated is noted as \"circa 1116\".\n\nSince both conditions specified in the claim are met according to the data presented in Row 5 of the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. Now, let's compile the relevant cells into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis JSON object reflects that the claim about Bosone's cardinalatial order and title as well as his elevation date is fully supported by the data in Row 5 of the table.",
