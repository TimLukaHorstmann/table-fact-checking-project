    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each part of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Artist Name**: The claim states \"artist maggie toal\". We need to verify if there is a row where the artist name is \"maggie toal\".\n\n2. **Draw Number**: The claim mentions \"have draw 7\". We must check if this artist has a draw number of 7.\n\n3. **Song Title**: The claim refers to the song \"fee him with love\". We need to verify that this artist's song title matches exactly.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Artist: the memories\n  - Draw: 1\n  - Song: if it means losing you\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Artist: ann breen\n  - Draw: 2\n  - Song: oh , darling\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Artist: fran meen\n  - Draw: 3\n  - Song: say that you love me\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Artist: dreams\n  - Draw: 4\n  - Song: sin sin (that 's that)\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Artist: connor stevens\n  - Draw: 5\n  - Song: count on me\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Artist: linda martin and friends\n  - Draw: 6\n  - Song: all the people in the world\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Artist: maggie toal\n  - Draw: 7\n  - Song: feed him with love\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Artist: liam reilly\n  - Draw: 8\n  - Song: somewhere in europe\n\nFrom Row 7, we observe:\n\n- The artist is \"maggie toal\".\n- The draw number is 7.\n- The song title is \"feed him with love\".\n\nThe claim states the song title as \"fee him with love\", which does not match exactly with \"feed him with love\" from the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n1. Row 7, Artist: maggie toal\n2. Row 7, Draw: 7\n3. Row 7, Song: feed him with love\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
