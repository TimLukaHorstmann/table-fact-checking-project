However, she is the only opponent listed as playing on a hard surface.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is false because there is only one match on a hard surface, not two.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output indicates that Row 6 is relevant because it confirms Naomi Cavaday was the opponent on a hard surface, and no other rows mention matches played on a hard surface.",
