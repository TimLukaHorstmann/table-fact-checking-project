    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"March be feature more often as a month in the date than any other month,\" we need to assess which months appear most frequently in the 'date' column of the provided table.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We will focus on the 'date' column since it contains the information about when each game occurred.\n\n2. **Count Frequency of Each Month**:\n   - Extract and count occurrences of each month (e.g., August, September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April).\n\n3. **Compare Frequencies**: Check if \"March\" has more appearances compared to any other month.\n\n### Counting the Months in the 'date' Column:\n\n- **August 2008**: Game 1\n- **September 2008**: Games 2 and 3\n- **October 2008**: Games 4, 5, and 6\n- **November 2008**: Games 7 and 8\n- **December 2008**: Games 9 and 10\n- **January 2009**: Games 11 to 16 (6 games)\n- **February 2009**: Games 17 to 22 (6 games)\n- **March 2009**: Games 23 to 31 (9 games)\n- **April 2009**: Games 32 to 43 (12 games)\n\n### Frequency Analysis:\n- March: 9 occurrences\n- April: 12 occurrences\n\nFrom this analysis, April appears more frequently than March. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Rows for Verification:\n\nWe only need rows with 'March' and 'April' in their 'date' column to verify the count of occurrences:\n\n- **March (Games 23 to 31)**: Row indices 23 to 31\n- **April (Games 32 to 43)**: Row indices 32 to 43\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Aldershot Town be the opponent on 10 March 2009, when Bradford City score their highest point total,\" we need to follow a structured approach:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant date in the table**: We are interested in checking the game that occurred on 10 March 2009.\n\n2. **Check if Aldershot Town was indeed the opponent**: Verify if \"Aldershot Town\" is listed as the opponent for this particular date.\n\n3. **Determine Bradford City's highest point total**: \n   - First, we must identify how many points Bradford City scored in each game.\n   - Points are generally awarded as follows: 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.\n\n4. **Compare the points from 10 March to other games**:\n   - Calculate the total points for all matches listed in the table and check if this game had the highest score.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1 & 2**: Check the row for 10 March 2009.\n  - Row Index: 36\n  - Date: 10 March 2009\n  - Opponent: Rochdale (not Aldershot Town, so this part of the claim is false)\n\nSince we already found a discrepancy in the opponent's name on the specified date, further calculations regarding points are unnecessary for determining if the statement about opponents is true. However, let's still calculate the highest point total for completeness.\n\n- **Step 3 & 4**: Calculate points for each game to determine Bradford City\u2019s highest scoring match.\n  - Examine each result:\n    - \"Win\" results in 3 points (Bradford score higher than opponent)\n    - \"Draw\" results in 1 point\n    - \"Loss\" results in 0 points\n\n- **Identifying the highest-scoring game**:\n  - Look at games where Bradford scored multiple goals and consider the goal difference to determine if it was a win.\n  \nFrom the table:\n\n- Highest number of goals scored by Bradford City: \n  - Game against Aldershot Town on 3 March 2009, they scored 5 goals (win).\n\nLet's compile this information into the JSON object format specified in your instructions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The opponent on 10 March was Rochdale, not Aldershot Town, making the statement false.\n- To verify Bradford City's highest scoring game (5 goals against Aldershot Town), we referenced relevant cells for both the correct opponent and result data.",
