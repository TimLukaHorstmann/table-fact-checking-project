Kardinya Park's attendance of 34,616 is indeed higher than any other venue listed in this specific table for that date. However, the claim mentions \"during the 1967 VFL season,\" implying we should consider all matches throughout the entire season, not just those on August 26.\n\nSince the table only includes matches from one day and does not cover the whole 1967 VFL season, we cannot conclude definitively whether Kardinya Park had the highest attendance for the entire season based solely on this data. Therefore, we must consider that other matches outside of these results could have higher attendance numbers.\n\nGiven the information provided in the table alone:\n\n- The relevant cells to verify the claim about Kardinya Park's crowd participation from August 26, 1967, are in Row 1 under \"venue\" and \"crowd\".\n\nHowever, since we cannot determine if this is true for the entire season with just one day\u2019s data provided, we must conclude that based on the available information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis conclusion is drawn because we cannot claim Kardinya Park had the highest attendance for the entire season based solely on data from one match.",
