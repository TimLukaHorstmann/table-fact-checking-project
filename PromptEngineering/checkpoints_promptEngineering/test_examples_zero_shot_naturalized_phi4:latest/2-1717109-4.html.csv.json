The opponent is indeed John McEnroe, which matches the claim.\n2. The surface is listed as Carpet, not Clay.\n\nSince the second condition (the surface being clay) is not met, the entire claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table to verify this:\n\n- Row 6, \"surface\": Carpet\n- Row 6, \"opponent in final\": John McEnroe\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.
