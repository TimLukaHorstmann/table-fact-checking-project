Check if \"games played\" for the team series involving the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy is 90.\n   - Row 3 shows teams (dartmouth - princeton) have a trophy called \"sawhorse dollar\".\n   - In this row, \"games played\" is indeed listed as 90 games.\n\n2. Verify that the trophy in question matches:\n   - The trophy for the series between dartmouth and princeton is named \"sawhorse dollar\", which matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by Row 3 data:\n\n- Games Played = 90\n- Trophy = Sawhorse Dollar\n\nThe claim is TRUE. Now, we compile the relevant cells in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"more than 100 games were played for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy,\" we need to examine the table and identify relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim mentions the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy.\n   - Looking through the rows, the \"sawhorse dollar\" is associated with Row 3 (Dartmouth vs. Princeton).\n\n2. **Check the Condition**:\n   - The condition to verify is whether more than 100 games have been played in this series.\n   - From Row 3, under the column \"games played,\" we see the value is 90 games.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that more than 100 games were played.\n   - Since only 90 games are recorded for this series, the condition of having more than 100 games is not met.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because the number of games (90) does not exceed 100.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For verification, we need to reference the row index and column name where the relevant data can be found.\n   - Row Index: 2 (since it\u2019s a zero-based index for the third row)\n   - Column Name: \"games played\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the result is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
