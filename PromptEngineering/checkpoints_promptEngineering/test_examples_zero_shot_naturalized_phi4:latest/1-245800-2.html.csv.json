    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim about the longest expedition after June 5, 1980, we need to evaluate the duration of expeditions listed in the table starting from Row 8 (since it corresponds to the launch date of June 26, 1980) through Row 13.\n\n1. **Identify Expeditions After June 5, 1980:**\n   - The relevant rows are Rows 8 to 13.\n   \n2. **Check Durations in These Rows:**\n   - **Row 8:** Duration = 7.87 days\n   - **Row 9:** Duration = 3.93 days\n   - **Row 10:** Duration = 7.86 days\n   - **Row 11:** Duration = 7.86 days\n   - **Row 12:** Duration = 12.8 days\n   - **Row 13:** Duration = 74.73 days\n\n3. **Compare Durations:**\n   - The longest duration among these expeditions is 74.73 days, which belongs to the expedition in Row 13 (Salyut 6 - EO-6).\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against These Findings:**\n   - The claim states that \"the longest expedition after June 5, 1980, be Expedition Soyuz 28 with a duration of 7.93 days.\"\n   - Expedition Soyuz 28 is actually listed in Row 3, which predates June 5, 1980.\n   - Therefore, the claim incorrectly identifies the expedition and its duration.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
