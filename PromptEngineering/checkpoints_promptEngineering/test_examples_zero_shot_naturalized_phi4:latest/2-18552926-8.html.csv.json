    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each condition in the claim using the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Condition**: \"the earliest year when the result be nominate\"\n   - We must identify all rows where the `result` column has the value \"nominated\" and find the earliest year among them.\n\n2. **Condition**: \"and the role / episode be fox mulder\"\n   - For the identified row(s) from the first condition, we need to check if the `role / episode` column contains \"fox mulder\".\n\nLet's evaluate each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (1996)**: Result is \"won\", so it does not satisfy the nomination condition.\n- **Row 2 (1996)**: Result is \"nominated\", and role/episode is \"dana scully\". This satisfies the nomination condition but not the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 3 (1996)**: Role/episode is \"best series - drama\", so it does not meet the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 4 (1997)**: Result is \"nominated\", and role/episode is \"david duchovny\". This satisfies the nomination condition but not the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 5 (1997)**: Role/episode is \"gillian anderson\". It does not meet the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 6 (1997)**: Role/episode is \"best series - drama\", so it does not meet the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 7 (1998)**: Role/episode is \"gillian anderson\". It does not meet the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 8 (1998)**: Role/episode is \"best series - drama\", so it does not meet the role/episode condition.\n- **Row 9 (2000)**: Role/episode is \"gillian anderson\". It does not meet the role/episode condition.\n\nNow, we need to find any row where both conditions are satisfied:\n\n- The only row with \"fox mulder\" in the `role / episode` column is Row 1, but its result is \"won\", not \"nominated\".\n- None of the rows satisfy both conditions simultaneously: being nominated and having \"fox mulder\" as the role/episode.\n\nTherefore, there is no year where the result is \"nominated\" and the role/episode is \"fox mulder\".
