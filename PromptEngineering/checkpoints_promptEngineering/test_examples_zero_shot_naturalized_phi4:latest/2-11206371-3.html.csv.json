    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Paddock and the Red Squirrels' last appearances, let's break down the relevant parts of the claim:\n\n1. **Paddock's Last Appearance**:\n   - The claim states: \"Paddock's last appearance be in 'blood is thicker than water'.\"\n   - From the table, Row 21 corresponds to Paddock with a species of Stoat (note that Paddock might actually refer to another character as per typical series details), but there seems to be a mismatch here since Paddock refers to an animal with a species \"Stoat\" instead. However, based on logical deduction from the table:\n     - Row 19 is \"Paddock,\" with a last appearance in \"blood is thicker than water.\"\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n2. **Red Squirrels' Last Appearance**:\n   - The claim states: \"Red squirrel's last appearance be in 'a hero's welcome'.\"\n   - From the table, Row 20 refers to Red Squirrels with their first and last appearance noted as \"a hero's welcome.\"\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is **TRUE**.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the data provided in the table:\n\n- The answer to the entire claim is \"TRUE\".\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- For Paddock: Row 19, Column \"last appearance\".\n- For Red Squirrels: Row 20, Column \"last appearance\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"last appearance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"last appearance\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nNote: The row indices are adjusted for zero-based indexing used in JSON representation.",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"the male bounder book be no,\" we need to examine the relevant details from the table for the animal named \"bounder.\" The key points in the claim are:\n\n1. **Bounder's Gender**: The claim specifies that Bounder is male.\n2. **Appearance in Books**: The claim states that Bounder does not appear (\"be no\") in books.\n\nLet's verify these against the data provided in the table:\n\n- For **row 24**, corresponding to \"bounder\":\n  - **Animal Name**: \"Bounder\"\n  - **Species**: Fox\n  - **Gender**: Male (matches the claim)\n  - **Books Appearance**: Yes (\"no\" is mentioned as a value indicating non-appearance, but here it states \"yes\")\n\nBased on this information:\n\n- The gender matches the claim as both indicate Bounder is male.\n- However, the claim states that Bounder does not appear in books, while the table indicates he does appear in books. This contradicts the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE** because Bounder appears in books, contrary to what the claim asserts.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n1. The gender of \"bounder\" (row 24, column \"gender\").\n2. Whether \"bounder\" appears in books (row 24, column \"books\").\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"books\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
