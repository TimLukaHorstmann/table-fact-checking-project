    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding poker hand payouts in relation to the given table data:\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n- The claim states two conditions:\n  1. \"Four aces win 800 credits at 5 credits.\"\n  2. \"Four aces win only 160 credits at 1 credit.\"\n\nWe need to verify these conditions against the table.\n\n### Table Analysis\n\nLet's identify the relevant rows and columns from the table:\n\n- **Row 3**: This row corresponds to the hand \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4.\"\n  - Column for \"5 credits\": The payout is 2000.\n  - Column for \"1 credit\": The payout is 400.\n\n- **Row 5**: This row corresponds to the hand \"four aces.\"\n  - Column for \"5 credits\": The payout is 800.\n  - Column for \"1 credit\": The payout is 160.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **\"Four aces win 800 credits at 5 credits.\"**\n   - In Row 5, under \"5 credits,\" the payout is indeed 800. This condition is true.\n\n2. **\"Four aces win only 160 credits at 1 credit.\"**\n   - Again in Row 5, under \"1 credit,\" the payout is 160. This condition is also true.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are supported by the table data, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- From Row 5:\n  - Column for \"5 credits\": payout of 800.\n  - Column for \"1 credit\": payout of 160.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The row index is zero-based as per typical data indexing conventions.)",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part against the provided table:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit\":**\n   - We need to check if a \"four aces\" hand yields 900 credits when betting 5 credits.\n\n2. **\"the result for 1 credit would be 160\":**\n   - We need to confirm that the payout for 1 credit with a \"four aces\" hand is indeed 160.\n\n### Relevant Table Rows:\n- The relevant rows for checking these conditions are those containing information about the \"four aces\" hands. According to the table, there are two entries related to \"four aces\":\n  - **Row 3**: \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\"\n    - 1 credit: 400\n    - 5 credits: 2000\n\n  - **Row 5**: \"four aces\"\n    - 1 credit: 160\n    - 5 credits: 800\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Check the yield for 5 credits with \"four aces\":**\n   - From Row 3, the payout for 5 credits is 2000.\n   - From Row 5, the payout for 5 credits is 800.\n\n2. **Check the yield for 1 credit with \"four aces\":**\n   - From Row 3, the payout for 1 credit is 400.\n   - From Row 5, the payout for 1 credit is 160.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit,\" but neither Row 3 (2000) nor Row 5 (800) matches this value. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n- The claim also states that \"the result for 1 credit would be 160.\" This matches the information in Row 5.\n\nSince one part of the claim does not match the table data, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
