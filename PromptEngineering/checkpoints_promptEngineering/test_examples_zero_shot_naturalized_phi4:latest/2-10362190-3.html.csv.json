Compare the claimed attendance figure to the actual data from the table:\n   - The claim states that during week 7, the attendance was 55,703.\n   - From row 7 of the table, we see that the recorded attendance is indeed 55,703.\n\nSince the data in the table matches the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.
