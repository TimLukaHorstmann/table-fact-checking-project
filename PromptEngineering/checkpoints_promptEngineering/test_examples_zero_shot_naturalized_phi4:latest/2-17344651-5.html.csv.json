    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that the Boston Celtics played six games at the Boston Garden in December and won every one, we need to examine the table data for specific conditions:\n1. Identify all games played at \"boston garden\" in December.\n2. Check if there are exactly six such games.\n3. Verify that the team won each of these games.\n\nLet's break down the relevant information from the table:\n\n- **Column Names**: The columns we need to focus on are \"location\", \"date\", and \"score\".\n\n- **Identify Games at Boston Garden**:\n  - Row 2: Location is \"boston garden\".\n  - Row 4: Location is \"boston garden\".\n  - Row 6: Location is \"boston garden\".\n  - Row 9: Location is \"boston garden\".\n  - Row 11: Location is not relevant (different location).\n  - Row 12: Location is \"boston garden\".\n  - Row 13: Location is \"boston garden\".\n\n- **Games in December**: All games listed are from December, so we only need to ensure the games at Boston Garden meet the criteria.\n\n- **Verify Wins**:\n  - Row 2: Score is 122 - 99 (Win).\n  - Row 4: Score is 123 - 107 (Win).\n  - Row 6: Score is 128 - 127 (Win).\n  - Row 9: Score is 117 - 106 (Win).\n  - Row 12: Score is 92 - 107 (Loss).\n  - Row 13: Score is 117 - 107 (Win).\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- There are six games at Boston Garden.\n- The team won five out of these six games.\n\nThe claim states they won every game, but they lost one game (Row 12).

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Boston Celtic's largest loss margin in December was 25 points, and it happened on Dec 30,\" we need to evaluate each part of the statement based on the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Largest Loss Margin:** \n   - We must identify games where Boston Celtics lost (i.e., their score is less than the opponent's score) and calculate the margin by subtracting the Celtics' score from the opponent's score.\n   - From Row 2 to Row 18, we find two losses for the Celtics:\n     - **Row 8:** Score was 107 - 110. The loss margin is \\(110 - 107 = 3\\).\n     - **Row 12:** Score was 92 - 107. The loss margin is \\(107 - 92 = 15\\).\n     - **Row 14:** Score was 85 - 110. The loss margin is \\(110 - 85 = 25\\).\n     - **Row 18:** Score was 98 - 114. The loss margin is \\(114 - 98 = 16\\).\n\n2. **Largest Loss Margin of 25 Points:**\n   - We have determined that the largest loss margin (25 points) occurred in Row 14 on December 22.\n\n3. **Loss Occurring on Dec 30 with a 25 Point Margin:**\n   - On December 30, based on Row 18, the Celtics lost to Milwaukee Bucks by a margin of 16 points (\\(114 - 98 = 16\\)), not 25 points.\n\nThus, while there was indeed a loss of 25 points for the Celtics during December, it did not occur on December 30. The claim is therefore false.\n\nThe relevant cells are those that involve losses and the specific dates mentioned in the claim:\n\n- **Row 14** (loss of 25 points)\n- **Row 18** (loss on Dec 30 but with a margin of 16)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
