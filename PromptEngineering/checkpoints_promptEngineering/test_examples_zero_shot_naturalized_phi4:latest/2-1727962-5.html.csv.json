Row 35: clay\n\nNow, we count the occurrences for each surface:\n- Clay: Rows 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23, 27, 34, 35 (14 times)\n- Carpet: Rows 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 (16 times)\n- Hard: Rows 2, 12, 17, 20, 28 (5 times)\n\nThe majority surface is carpet with 16 occurrences. Clay appears 14 times, and hard surfaces appear only 5 times.\n\nThus, the claim that \"most of the tournament be play on clay surface\" is not supported by the data since more matches were played on a carpet surface than on a clay surface.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
