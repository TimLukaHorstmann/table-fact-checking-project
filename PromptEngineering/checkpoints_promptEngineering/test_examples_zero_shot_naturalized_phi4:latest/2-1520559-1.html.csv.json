Determine if these scores are indeed the lowest in the list, implying a comparison with all other rows' \"score\" values.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Scores\n- **Annika S\u00f6renstam** is listed as the champion in Row 3 for the year 2003.\n- **Catriona Matthew** is listed as the champion in Row 5 for the year 2009.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Annika S\u00f6renstam's score (Row 3) is 278.\n- Catriona Matthew's score (Row 5) is 285.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Scores\nNow, we need to check if these scores are the lowest compared to all other champions in the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the components of the claim and compare them against the relevant rows in the provided table.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2010 open with 9 stroke\"\n\nWe need to verify the following conditions from the claim:\n1. Jiyai Shin was a champion.\n2. This event occurred in the year 2010.\n3. She beat Inbee Park.\n4. The margin of victory was 9 strokes.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition against the table:\n\n1. **Jiyai Shin as Champion:**\n   - Jiyai Shin is listed as a champion in two rows:\n     - Row 2 (Year 2012)\n     - Row 6 (Year 2008)\n\n2. **Event Occurred in 2010:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the year 2010.\n   - Row 4 corresponds to the year 2010, with Yani Tseng as the champion.\n\n3. **Beating Inbee Park:**\n   - The runner-up for the 2010 event (Row 4) is Katherine Hull, not Inbee Park.\n\n4. **Margin of Victory of 9 Strokes:**\n   - Row 4 shows a margin of victory of 1 stroke in the year 2010.\n\nSince Jiyai Shin was never a champion in 2010 and did not beat Inbee Park with a margin of 9 strokes, all conditions from the claim are incorrect based on the table data. The relevant cells to verify this conclusion are:\n\n- Row 4 (Year 2010) for verifying the year, champion, runner-up, and margin.\n- Row 2 (Year 2012) as an example where Jiyai Shin is a champion.\n- Row 6 (Year 2008) as another instance of Jiyai Shin being a champion.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.

Jiyai Shin's winner's share in 2012.\n\nAccording to the table:\n\n- For Row 3 (Year 2011), Yani Tseng's winner's share is $392,133.\n- For Row 2 (Year 2012), Jiyai Shin's winner's share is $428,650.\n\nThe claim states that Jiyai Shin earned $36,517 less than Yani Tseng in these respective years. To verify this, we calculate the difference between their earnings:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 392,133 - 428,650 = -36,517 \\]\n\nThis result shows that Jiyai Shin actually earned more than Yani Tseng by $36,517, not less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.
