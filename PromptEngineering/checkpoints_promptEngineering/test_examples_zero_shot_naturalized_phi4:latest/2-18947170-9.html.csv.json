    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions:\n\n1. The second highest elevation should be 5895 meters in Tanzania.\n2. The third highest elevation should be 2848 meters in Kenya.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### 1. Identify Elevations and their Order\nFirst, let's list the elevations from the table in descending order to identify the ranks:\n\n- **5895 m** - Mount Kilimanjaro (Row 1)\n- **5199 m** - Mount Kenya (Row 2)\n- **4565 m** - Mount Meru (Row 3)\n- **4321 m** - Mount Elgon (Row 4)\n- **4001 m** - Mount Satima (Row 7)\n- **3682 m** - Loolmalassin (Row 9)\n- **3420 m** - Mount Hanang (Row 8)\n- **3334 m** - Chepunyal Hills (Row 13)\n- **3083 m** - Mount Moroto (Row 11)\n- **3063 m** - Mount Kadam (Row 17)\n- **3002 m** - Mulanje Massif (Row 5)\n- **2980 m** - Mtorwi (Row 18)\n- **2858 m** - Kitumbeine Hill (Row 12)\n- **2848 m** - Mount Ng'iro (Row 21)\n- **2693 m** - Kimhandu (Not in list, typo likely)\n- **2653 m** - Kimhandu (Row 6)\n- **2464 m** - Shengena (Row 15)\n- **2419 m** - Mount Namuli (Row 14)\n- **2300 m** - Sungwi (Row 16)\n- **2285 m** - Mount Kulal (Row 19)\n- **2279 m** - Karenga (Row 20)\n\n#### 2. Verify the Second Highest Elevation\nAccording to our list:\n- The highest elevation is **5895 m** at Mount Kilimanjaro.\n- The second highest elevation should be **5199 m** at Mount Kenya.\n\nThe claim states that the second highest elevation is **5895 m**, which is incorrect as it matches the first highest elevation. Therefore, the claim about the second highest elevation being 5895 m in Tanzania is false.\n\n#### 3. Verify the Third Highest Elevation\nContinuing from our list:\n- The third highest elevation is **4565 m** at Mount Meru.\n\nThe claim states that the third highest elevation should be **2848 m** in Kenya, which does not match our findings. Therefore, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are incorrect based on the table data, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n- The cells relevant to verifying these conditions include the \"elevation (m)\" and \"country\" columns for the peaks with elevations 5895 m, 5199 m, 4565 m, and 2848 m. \n\nThus, we extract the following relevant rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The second lowest value for \"col (m)\" should be 10.\n2. The second highest value for \"col (m)\" should be 1642.\n\nFirstly, let's list all the \"col (m)\" values from the table in ascending order:\n\n- Row 1: col = 10\n- Row 5: col = 683\n- Row 15: col = 714\n- Row 6: col = 532\n- Row 16: col = 570\n- Row 10: col = 1018\n- Row 20: col = 750\n- Row 21: col = 1347\n- Row 2: col = 1374\n- Row 18: col = 1292\n- Row 19: col = 743\n- Row 12: col = 1088\n- Row 17: col = 1373\n- Row 11: col = 1265\n- Row 13: col = 1575\n- Row 4: col = 1863\n- Row 7: col = 1920\n- Row 8: col = 1370\n- Row 3: col = 1395\n\nArranging them in ascending order:\n\n1. 10 (Row 1)\n2. 532 (Row 6)\n3. 570 (Row 16)\n4. 683 (Row 5)\n5. 714 (Row 15)\n6. 743 (Row 19)\n7. 750 (Row 20)\n8. 1018 (Row 10)\n9. 1088 (Row 12)\n10. 1265 (Row 11)\n11. 1292 (Row 18)\n12. 1347 (Row 21)\n13. 1370 (Row 8)\n14. 1373 (Row 17)\n15. 1374 (Row 2)\n16. 1395 (Row 3)\n17. 1575 (Row 13)\n18. 1863 (Row 4)\n19. 1920 (Row 7)\n\nThe second lowest value is 532, and the second highest value is 1575.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim:\n\n1. The claim states that the second lowest \"col (m)\" should be 10. However, we found it to be 532.\n2. The claim states that the second highest \"col (m)\" should be 1642. However, we found it to be 1575.\n\nSince neither condition in the claim is met, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those containing the \"col (m)\" values:\n\n- Row 1: col = 10\n- Row 6: col = 532\n- Row 16: col = 570\n- Row 5: col = 683\n- Row 15: col = 714\n- Row 19: col = 743\n- Row 20: col = 750\n- Row 10: col = 1018\n- Row 12: col = 1088\n- Row 11: col = 1265\n- Row 18: col = 1292\n- Row 21: col = 1347\n- Row 8: col = 1370\n- Row 17: col = 1373\n- Row 2: col = 1374\n- Row 3: col = 1395\n- Row 13: col = 1575\n- Row 4: col = 1863\n- Row 7: col = 1920\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
