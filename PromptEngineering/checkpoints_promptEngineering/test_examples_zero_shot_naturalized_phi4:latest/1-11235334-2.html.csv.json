The episode name should be \"chapter six\".\n2. The air date should be \"october 27, 2008\".\n\nNow let's check these components against the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: We need to find the row where the episode is \"chapter six\".\n- **Episode Name** (Column: `episode`): We will look for the entry that matches \"chapter six : take the high road\" in the column labeled `episode`.\n- **Air Date** (Column: `air date`): Once we locate the correct episode, we will check if its air date is \"october 27 , 2008\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 6 contains the entry where the episode is listed as \"chapter six : take the high road\".\n- In the same row (Row 6), under the column `air date`, the value provided is \"october 27 , 2008\".\n\nBoth components of the claim are verified and match the data in Row 6. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The cell at Row Index 5 (since the table starts from index 0), Column `episode` with value \"chapter six : take the high road\".\n- The cell at Row Index 5, Column `air date` with value \"october 27 , 2008\".\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find this exact name in the table.\n   - In Row 5, we have \"episode\": chapter five : dressed to kill. There is a minor discrepancy in capitalization (\"Dressed\" vs. \"dress\"), but it's reasonable to assume they refer to the same episode given typical variations in text.\n\n2. **Weekly Rank Check**:\n   - The claim states that the rank should be 8.\n   - In Row 5, under \"weekly rank for living\", we see the value is indeed 8.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- To verify the episode name and its weekly rank, we need to check two cells in Row 5:\n  - **Column**: \"episode\" (to confirm it matches \"chapter five : dressed to kill\")\n  - **Column**: \"weekly rank for living\" (to confirm the rank is 8)\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim is fully supported by the data.
