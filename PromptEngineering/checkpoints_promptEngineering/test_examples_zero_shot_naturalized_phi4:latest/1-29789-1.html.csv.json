    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim:\n\n- The claim states that in the UNWTO region of Asia, there were 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012.\n- It also claims this number was less than in 2011.\n\nWe need to verify these points using the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the row for the UNWTO region of Asia**: \n   - From the table, we see that China is listed under the UNWTO region of Asia.\n\n2. **Check the international tourist arrivals in 2012 for Asia**:\n   - For China (row 3), the number of international tourist arrivals in 2012 is 57.7 million.\n\n3. **Compare the 2012 figure to the 2011 figure for Asia**:\n   - For China, the number of international tourist arrivals in 2011 was 57.6 million.\n   - The change from 2011 to 2012 is +0.3%.\n\nFrom these points:\n\n- The claim that there were 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in Asia in 2012 is correct.\n- However, the claim that this number was less than in 2011 is incorrect because the 2012 figure (57.7 million) is actually greater than the 2011 figure (57.6 million).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- Row 3, \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"\n- Row 3, \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"25.7 million international tourist visit Russia in 2012\" is true or false, we need to verify specific information from the table related to Russia and the year 2012.\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Russia**: \n   - From the naturalized format of the table, it's clear that each row corresponds to a different country.\n   - We find Row 9 in the table which mentions \"country: russia\".\n\n2. **Verify the Column for International Tourist Arrivals (2012)**:\n   - The column labeled \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" contains data relevant to the year 2012.\n\n3. **Check the Value**:\n   - In Row 9, under the column \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\", the value provided is \"25.7 million\".\n\nSince all conditions in the claim match with the data available from the table, we can conclude that:\n\n- The claim is indeed true based on the information provided.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this conclusion and the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `row_index`: The table is given in a naturalized format starting with Row 1. Therefore, Russia's data, which corresponds to the claim, appears at index 8 when using zero-based indexing typical for programming.\n- `column_name`: \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" matches the specific year mentioned in the claim.",
