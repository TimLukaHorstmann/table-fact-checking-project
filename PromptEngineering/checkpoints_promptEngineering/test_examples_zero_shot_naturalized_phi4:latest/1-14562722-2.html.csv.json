    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"on March 15, 2007 and in region 2 the highest number of episode be 3,\" we need to check two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify the volume associated with Region 4 having a release date on March 15, 2007.\n2. For that identified volume, determine if the number of episodes released in Region 2 is at most 3.\n\nLet's examine each row for these details:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Volume: 1\n  - Region 4 Release Date: March 15, 2007\n  - Number of Episodes in Region 2 (February 19, 2007): 4\n\nSince Row 1 has the date \"March 15, 2007\" for Region 4, we check the number of episodes for Volume 1 in Region 2. It is given as 4.\n\nAccording to the claim, on March 15, 2007 (in Region 4), the highest number of episodes should be 3 or fewer in Region 2. However, for Row 1, there are 4 episodes released in Region 2 by February 19, 2007, which exceeds the claimed maximum.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 1, \"region 4\" (to confirm the date March 15, 2007)\n- Row 1, \"region 2\" (to check the number of episodes)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"region 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"region 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
