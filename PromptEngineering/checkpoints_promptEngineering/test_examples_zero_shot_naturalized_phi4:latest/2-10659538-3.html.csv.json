There's no game played, hence:\n     - No attendance value can be checked against 66,189 because it's \"nan.\"\n     - The record isn't explicitly updated here due to the absence of a game.\n\n   - Look for the Record \"6 - 1\":\n     - **Row 7**: Week: 7, Date: October 28, 2001, Opponent: New Orleans Saints, Result: l 34 - 31, Record: 6 - 1.\n     \n     The record of 6-1 is associated with Week 7 after the game against the New Orleans Saints.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \n\n   The claim specifies attendance and a record for Week 8, but:\n   - There was no game in Week 8 (bye week), so there cannot be an attendance figure.\n   - The mentioned record of \"6 - 1\" is from Week 7 after the game against New Orleans Saints.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim that states both a specific attendance and record for Week 8 is false. \n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
