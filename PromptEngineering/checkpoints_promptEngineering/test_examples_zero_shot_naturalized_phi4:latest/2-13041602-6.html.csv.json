A win is indicated if the first score (Brewers' score) is greater than the second score (opponent's score).\n\n3. **Determine Relevance of Rows and Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns are `attendance`, `date`, `opponent`, and `score`.\n   - We need to track which rows have these data points, particularly focusing on the game with the lowest attendance.\n\nNow let\u2019s perform this analysis:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - The attendances are as follows (with their respective row indices):\n     - Row 1: 32453\n     - Row 2: 40659\n     - Row 3: 30359\n     - Row 4: 31759\n     - Row 5: 35800\n     - Row 6: 35017\n     - Row 7: 30260\n     - Row 8: 28556\n     - Row 9: 37650\n     - Row 10: 24103\n     - Row 11: 41282\n     - Row 12: 29262\n     - Row 13: 18596 (lowest attendance)\n     - Row 14: 18582\n     - Row 15: 19288\n     - Row 16: 29844\n     - Row 17: 31651\n     - Row 18: 41101\n     - Row 19: 35712\n     - Row 20: 20318\n     - Row 21: 33323\n     - Row 22: 22843\n     - Row 23: 30670\n     - Row 24: 42464\n     - Row 25: 35060\n     - Row 26: 28337\n     - Row 27: 15062\n\n   The lowest attendance is in **Row 13** with an attendance of **18596**.\n\n2. **Check the Outcome for Row 13:**\n   - For Row 13:\n     - Date: August 31\n     - Opponent: Pirates\n     - Score: 6 - 5 (Brewers win since their score is higher)\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The game with the lowest attendance was indeed a win for the Brewers.\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are from Row 13:\n- `attendance` in Row 13\n- `score` in Row 13\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Row indices are zero-based as per standard programming conventions.",
