A 50/50 win-loss record implies that the number of wins is equal to the number of losses (e.g., 52-52, 53-53).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**: We need to look at each row in the table and identify when the Brewers had a win-loss record with equal numbers.\n\n3. **Relevant Column**: The column that shows the win-loss record is \"record\".\n\n4. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Record: 52-55\n   - **Row 2**: Record: 53-55\n   - **Row 3**: Record: 54-55\n   - **Row 4**: Record: 55-55 (50/50 record)\n   - **Row 5**: Record: 55-56\n   - **Row 6**: Record: 56-56 (50/50 record)\n   - **Row 7**: Record: 56-57\n   - **Row 8**: Record: 56-58\n   - **Row 9**: Record: 56-59\n   - **Row 10**: Record: 56-60\n   - **Row 11**: Record: 56-61\n   - **Row 12**: Record: 57-61\n   - **Row 13**: Record: 57-62\n   - **Row 14**: Record: 58-62\n   - **Row 15**: Record: 59-62\n   - **Row 16**: Record: 60-62\n   - **Row 17**: Record: 60-63\n   - **Row 18**: Record: 61-63\n   - **Row 19**: Record: 61-64\n   - **Row 20**: Record: 62-64\n   - **Row 21**: Record: 63-64\n   - **Row 22**: Record: 63-65\n   - **Row 23**: Record: 64-65\n   - **Row 24**: Record: 64-66\n   - **Row 25**: Record: 64-67\n   - **Row 26**: Record: 64-68\n   - **Row 27**: Record: 65-68\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Brewers had a 50/50 win-loss record on two occasions:\n   - August 28, 2005 (Row 4): Record 55-55\n   - August 31, 2005 (Row 6): Record 56-56\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
