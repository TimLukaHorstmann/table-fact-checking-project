    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Oct 22 be the date the streak be lose at 7\", we need to examine specific columns in the table for relevant information:\n\n1. **Date**: We first locate the row corresponding to October 22.\n2. **Streak**: Check the value of the streak on this date.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- The claim mentions \"Oct 22,\" so we look at Row 8, which has the date `oct 22`.\n- In Row 8, the `streak` column indicates a value of \"lost 2.\"\n\nThe claim states that the loss streak should be at 7 on October 22. However, according to the table, the streak is actually \"lost 2\" on this date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"streak\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of relevant cells:\n- **Row Index 7**: This corresponds to October 22. We check the `date` column for verification.\n- **Streak Column in Row 7**: This tells us the current loss streak on that date, which is crucial for verifying the claim.",
