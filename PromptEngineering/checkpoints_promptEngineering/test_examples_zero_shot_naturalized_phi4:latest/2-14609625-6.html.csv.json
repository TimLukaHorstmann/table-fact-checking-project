    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on two conditions:\n\n1. The average is less than 2.6.\n2. Count the number of touchdowns for those rows where the condition in step 1 holds true.\n\nLet's analyze each row based on these criteria:\n\n- **Row 1 (Stephen Davis):**\n  - Average: 4.0\n  - Since 4.0 is not less than 2.6, this row does not meet the first condition.\n\n- **Row 2 (Larry Centers):**\n  - Average: 5.4\n  - Since 5.4 is not less than 2.6, this row does not meet the first condition.\n\n- **Row 3 (James Thrash):**\n  - Average: 8.2\n  - Since 8.2 is not less than 2.6, this row does not meet the first condition.\n\n- **Row 4 (Skip Hicks):**\n  - Average: 2.7\n  - Since 2.7 is not less than 2.6, this row does not meet the first condition.\n\n- **Row 5 (Brad Johnson):**\n  - Average: 2.6\n  - Since 2.6 is not less than 2.6, this row does not meet the first condition.\n\nNo rows satisfy the condition of having an average less than 2.6. Therefore, there are no touchdowns to count for such cases.\n\nThe claim states that \"1 be the number of touchdown when the average be less than 2.6.\" Since no player has an average less than 2.6, the number of touchdowns is actually zero, not one.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

However, according to the table, Larry has 19 attempts. Therefore, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n2. **Yards**: The claim states that Larry has 103 yards. According to the table, Larry indeed has 103 yards.
