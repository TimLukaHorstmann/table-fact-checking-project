    "resp": "To verify the claim \"of the respondent for george h w bush , 1% have no opinion,\" we need to check two specific aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify the row associated with \"George H W Bush\" under the column labeled by each president's name.\n2. Check if, in that row, the percentage corresponding to \"no opinion\" is indeed 1%.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n- The claim involves finding where George H. W. Bush's data is located:\n  - Across all rows (result categories: outstanding, above average, average, below average, poor, no opinion), we find a column labeled \"george h w bush\" which contains the relevant percentages.\n\n- The specific row to check for \"no opinion\" is Row 6 because it corresponds to the result category \"no opinion.\"\n\n- In Row 6, under the \"george h w bush\" column, we need to verify if the percentage is 1%.\n\nNow let's examine the data:\n\n- **Row 6: Result - No Opinion**\n  - barack obama: 1%\n  - george h w bush: 1% (This matches the claim)\n  - ronald reagan: 1%\n  - jimmy carter: 3%\n  - gerald ford: 6%\n  - richard nixon: 3%\n\nThe percentage for George H. W. Bush in Row 6 is indeed 1%, which supports the claim.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell in Row 6 under \"george h w bush\" column.\n- The cell in Row 6 under \"result\" which indicates it's the \"no opinion\" category.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"george h w bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row indices are zero-based as per standard programming conventions.",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George Bush,\" we need to verify if this statement accurately reflects the data provided in the table.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that there are two distinct references to George Bush within the data: \n- \"Barack Obama\" row contains percentages for \"barack obama.\"\n- The other relevant reference is to \"George H W Bush,\" which pertains to the first President Bush, not George W. Bush.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"George Bush\" without specifying whether it refers to George H. W. Bush or George W. Bush. Given that George W. Bush does not appear in the table at all, we will assume this refers to George H. W. Bush, as he is the only version present.\n\nNext, let's examine the relevant row from the provided data:\n- Row 6 lists percentages under \"result: no opinion.\" For \"george h w bush,\" it indicates a value of 1%.\n\nThis directly aligns with the claim that \"1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George Bush\" (assuming it refers to George H. W. Bush).\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThe JSON response confirming this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"george h w bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"1% of the respondents for George H.W. Bush have below average opinion,\" we need to analyze the data in the table related to this specific condition.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Column and Row**:\n   - We are interested in the row labeled \"4. below average\" because it corresponds to the \"below average\" opinion.\n   - The relevant column is for \"george h w bush.\"\n\n2. **Extract Data from the Table**:\n   - Locate the entry under \"result: 4. below average\" and check the percentage for George H.W. Bush.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - According to the table, the percentage of respondents with a \"below average\" opinion for George H.W. Bush is 11%.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that only 1% of respondents have a below-average opinion of George H.W. Bush.\n- However, the table shows this value as 11%, not 1%.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"george h w bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
