    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there were any games in which the New York Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics during the 1984-85 season, based on the provided table.\n\n### Breakdown of Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: \n   - We are interested only in rows where the opponent is \"New York Knicks\". This requires examining the \"opponent\" column for each row.\n\n2. **Check Game Outcomes**:\n   - For games involving the New York Knicks, we need to check if they were declared as winners.\n   - The score format given in the table (e.g., 105 - 94) suggests that the first number represents Boston's score and the second number represents their opponent's score. Therefore, for the New York Knicks to win against the Celtics, their score must be higher than the Celtics' score.\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Rows**:\n   - Row 2: The opponent is \"New York Knicks\", and the score is \"105 - 94\". Boston scored 105, which means they won this game.\n   - Row 3: The opponent is again \"New York Knicks\", and the score is \"108 - 97\". Boston scored 108, indicating another win for the Celtics.\n\nIn both instances involving the New York Knicks as opponents, the Boston Celtics were victorious. Therefore, there are no records of a New York Knicks victory against the Boston Celtics during this season based on the table provided.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these observations, the claim \"the new york knicks do not win a game against the boston celtic in the 1984 - 85 season\" is supported by the data.

Identify games where the opponent is \"New York Knicks.\"\n2. Check if these games were played at the Boston Garden (home for Celtics).\n3. Verify the outcome of each identified game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against New York Knicks:**\n   - From the table, we identify two games against the New York Knicks:\n     - Row 2: Game 34\n     - Row 3: Game 35\n\n2. **Check Location for Home Games:**\n   - For each game identified in step 1, check if the location is \"Boston Garden.\"\n\n3. **Verify Game Outcomes:**\n   - Determine if Boston won these games.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Relevant Rows:**\n\n- **Row 2 (Game 34):**\n  - Opponent: New York Knicks\n  - Location: Boston Garden (home for Celtics)\n  - Score: 105 - 94 (Celtics win)\n\n- **Row 3 (Game 35):**\n  - Opponent: New York Knicks\n  - Location: Madison Square Garden (away for Celtics)\n  - This game is not relevant as it was an away game.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Boston Celtics played two games against the New York Knicks in the specified season, and one of these was a home game at Boston Garden.
