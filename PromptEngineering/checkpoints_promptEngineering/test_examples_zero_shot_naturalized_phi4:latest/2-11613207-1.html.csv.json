    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two main parts:\n\n1. **Popularity of Months for Hosting Tournaments:**\n   - We need to determine how many tournaments occur in September and December.\n   - Compare these numbers with other months listed in the table.\n\n2. **Average OWGR Points for September and December:**\n   - Calculate the average OWGR points for tournaments held in September and December.\n   - Check if this average is 6, as stated in the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Count Tournaments by Month:**\n   - **September:** \n     - Row 9 (Sep 12 - 15)\n     - Row 10 (Sep 26 - 29)\n     - Total: 2 tournaments\n   - **December:** \n     - No tournaments listed in December.\n   - **Other Months:**\n     - April, May, August, October, November each have at least one tournament.\n\n2. **Calculate Average OWGR Points for September:**\n   - Row 9: 6 points\n   - Row 10: 6 points\n   - Average = (6 + 6) / 2 = 6\n\n3. **Check the Claim:**\n   - September has tournaments, but December does not.\n   - The average OWGR points for September is indeed 6.\n   - Since there are no tournaments in December, it cannot be considered a popular month for hosting tournaments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim that \"September and December be the most popular month to host golf tournament in Korea\" is false because December has no tournaments.\n- The average OWGR points for September being 6 is true.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For counting tournaments: Dates column for each row.\n- For calculating OWGR points: OWGR Points column for September rows (Row 9 and Row 10).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
