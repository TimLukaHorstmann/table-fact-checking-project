Oliver is associated with Alabama's 6th district.\n2. If his representation status (as an incumbent) in that district is correctly noted.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data:\n\n- **Row Index:** We need to locate Row 6, as it contains information about Alabama's 6th district.\n  \n- **District Column:** The \"district\" column should confirm that the entry refers to \"alabama 6.\"\n\n- **Incumbent Column:** The \"incumbent\" column should list \"william b oliver,\" confirming he is indeed representing the district.\n\nChecking Row 6:\n- The \"district\" cell states: \"alabama 6.\"\n- The \"incumbent\" cell lists: \"william b oliver.\"\n\nBoth conditions are met, indicating that William B. Oliver represents Alabama's 6th district as per the table.\n\nNow, let\u2019s format this information into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
