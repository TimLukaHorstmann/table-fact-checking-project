    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the rider ranked 12th on June 3rd, we need to verify if the specified time and speed match those recorded in the data table for that specific day.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: The claim pertains to \"the rider rank 12th,\" so we locate Row 12 of the data which mentions:\n   - Rider: Carl Rennie\n   - Rank: 13\n\n2. **Check the correct ranking**: Since it states \"ranked 12th\", this immediately indicates an inconsistency because, according to the table, the rider in Row 12 is actually ranked 13.\n\n3. **Examine the data for June 3rd (Wednesday) for Row 12**:\n   - Time recorded: 18'19.47\n   - Speed recorded: 123.539 mph\n\n4. **Comparison with Claim**: The claim specifies a time of \"18'19.47\" and a speed of \"123.539 mph\" for the rider ranked 12th on June 3rd.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The data shows that on June 3rd, Row 12 (Carl Rennie) indeed has these values.\n   - However, Carl Rennie is not the 12th-ranked rider; he's ranked 13th according to the table.\n\nGiven this discrepancy in ranking and the actual row number, the claim about a rider ranked 12th having those specific times and speeds on June 3rd cannot be supported by the data. Therefore, the answer must be \"FALSE.\"\n\nHere is the structured JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Time on June 3rd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Speed on June 3rd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
