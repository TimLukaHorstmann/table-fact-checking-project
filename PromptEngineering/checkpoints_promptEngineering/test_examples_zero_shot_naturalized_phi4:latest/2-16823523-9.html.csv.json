    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify whether the first game mentioned in the table occurs on December 9th, 2006.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this claim is \"kick off,\" as it contains the date and time when each match took place.\n\n2. **Extract Dates from the Table**:\n   - Row 1: Kick off is 2006-09-12\n   - Row 2: Kick off is 2006-09-27\n   - Row 3: Kick off is 2006-10-18\n   - Row 4: Kick off is 2006-10-31\n   - Row 5: Kick off is 2006-11-22\n   - Row 6: Kick off is 2006-12-05\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**: The claim states that \"the first game to take place occurs on December 9th, 2006.\" We need to check if any match in the table has this date as its kick-off time.\n\n4. **Compare Dates**:\n   - None of the dates listed in the \"kick off\" column matches December 9th, 2006.\n   - The earliest date is September 12th, 2006 (Row 1), followed by other dates leading up to December 5th, 2006 (Row 6).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that the first game took place on December 9th, 2006, is not supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
