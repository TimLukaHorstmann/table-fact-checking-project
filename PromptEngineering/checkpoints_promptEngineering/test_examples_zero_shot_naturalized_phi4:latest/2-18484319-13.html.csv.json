The key pieces of information required for verifying this claim include:\n\n1. Identifying the home team for round 1.\n2. Checking if that home team matches \"pohang steelers.\"\n\nLet's go through the relevant row in the table:\n\n- Row 1: This row corresponds to round 1, so we need to check the details of this row to verify the claim.\n\nRelevant information from Row 1:\n- **Column**: `home team`\n- **Value**: \"pohang steelers\"\n\nSince the home team listed for round 1 is indeed \"pohang steelers,\" the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. \n\nThus, our conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"round 5 be the last away game the pohang steelers play,\" we need to verify two main conditions:\n1. Identify all games where Pohang Steelers played as the away team.\n2. Check if there is no subsequent round after Round 5 where Pohang Steelers are listed as the away team.\n\nWe will examine each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** In this game, Pohang Steelers were the home team against Adelaide United. This row is not relevant to our claim.\n  \n- **Row 2:** Changchun Yatai was the home team, and there's no mention of Pohang Steelers. Therefore, this row does not concern us.\n\n- **Row 3:** B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng were the home team against Adelaide United; again, Pohang Steelers are not involved in this match.\n\n- **Row 4:** Ad\u00e9laide United was the home team and faced B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng. This row is irrelevant to our claim about Pohang Steelers.\n\n- **Row 5:** Here, Ad\u00e9laide United played as the home team against Pohang Steelers. It confirms that in Round 5, Pohang Steelers played an away game. This row is relevant for verifying part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 6:** Changchun Yatai were the home team with no mention of Pohang Steelers, so this row does not apply to our analysis.\n\nFrom these observations, we see that in Round 5 (Row 5), Pohang Steelers indeed played an away game. Importantly, there are no further rounds mentioned beyond Row 6 where Pohang Steelers play as the away team, confirming that Round 5 was their last away match according to the provided data.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away_team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
