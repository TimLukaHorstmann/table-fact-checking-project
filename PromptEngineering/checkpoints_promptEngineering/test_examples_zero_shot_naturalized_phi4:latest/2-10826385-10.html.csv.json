Compare the home team scores for these matches to see if they are the highest among all matches.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Matches with St Kilda as Away Team\n\nFrom the table, we have:\n\n- **Row 1**: The away team is \"St Kilda\".\n\nThis means only Row 1 involves St Kilda as the away team.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Home Team Scores\n\nWe need to compare the home team score from Row 1 with the scores of all other matches to see if it's the highest:\n\n- **Row 1**: Geelong (home team) scored 9.11 (65).\n- **Row 2**: North Melbourne (home team) scored 6.11 (47).\n- **Row 3**: Richmond (home team) scored 15.14 (104).\n- **Row 4**: South Melbourne (home team) scored 8.11 (59).\n- **Row 5**: Hawthorn (home team) scored 11.22 (88).\n- **Row 6**: Essendon (home team) scored 14.17 (101).\n\nComparing these scores, the highest home team score is from Row 3 with Richmond scoring 15.14 (104). Therefore, the home team score in Row 1 (9.11 or 65 points) is not the highest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"the home team score be highest when the away team be st kilda\" is FALSE because the home team score for St Kilda's match was not the highest.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify this, we consider the following cells:\n\n- Row 1: \"home team score\"\n- Rows 2 to 6: \"home team score\"\n\nThese are relevant because they allow us to compare the scores and determine if the claim is true or false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
