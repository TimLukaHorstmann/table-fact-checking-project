    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Dorrie Timmermans - van Hall did not advance to the next round\" is true or false, we need to examine Dorrie Timmermans - van Hall's performance in each stage of her event according to the table:\n\n1. **Round of 16**: The table shows that she won against Polidori (ITA) with scores 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. This indicates advancement from the Round of 32 to the Round of 16.\n\n2. **Quarterfinals**: She lost to Andersson (SWE) with scores 3-6, 1-6. This means she did not advance past this round.\n\nSince Dorrie Timmermans - van Hall did not move beyond the Quarterfinals, it is accurate to say that she \"did not advance to the next round\" after the Quarterfinals.\n\nRelevant data from the table includes her results in the Round of 16 and the Quarterfinals:\n\n- **Round of 16**: \n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column name: \"round of 16\"\n\n- **Quarterfinals**:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column name: \"quarterfinals\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round of 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need the row corresponding to \"Dorrie timmermans - van hall.\"\n2. **Locate the relevant column:** Since we are interested in the semifinals, we should focus on the \"Semifinals\" column.\n3. **Verify the content:** Check if the entry for Dorrie Timmermans - van Hall in the \"Semifinals\" column matches the claim \"did not advance.\"\n\n**Steps to verify:**\n\n- Locate Row 4 as it corresponds to Dorrie Timmermans - van Hall.\n- Examine the \"Semifinals\" column within this row.\n\nAccording to Row 4:\n- The entry under \"Semifinals\" is \"did not advance.\"\n\nThis exactly matches the claim provided.
