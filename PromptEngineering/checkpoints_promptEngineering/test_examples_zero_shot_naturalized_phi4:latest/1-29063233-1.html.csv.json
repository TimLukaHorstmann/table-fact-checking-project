    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the lady of the lake episode have the least UK viewer\" is true or false, we need to compare the UK viewership numbers for each episode listed in the table.\n\nThe relevant column for this comparison is \"UK viewers (million)\" since it directly relates to the number of viewers. We will extract these values from each row and identify which episode has the lowest viewership.\n\nHere's the data extracted from the table:\n\n- Row 1: 5.77 million\n- Row 2: 5.94 million\n- Row 3: 6.09 million\n- Row 4: 5.69 million\n- Row 5: 5.53 million\n- Row 6: 6.14 million\n- Row 7: 5.62 million\n- Row 8: 6.16 million\n- Row 9: 6.30 million\n- Row 10: 6.02 million\n- Row 11: 6.01 million\n- Row 12: 6.01 million\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the episode \"Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)\" from Row 5 has the lowest viewership at 5.53 million.\n\nThe claim states that \"the lady of the lake episode\" has the least UK viewers. From Row 9, we know that \"the lady of the lake\" has 6.30 million viewers, which is not the least; hence, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are from all rows for the column \"UK viewers (million)\" because we need to compare all episodes to determine which one has the lowest viewership.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
