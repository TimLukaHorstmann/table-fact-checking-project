The claim states that in 2008 Polona was ranked 12 spots higher than in 2011.\n\nLet's extract the relevant data:\n\n- **Year-end ranking in 2008**: According to Row 28, Column \"year end ranking\", the ranking is 243.\n- **Year-end ranking in 2011**: According to Row 28, Column \"year end ranking\", the ranking is 36.\n\nNext, we calculate the difference between these two rankings:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 243 - 36 = 207 \\]\n\nThe claim states that Polona was ranked 12 spots higher in 2008 than in 2011. However, the actual difference calculated is 207 spots, not 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"year end ranking\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"year end ranking\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the number of Grand Slam match wins for Polona in each relevant year (2008 and 2011) using the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - We are interested in Polona's performance at Grand Slam tournaments over the years 2008 and 2011.\n   - The relevant rows for this analysis are:\n     - Row 2 (Austral Open)\n     - Row 3 (French Open)\n     - Row 4 (Wimbledon)\n     - Row 5 (US Open)\n\n2. **Extract Grand Slam Match Wins:**\n   - For each year, we need to count the number of matches won at each Grand Slam tournament.\n\n**Year 2008:**\n\n- **Austral Open:** Polona did not compete or was eliminated in the first round (\"1R\").\n- **French Open:** Polona reached the second round (\"2R\"), winning one match.\n- **Wimbledon:** Polona reached the third round (\"3R\"), winning two matches.\n- **US Open:** Polona reached the fourth round (\"4R\"), winning three matches.\n\nTotal Grand Slam match wins in 2008 = 1 (French Open) + 2 (Wimbledon) + 3 (US Open) = 6\n\n**Year 2011:**\n\n- **Austral Open:** Polona reached the third round (\"3R\"), winning two matches.\n- **French Open:** Polona was eliminated in the second round (\"2R\"), winning one match.\n- **Wimbledon:** Polona was eliminated in the first round (\"1R\"), winning zero matches.\n- **US Open:** Polona reached the fourth round (\"4R\"), winning three matches.\n\nTotal Grand Slam match wins in 2011 = 2 (Austral Open) + 1 (French Open) + 0 (Wimbledon) + 3 (US Open) = 6\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- In both 2008 and 2011, Polona won a total of 6 matches at Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nSince the number of Grand Slam match wins is equal for both years, neither year can be considered to have \"the most\" wins over the other. Therefore, the claim that \"2011 and 2008 be the year that Polona have the most grand slam match win\" is false because they are tied in terms of match wins.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row 2 (Austral Open) for both years.\n- Row 3 (French Open) for both years.\n- Row 4 (Wimbledon) for both years.\n- Row 5 (US Open) for both years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2011\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
