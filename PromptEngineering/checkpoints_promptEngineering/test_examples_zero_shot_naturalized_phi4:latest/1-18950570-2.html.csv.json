    "resp": "To verify the claim that there were \"3,624,000 live births per year in the period from 1975 to 1980,\" we need to examine the table for data corresponding specifically to this time frame.\n\nFirst, identify the row in the table that corresponds to the period 1975-1980. According to the given table:\n\n- **Row 6** is labeled with the period \"1975 - 1980.\"\n\nNext, check the column related to live births per year within Row 6.\n\nThe relevant column for live births per year in this row shows a value of \"3,741,000,\" which does not match the claimed figure of \"3,624,000.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the data from the table.\n\nFor clarity and record-keeping, identify the specific cell that was checked:\n\n- **Row Index**: 6 (since indexing typically starts at zero, this would be the seventh row if using a one-based index like in the description).\n- **Column Name**: \"live births per year.\"\n\nSince the information from Row 6 indicates live births of 3,741,000 and not 3,624,000, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live births per year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
