The match involving Richmond and Melbourne occurred at Punt Road Oval.\n2. In that specific match, Richmond was the home team.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Home Team: Richmond\n  - Away Team: Melbourne\n  - Venue: Punt Road Oval\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions of the claim:\n- The venue is indeed Punt Road Oval.\n- Richmond was listed as the home team, making them Melbourne's opponent at that location.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 4. Now let's identify and list the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index 3** (since we start counting from 0):\n  - Venue: punt road oval\n  - Home Team: richmond\n  - Away Team: melbourne\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cells are those that confirm both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
