Here is a breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** We locate the row associated with \"Tom Watson.\" According to the naturalized table format:\n   - Row 1 mentions \"player: tom watson.\"\n\n2. **Check Score Information:** In Row 1, we see the following details for Tom Watson:\n   - The score is explicitly stated as \"65 + 70 + 71 = 206.\"\n\n3. **Verify Claim Against Data:** The claim states that Tom Watson's score should be 206. As per Row 1 in the table:\n   - It confirms his score is indeed 206.\n\nThus, all conditions for the claim are met based on the data from Row 1, specifically under the \"score\" column.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Row Index:** The table's first row corresponds to index 0.\n- **Column Names:** We identified the relevant columns as \"player\" (to confirm it is Tom Watson) and \"score\" (to verify his score of 206).",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about Bryce Molder's performance in the golf tournament table provided, we need to check two specific aspects of the data: his place and his score relative to par.\n\n1. **Place Check**: The claim states that Bryce Molder came in \"t8\", meaning tied for 8th place. According to Row 8:\n   - Place is listed as \"t8\".\n   \n2. **Score Relative to Par Check**: The claim also mentions that he was \"-1 to par\". However, examining the same row shows:\n   - Score relative to par is given as \"e\" (even).\n\nNow let's evaluate these checks against the table:\n\n- For the place, Row 8 confirms Bryce Molder is indeed at \"t8\", which supports this part of the claim.\n  \n- For the score relative to par, the table indicates that his performance was even (\"e\"), not \"-1\". This contradicts the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim about Bryce Molder's position (his place) is correct but another part (score relative to par) is incorrect, we can determine that the overall claim is false. Therefore, the final answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim are:\n- Row 8, column \"place\" (for checking his position).\n- Row 8, column \"to par\" (for verifying his score relative to par).\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
