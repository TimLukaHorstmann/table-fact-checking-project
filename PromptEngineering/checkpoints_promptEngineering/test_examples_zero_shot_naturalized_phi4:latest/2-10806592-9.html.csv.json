We will be checking if any team's score (home or away) is less than 10 goals.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Home Team Score: 11.23 (89)\n     - Away Team Score: 6.13 (49) -> Less than 10\n     - Relevant Teams: Hawthorn\n\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Home Team Score: 16.12 (108)\n     - Away Team Score: 8.8 (56) -> Less than 10\n     - Relevant Teams: South Melbourne\n\n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Home Team Score: 14.12 (96)\n     - Away Team Score: 16.16 (112)\n\n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Home Team Score: 15.14 (104)\n     - Away Team Score: 15.9 (99)\n\n   - **Row 5:** \n     - Home Team Score: 13.9 (87)\n     - Away Team Score: 10.5 (65)\n\n   - **Row 6:** \n     - Home Team Score: 11.5 (71)\n     - Away Team Score: 16.25 (121)\n\n3. **Count Teams Scoring Less Than 10:**\n   - From Row 1, Hawthorn scored less than 10.\n   - From Row 2, South Melbourne scored less than 10.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:** According to the claim, only two teams should have scores less than 10, specifically Hawthorn and South Melbourne. Our analysis shows that these are indeed the only two teams with such scores.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim is true because only Hawthorn and South Melbourne scored less than 10 goals in their respective matches on 18 June 1938.\n\nNow we compile the relevant cells:\n\n- For Row 1, Away Team Score (Hawthorn) is relevant.\n- For Row 2, Away Team Score (South Melbourne) is relevant.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant column is \"home team score,\" and our task is to determine if any of these scores exceed 11 goals.\n\nHere's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Understand Scoring Notation**: In Australian Rules Football, the scoring format is given as `goals.shots`. A goal is worth 6 points, and a shot (or behind) is worth 1 point. The total score in numerical form can be calculated as `goals * 6 + shots`.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Geelong scored 11.23 (89). \n     - Goals = 11, Shots = 23\n     - Total = 11 * 6 + 23 = 66 + 23 = 89. The goals are 11.\n   \n   - Row 2: Fitzroy scored 16.12 (108).\n     - Goals = 16, Shots = 12\n     - Total = 16 * 6 + 12 = 96 + 12 = 108. The goals are 16.\n   \n   - Row 3: St Kilda scored 14.12 (96).\n     - Goals = 14, Shots = 12\n     - Total = 14 * 6 + 12 = 84 + 12 = 96. The goals are 14.\n   \n   - Row 4: Richmond scored 15.14 (104).\n     - Goals = 15, Shots = 14\n     - Total = 15 * 6 + 14 = 90 + 14 = 104. The goals are 15.\n   \n   - Row 5: Footscray scored 13.9 (87).\n     - Goals = 13, Shots = 9\n     - Total = 13 * 6 + 9 = 78 + 9 = 87. The goals are 13.\n   \n   - Row 6: North Melbourne scored 11.5 (71).\n     - Goals = 11, Shots = 5\n     - Total = 11 * 6 + 5 = 66 + 5 = 71. The goals are 11.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: From the analysis above, Fitzroy (16), St Kilda (14), Richmond (15), and Footscray (13) have scored more than 11 goals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 2: home team score\n   - Row 3: home team score\n   - Row 4: home team score\n   - Row 5: home team score\n\nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game on the 18th of june draw a crowd of more fewer than 20000\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check each row in the table for the crowd size associated with games played on that date.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant piece of information from the table:\n\n1. **Row 1**:\n   - Date: 18 June 1938\n   - Crowd: 7000\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Date: 18 June 1938\n   - Crowd: 12000\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Date: 18 June 1938\n   - Crowd: 14000\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - Date: 18 June 1938\n   - Crowd: 20000\n\n5. **Row 5**:\n   - Date: 18 June 1938\n   - Crowd: 18000\n\n6. **Row 6**:\n   - Date: 18 June 1938\n   - Crowd: 13000\n\nThe claim states that no game on the 18th of June drew a crowd fewer than 20000 or more than 20000. This means we are looking for crowds exactly equal to 20000 and not less than or greater than this number.\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n- Row 1 has a crowd size of 7000, which is less than 20000.\n- Row 2 has a crowd size of 12000, which is less than 20000.\n- Row 3 has a crowd size of 14000, which is less than 20000.\n- Row 4 has a crowd size of exactly 20000, which satisfies the condition in the claim.\n- Row 5 has a crowd size of 18000, which is less than 20000.\n- Row 6 has a crowd size of 13000, which is less than 20000.\n\nSince there are several games with crowds fewer than 20000 and none with more than 20000, the claim is FALSE. The relevant data for verifying this includes the 'crowd' column in all rows since they all pertain to games on the same date (18 June 1938).\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
