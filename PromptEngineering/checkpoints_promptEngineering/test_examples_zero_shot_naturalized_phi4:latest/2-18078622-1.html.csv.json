This detail might not be directly verifiable unless additional context was provided.\n3. **Earliest Re-release Before 2008**: Among Dennis Wilson's re-releases of \"Pacific Ocean Blue,\" we need to find the earliest one released before 2008.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- Rows related to **Dennis Wilson** and his album **\"Pacific Ocean Blue\"** are:\n  - Row 13: Year 1977, Format LP\n  - Row 14: Year 1991, Format CD\n  - Row 15: Year 2008, Formats CD/LP\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n1. **Identify Re-releases**: A re-release typically implies a format change or new catalog number but the same album.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding The Beach Boys' album releases with Caribou Records in LP and CD formats, we need to examine each entry related to The Beach Boys and identify whether every album listed as an LP release also has a corresponding CD version.\n\n1. **Albums by The Beach Boys:**\n   - **\"La (Light Album)\":** \n     - LP format exists for 1979 with catalog JZ 35752.\n     - CD format exists for 1989 with catalog ZK 35752.\n   - **\"Keepin' the Summer Alive\":**\n     - LP format exists for 1980 with catalog FZ 36293.\n     - CD format exists for 1991 with catalog ZK 36293.\n   - **\"Ten Years of Harmony\":**\n     - LP format exists as a double LP (2LP) for 1981 with catalog Z2X 37445.\n     - CD format exists as a double CD (2CD) for 1988 with catalog Z2K 37445.\n   - **\"The Beach Boys\":**\n     - LP format exists for 1985 with catalog BFZ 39946.\n     - CD format also exists for the same year, 1985, with catalog ZK 39946.\n\n2. **Analysis of Formats:**\n   - For each album released in LP format by The Beach Boys:\n     - \"La (Light Album)\" has a corresponding CD release.\n     - \"Keepin' the Summer Alive\" has a corresponding CD release.\n     - \"Ten Years of Harmony,\" despite being a double LP, has an equivalent double CD release.\n     - \"The Beach Boys\" album has both LP and CD releases in the same year.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Every LP version of The Beach Boys' albums is paired with at least one CD version.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim that \"the beach boys release an lp, but not necessarily a cd for every album release with caribou record\" is TRUE because there are no instances where an LP exists without a corresponding CD release for these records.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
