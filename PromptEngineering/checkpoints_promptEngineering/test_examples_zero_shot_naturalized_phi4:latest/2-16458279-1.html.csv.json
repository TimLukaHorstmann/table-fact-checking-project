The score must be less than 71.\n2. The country must be Zimbabwe.\n\nWe need to check if there's any row in the table where both these conditions are met, and then verify whether the \"place\" for that row is indeed \"t2\".\n\n### Relevant Data Extraction from Table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Score: 66 (less than 71)\n  - Country: Northern Ireland\n  - Place: 1\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Score: 70 (less than 71)\n  - Country: Zimbabwe\n  - Place: t4\n\n### Verification:\n\n- From the table, the only row that meets both conditions (score < 71 and country is Zimbabwe) is Row 4.\n- In this row (Row 4), the place is \"t4\", not \"t2\".\n\nSince the condition of having a place as \"t2\" when the score is less than 71 and the country is Zimbabwe is not met, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe cells relevant to verifying this claim are:\n- Row 4: columns for \"score,\" \"country,\" and \"place.\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
