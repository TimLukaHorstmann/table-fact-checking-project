If either set is not marked as 'na', it indicates that the match extended beyond three sets. \n\nLet's examine each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (Jun 11):** Sets 4 and 5 are 'na'. (3 sets)\n- **Row 2 (Jun 12):** Sets 4 and 5 are 'na'. (3 sets)\n- **Row 3 (Jun 13):** Sets 4 and 5 are 'na'. (3 sets)\n- **Row 4 (Jun 14):** Sets 4 and 5 are 'na'.

(4 sets)\n- **Row 18 (Jun 15):** Set 4 is not 'na', indicating four sets were played. (4 sets)\n- **Row 19 (Jun 16):** Sets 4 and 5 are not 'na'. This indicates five sets were played. (5 sets)\n- **Row 20 (Jun 17):** Sets 4 and 5 are 'na'. (3 sets)\n\nFrom the analysis, we observe that matches on Jun 8, Jun 9, Jun 10, Jun 15, and Jun 16 went beyond three sets.\n\nThe claim states that only the match on June 8 went to a total of four sets.

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nFor verifying this, the relevant cells are those in the \"Score\" and \"Set 4\" columns for each row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Set 4\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
