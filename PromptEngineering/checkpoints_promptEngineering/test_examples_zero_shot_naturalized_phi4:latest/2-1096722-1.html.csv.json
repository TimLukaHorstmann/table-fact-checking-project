The run time should be 24:57.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row and column in the table:\n\n- **Row 4** (corresponding to \"episode: part four\"):\n  - **Column \"viewers (in millions)\"**: The value is 10.6, which matches the claim.\n  - **Column \"run time\"**: The value is 24:57, which also matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data in Row 4 of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
