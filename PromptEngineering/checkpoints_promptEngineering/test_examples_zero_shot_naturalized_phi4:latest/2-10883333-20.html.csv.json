    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table provided, we need to break down the claim and match it with the relevant information from the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Carlton scored 14.11 as the away team**.\n2. **Melbourne scored 13.20 as the home team in the same game**.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n#### Step 1: Check Carlton's Score and Position\n- From the table, we find that Row 5 mentions:\n  - Home Team: Richmond\n  - Away Team: Carlton\n  - Carlton's Score: 14.11\n\nThis confirms that Carlton scored 14.11 as the away team in a game against Richmond.\n\n#### Step 2: Check Melbourne's Score and Position\n- From the table, we find that Row 2 mentions:\n  - Home Team: Fitzroy\n  - Away Team: Melbourne\n  - Melbourne's Score: 13.11\n\nThis indicates that Melbourne scored 13.11 as the away team in a game against Fitzroy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that Carlton and Melbourne both played in the same game, with Carlton scoring 14.11 as an away team and Melbourne scoring 13.20 as a home team. However, from our verification:\n\n- Carlton did indeed score 14.11 as an away team (Row 5).\n- Melbourne scored 13.11, not 13.20, and they were the away team, not the home team (Row 2).\n\nSince the conditions in the claim are not met simultaneously in any single game, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, we need to check the relevant cells for Carlton's score as an away team and Melbourne's score as a home team:\n\n- For Carlton: Row 5, \"away team score\" column.\n- For Melbourne: Row 2, \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the crowd sizes at VFL Park and the MCG is true or false, we need to extract relevant data from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The claim refers to two specific venues: VFL Park and the MCG.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 6 mentions a game at VFL Park with a crowd of 15,601.\n     - Row 5 mentions a game at the MCG (abbreviated as \"mcg\") with a crowd of 49,756.\n\n2. **Extract Crowd Numbers:**\n   - For VFL Park (Row 6): The crowd size is 15,601.\n   - For the MCG (Row 5): The crowd size is 49,756.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Crowds:**\n   - Calculate the difference between the crowds at the two venues:\n     \\[\n     49,756 - 15,601 = 34,155\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Difference:**\n   - The claim states that there are 14,155 fewer people at VFL Park than at the MCG.\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of 34,155.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value:**\n   - Since 34,155 is not equal to 14,155, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are:\n     - Row 5, \"crowd\" column (for MCG)\n     - Row 6, \"crowd\" column (for VFL Park)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
