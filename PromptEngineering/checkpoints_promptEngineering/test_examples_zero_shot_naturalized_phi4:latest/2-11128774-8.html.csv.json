    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine the scores of all games where Vancouver was the visitor and find out the second highest number of goals they scored in a single game.\n\nFirstly, let's identify the relevant columns for this analysis:\n- **\"visitor\"**: This column helps us confirm that the game involves Vancouver as the visiting team.\n- **\"score\"**: This column contains the scores in the format \"Vancouver's score - Opponent's score\". We are interested in the first number (Vancouver's score) in each entry where Vancouver is the visitor.\n\nNext, we will extract Vancouver's scores from relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Visitor: vancouver\n   - Score: 5 - 3\n   - Vancouver's goals: 5\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Visitor: vancouver\n   - Score: 1 - 5\n   - Vancouver's goals: 1\n\n3. **Row 4**: Vancouver is the home team, not the visitor. Not relevant.\n\n4. **Row 5**:\n   - Visitor: vancouver\n   - Score: 1 - 8\n   - Vancouver's goals: 1\n\n5. **Row 6**: Vancouver is the home team, not the visitor. Not relevant.\n\n6. **Row 7**: Vancouver is the home team, not the visitor. Not relevant.\n\n7. **Row 8**: \n   - Visitor: vancouver\n   - Score: 8 - 6\n   - Vancouver's goals: 8\n\nNow, we have the scores for all games where Vancouver was the visitor:\n- Row 1: 5 goals\n- Row 2: 1 goal\n- Row 5: 1 goal\n- Row 8: 8 goals\n\nNext, we sort these scores in descending order to find the second highest:\n- 8 (Row 8)\n- 5 (Row 1)\n- 1 (Row 2)\n- 1 (Row 5)\n\nThe second most goals Vancouver scored in a single game as the visitor is **5**.\n\nThe claim states that \"the second most goal vancouver score in a single game be 8,\" which contradicts our finding. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Row 1, column \"score\"\n- Row 2, column \"score\"\n- Row 5, column \"score\"\n- Row 8, column \"score\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
