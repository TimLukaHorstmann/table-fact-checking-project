    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Donte Greene gets the highest number of rebounds in 3 games,\" we need to identify instances where Donte Greene has the highest rebound count and check if this occurs in three separate games.\n\nLet's examine the relevant column for each game:\n\n1. **Row 1**: High Rebounds: Demarcus Cousins (8)\n2. **Row 2**: High Rebounds: Carl Landry (12)\n3. **Row 3**: High Rebounds: Omri Casspi (11)\n4. **Row 4**: High Rebounds: Omri Casspi, Demarcus Cousins (6 each)\n5. **Row 5**: High Rebounds: Jason Thompson (11)\n6. **Row 6**: High Rebounds: Omri Casspi, Demarcus Cousins (8 each)\n7. **Row 7**: High Rebounds: Jason Thompson (9)\n8. **Row 8**: High Rebounds: Demarcus Cousins (10)\n9. **Row 9**: High Rebounds: Demarcus Cousins (8)\n10. **Row 10**: High Rebounds: Dont\u00e9 Greene (11) - This is one instance where Donte Greene has the highest rebounds.\n11. **Row 11**: High Rebounds: Samuel Dalembert (12)\n12. **Row 12**: High Rebounds: Jason Thompson (12)\n13. **Row 13**: High Rebounds: Demarcus Cousins, Carl Landry (8 each)\n14. **Row 14**: High Rebounds: Omri Casspi, Tyreke Evans, Jason Thompson (8 each)\n15. **Row 15**: High Rebounds: Demarcus Cousins, Carl Landry (10 each)\n\nFrom the data above, Donte Greene has the highest number of rebounds only in Row 10. He does not have the highest rebound count in any other game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Donte Greene does not achieve the highest number of rebounds in three games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
