    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the height for demetrius jemison be 6 - 3\", we need to find the relevant data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the row related to Demetrius Jemison:**\n   - From Row 7, it's mentioned that the name is \"demetrius jemison\".\n\n2. **Check the height information for Demetrius Jemison:**\n   - In Row 7, under the column labeled \"height\", the value is listed as \"6 - 8\".\n\n3. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states that his height should be \"6 - 3\". \n   - However, according to the table, Demetrius Jemison's actual height is \"6 - 8\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The information in Row 7 contradicts the claim.\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell for verification:\n- Row index: 7 (since indexing starts from 0 in typical data formats)\n- Column name: \"height\"\n\nThus, the JSON object should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that I used a zero-based index for \"Row Index\" in the relevant cells list.",
