    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"reason to be pretty be nominate for best play more than 1 time\" is true or false based on the given table, let's break down and verify each part of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Play**: The claim mentions \"reason to be pretty,\" which suggests that we are looking for entries related to this specific play.\n\n2. **Check the Category**: We need to look at nominations for the category \"best play.\"\n\n3. **Count the Nominations**: We want to determine if there is more than one nomination for \"best play\" specifically linked to \"reason to be pretty.\"\n\nNow, let's go through the table:\n\n- Row 1: \n  - Year: 2009\n  - Award Ceremony: Tony Award\n  - Category: Best Play\n  - Nominee: Neil Labute (likely associated with \"reason to be pretty\" as he is the playwright)\n  - Result: Nominated\n\nThis row indicates that \"reason to be pretty\" was nominated for the \"best play\" category at the Tony Awards.\n\n- Row 4:\n  - Year: 2009\n  - Award Ceremony: Drama Desk Award\n  - Category: Outstanding Play\n  - Nominee: Outstanding Play (not specific to a title)\n  - Result: Nominated\n\nThis row does not specifically mention \"reason to be pretty,\" just an outstanding play nomination.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim:\n\n- **\"reason to be pretty\" nominated for best play more than 1 time**: From the table, we see that there is only one specific mention of a \"best play\" nomination directly linked to \"reason to be pretty\" (Row 1).
