    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if \"0.17\" is indeed the highest swing to gain point in the Scottish Parliament election of 2007 according to the given table. The relevant column for this verification is \"swing to gain.\"\n\nLet's examine the values in the \"swing to gain\" column across all rows:\n\n- Row 1: 0.17\n- Row 2: 1.01\n- Row 3: 1.07\n- Row 4: 1.92\n- Row 5: 2.13\n- Row 6: 2.91\n- Row 7: 2.92\n- Row 8: 2.96\n- Row 9: 3.56\n- Row 10: 4.41\n- Row 11: 4.91\n\nThe highest swing to gain value in the table is \"4.91\" (Row 11), not \"0.17\". Therefore, the claim that \"0.17 be the highest swing to gain point in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007\" is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification include all rows where the \"swing to gain\" column is present because we need to compare each value to determine if any are higher than 0.17.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"swing to gain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
