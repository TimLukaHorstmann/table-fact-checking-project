    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Tom Watson won in year 1977 and 1981,\" we need to examine the relevant row in the table for Tom Watson's information.\n\nThe naturalized table provides data organized into rows, where each row corresponds to a player with specific details about their wins, country, years won, total score, and strokes to par. We will focus on:\n\n- The \"player\" column to locate Tom Watson.\n- The \"year (s) won\" column to confirm the years he won in.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n1. **Locate Tom Watson:**\n   - According to the table structure, we need to find the row where the player is listed as \"Tom Watson.\"\n\n2. **Check Year(s) Won:**\n   - Once located, examine the \"year (s) won\" column in this row to verify if it includes both 1977 and 1981.\n\n### Relevant Row Identification\n\n- Upon reviewing the table:\n  - Row 6 corresponds to Tom Watson.\n  \n3. **Verify the Years:**\n   - In Row 6, the \"year (s) won\" column reads \"1977, 1981.\"\n\nThis matches the claim exactly, confirming that Tom Watson did indeed win in both 1977 and 1981.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the data supports the claim accurately, we can conclude that the statement is true.
