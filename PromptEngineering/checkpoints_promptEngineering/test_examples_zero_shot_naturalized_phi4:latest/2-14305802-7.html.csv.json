Identify the column for the date (March) and check the value corresponding to row with game number 74.\n2. Find the opponent listed for the same row where March is 28.\n3. Compare the identified opponent with the claim.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Check the \"game\" column to find row 14, as it corresponds to game 74 (March 28).\n- Verify the \"march\" column in row 14 to ensure the date is indeed March 28.\n- Confirm the \"opponent\" column for this row to see if it lists \"colorado rockies.\"\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row index 13 (as per zero-based indexing) for game number 74 has March as 28 and opponent as Colorado Rockies.\n\nThe claim is supported by these relevant conditions being met:\n\n1. The date in the \"march\" column matches the claimed date.\n2. The opponent listed matches \"colorado rockies.\"\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
