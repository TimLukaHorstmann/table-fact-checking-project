    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"March - Ford be 1 of 2 constructor to feature 3 driver\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check for two main conditions:\n\n1. Identify if the constructor \"March-Ford\" features exactly three drivers.\n2. Determine if there is only one other constructor that also has exactly three drivers.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table to find occurrences of constructors with their respective driver counts:\n\n- **Row 4**: March - Ford, Driver: Hans-Joachim Stuck (1st instance)\n- **Row 14**: March - Ford, Driver: Lella Lombardi (2nd instance)\n- **Row 17**: March - Ford, Driver: Vittorio Brambilla (3rd instance)\n\nThe constructor \"March-Ford\" features exactly three drivers: Hans-Joachim Stuck, Lella Lombardi, and Vittorio Brambilla.\n\nNext, we need to check for other constructors with exactly three drivers:\n\n- **Ferrari**:\n  - Row 1: Driver: Niki Lauda\n  - Row 7: Driver: Clay Regazzoni\n\n  Ferrari has two drivers.\n\n- **Tyrrell-Ford**:\n  - Row 2: Driver: Patrick Depailler\n  - Row 5: Driver: Jody Scheckter\n\n  Tyrrell-Ford has two drivers.\n\n- **Shadow-Ford**:\n  - Row 3: Driver: Tom Pryce\n  - Row 15: Driver: Jean-Pierre Jarier\n\n  Shadow-Ford has two drivers.\n\n- **McLaren-Ford**:\n  - Row 6: Driver: Jochen Mass\n  - Row 16: Driver: James Hunt\n\n  McLaren-Ford has two drivers.\n\n- **Wolf-Williams-Ford**:\n  - Row 8: Driver: Jacky Ickx\n\n  Wolf-Williams-Ford has one driver.\n\n- **Williams-Ford**:\n  - Row 9: Driver: Renzo Zorzi\n\n  Williams-Ford has one driver.\n\n- **Brabham-Alfa Romeo**:\n  - Row 10: Driver: Carlos Pace\n  - Row 12: Driver: Carlos Reutemann\n\n  Brabham-Alfa Romeo has two drivers.\n\n- **Fittipaldi-Ford**:\n  - Row 11: Driver: Ingo Hoffmann\n  - Row 13: Driver: Emerson Fittipaldi\n\n  Fittipaldi-Ford has two drivers.\n\n- **Ligier-Matra**:\n  - Row 18: Driver: Jacques Laffite\n\n  Ligier-Matra has one driver.\n\n- **Lotus-Ford**:\n  - Row 19: Driver: Ronnie Peterson\n  - Row 20: Driver: Mario Andretti\n\n  Lotus-Ford has two drivers.\n\n- **Penske-Ford**:\n  - Row 21: Driver: John Watson\n\n  Penske-Ford has one driver.\n\n- **BRM**:\n  - Row 22: Driver: Ian Ashley\n\n  BRM has one driver.\n\nAfter reviewing all the constructors, no other constructor features exactly three drivers. Therefore, \"March-Ford\" is indeed one of the two constructors to feature three drivers, with the second being none (since no other constructor meets this criterion).\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
