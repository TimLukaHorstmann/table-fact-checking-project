    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"melfi play at the arturo valerio\" is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The club named \"Melfi\" should exist in the table.\n2. The stadium for this club should be \"arturo valerio\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the provided data:\n\n- **Check for Club Name**: Look through each row in the table to find a club with the name \"melfi\".\n  \n  - Row 13 mentions: \n    - club: melfi\n    - stadium: arturo valerio\n\n- **Stadium Verification**: Confirm that the stadium listed for this club is indeed \"arturo valerio\".\n\n  - The row indicates:\n    - stadium: arturo valerio\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, as we found the club \"melfi\" in Row 13 and verified that their stadium is \"arturo valerio\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's provide the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the pasquale ianniello stadium have a capacity of 4000,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify which club uses the Pasquale Ianniello stadium.\n2. Verify that this stadium has a capacity of 4000.\n\nLet's review each relevant row in the naturalized table format:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Club: Arzanese\n  - City: arzano (playing in frattamaggiore)\n  - Stadium: pasquale ianniello\n  - Capacity: 4000\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that Row 2 matches the conditions specified in the claim. The club associated with Pasquale Ianniello stadium is Arzanese and indeed the capacity listed for this stadium is 4000.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in Row 2:\n\n- The Pasquale Ianniello stadium belongs to the club Arzanese.\n- Its capacity is 4000.\n\nThe cells that are relevant to verify the truth of the claim are:\n- \"Stadium\" from Row 2 which confirms it as Pasquale Ianniello.\n- \"Capacity\" from Row 2 which confirms its value as 4000.\n\nSince all conditions in the claim align with the data provided, we can conclude the answer is TRUE.
