According to the table:\n    - Row 8, Column \"debut year\": 2008\n  - This matches the claim that he debuted in 2008.\n\n- **Step 2: Check Goals Scored**\n  - Again, locate Diego Milito's row in the table, which is Row 8.\n  - Find the \"goals\" column for this row. According to the table:\n    - Row 8, Column \"goals\": 86\n  - This matches the claim that he has scored 86 goals.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are verified and supported by the data in the table.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both parts of the claim are confirmed by the relevant cells in the table, we conclude that the claim is TRUE. Here's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based, so Row 8 in the naturalized format corresponds to `row_index` 7.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"0 goals occur with Diego Milito in a debut year before 2008,\" we need to check two main conditions from the table for Diego Milito:\n\n1. Whether his debut year is before 2008.\n2. Whether he has scored any goals (i.e., more than 0).\n\n**Relevant Information:**\n- From Row 8 of the table, we have:\n  - Name: Diego Milito\n  - Debut Year: 2008\n  - Goals: 86\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Debut Year Check:** The debut year for Diego Milito is explicitly given as 2008. This means his debut year is not before 2008, so the first condition of the claim (a debut year before 2008) is false.\n\n2. **Goals Check:** The goals scored by Diego Milito are 86, which is greater than 0. Thus, even if his debut year had been before 2008, he has still scored goals.\n\nSince the first condition is not satisfied (his debut year is not before 2008), the claim does not hold true regardless of the number of goals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is FALSE because Diego Milito's debut year is 2008, which does not satisfy the \"before 2008\" condition.
