The specific date of interest, which is \"July 16.\"\n2. The total score being the lowest and specifically mentioning that the total number of runs was 3.\n\nFirstly, we identify all entries in the table with the date \"July 16.\" According to the data:\n- Row 16 has the date \"july 16\" with an opponent \"angels\" and a score \"3 - 0.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine if this game indeed had the lowest total runs scored compared to all other games listed in the table. To do so, we'll calculate the total number of runs for each game by adding the home team's runs to the visiting team's runs.\n\nHere are calculations for some relevant entries:\n- Row 1: Total Runs = 7 + 6 = 13\n- Row 2: Total Runs = 6 + 3 = 9\n- ...\n- Row 16: Total Runs = 3 + 0 = 3 (July 16, specifically mentioned in the claim)\n- ...\n- Checking other rows to ensure no lower total exists:\n    - For example,\n    - Row 14: Total Runs = 5 + 3 = 8\n    - Row 15: Total Runs = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nAfter reviewing all entries, it is confirmed that the lowest total score across all games listed in the table is indeed on \"July 16\" with a combined score of 3 runs. No other game has fewer than 3 total runs.\n\nThus, the claim that the lowest scoring game was on July 16th with only 3 runs scored is true based on our analysis of the data provided.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion are from:\n- Row 16 (date: \"july 16\", score: \"3 - 0\").\n\nTherefore, the final JSON object summarizing the findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index uses zero-based indexing, where the first entry (Row 1) is represented as index 0 in the JSON.",

The July 16 game indeed had the fewest total runs.\n2. The number of total runs on that day was 9.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row from the table for the month of July, focusing on the \"score\" and \"date\" columns to find games with fewer than or equal to 9 total runs:\n\n- **Row 1 (July 1)**: Score is 7 - 6.
