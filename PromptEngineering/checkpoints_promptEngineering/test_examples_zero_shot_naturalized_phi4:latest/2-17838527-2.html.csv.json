    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medal , total gold medal be 13,\" let's break it down into components and verify each against the given table:\n\n1. **Rank 1**: We need to find the row where rank is 1.\n   - The table specifies that Row 1 has `rank: 1`.\n\n2. **Total of more than 21 medals**: For the row with rank 1, check if the total number of medals exceeds 21.\n   - In Row 1, `total: 22`, which satisfies this condition as 22 is greater than 21.\n\n3. **Total gold medals be 13**: Finally, for the same row (rank 1), verify that the number of gold medals is 13.\n   - In Row 1, `gold: 13`, confirming this part of the claim.\n\nSince all conditions are met by Row 1 in the table, we conclude that the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to check these conditions are:\n\n- Cell at `Row 1`, column `rank` for checking rank.\n- Cell at `Row 1`, column `total` for verifying total medals more than 21.\n- Cell at `Row 1`, column `gold` for confirming the number of gold medals.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"rank 3 have 6 total medal,\" we need to verify if the row corresponding to rank 3 in the table has a total of 6 medals.\n\n1. Identify the relevant row for rank 3:\n   - According to the table, Row 3 corresponds to rank 3.\n   \n2. Check the 'total' value for Row 3:\n   - In Row 3, the 'total' column indicates that there are 16 total medals (gold: 1, silver: 3, bronze: 12).\n\nThe claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals, but our verification shows that it actually has 16 total medals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is located at:\n- Row index: 2 (since row indices are typically zero-based in many contexts, and we start counting from Row 1 as row 0)\n- Column name: \"total\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
