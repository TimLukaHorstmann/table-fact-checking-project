According to the table:\n     - Row 4 has \"player\": jp maher.\n\n2. **Check the Date for this Player:**\n   - For Row 4, which corresponds to \"jp maher\", check the date.\n   - The date in Row 4 is \"20 - 02 - 2003\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Date:**\n   - The claim states that jp maher have a date of \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n   - However, from the table, we see that the actual date for jp maher is \"20 - 02 - 2003\", not \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the dates do not match, the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the JSON response as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- The relevant cells are those containing the player name (\"jp maher\") and the date associated with him in the table.\n- These cells were located in Row 4 (index 3 since indexing starts from 0), specifically checking columns \"player\" and \"date\".",
