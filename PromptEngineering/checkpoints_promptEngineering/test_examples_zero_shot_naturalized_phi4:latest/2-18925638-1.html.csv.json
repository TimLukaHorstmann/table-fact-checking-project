Therefore, this part of the condition fails.\n\n2. Compare Week 16 attendance with Week 17:\n   - Week 16: 64,285\n   - Week 17: 68,436\n\n   The attendance in week 16 (64,285) is indeed less than the attendance in week 17 (68,436). This part of the condition holds true.\n\nSince both conditions must be satisfied for the claim to be true, and the first comparison fails, the overall claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells are those corresponding to the attendance figures of weeks 9, 16, and 17.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant details from the table provided in naturalized format:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states two conditions about weeks 14 and 15:\n1. There was a difference of 37 fewer crowd attendance in week 15 compared to week 14.\n2. Both games were losses.\n\n#### Verification Steps:\n\n**Step 1: Verify Attendance Difference**\n- **Week 14**: \n  - Date: December 9, 2002\n  - Attendance: 73,609\n\n- **Week 15**:\n  - Date: December 15, 2002\n  - Attendance: 73,572\n\nCalculate the difference in attendance:\n\\[ \\text{Attendance Difference} = 73,609 - 73,572 = 37 \\]\n\nThe claim about the attendance being 37 fewer in week 15 is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Verify Game Results**\n- **Week 14**: \n  - Result: w 27 - 9 (Win)\n\n- **Week 15**: \n  - Result: w 23 - 17 (Win)\n\nThe claim that both games were losses is incorrect. Both games were actually wins.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the second condition in the claim (both games being losses) is false, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Week 14: Attendance and Result\n- Week 15: Attendance and Result\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
