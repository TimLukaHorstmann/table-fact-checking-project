    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"kansas city have no post-season record in 2013,\" we need to focus on identifying which row in the table corresponds to Kansas City and what data is present for their post-season record in 2013.\n\nFirst, let's locate the relevant row:\n- We search through each row to find where \"mlb affiliate\" is listed as \"kansas city.\" \n- Row 13 mentions \"kansas city.\"\n\nNow, check the post-season information for Kansas City in 2013 (Row 13):\n- The claim specifically states that there is no post-season record for Kansas City.\n- Looking at Row 13 under \"post - season record,\" we see \"-\", which indicates no recorded data. \n- Similarly, under \"post - season win %,\" the cell also shows \"-\", confirming no post-season games were played or recorded.\n\nThus, both conditions of having no post-season record and no post-season winning percentage are satisfied in Row 13 for Kansas City. This fully supports the claim.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this information include:\n- The \"mlb affiliate\" column to confirm that it is indeed Kansas City.\n- The \"post - season record\" column to check if there is any recorded data.\n- The \"post - season win %\" column to ensure no percentage has been logged.\n\nIn conclusion, the relevant cells are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Houston have no post-season record\" is true or false, we need to examine the table's relevant rows and columns related to Houston's post-season records.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The rows of interest are those where the `mlb affiliate` is \"houston\". These rows include seasons 2001 to 2012.\n\n2. **Examine Post-Season Records for Each Relevant Row:**\n   - **Row 1 (2001):** \n     - `post-season record`: 4 - 0\n     - `post-season win %`: 1.000\n     - This indicates a post-season record exists.\n   \n   - **Rows 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 (2002 to 2012):**\n     - All these rows have `post-season record`: `-` and `post-season win %`: `-`.\n     - These indicate no post-season records for these years.\n\n   - **Rows 3 and 6 (2003 and 2006):**\n     - Both have a `post-season record` of 0 - 2.\n     - Both have a `post-season win %` of 000.\n     - This indicates post-season records exist for these years as well.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Houston has post-season records in the seasons: 2001, 2003, and 2006. \n- Therefore, the claim \"Houston have no post-season record\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells are those related to the `post-season record` and `post-season win %` for rows where Houston is the MLB affiliate (rows 1 to 12), specifically focusing on non-empty entries:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
