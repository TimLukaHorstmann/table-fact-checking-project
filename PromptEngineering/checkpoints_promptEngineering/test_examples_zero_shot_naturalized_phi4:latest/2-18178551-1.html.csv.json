The last match played before 24 June.\n2. The first match after 24 June.\n\nThe relevant columns for this verification are:\n- `date`: To check the dates of matches around June and November.\n- `status` or `opposing teams`: To ensure these are actual match entries, not irrelevant data.\n\nFrom the table provided:\n\n1. **Last Match Before 24 June:**\n   - Row 7 mentions a match on 24/06/2000 against South Africa (second test).\n   - Therefore, we need to find the last recorded match before this date.\n   - Row 6 shows a match against South Africa on 17/06/2000 (first test), which is just before 24 June.\n\n2. **First Match After 24 June:**\n   - The first match after 24 June is indicated in Row 8, with Australia on 18/11/2000 at Twickenham, London (test match).\n\n**Calculation of Days Between Matches:**\n\n- From 17 June to 18 November:\n  - Counting days from 17 June to 18 November gives us:\n    - June: 13 days remaining after the 17th\n    - July: 31 days\n    - August: 31 days\n    - September: 30 days\n    - October: 31 days\n    - November: 18 days\n\n- Total Days = 13 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 18 (November) = 154 days.\n\nTo convert the number of days to months, we divide by approximately 30.44 (the average number of days in a month):\n\n- Months = 154 / 30.44 \u2248 5.06\n\nThis means the time between matches is just over 5 months, not under 5 months as claimed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"England go just under 5 months without a match, from 24 June to 18 November\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells for verifying the dates and ensuring these are matches include rows related to dates around 17/06/2000 to 18/11/2000.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"england cone time the most points against argentina,\" we need to carefully examine the relevant parts of the provided table.\n\n1. **Interpretation of the Claim**:\n   - The claim is suggesting that England scored the most points against Argentina compared to other teams mentioned in the table.\n   \n2. **Relevant Data Extraction**:\n   - We need to extract data related to matches played by England, focusing on the opponent team and the points scored.\n\n3. **Identifying Relevant Rows**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"against argentina,\" so we will focus on the row where Argentina is listed as an opposing team.\n   - From the table, Row 9 has Argentina as the opposing team with 0 points scored against them by England.\n\n4. **Comparison of Scores**:\n   - We need to compare the score in Row 9 (against Argentina) with scores from all other rows since they also represent matches played by England.\n   - Extracting the 'against' column values for each row:\n     - Row 1: Ireland, 18 points\n     - Row 2: France, 9 points\n     - Row 3: Wales, 12 points\n     - Row 4: Italy, 12 points\n     - Row 5: Scotland, 19 points\n     - Row 6: South Africa, 18 points\n     - Row 7: South Africa, 22 points\n     - Row 8: Australia, 19 points\n     - Row 9: Argentina, 0 points (relevant for the claim)\n     - Row 10: South Africa, 17 points\n\n5. **Evaluation**:\n   - The maximum score against any team in this dataset is 22 points (Row 7, against South Africa).\n   - Against Argentina, England scored only 0 points.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that \"england cone time the most point against argentina\" is false because England did not score more points against Argentina than they did in other matches listed.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
