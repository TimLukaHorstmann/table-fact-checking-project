However, there's no direct mention of Mauro Baldi.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify Highest Points\n- We need to check if 3 points in 1983 are indeed the highest for any entry associated with Mauro Baldi.\n- The table shows points for different years:\n  - **Row 1 & 2 (1982):** 2 points each\n  - **Row 4 (1984):** 0 points\n  - **Row 5 (1985):** 0 points\n\nThe highest points in the table are 3, which occur in Row 3 for the year 1983.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\n- The claim states Mauro Baldi's highest points were in 1983 with Marlboro Team Alfa Romeo.\n- While the table shows that 1983 had the highest points (3), it does not explicitly link these points to Mauro Baldi, as no driver information is provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince the table lacks specific driver data, we cannot definitively confirm that Mauro Baldi achieved his highest points in 1983 with Marlboro Team Alfa Romeo.
