    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to identify if there are two players from Australia who have served as nightwatchmen in cricket matches according to the table provided.\n\nA nightwatchman is typically a lower-order batsman sent up to bat before the tailenders in order to protect better batsmen from having to face the new ball and possible early dismissals at the start of an innings, particularly under challenging conditions like poor light or deteriorating pitch. The score being unusually high for their batting position (e.g., 100s or more) often suggests a nightwatchman role.\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Player: Nasim-ul-Ghani, Team: Pakistan, Score: 101, versus: England, Year: 1962.\n   - Not relevant as the player is from Pakistan.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Player: Tony Mann, Team: Australia, Score: 105, versus: India, Year: 1977.\n   - Relevant because the player is from Australia and has a high score (105) for a typical lower-order batsman, suggesting he might have been a nightwatchman.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Player: Syed Kirmani, Team: India, Score: 101 not out, versus: Australia, Year: 1979.\n   - Not relevant as the player is from India.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Player: Mark Boucher, Team: South Africa, Score: 125, versus: Zimbabwe, Year: 1999.\n   - Not relevant as the player is from South Africa.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Player: Mark Boucher, Team: South Africa, Score: 108, versus: England, Year: 1999.\n   - Not relevant as the player is from South Africa.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Player: Jason Gillespie, Team: Australia, Score: 201 not out, versus: Bangladesh, Year: 2006.\n   - Relevant because the player is from Australia and has an exceptionally high score (201 not out) for a lower-order batsman, strongly suggesting he was a nightwatchman.\n\nFrom this analysis, there are two players from Australia who appear to have served as nightwatchmen based on their unusually high scores:\n\n- Tony Mann (Row 2)\n- Jason Gillespie (Row 6)\n\nTherefore, the claim \"2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from australia\" is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
