    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the information regarding gold medalists for each year listed in the table and check if they have been different every year except 1994 and 1998.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Extract Gold Medalists:**\n   - 1982: nadia al - moutawaa\n   - 1986: takashi tomura\n   - 1994: konoshin kuwahara\n   - 1998: jin kanno\n   - 2002: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski\n   - 2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi\n   - 2010: ramzy al duhami\n\n2. **Check for Repeated Gold Medalists:**\n   - We need to verify if any gold medalist is repeated in different years, except possibly for the years 1994 and 1998.\n   - In 1994, konoshin kuwahara won the gold.\n   - In 1998, jin kanno won the gold.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Check if any other year has the same gold medalist as in 1994 or 1998:\n     - nadia al - moutawaa (1982) is not konoshin kuwahara.\n     - takashi tomura (1986) is not konoshin kuwahara.\n     - mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski (2002) is not konoshin kuwahara or jin kanno.\n     - ali yousuf al - rumaihi (2006) is not konoshin kuwahara or jin kanno.\n     - ramzy al duhami (2010) is not konoshin kuwahara or jin kanno.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - No other years have the same gold medalist as 1994 or 1998, so the condition that they are different every year except possibly these two holds true.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to check the \"gold\" column for each row to verify this claim.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 1 (1982): Gold medalist\n- Row 2 (1986): Gold medalist\n- Row 3 (1994): Gold medalist\n- Row 4 (1998): Gold medalist\n- Row 5 (2002): Gold medalist\n- Row 6 (2006): Gold medalist\n- Row 7 (2010): Gold medalist\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each part of it:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time.\"\n   - It specifies Seoul as a location where these games were hosted twice.\n\n2. **Checking the Table:**\n   - We need to identify all instances of locations associated with South Korea.\n   - Row 2 mentions \"seoul\" as the location in 1986. \n   - There is no other row that mentions \"seoul,\" so it appears only once in the table.\n   - No other location in the table refers to a city in South Korea.\n\n3. **Verification of Conditions:**\n   - For South Korea to host more than once, there must be multiple entries for locations in South Korea (like Seoul).\n   - There is no repeated entry for any South Korean city in the provided rows.\n   - Therefore, South Korea did not host the equestrian events more than once according to this table.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time\" is false because there is no evidence in the table showing South Korea hosting multiple times.\n   - Additionally, Seoul appears only once as a host location in the provided data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those that provide information about the locations where the games were hosted:\n     - Row 2, column \"location\" (since it mentions \"seoul\").\n\nGiven these observations, the correct determination is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
