Since no specific position is given for his international debut in 1897 under rugby union, and since the information we have about his position (as forward) comes from when he played cross-code rugby, this does not support him playing as a center.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, Alex Laidlaw was listed as a forward during his time in rugby league, not a center. There's no explicit indication that he played as a center in 1897 or any other year mentioned for rugby union matches in the table.\n\nGiven this evaluation:\n\n- The player is correctly identified as Alex Laidlaw.\n- His position as a center in 1897 cannot be confirmed from the table and is contradicted by his later listed forward position.\n\nThus, the claim \"alex laidlaw play centre in 1897\" does not hold true according to the information provided. \n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
