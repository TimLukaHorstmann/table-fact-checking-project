    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify three specific conditions from the table: \n\n1. The annual ridership in 2012 is 123219300.\n2. The rider per mile is 4056.\n3. There are 44 stations.\n\nLet's examine each condition one by one:\n\n- **Annual Ridership (2012):** We look for a row where this value matches 123219300. By checking the table, we find that Row 5 has an annual ridership of 123219300.\n\n- **Rider per Mile:** In the same Row 5, the rider per mile is given as 4056, which matches the claim.\n\n- **Stations:** Again in Row 5, the number of stations listed is 44, which also aligns with the claim.\n\nSince all three conditions are met by Row 5, the claim is fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are:\n- Annual ridership (2012) in Row 5.\n- Rider per mile in Row 5.\n- Stations in Row 5.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the results:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"annual ridership (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stations\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
