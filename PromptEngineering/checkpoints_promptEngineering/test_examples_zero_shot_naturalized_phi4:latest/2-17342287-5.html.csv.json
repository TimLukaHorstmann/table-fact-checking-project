    "resp": "To verify the claim that there were \"8 games at the Boston Garden, all before December 17,\" we need to analyze each game entry in the table for its location and date.\n\n1. **Location Check**: We'll identify which rows have \"boston garden\" as their location.\n2. **Date Check**: For those identified locations, we will further filter by checking if the date is before December 17.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Game: 20)**\n  - Location: Boston Garden\n  - Date: December 3\n\n- **Row 2 (Game: 21)**\n  - Location: St Louis Arena\n  - Date: December 4\n  \n- **Row 3 (Game: 22)**\n  - Location: Cincinnati\n  - Date: December 5\n\n- **Row 4 (Game: 23)**\n  - Location: New York, NY\n  - Date: December 7\n\n- **Row 5 (Game: 24)**\n  - Location: Boston Garden\n  - Date: December 8\n\n- **Row 6 (Game: 25)**\n  - Location: Boston Garden\n  - Date: December 11\n\n- **Row 7 (Game: 26)**\n  - Location: Boston Garden\n  - Date: December 15\n\n- **Row 8 (Game: 27)**\n  - Location: Detroit\n  - Date: December 17\n\n- **Row 9 (Game: 28)**\n  - Location: Boston Garden\n  - Date: December 22\n\n- **Row 10 (Game: 29)**\n  - Location: Baltimore\n  - Date: December 25\n\n- **Row 11 (Game: 30)**\n  - Location: Baltimore\n  - Date: December 26\n\n- **Row 12 (Game: 31)**\n  - Location: Baltimore\n  - Date: December 28\n\n- **Row 13 (Game: 32)**\n  - Location: Madison Square Garden\n  - Date: December 29\n\n- **Row 14 (Game: 33)**\n  - Location: Providence\n  - Date: December 30\n\nFrom the above, we identify rows with games at Boston Garden and check their dates:\n\n- Row 1: December 3\n- Row 5: December 8\n- Row 6: December 11\n- Row 7: December 15\n- Row 9: December 22 (this date is not before December 17)\n\nOnly rows 1, 5, 6, and 7 meet the criteria of being at Boston Garden with dates before December 17.\n\nThus, there are only **4** games that match both conditions in the claim. The claim states \"8 games,\" which is incorrect based on our analysis.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this include the location and date for rows:\n\n- Row 1: Location / Attendance, Date\n- Row 5: Location / Attendance, Date\n- Row 6: Location / Attendance, Date\n- Row 7: Location / Attendance, Date\n- Row 9 (for confirming it does not meet the claim): Location / Attendance, Date\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
