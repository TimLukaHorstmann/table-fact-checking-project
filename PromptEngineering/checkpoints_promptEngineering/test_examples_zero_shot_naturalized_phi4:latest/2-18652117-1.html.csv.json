Identify which player(s) come from Ohio State.\n2. Check if this player plays for New York.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step by step using the given table:\n\n- **Step 1**: Find the player from Ohio State.\n  - Looking at each row, we identify that Row 3 has a college entry of \"ohio state\". Thus, the relevant information is:\n    - Player: Matt Snell\n    - College: Ohio State\n\n- **Step 2**: Determine if this player plays for New York.\n  - From Row 3, check the team column. The team listed is \"new york\".\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (Matt Snell is from Ohio State and plays for New York), the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 3, Column: college\n- Row 3, Column: team\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The player with Pick Number 7 is Tony Lorick.\n2. This player (Tony Lorick) was picked by the team \"Denver\".\n\nLet's check these against the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Check if the player with Pick Number 7 is Tony Lorick.\n- From Row 7 of the table:\n  - Pick: 7\n  - Player: Tony Lorick\n\nThis condition is satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2: Check if this player (Tony Lorick) was picked by Denver.\n- According to Row 7:\n  - Team: Oakland\n\nAccording to the table, the team that made pick number 7 is \"Oakland\", not \"Denver\". Therefore, this condition is not satisfied.\n\nSince one of the conditions for verifying the claim is false, we conclude that the entire claim is FALSE. Now, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n1. From Row 7:\n   - Column: pick -> Value: 7\n   - Column: player -> Value: Tony Lorick\n\n2.
