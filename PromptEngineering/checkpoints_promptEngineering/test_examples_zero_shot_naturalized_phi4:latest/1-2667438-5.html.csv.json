    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to examine the information provided in the table regarding episodes with a specific number both in series and season.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"series 32 originally air on december 21 , 2006.\"\n\n2. **Relevant Table Columns**:\n   - `no in series`: This column contains the serial numbers of the episodes.\n   - `original air date`: This column provides the dates when each episode was first aired.\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - We need to identify the row where the `no in series` is 32.\n   - Check the `original air date` for that particular row to see if it matches \"December 21, 2006.\"\n\n4. **Examination of Table Rows**:\n   - Row 10 contains: \n     - `no in series`: 32\n     - `title`: love is blind\n     - `directed by`: andy cadiff\n     - `written by`: earl davis\n     - `original air date`: December 21, 2006\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The episode with `no in series` as 32 indeed has an original air date of \"December 21, 2006,\" matching the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Title**: Check if there is an episode titled \"a bitter pill to swallow\" directed by Andy Cadiff.\n2. **Original Air Date**: Verify whether this episode originally aired on November 19, 2006.\n\nLet's break down the verification process using the table provided:\n\n- The claim states that the title of the episode is \"a bitter pill to swallow\" and it was directed by Andy Cadiff. From Row 21 in the table:\n  - **Title**: \"a bitter pill to swallow\"\n  - **Directed By**: Andy Cadiff\n  This confirms the first part of the claim regarding the title and director.\n\n- The claim also states that this episode originally aired on November 19, 2006. However, from Row 21 in the table:\n  - **Original Air Date**: April 1, 2007\n\nThe original air date does not match the date mentioned in the claim (November 19, 2006). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- From Row 21: \"title\", \"directed by\", and \"original air date\".\n\nThus, the final JSON object with the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
