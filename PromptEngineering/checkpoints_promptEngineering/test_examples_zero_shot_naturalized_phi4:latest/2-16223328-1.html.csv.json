We need to find this poll source in the table.\n   - According to the given rows:\n     - **Row 2**: The poll source is \"Rasmussen reports / fox news\".\n\n2. **Check the Lead Margin for the Identified Row:**\n   - In Row 2, we observe the lead margin associated with \"Rasmussen Reports / Fox News\".\n   - The lead margin listed in Row 2 is **0.0**.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the lead margin should be **0.8**.\n   - However, from the table, we see it is actually **0.0** for \"Rasmussen Reports / Fox News\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data in the table does not support the claim that \"Rasmussen Report / Fox News\" have a lead margin of 0.8. The actual value given in the table is 0.0.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether this claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"poll source\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lead margin\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Row Index**: Row indices are zero-based as per typical programming conventions, so Row 2 in natural language corresponds to `row_index: 1`.\n- **Column Names**: The relevant columns for verifying the claim were \"poll source\" (to confirm which poll we are looking at) and \"lead margin\" (to check the actual value).",
