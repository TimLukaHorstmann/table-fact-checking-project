    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the team rocketsports have a qual 2 time of 58.385,\" we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The team must be \"rocketsports.\"\n2. The Qual 2 time for this team must be exactly 58.385.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row and check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 11**: \n  - Team: rocketsports racing\n  - Qual 2: 58.385\n\nThis matches both conditions stated in the claim. Therefore, there is a match for the team \"rocketsports\" with the exact Qual 2 time of 58.385.\n\nAfter checking all relevant rows, we find that Row 11 satisfies both parts of the claim. Hence, the statement about Team Rocketsports having a Qual 2 time of 58.385 is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cell for verifying this claim is from:\n- Row index: 10 (because row indices start at 0 in this context)\n- Column name: \"qual 2\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the answer and the relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"qual 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
