    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on identifying information from the table about the race held at Epsom. The specific part of the claim to verify is whether there were only 4 runners in a race at Epsom and if it was the lowest attendance race among all listed.\n\n1. **Identifying Races at Epsom:**\n   - We look for races with \"course\" as \"Epsom.\" There's one such entry:\n     - Row 5: The Epsom Derby is held at Epsom, Dist (f): 12, Course: Epsom.\n\n2. **Checking the Number of Runners in Epsom Races:**\n   - From Row 5: The number of runners for the race \"Epsom Derby\" is 15.\n   \n3. **Comparing with Other Races:**\n   - We need to compare this number (15) with the number of runners for all other races to see if any have fewer than 15 runners.\n\n4. **Checking Runner Counts Across All Rows:**\n   - Row 1: Runners = 13\n   - Row 2: Runners = 8\n   - Row 3: Runners = 4 (This is indeed the lowest, as it has fewer than Epsom's 15)\n   - Row 4: Runners = 4\n   - Row 5: Runners = 15 (Epsom Derby)\n   - Row 6: Runners = 11\n   - Row 7: Runners = 6\n   - Row 8: Runners = 10\n\n5. **Verifying the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Epsom has only 4 runners, which is incorrect because it actually has 15.\n   - Additionally, it claims to be the lowest attendance race, but races in rows 3 and 4 have fewer (only 4 each).\n\nThus, the claim \"epsom have only 4 runner , make it the lowest attend race\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
