Check if Season 10 aired in January, approximately one year after Season 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Season 2**: \n  - Look at Row 2:\n    - \"season\": 2\n    - \"original air date\": November 23, 1996\n\n  The original air date for Season 2 is November 23, 1996. This does not fall in January.\n\n- **Season 10**:\n  - Look at Row 9:\n    - \"season\": 10\n    - \"original air date\": January 11, 1997\n\n  The original air date for Season 10 is January 11, 1997, which does indeed fall in January. \n\nNow, let's check the time difference between these two dates:\n\n- **Season 2**: November 23, 1996\n- **Season 10**: January 11, 1997\n\nThe time difference is approximately 1 month and 18 days, not nearly one year.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince Season 2 did not air in January and the time gap between Season 2 and Season 10 is less than a year, the claim is false. \n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 2: \"original air date\"\n- Row 9: \"original air date\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"each of the episode titles have a letter somewhere within the title,\" we need to examine the `episode_title` column for each row in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column is `episode_title`.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - We will check if every entry in the `episode_title` column contains at least one letter (a-z or A-Z).\n\n3. **Examine Rows Individually**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \"tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 2**: \"montell jordan\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 3**: \"dru hill\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 4**: \"tyra banks / blackstreet\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 5**: \"music special\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 6**: \"a tribe called quest\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 7**: \"702\" - Does not contain any letters.\n   - **Row 8**: \"tony! toni! tone!\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 9**: \"chris farley / mint condition\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 10**: \"112\" - Does not contain any letters.\n   - **Row 11**: \"sherman hemsley / nas\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 12**: \"john leguizamo / mona lisa\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 13**: \"ray j\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 14**: \"for real\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 15**: \"aaliyah\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 16**: \"az yet\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 17**: \"monica\" - Contains letters.\n   - **Row 18**: \"mc lyte\" - Contains letters.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Rows 7 and 10 have episode titles without any letters.
