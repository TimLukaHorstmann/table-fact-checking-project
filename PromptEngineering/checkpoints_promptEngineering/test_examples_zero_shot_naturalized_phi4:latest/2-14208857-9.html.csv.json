    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the opponent on April 16 was indeed the New York Rangers.\n\n1. Identify the relevant row in the table:\n   - The date provided in the claim is \"April 16\". We look for this specific date within the table.\n   - Row 6 corresponds to the game played on April 16, as specified by the date column: \"date: april 16\".\n\n2. Verify the opponent for the identified row:\n   - In Row 6, check the \"opponent\" column.\n   - The value in this column is \"new york rangers\".\n\n3. Evaluate the claim based on these findings:\n   - Since the opponent listed in Row 6 (April 16) is indeed \"new york rangers\", the condition stated in the claim is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this are from Row 6 for both the \"date\" and \"opponent\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"game 6 be hold on april 11\", we need to check the relevant information in the table related to Game 6's date.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to confirm which game was held on April 11.\n   - Verify the details of Game 6 from the table to find its date.\n\n2. **Extract and Compare Data:**\n   - From Row 3, we see that Game 3 was held on April 11.\n   - From Row 6, Game 6 was held on April 16.\n\n3. **Determine Claim Validity:**\n   - The claim states that Game 6 was held on April 11.\n   - However, the table shows that Game 6 was actually held on April 16, not April 11.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the information from the table contradicts the claim, the statement is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Game 3 (held on April 11), refer to Row 3.\n   - For Game 6 (date verification), refer to Row 6.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
