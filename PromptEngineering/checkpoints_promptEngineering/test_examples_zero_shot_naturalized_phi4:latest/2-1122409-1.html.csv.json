    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of it against the table:\n\n1. **Driver Name**: The claim mentions \"Silvio Moser\". In Row 13 of the table, the driver is indeed Silvio Moser.\n\n2. **Laps Completed**: The claim states that he retired after completing 9 laps. According to Row 13, Silvio Moser completed 9 laps before retiring.\n\n3. **Reason for Retirement**: The claim specifies \"an oil leak\" as the reason for retirement. However, according to Row 13, the actual reason given is a \"fuel leak\".\n\n4. **Grid Position**: Finally, the grid position stated in the claim is \"grid 13\". In Row 13, Silvio Moser started from grid position 13.\n\nBased on these verifications:\n\n- The driver name matches.\n- The laps completed match.\n- The reason for retirement does not match (\"fuel leak\" instead of \"oil leak\").\n- The starting grid position matches.\n\nSince the reason for retirement is incorrect according to the claim, we conclude that the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells from the table are in Row 13 and include columns related to driver name, laps completed, time/retired (for cause), and grid position.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The driver name matches: John Miles is indeed the driver in Row 15.\n2. Laps completed also match: He retired after 3 laps, consistent with the claim.\n3. Grid position matches as well: His grid was 14.\n\nHowever, the constructor does not match the claim. According to the table, his constructor was \"lotus - ford\", not \"BRM\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince one condition of the claim (constructor) is incorrect based on the data in the table, the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation are from Row 15, specifically concerning the driver name, constructor, laps completed, and grid position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
