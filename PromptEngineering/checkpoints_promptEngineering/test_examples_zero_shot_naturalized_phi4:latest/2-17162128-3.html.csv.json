    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Steve Jones and his performance in comparison to other players from the United States with a total score of 154, we need to examine relevant pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. **Check for Players from the United States:**\n   - The claim asserts that Steve Jones is \"the only player from the United States\" with a total score of 154. Therefore, we must verify:\n     - Whether there are other players listed from the United States.\n     - If any of these other players have a total score of 154.\n\n2. **Check for Other Players with a Total Score of 154:**\n   - The claim also states that Steve Jones is \"the only player\" (not necessarily limited to the United States) with this specific total score of 154. Hence, we must verify:\n     - If any other players listed have a total score of 154.\n\nLet's examine each row in detail:\n\n- **Row 2: Fuzzy Zoeller**\n  - Country: United States\n  - Total: 151\n\n- **Row 3: Curtis Strange**\n  - Country: United States\n  - Total: 152\n\n- **Row 4: Jack Nicklaus**\n  - Country: United States\n  - Total: 153\n\n- **Row 5: Steve Jones**\n  - Country: United States\n  - Total: 154\n\n- **Row 6: Hale Irwin**\n  - Country: United States\n  - Total: WD (withdrawn)\n\nFrom this, we observe:\n- There are multiple players from the United States in the table.\n- No other player from the United States has a total score of 154; only Steve Jones does.\n\nNext, we check if any player, regardless of nationality, has a total score of 154:\n\n- **Row 1: Ernie Els**\n  - Total: 148\n\n- **Row 2: Fuzzy Zoeller**\n  - Total: 151\n\n- **Row 3: Curtis Strange**\n  - Total: 152\n\n- **Row 4: Jack Nicklaus**\n  - Total: 153\n\n- **Row 5: Steve Jones**\n  - Total: 154 (Only player with this score)\n\n- **Row 6: Hale Irwin**\n  - Total: WD\n\nNo other players have a total of 154. Thus, the claim that Steve Jones is \"the only player\" with this score holds true.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is TRUE based on our verification against the table. The relevant cells to confirm this are:\n\n- For verifying if there's any other player (regardless of nationality) with a total of 154: Row 1, Column \"Total\"; Row 2, Column \"Total\"; Row 3, Column \"Total\"; Row 4, Column \"Total\"; and Row 5, Column \"Total\".\n- For verifying the players from the United States and their totals (to ensure no other has 154): Rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, Columns \"Country\" and \"Total\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
