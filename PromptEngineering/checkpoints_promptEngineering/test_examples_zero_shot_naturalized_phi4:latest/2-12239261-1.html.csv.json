    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the claim against the table.\n\nThe claim states:\n1. During season 1991, West Indies were the holder at the end of the series.\n2. The host England had 5 tests in that series.\n3. The result of the series was drawn.\n\nLet's check these conditions using the relevant rows and columns from the table:\n\n- **Season 1991**: We need to find the row corresponding to season 1991, which is Row 14.\n  \n- **Holder at the end of the series**: In Row 14, the \"holder at the end of the series\" column states \"west indies\". This matches the claim.\n\n- **Number of tests**: In Row 14, the \"tests\" column shows 5. This confirms the host England had 5 tests in that series, matching the claim.\n\n- **Series result**: In Row 14, the \"series result\" column is \"series drawn\", which aligns with the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 14.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for this verification are from Row 14 and involve the columns: \"season,\" \"holder at the end of the series,\" \"tests,\" and \"series result.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"series result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
