    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the 2 round match held in South Dakota, United States, the opponent's name be Brian Dunn,\" we need to verify three key conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Location:** The match must have been held in South Dakota, USA.\n2. **Round:** The match must have lasted for 2 rounds.\n3. **Opponent Name:** The opponent's name must be Brian Dunn.\n\nNow, let's examine each row relevant to these criteria:\n\n- **Row 12:**\n  - Location: South Dakota, United States\n  - Round: 2\n  - Opponent: Brian Dunn\n\nThis row satisfies all the conditions specified in the claim. Therefore, we can confirm that there was indeed a match with these characteristics.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are from Row 12:\n- \"location\" column (confirms South Dakota, USA)\n- \"round\" column (confirms it was a 2-round match)\n- \"opponent\" column (confirms the opponent's name is Brian Dunn)\n\nNo other row matches all three conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
