This part of the claim is correct.\n   - Check if the growth percentage is 38% as claimed.\n     - From Row 9, growth % = 42.0%. The claim states 38%, which does not match.\n\nSince the subscriber count for Vodafone in 2006 matches but the growth percentage does not, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 9, \"subscribers (2006) (thousands)\"\n   - Row 9, \"growth %\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"subscribers (2006) (thousands)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"growth %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
