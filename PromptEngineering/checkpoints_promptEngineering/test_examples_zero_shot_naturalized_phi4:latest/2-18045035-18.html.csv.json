    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Tony Fiammetta and Delone Carter's gains, we need to examine specific cells in the table:\n\n1. **Tony Fiammetta's Gain:**\n   - The row for Tony Fiammetta is Row 5.\n   - We check the \"gain\" column for this row.\n\n2. **Delone Carter's Gain:**\n   - The row for Delone Carter is Row 4.\n   - We check the \"gain\" column for this row.\n\nNow, let's extract and verify these values:\n\n- **Row 5 (Tony Fiammetta):** \n  - Gain = 66\n\n- **Row 4 (Delone Carter):**\n  - Gain = 141\n\nThe claim states:\n- Tony Fiammetta has a gain of 141.\n- Delone Carter has a gain of 66.\n\nUpon comparing these with the values from the table, we find:\n\n- The claim incorrectly assigns Tony Fiammetta's gain as 141 instead of 66.\n- It also incorrectly assigns Delone Carter's gain as 66 instead of 141.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. Here are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
