    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"South Melbourne lose by the largest amount of points of any other team,\" we need to compare the point differences for each game listed in the table and determine if South Melbourne's loss is indeed the largest.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand Point Calculation**: The scores are given in a format that combines goals (each worth 6 points) and behinds (each worth 1 point). For example, a score of \"10.15 (75)\" translates to \\(10 \\times 6 + 15 = 75\\) points.\n\n2. **Calculate Point Differences**:\n   - **Row 1**: Melbourne vs Richmond\n     - Melbourne: 122 points, Richmond: 89 points\n     - Difference: \\(122 - 89 = 33\\)\n   - **Row 2**: Essendon vs St Kilda\n     - Essendon: 85 points, St Kilda: 38 points\n     - Difference: \\(85 - 38 = 47\\)\n   - **Row 3**: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne\n     - South Melbourne: 75 points, North Melbourne: 73 points\n     - Difference: \\(73 - 75 = -2\\) (South Melbourne loses by 2 points)\n   - **Row 4**: Hawthorn vs Footscray\n     - Hawthorn: 67 points, Footscray: 100 points\n     - Difference: \\(67 - 100 = -33\\) (Hawthorn loses by 33 points)\n   - **Row 5**: Geelong vs Collingwood\n     - Geelong: 68 points, Collingwood: 75 points\n     - Difference: \\(68 - 75 = -7\\) (Geelong loses by 7 points)\n   - **Row 6**: Fitzroy vs Carlton\n     - Fitzroy: 58 points, Carlton: 48 points\n     - Difference: \\(58 - 48 = 10\\)\n\n3. **Identify the Largest Loss**:\n   - South Melbourne's loss: 2 points\n   - Hawthorn's loss: 33 points (largest)\n   - Geelong's loss: 7 points\n\n4. **Conclusion**: South Melbourne does not lose by the largest amount of points. Hawthorn loses by 33 points, which is larger than any other team's loss.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For calculating point differences, we need the scores from both teams for each match.\n- Specifically, relevant cells are those containing the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" for each row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
