Now, we list the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row 4: \"born - died\" for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri.\n- Row 2: \"born - died\" for Kostaq Kota.\n- Row 3: \"born - died\" for Pandeli Evangjeli.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
