    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim: \"0 , 35723 be 1 value for yellow, which be at 1.09%,\" we need to examine relevant data from the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two pieces of information:\n1. A specific value (0,35723) is associated with the category \"yellow.\"\n2. This value corresponds to a percentage of 1.09%.\n\nWe will verify these points by examining each row in the table for entries related to \"yellow\" and its percentage:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Yellow count: 420,952\n  - Percentage: 1.09%\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Yellow percentage: 20 , 02%\n  \n- **Row 3:**\n  - Yellow percentage: 0 , 92%\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Yellow count: 1,178,391\n  - Percentage: 1.09%\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Yellow count: 0 , 35723\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Row 5's yellow count of \"0 , 35723.\"\n- The percentage associated with yellow in the table.\n\nFrom the data, we see that:\n- Row 5 does indeed have a value of \"0 , 35723\" for yellow.\n- However, this value is not associated with a percentage of 1.09%. Instead, Row 4 has both a count and percentage of 1.09% for yellow.\n\nThus, the claim that \"0 , 35723 be 1 value for yellow, which be at 1.09%\" is incorrect because while \"0 , 35723\" is indeed a value for yellow, it does not correspond to the percentage 1.09%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yellow\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"yellow\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim: \"1,178,391 be the yellow fertility rate when Brazil be 0 ,43407\", we need to analyze the provided table and compare it against the specifics mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Analyzing the Table:**\n\n- **Row Structure:** \n  - Row 1 presents absolute numbers for different racial groups.\n  - Row 2 shows percentages of these racial groups relative to the total population.\n  - Row 3 displays percentage contributions to a collective 100% (perhaps indicating distribution across certain metrics like fertility, etc.).\n  - Row 4 repeats what appears to be updated or cumulative totals similar to Row 1.\n  - Row 5 shows numbers with commas that seem to represent percentages in an unusual format.\n\n**Breaking Down the Claim:**\n\n- The claim states \"1,178,391 be the yellow fertility rate when Brazil be 0 ,43407\".\n  \n  1. **Yellow Population:** \n     - From the table, we see that \"yellow\" numbers are:\n       - Row 1 (absolute number): 420,952\n       - Row 4 (absolute number): 1,178,391\n       - Row 5: 0 ,35723\n\n  2. **Brazil Total:** \n     - The claim references \"when Brazil be 0 ,43407\". This resembles the format in Row 5 for total Brazilian population metrics.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n- Check if the number \"1,178,391\" appears as a yellow population figure when the total (or related metric) is \"0 ,43407\":\n  - In Row 4, \"yellow\" has the value of 1,178,391.\n  - In Row 5, the Brazil total (likely representing overall metrics or fertility rate in this context) is shown as \"0 ,43407\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim aligns with Row 4's yellow population figure and matches the format in Row 5 for a metric labeled as Brazil's total (\"0 ,43407\").\n- Therefore, based on this alignment, the claim appears to be supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yellow\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"brazil 100%\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
