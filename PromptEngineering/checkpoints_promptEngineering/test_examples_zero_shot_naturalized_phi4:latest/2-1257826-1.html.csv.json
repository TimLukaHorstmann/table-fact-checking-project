    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the table, we need to check whether there is a game with a goal labeled as \"3\" and if its date is \"January 20, 2001\". \n\nLet's break down the relevant components of the claim:\n\n- The claim states: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 3 be January 20, 2001.\"\n- This implies we need to look for an entry where:\n  - The column \"goal\" equals \"3\".\n  - The corresponding \"date\" should be \"January 20, 2001\".\n\nNext, let's examine the table entries:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - goal: 1\n  - date: 17 January 2001\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - goal: 2\n  - date: 20 January 2001\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - goal: 3\n  - date: 20 January 2001\n\nThe third row has a \"goal\" of \"3\" and the corresponding \"date\" is \"January 20, 2001\". Thus, this entry supports the claim.\n\nAs per our analysis, only rows with columns related to \"goal\" and \"date\" are relevant to verify this claim. Specifically:\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Column \"goal\": value is \"3\"\n  - Column \"date\": value is \"20 January 2001\"\n\nThe information in these cells confirms the claim's conditions, so the answer is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cell details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to check if there is a row where:\n- The \"goal\" value is 4.\n- The corresponding \"date\" for this goal is \"15 March 2001\".\n\nLet's examine the table data:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Goal: 1\n  - Date: 17 January 2001\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Goal: 2\n  - Date: 20 January 2001\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Goal: 3\n  - Date: 20 January 2001\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Goal: 4\n  - Date: 15 March 2001\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Goal: 5\n  - Date: 14 July 2004\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Goal: 6\n  - Date: 17 November 2004\n\nFrom the table, we see that Row 4 matches both conditions:\n- The \"goal\" value is indeed 4.\n- The corresponding \"date\" for this goal is \"15 March 2001\".\n\nSince the data supports the claim fully, the answer is TRUE.\n\nNow let's provide the relevant cells involved in verifying this:\n\n- From **Row 4**, the relevant columns are:\n  - Column: \"goal\"\n  - Column: \"date\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON object representing the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based, so Row 4 in the table corresponds to `row_index: 3`.",
