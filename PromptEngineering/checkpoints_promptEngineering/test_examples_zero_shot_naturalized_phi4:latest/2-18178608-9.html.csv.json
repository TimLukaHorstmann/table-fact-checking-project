    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"England competed against both Scotland and Ireland 2 times in 1988,\" we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **England played against Scotland twice in 1988:**\n   - From the table, Row 3 indicates a match between England and Scotland on 05/03/1988.\n\n2. **England played against Ireland twice in 1988:**\n   - From the table, Row 4 shows a match between England and Ireland on 19/03/1988.\n   - Additionally, Row 5 records another match between England and Ireland on 23/04/1988.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from these rows:\n\n- For Scotland:\n  - Row 3: \"opposing teams\" (scotland), \"date\" (05 / 03 / 1988)\n\n- For Ireland:\n  - Row 4: \"opposing teams\" (ireland), \"date\" (19 / 03 / 1988)\n  - Row 5: \"opposing teams\" (ireland), \"date\" (23 / 04 / 1988)\n\nThe table shows that England played against Scotland only once and Ireland twice in 1988. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
