However, none of these columns specify the title (\"Just keep walking\"), its nature as a single, nor whether it was a hit.\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n- There is no information in the table to confirm that \"Just keep walking\" was released as a single by INXS in 1980.\n- There is no information about album releases or their sequence relative to singles in the same year.\n- There is no data indicating whether it became an Australian top 40 hit.\n\nSince none of these conditions are verifiable using the table, we conclude that the claim cannot be substantiated with the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

It was founded in 1955 as a division of Atlantic Records and is an abbreviation for \"Atlantic Corporation.\"\n\n### Analysis Using the Table:\n\nLet's identify relevant information from the table that pertains to Atco Records:\n- The table lists several entries where Atco Records is mentioned as a label.\n\n#### Relevant Rows:\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Format: LP\n  - Country: USA\n  - Label: Atco Records\n  - Catalogue No: 7 - 90184 - 1 - Y\n  - Date: 1984\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Format: MC\n  - Country: USA\n  - Label: Atco Records\n  - Catalogue No: 7 - 90184 - 4\n  - Date: 1984\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Format: CD\n  - Country: USA\n  - Label: Atco Records\n  - Catalogue No: 7 - 90184 - 2\n  - Date: 15 November 1987\n\n#### Analysis of the Relevant Rows:\n\n1. **Country Information**:\n   - In all three rows where Atco Records is mentioned, the country listed is \"USA.\" This supports the claim that it is an American record company.\n\n2. **Year and Founding Information**:\n   - The table does not provide any information about the founding year of Atco Records or its relationship with Atlantic Records. Therefore, we cannot verify from this data alone whether it was founded in 1955 as a division of Atlantic Records or that it is an abbreviation for \"Atlantic Corporation.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The table supports part of the claim: Atco Records operates in the USA (American record company).\n- However, there is no information in the table to confirm or deny the founding details and its relation to Atlantic Records.\n\nGiven this analysis, we conclude that the table does not fully support the entire claim.
