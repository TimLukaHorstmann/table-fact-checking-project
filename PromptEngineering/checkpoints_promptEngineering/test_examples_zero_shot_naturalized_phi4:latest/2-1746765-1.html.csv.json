However, it does not explicitly state who the test driver was.\n\n- **Row 16** (year 2011) shows a race count of 19 with other competition results listed, indicating that by 2011, Paul Di Resta had moved from being a test driver to racing in the series for Force India F1 Team. This implies that he likely started as a test driver before becoming a full-time driver.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that \"Paul Di Resta joined the Force India F1 team in 2010 as a test driver.\" The table supports this by showing that Paul Di Resta was listed as a test driver for Force India F1 Team in 2010.
