Therefore, based on the data given in the table, this part of the claim is not supported.\n\nSecondly, let's check if Mont Blanc is listed as the parent peak for Arcalod:\n\n- In row 37, we find that the peak \"Grande T\u00eate de l'Obiou\" has a parent listed as \"Barre des \u00c9crins 1 / MB 2\".\n- In row 38, the peak \"Cima Tosa\" has a parent listed as \"Presanella 1 / MB 2\".\n\nWe need to check directly for Arcalod:\n\n- In row 37, we find that the peak \"Grande T\u00eate de l'Obiou\" lists its parent as \"Barre des \u00c9crins 1 / MB 2\".\n- However, in row 37, it mentions \"Ellmauer Halt\" with Mont Blanc as the parent.\n- But importantly, for Arcalod specifically (row 37), no mention of Mont Blanc is found; instead, the claim refers to it being associated with Ellmauer Halt.\n\nBased on this verification:\n\n1. Finsteraarhorn 1 / MB 2 is not mentioned as the parent peak of Mont Blanc.\n2. Mont Blanc is not listed as the parent of Arcalod (the relevant entry does not exist).\n\nSince neither part of the claim is supported by the table data, the entire statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"parent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
