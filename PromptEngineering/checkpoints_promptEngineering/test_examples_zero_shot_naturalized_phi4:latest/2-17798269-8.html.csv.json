    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the second highest scoring game for the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009, we need to identify and compare the scores of each game listed in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The \"score\" column is relevant since it contains information about how many goals were scored by both teams in each game.\n   \n2. **Extract Scores:**\n   - For each row, extract the Avalanche's score (the first number in the \"score\" entry).\n\n3. **Compare Scores:**\n   - List the scores to identify which games had the highest and second-highest total points for the Avalanche.\n\n4. **Verify Opponents:**\n   - Check if the opponents in these top-scoring games match those mentioned in the claim (Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Extracted Scores from Table:**\n\n   - Row 1: March 2 vs New York Islanders, Score: 4-2 (Avalanche score = 4)\n   - Row 2: March 4 vs Detroit Red Wings, Score: 3-2 (Avalanche score = 3)\n   - Row 3: March 8 vs Chicago Blackhawks, Score: 5-1 (Avalanche score = 5)\n   - Row 4: March 10 vs Atlanta Thrashers, Score: 3-0 (Avalanche score = 3)\n   - Row 5: March 12 vs Minnesota Wild, Score: 2-1 (Avalanche score = 2)\n   - Row 6: March 14 vs Edmonton Oilers, Score: 3-2 (Avalanche score = 3)\n   - Row 7: March 15 vs Vancouver Canucks, Score: 4-2 (Avalanche score = 4)\n   - Row 8: March 17 vs Minnesota Wild, Score: 3-2 (Avalanche score = 3)\n   - Row 9: March 19 vs Edmonton Oilers, Score: 8-1 (Avalanche score = 8)\n   - Row 10: March 22 vs San Jose Sharks, Score: 3-1 (Avalanche score = 3)\n   - Row 11: March 25 vs Anaheim Ducks, Score: 7-2 (Avalanche score = 7)\n   - Row 12: March 27 vs Vancouver Canucks, Score: 4-1 (Avalanche score = 4)\n   - Row 13: March 29 vs Anaheim Ducks, Score: 4-1 (Avalanche score = 4)\n\n2. **Determine Highest Scores:**\n\n   - The highest scoring game for the Avalanche is against Edmonton Oilers on March 19 with a score of 8-1.\n   - The second-highest scoring game is against Anaheim Ducks on March 25 with a score of 7-2.\n\n3. **Check Claim Against Analysis:**\n\n   - The claim states that the second highest scoring games were against both Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers, but from the analysis:\n     - Only one game (against Anaheim Ducks) qualifies as the second-highest individual scoring.\n     - The other high-scoring game is against Edmonton Oilers, making it the top score.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is incorrect because only the game against Anaheim Ducks qualifies as the second highest in terms of Avalanche's goals scored. The game against Edmonton Oilers has the highest goal total for the Avalanche and thus does not fulfill the criteria of being the \"second-highest.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
