    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Rob Emerson has the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his MMA career,\" we need to focus on examining the `record` column for each row within the table. The relevant information from this column includes both wins and losses. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - \"Highest win record\" implies the highest number of wins listed in the `record`.\n   - According to the claim, Rob Emerson's highest recorded wins are 13.\n\n2. **Extracting Relevant Data**:\n   - The table provides records for each fight as part of a fighter\u2019s career history.\n   - We need to examine each row for the `record` column and identify which record shows 13 wins.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - From the table, let's check the `record` field across all rows to find entries with \"13\" as the number of wins.\n   - Relevant records indicating 13 wins are present in Rows 1 and potentially any other row (if applicable).\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - In Row 1: The record is listed as \"13 - 10 (1)\", confirming 13 wins, which matches the highest win count mentioned in the claim.\n   - We should ensure no other row exceeds this number of wins.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since Row 1 shows a maximum of 13 wins and there are no entries exceeding this win record, Rob Emerson indeed has his highest win record as \"13 - 10\".\n   - Thus, the claim is true based on the data provided.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response identifies only Row 1 as it contains the highest win record mentioned in the claim.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rob emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided and count the number of wins.\n\nWe will go through each row in the table and check the \"res\" (result) column for a value indicating a win. Each entry where \"res\" equals \"win\" contributes one win to Rob Emerson's record.\n\nLet's evaluate the relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row 1**: `res: win`\n2. **Row 2**: `res: win`\n3. **Row 4**: `res: win`\n4. **Row 5**: `res: win`\n7. **Row 7**: `res: win`\n10. **Row 10**: `res: win`\n11. **Row 11**: `res: win`\n13. **Row 13**: `res: win`\n14. **Row 14**: `res: win`\n15. **Row 15**: `res: win`\n16. **Row 16**: `res: win`\n19. **Row 19**: `res: win`\n20. **Row 20**: `res: win`\n\nCounting these rows, we find that Rob Emerson has a total of 12 wins.\n\nThe claim states he has only won 10 matches, which is incorrect based on our count. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
