We locate this team in Row 3 of the table.\n\n2. **Aggregate Score (Agg)**: The claim implies that \"energa czarni slupsk\" qualified for basketball, which typically means they won both legs or had a favorable aggregate score.\n   - In Row 3, the aggregate score is \"136 - 151\". This indicates \"energa czarni slupsk\" scored 136 points in total while their opponent, \"unics kazan\", scored 151.\n\n3. **First and Second Leg Scores**:\n   - The first leg score for \"energa czarni slupsk\" is 76 against \"unics kazan's\" 62.\n   - The second leg score for \"energa czarni slupsk\" is 50 against \"unics kazan's\" 89.\n\n4. **Qualification Check**: To qualify, a team generally needs to have an aggregate score in their favor or win based on specific tie-breaking rules (e.g., away goals). In this case:\n   - The aggregate score shows that \"energa czarni slupsk\" lost the series with a total of 136 points compared to 151 by \"unics kazan\".\n\nBased on these observations, \"energa czarni slupsk\" did not qualify as they lost both in terms of the aggregate score and the second leg.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding ASK Riga's qualification for the final round, we need to examine their aggregate score and the results of their matches. The claim specifically states: \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round.\" \n\nIn sports tournaments that involve multiple legs or rounds leading to a final stage, teams typically progress based on either their performance in terms of aggregate scores over two-leg series or by advancing through knockout stages based on specific rules.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the provided table:\n\n1. **ASK Riga vs Cholet Results**:\n   - 1st Leg: ASK Riga 69, Cholet 62\n   - 2nd Leg: ASK Riga 73, Cholet 75\n   - Aggregate Score: ASK Riga 142, Cholet 137\n\nThe aggregate score shows that ASK Riga won against Cholet with a total of 142 to 137. This indicates that ASK Riga advanced past this series because they had the higher aggregate score.\n\n2. **Relevance to Claim**:\n   - The claim implies that ASK Riga did not qualify for the final round, which would be true only if their performance in the last recorded match (against Cholet) was unsuccessful.\n   - Since ASK Riga won against Cholet based on aggregate points, they successfully progressed from this stage of the competition.\n\nThus, given the information and the context of sports tournament progression, ASK Riga's success in advancing after beating Cholet contradicts the claim that they were unable to qualify for the final round. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are:\n- The aggregate score row for ASK Riga vs. Cholet (Row 7).\n- The first and second leg scores for these teams in Row 7, which confirm how the aggregate score was achieved.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
