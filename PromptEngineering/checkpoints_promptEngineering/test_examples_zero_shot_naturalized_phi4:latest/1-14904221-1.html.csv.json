Identify the row corresponding to the year 2001. According to the naturalized format of the table:\n   - Row 8 corresponds to the year 2001.\n\n2. Within this row, locate the column named \"womens singles\" and check who was listed as the winner for that category in that specific year.\n\n3. In Row 8 (year: 2001), under the \"womens singles\" column, it states that the winner is Jelena Obri\u0107.\n\nBased on this information, we can confirm that the claim matches the data provided in the table for the specified year and category.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell from which this conclusion is drawn is Row 8 under the \"womens singles\" column.\n\nThe JSON object representing this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The row index starts from 0, so Row 8 in natural counting corresponds to index 7 in zero-based indexing.)",
