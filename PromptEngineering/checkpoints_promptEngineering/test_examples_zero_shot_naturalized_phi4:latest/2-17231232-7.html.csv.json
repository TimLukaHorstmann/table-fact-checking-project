The money earned by this player is $47,646.\n3. The score achieved by this player is 281.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the provided table (naturalized):\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - `player`: chip beck\n  - `money`: 47646\n  - `score`: 75 + 73 + 68 + 65 = 281\n\nNow, let's check each condition against this information:\n\n1.
