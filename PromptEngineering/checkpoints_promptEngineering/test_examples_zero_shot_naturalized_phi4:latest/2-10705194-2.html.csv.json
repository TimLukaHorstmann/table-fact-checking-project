    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jeremija Sanders' record being 8-2 is true or false based on the provided table, we need to locate all occurrences of \"Jeremija Sanders\" as an opponent in the dataset and verify their corresponding records.\n\n1. **Locate Row with Jeremija Sanders**: We find Jeremija Sanders listed as an opponent in Row 18.\n   \n2. **Check Record Before the Match**:\n   - In Row 18, it states that after a win against Jeremija Sanders, the record became 8-2.\n   - This implies prior to this match, the fighter's record was 7-2 (since winning one more fight increased wins by one and thus resulted in an 8-2 record).\n\n3. **Verify Record After the Match**:\n   - The table confirms that after defeating Jeremija Sanders, the record became 8-2.\n\n4. **Cross-Check Opponent\u2019s Record Information**:\n   - Since there is no direct information provided about Jeremija Sanders' own past fights or losses in this dataset (the table only provides results from the perspective of the fighter whose record we are evaluating), it's not possible to ascertain his entire career record directly from this data.\n   - The claim specifically asks for \"the record of opponent Jeremija Sanders be 8-2\", but we can't verify that from the information given.\n\nTherefore, based solely on what is available in the table and the nature of how records are presented (from the perspective of the fighter listed), there isn't enough data to confirm or deny Jeremija Sanders' record as being 8-2. The claim cannot be validated with the provided dataset.\n\nThus, the correct response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that the claim is false and provides relevant cells to support this conclusion.",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Jeremija Sanders' opponent's record, we must first identify which row in the table pertains to a fight involving Jeremija Sanders.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We look through the \"opponent\" column for \"jeremija sanders\". This is found in Row 18.\n   \n2. **Determine Opponent's Record Before Fight:**\n   - The table provides the record of the fighter after each fight with entries such as \"res: win, record: X - Y\".\n   - For Jeremija Sanders (Row 18), the result listed is a win (\"win\") and the fighter's record post-fight is \"8 - 2\".\n\n3. **Calculate Opponent's Record Prior to Fight:**\n   - The opponent\u2019s record before this fight can be derived by adjusting their record shown in Row 18 for the outcome of that specific match.\n   - Since the fighter won against Jeremija Sanders, the opponent's wins should decrease by one and the losses increase by one from the post-fight record of \"8 - 2\".\n   - Therefore, prior to this fight, the opponent\u2019s record would have been \"7 - 3\".\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Jeremija Sanders' opponent had a record of \"8 - 4\" before their fight.\n   - However, as calculated above, the opponent's correct record was \"7 - 3\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"7 - 3\" is not equal to \"8 - 4\", the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cell in the table is Row 18 under the columns \"opponent\" (for identifying Jeremija Sanders) and \"record\" (to determine the post-fight record).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the JSON response reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
