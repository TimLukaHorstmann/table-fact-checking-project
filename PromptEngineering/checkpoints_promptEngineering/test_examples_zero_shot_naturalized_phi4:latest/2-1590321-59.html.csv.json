The relevant cells to verify this claim are from Row 10 in the 'years' and 'goals' columns.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is 9 because the table provided in naturalized format starts with Row 1 corresponding to index 0.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the data for players who played during the years 1950 through 1965 and check if their goal scores were less than 160.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Period:**\n   - The claim concerns players active from 1950 to 1965.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Applicable Years:**\n   - We need to look at the \"years\" column and identify rows where the range includes any part of 1950-1965.\n\n3. **Evaluate Goal Scores:**\n   - For those players, check if their goal scores are less than 160.\n\n### Examination:\n\n- **Row 1:** Years: 1970 - 1986\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 2:** Years: 1993 - present\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 3:** Years: 1974 - 1989\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 4:** Years: 1974 - 1989\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 5:** Years: 1964 - 1976\n  - Partially overlaps with the period. Goals: 170.\n  - Relevant but does not satisfy the condition (goals \u2265 160).\n\n- **Row 6:** Years: 1966 - 1983\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 7:** Years: 1970 - 1987\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 8:** Years: 1975 - 1989\n  - Not relevant (outside 1950-1965).\n\n- **Row 9:** Years: 1962 - 1976\n  - Partially overlaps with the period. Goals: 160.\n  - Relevant but does not satisfy the condition (goals = 160).\n\n- **Row 10:** Years: 1947 - 1964\n  - Overlaps with the period. Goals: 157.\n  - Relevant and satisfies the condition (goals < 160).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is only fully supported by Row 10, where the goals are less than 160 during part of the specified period. However, not all players from the relevant time frame have scores below 160 (Rows 5 and 9 do not meet this criterion). Therefore, the claim is not universally true for all applicable players.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
