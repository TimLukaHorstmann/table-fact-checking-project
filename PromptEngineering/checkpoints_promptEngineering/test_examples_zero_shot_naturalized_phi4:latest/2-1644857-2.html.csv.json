    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table data provided:\n\nThe claim states:\n\"Scotland be the country that have stolen end less than 9 and a craig brown as the skip.\"\n\nWe need to verify two conditions from this claim using the table:\n\n1. Check if Scotland has \"stolen ends\" less than 9.\n2. Check if Craig Brown is listed as the skip for any country.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Row 2 (Scotland):**\n  - Skip: David Murdoch\n  - Stolen Ends: 10\n\nScotland has stolen ends equal to 10, which does not satisfy the condition of having stolen ends less than 9.\n\n- **Row 7 (United States):**\n  - Country: United States\n  - Skip: Craig Brown\n  - Stolen Ends: 6\n\nCraig Brown is listed as a skip, but for the United States, not Scotland. Additionally, his team has stolen ends equal to 6, which satisfies the condition of having stolen ends less than 9, but it does not relate to Scotland.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The first part of the claim about Scotland's stolen ends being less than 9 is false.\n- Craig Brown as skip pertains to the United States, not Scotland.\n\nThe entire claim is therefore false because neither condition applies specifically to Scotland. We only need to identify cells relevant to verifying the claim:\n\n1. For Scotland:\n   - \"stolen ends\" in Row 2\n2. For Craig Brown (to show he's a skip but for another country):\n   - \"skip\" and \"stolen ends\" in Row 7\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"skip\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
