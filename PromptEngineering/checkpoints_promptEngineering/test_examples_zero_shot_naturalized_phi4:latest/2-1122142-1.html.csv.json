Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells Identification:\nWe identified that Row 7 contains the necessary information to verify the claim regarding \"Cesare Perdisa have a time / retire of + 6 lap.\"\n\n- **Row Index**: 7\n- **Columns**:\n  - Driver (to confirm driver identity)\n  - Time / Retired (to check retirement status)\n\nThus, the JSON response reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- Note: The row index is zero-based in the JSON response.
