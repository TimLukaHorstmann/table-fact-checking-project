Compare this figure with all other games listed in the table:\n   - Row 1: Attendance = 15,730\n   - Row 2: Attendance = 57,491\n   - Row 3: Attendance = 37,419\n   - Row 4: Attendance = 18,104\n   - Row 5: Attendance = 38,264\n   - Row 6: Attendance = 60,671 (This game has the highest attendance so far)\n   - Row 7: Attendance = 62,844 (We are verifying this row)\n   - Row 8: Attendance = 49,888\n   - Row 9: Attendance = 48,169\n   - Row 10: Attendance = 21,231\n   - Row 11: Attendance = 49,219\n   - Row 12: Attendance = 32,229\n   - Row 13: Attendance = 56,964\n   - Row 14: Attendance = 34,508\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The attendance on October 28, 1962 (62,844) is indeed higher than any other game listed.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"the game on October 28, 1962 has the highest attendance of any game with 60,671 attendee\" is TRUE.\n\n5. Relevant cells for verification:\n   - All rows in the \"attendance\" column are relevant to compare against the specified date's attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
