The game against the New Orleans Saints happened during week 3, which is indeed before week 7, and it took place at Tulane Stadium.\n\nSince we have found a relevant match that fully supports the claim, the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nThe relevant cell for this verification is from row 3, specifically in the columns for \"week,\" \"opponent,\" and \"game site.\" However, to be precise and concise according to the format requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

By examining Row 1, we see that:\n- The \"week\" value is 1, which matches the condition in the claim.\n- The \"attendance\" value is 62936, which exactly matches the claimed attendance.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the correct week and the exact attendance), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
