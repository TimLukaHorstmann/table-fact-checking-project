This meets both conditions.\n- **Row 16**: Emerson Fittipaldi completed 6 laps and retired due to clutch issues. This also meets both conditions.\n\nFrom this analysis, we have two drivers who completed fewer than 50 laps: Jean-Pierre Jarier (transmission issue) and Emerson Fittipaldi (clutch issue).

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify several conditions:\n\n1. **Claim Conditions:**\n   - The top two drivers have grid positions of 1 and 5.\n   - These drivers are Clay Regazzoni and Tom Pryce.\n\n2. **Verification Steps:**\n\n   - **Identify Top Two Drivers by Finish Time:**\n     - Check the \"time / retired\" column to determine the finishing order based on time or laps completed (fewer laps indicates a worse finish).\n     - Row 1: Clay Regazzoni finished in 1:01:25.34.\n     - Row 2: Patrick Depailler finished +0:08.35 behind.\n     - Row 3: Jochen Mass finished +0:15.44 behind.\n     - These three drivers have completed all 60 laps, so they are the top finishers based on time.\n\n   - **Check Grid Positions for Top Two Drivers:**\n     - Clay Regazzoni (Row 1) has a grid position of 3.\n     - Patrick Depailler (Row 2) has a grid position of 5.\n\n   - **Verify Driver Names:**\n     - The claim states the top two drivers are Clay Regazzoni and Tom Pryce.\n     - From the table, we see that Tom Pryce did not finish in the top two; he completed 59 laps (+1 lap behind) and is listed as Row 7.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   - The top two drivers by finishing time are Clay Regazzoni (grid 3) and Patrick Depailler (grid 5).\n   - The grid positions of the top two drivers are not 1 and 5; they are 3 and 5.\n   - Tom Pryce is not one of the top two finishers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. Now, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- **Relevant Cells:**\n  - For Clay Regazzoni (Row 1): \"grid\" column to verify his grid position.\n  - For Patrick Depailler (Row 2): \"grid\" column to verify his grid position.\n  - For Tom Pryce (Row 7): \"laps\" and \"time / retired\" columns to confirm he did not finish in the top two.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
