    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The venue for all games (except possibly one) should be \"kardinia park.\"\n2. The game in 1924 should have been held at \"mcg.\"\n\nLet's examine each row of the table relevant to these conditions:\n\n- **Row 2** (year: 1922): Venue is \"mcg.\" This contradicts the claim that all venues should be \"kardinia park.\"\n  \n- **Row 3** (year: 1924): Opponent is \"geelong\" and venue is \"kardinia park,\" which aligns with the part of the claim about a possible exception for 1924 at \"mcg.\" However, this game was actually held at \"kardinia park.\"\n\n- **Row 4** (year: 1932): Venue is \"mcg.\" This contradicts the claim that all venues should be \"kardinia park.\"\n\n- **Row 5 to Row 11**: Venues are all listed as \"mcg,\" which also contradicts the claim that they should all be at \"kardinia park.\"\n\nThe venue for the game in 1924 is actually \"kardinia park\" and not \"mcg\" as claimed. Additionally, numerous other games were held at \"mcg,\" not \"kardinia park.\" Therefore, the claim does not hold true based on the table data.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
