    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jackie Oliver competed in 13 races from 1967 - 1977\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant data involves checking if Jackie Oliver was listed as a driver for any of the entries between the years 1967 and 1977.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry**: Since the table only provides details about entrants, chassis, engines, and points but does not list drivers explicitly, we need external knowledge or confirmation that Jackie Oliver participated in these races under those teams during the specified period.\n\n3. **External Knowledge**:\n   - Jackie Oliver was indeed a driver for several teams during this timeframe.\n   - In 1967, he drove for Lotus Components Ltd.\n   - From 1968 to 1970, he raced with Gold Leaf Team Lotus and Owen Racing Organisation.\n   - In 1971, he drove for Bruce McLaren Motor Racing.\n   - He also participated in races under Marlboro BRM in 1972 and UOP Shadow Racing Team in 1973.\n\n4. **Count the Unique Entries**: We need to count how many unique race entries Jackie Oliver participated in from 1967 to 1977 based on the table:\n   - 1967: Lotus Components Ltd.\n   - 1968: Gold Leaf Team Lotus (two entries, but counted as one team entry)\n   - 1969: Owen Racing Organisation (three entries, but counted as one team entry)\n   - 1970: Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM (counted as two different team entries due to the change in team name)\n   - 1971: Bruce McLaren Motor Racing\n   - 1972: Marlboro BRM\n   - 1973: UOP Shadow Racing Team\n\n5. **Verification**: Based on historical records, Jackie Oliver did participate in additional races beyond those listed in this table during these years, but the table only accounts for a total of seven unique team entries.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the table does not support that Jackie Oliver competed in 13 races (it supports only seven based on different teams), and without additional data outside the table confirming more entries, the claim cannot be verified as true solely from this table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\" because the table does not provide enough information to confirm participation in 13 races.

Confirm whether during those instances, he drove the BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Identify Jackie Oliver's Involvement:**\n  - The claim mentions Jackie Oliver, but the table does not explicitly list drivers. It only lists teams and cars.\n  - Historical knowledge indicates that Jackie Oliver was known to drive for the Owen Racing Organisation (ORO) during the years listed in the table.\n\n- **Check Relevant Entries:**\n  - Look for entries where ORO is the entrant, as this team is associated with Jackie Oliver.\n  \n- **Verify Car and Engine Type:**\n  - We need to check if Jackie Oliver drove a BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine whenever he was involved.\n\n**Relevant Rows from the Table:**\n\n1. **Row 7 (Year 1970):**\n   - Entrant: Owen Racing Organisation\n   - Chassis: BRM P153\n   - Engine: BRM V12\n\n2. **Row 8 (Year 1970):**\n   - Entrant: Yardley Team BRM\n   - Chassis: BRM P153\n   - Engine: BRM V12\n\n- In Row 7, Jackie Oliver drove a BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine.\n- In Row 8, the same car and engine were used, but the team changed to Yardley Team BRM. However, it is known that Jackie Oliver could have driven for both teams as they are essentially the same racing operation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states \"always drove,\" which implies every time Jackie Oliver was involved in a race listed, he should have driven the specified car and engine.\n- Based on historical context, during the years 1969 to 1970, Jackie Oliver did indeed drive the BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine for both ORO and Yardley Team BRM entries.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data for the relevant years and teams associated with Jackie Oliver.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Jackie Oliver drove some races for these cars in 1969.\n\n3. **Determine Career Span:**\n   - From external knowledge or research, we know that Jackie Oliver began his Formula One career in 1967 and retired at the end of the 1978 season.\n   - Therefore, his career spanned from 1967 to 1978, which is a total of 12 years.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that his career spanned 15 years.\n   - Based on the actual data and additional knowledge, Jackie Oliver's career spanned 12 years, not 15.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false based on the information available in the table and known historical facts about Jackie Oliver's racing career.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Rows related to Jackie Oliver's involvement are Rows 4, 5, and 6 for the year 1969 with \"Owen Racing Organisation.\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Jackie Oliver's last race was with Lotus Components Ltd\" is true based on the provided table, we need to evaluate relevant information from the table and additional known facts.\n\n### Analyzing the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Jackie Oliver\u2019s Last Race:**\n   - Jackie Oliver, a British racing driver, raced in Formula One primarily in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n   - His last full season in Formula One was in 1973, driving for the Shadow Racing Team.\n\n2. **Check Table Data Related to Jackie Oliver:**\n   - We need to identify entries related to Jackie Oliver\u2019s participation:\n     - Row 12 (Year 1973) indicates \"UOP Shadow Racing Team\" with chassis \"Shadow DN1\" and engine \"Cosworth V8.\" This matches the period of his last full season.\n   \n3. **Verify Last Race Details:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention Jackie Oliver\u2019s name, but from historical records, we know that in 1973, Jackie Oliver raced for Shadow Racing Team.\n\n4. **Examine Lotus Components Ltd Entry:**\n   - Row 1 (Year 1967) shows \"Lotus Components Ltd\" with chassis \"Lotus 48 (F2)\" and engine \"Cosworth Straight-4.\"\n   - This entry is from 1967, which does not coincide with Jackie Oliver\u2019s last race year of 1973.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Jackie Oliver's Last Race:** With the Shadow Racing Team in 1973.\n- **Lotus Components Ltd Entry:** In 1967, no connection to his last race.\n  \nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. The relevant cells for verifying this information are Row 12 (Shadow Racing Team in 1973) and Row 1 (Lotus Components Ltd in 1967).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
