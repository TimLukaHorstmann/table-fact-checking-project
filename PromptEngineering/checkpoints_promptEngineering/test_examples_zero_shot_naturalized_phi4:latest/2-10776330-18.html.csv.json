The claim states:\n\n\"the 1961 Victorian Football League season be the 65th season of the elite Australian rule football competition.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim:\n- It references a specific year: 1961.\n- It refers to a particular league or competition: the Victorian Football League (VFL).\n- It claims that 1961 was the 65th season of this competition.\n\nNow, let's examine what information is available in the table:\n- The table provides data on several matches played on 26 August 1961.\n- The columns include team names, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nRelevant points from the table:\n1. **Date**: All entries are dated 26 August 1961, confirming that these matches occurred in 1961.\n2. **Teams and Venues**: They list teams such as Footscray, Geelong, etc., indicating they are part of a league (specifically, the Victorian Football League).\n\nTo verify if 1961 was indeed the 65th season of the VFL:\n- We need historical context about the VFL that is not directly provided in the table.\n- The VFL was established in 1897. If we count from 1897 as the first season, then:\n  - 1897 would be season 1.\n  - Counting forward: \n    - From 1897 to 1961 is a span of 64 years (inclusive).\n  - Therefore, 1961 would be the 65th season.\n\nThe table confirms that these matches were part of the VFL in 1961, and historical context supports that it was indeed the 65th season. Thus, the claim aligns with both the data provided and known history.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those that provide the date (confirming the year) and indicate participation in the Victorian Football League:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
