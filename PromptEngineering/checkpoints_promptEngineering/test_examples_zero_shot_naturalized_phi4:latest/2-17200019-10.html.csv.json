Each of these four players must have their league score as 4.\n\nLet's evaluate each row in the table based on the criteria mentioned above:\n\n- **Row 10:** Player: Lucas Biglia, League: 2, Total: 3\n- **Row 11:** Player: Dmitri Bulykin, League: 3, Total: 3\n- **Row 12:** Player: Jan Pol\u00e1k, League: 2, Total: 3\n- **Row 13:** Player: Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez, League: 1, Super Cup: 1, Total: 3 (Note: This player has a total of 3 due to the super cup, not the league)\n- **Row 14:** Player: Jelle Van Damme, League: 3, Total: 3\n\nFrom this evaluation:\n\n- We have four players with a total score of 3 goals: Lucas Biglia, Dmitri Bulykin, Jan Pol\u00e1k, Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez, and Jelle Van Damme.\n- However, none of these players has a league score of 4.\n\nThe claim specifically states that all four players must have their league count as 4, which is not the case here.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jelle van Damme's performance relative to other players in the UEFA Champions League tournament, we need to assess how his total score compares with others based on their contributions specifically from this competition.\n\nThe table provides data for several columns: \"league\", \"title playoff\", \"super cup\", and \"total\". The relevant column to verify the claim is \"total\" since it aggregates all titles and achievements.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Jelle van Damme's Total Score:**  \n   - From Row 14, we see that Jelle van Damme has a total score of 3.\n\n2. **Determine What It Means to \"Score 3 Times as Much\":**  \n   - The claim states Jelle van Damme scored 3 times as much as each of the other two players in the UEFA Champions League tournament.\n   - Mathematically, if his total is 3 times more than another player's contribution from the UEFA Champions League, that means:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Jelle van Damme's Total} = 3 \\times (\\text{Other Player's Contribution})\n     \\]\n   - This implies the other player\u2019s contribution must be \\(1\\) (because \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\)).\n\n3. **Identify Players with UEFA Champions League Contributions:**\n   - The table does not directly mention specific contributions from different competitions like the UEFA Champions League.\n   - However, if we assume that all \"total\" scores include contributions from such tournaments unless specified otherwise (as no separate column for UEFA exists), we need to look at players whose total score is 1.\n\n4. **Identify Players with a Total Score of 1:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 17: V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez has a total score of 1.\n     - Row 18: Bart goor has a total score of 1.\n\n5. **Compare Jelle van Damme's Total to These Players:**\n   - Jelle van Damme\u2019s total (3) is indeed three times the total scores of both V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez and Bart goor (each having a total of 1).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Jelle van Damme scored 3 times as much as each of the other two players in the UEFA Champions League tournament\" holds true based on the available data, assuming their total reflects their contributions from all competitions.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- Jelle van Damme's Total: Row 14, Column \"total\"\n- V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez's Total: Row 17, Column \"total\"\n- Bart goor's Total: Row 18, Column \"total\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table, let's break down each part:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that four players from the Belgian First Division A are in the top 19 scorers.\n   - It also claims that Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez is the top scorer with 5 fewer goals than Bart Goor, who has 11 goals.\n\n2. **Checking Players and League:**\n   - We need to identify which players are from the Belgian First Division A (assuming they appear in the table).\n   - The relevant columns for this task are \"player\" and \"league\".\n   - The Belgian First Division A is not explicitly listed, but typically it would be a high number of league goals.\n\n3. **Checking Goals:**\n   - We need to verify Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's total goals and compare them with Bart Goor's goals.\n   - Relevant columns for this task are \"player\" and \"total\".\n\n4. **Verification Steps:**\n   - Identify players with a high number of league goals (likely Belgian First Division A players).\n   - Check the top scorers in terms of the \"total\" column to confirm who is listed as the top scorer.\n   - Verify the total goals for Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez and Bart Goor.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For identifying Belgian First Division A players, we look at rows with high league values.\n   - To verify the claim about scores:\n     - Check Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's total (Row 13).\n     - Check Bart Goor's total (Row 18).\n\n6. **Verification Against Table Data:**\n   - Row 1 to Row 4 have high league goals, suggesting these players are likely from Belgian First Division A.\n   - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has a total of 3 goals (Row 13).\n   - Bart Goor has a total of 1 goal (Row 18).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Four players indeed have high league totals, supporting the first part of the claim.\n   - However, the second part is false because Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez does not have more goals than Bart Goor; in fact, he has fewer.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
