    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the specific details mentioned in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89).\"\n\nWe need to check the following conditions:\n1. Identify any row where \"north melbourne\" is listed as the away team.\n2. Verify that in such a row, the \"away team score\" matches \"13.11 (89)\".\n\nLet's examine each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Home Team: Footscray\n  - Away Team: Hawthorn\n  - North Melbourne is not mentioned.\n  \n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: Fitzroy\n  - Away Team: Geelong\n  - North Melbourne is not mentioned.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: Essendon\n  - Away Team: South Melbourne\n  - North Melbourne is not mentioned.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team: St Kilda\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne\n  - Here, North Melbourne is the away team.\n  - The \"away team score\" for this row is indeed \"13.11 (89)\".\n\n- **Row 5** and **Row 6** do not mention North Melbourne as an away team, so they are irrelevant to our claim.\n\nSince Row 4 confirms that when North Melbourne was the away team, their score was \"13.11 (89)\", the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
