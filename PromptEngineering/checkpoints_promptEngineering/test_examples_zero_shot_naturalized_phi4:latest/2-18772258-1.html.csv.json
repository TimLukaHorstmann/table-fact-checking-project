Check if the \"pick\" number in that row is indeed 5.\n\nLet's go through the table step by step:\n\n- **Row 1:** Player: Zandro Limpot Jr., Pick Number: 1\n- **Row 2:** Player: Victor Pablo, Pick Number: 2\n- **Row 3:** Player: Johnny Abarrientos, Pick Number: 3\n- **Row 4:** Player: Dwight Lago, Pick Number: 4\n- **Row 5:** Player: Benito Cheng, Pick Number: 5\n- **Row 6:** Player: Johnedel Cardel, Pick Number: 6\n- **Row 7:** Player: Teodorico Fernandez III, Pick Number: 7\n- **Row 8:** Player: Richard Bachmann, Pick Number: 8\n\nFrom the table, we observe that \"Benito Cheng\" is listed in Row 5 and has a pick number of 5.
