The relevant information for each game includes the `game site`, and whether it matches any location other than FedEx Field. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Home Venue**: From the data, FedEx Field is noted as the home stadium in several entries: Rows 1, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, and 17.\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Away Games**:\n   - Row 2: Game site is Georgia Dome (away).\n   - Row 3: Game site is FedEx Field (home).\n   - Row 5: Game site is Lincoln Financial Field (away).\n   - Row 7: Game site is Ralph Wilson Stadium (away).\n   - Row 9: Game site is Texas Stadium (away).\n   - Row 11: Game site is Ericsson Stadium (away).\n   - Row 12: Game site is Pro Player Stadium (away).\n   - Row 13: Game site is FedEx Field (home).\n   - Row 14: Game site is Giants Stadium (away).\n   - Row 16: Game site is Soldier Field (away).\n\n3. **Count Away Games**: \n   - From the analysis above, the away games occur in Rows 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, and 16.
