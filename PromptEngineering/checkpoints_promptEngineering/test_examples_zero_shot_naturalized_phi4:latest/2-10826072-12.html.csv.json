    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the average away team score is true or false, we need to extract and analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"away team score\" for each game played on 19 June 1971.\n   - The scores are given in a naturalized format (e.g., \"3.5 (23)\"). We need to convert these into numerical values representing the total points scored by the away teams.\n\n2. **Extract and Convert Scores:**\n   - Row 1: Away team score is 3.5, which converts to 23.\n   - Row 2: Away team score is 3.3, which converts to 21.\n   - Row 3: Away team score is 8.17, which converts to 65.\n   - Row 4: Away team score is 11.5, which converts to 71.\n   - Row 5: Away team score is 6.10, which converts to 46.\n   - Row 6: Away team score is 2.6, which converts to 18.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Score:**\n   - Sum of away team scores = 23 + 21 + 65 + 71 + 46 + 18 = 244\n   - Number of games = 6\n   - Average away team score = Total sum / Number of games = 244 / 6 \u2248 40.67\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the average away team score should be 10.81.\n   - Our calculated average is approximately 40.67, which is significantly different from 10.81.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated average (40.67) does not match the claimed average (10.81), the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the \"away team score\" for each row, as these were used to calculate the average.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "carlton have the smallest margin of victory of game play on 19 june 1971",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to calculate the margin of victory for each game on June 19, 1971. The margin of victory can be calculated by finding the difference between the home team score and the away team score in each row.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract Scores**: For each row, extract the scores for both the home team and the away team.\n2. **Calculate Margin of Victory**: Compute the absolute value of the difference between the home team score and the away team score for each game. This will give us the margin of victory for that game.\n\nLet's calculate these margins:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team Score: 114 (Carlton)\n  - Away Team Score: 23 (North Melbourne)\n  - Margin = |114 - 23| = 91\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team Score: 99 (St Kilda)\n  - Away Team Score: 21 (Geelong)\n  - Margin = |99 - 21| = 78\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team Score: 47 (Richmond)\n  - Away Team Score: 65 (Fitzroy)\n  - Margin = |47 - 65| = 18\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team Score: 104 (Hawthorn)\n  - Away Team Score: 71 (Essendon)\n  - Margin = |104 - 71| = 33\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team Score: 63 (Footscray)\n  - Away Team Score: 46 (Collingwood)\n  - Margin = |63 - 46| = 17\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Home Team Score: 49 (Melbourne)\n  - Away Team Score: 18 (South Melbourne)\n  - Margin = |49 - 18| = 31\n\nNow, let's compare these margins to determine the smallest one:\n\n- Row 1: 91\n- Row 2: 78\n- Row 3: 18\n- Row 4: 33\n- Row 5: 17\n- Row 6: 31\n\nThe smallest margin of victory is 17, which occurs in **Row 5** (Footscray vs. Collingwood).\n\nThe claim states that \"carlton have the smallest margin of victory on 19 june 1971.\" Carlton's margin (from Row 1) is 91, which is not the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are those containing the scores for each game:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
