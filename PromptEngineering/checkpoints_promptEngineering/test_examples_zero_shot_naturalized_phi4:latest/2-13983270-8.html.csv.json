    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the record on August 24 be 70 - 50\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for the row corresponding to August 24 and check the \"record\" column.\n\n1. **Locate the Date:** First, identify the row that corresponds to the date August 24. According to the table, Row 21 has the date: August 24.\n\n2. **Check the Record Column:** Next, look at the \"record\" entry for this row. In Row 21, the record is listed as \"79 - 50.\"\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:** The claim states that the record on August 24 should be \"70 - 50.\" However, according to the table, it is actually \"79 - 50.\"\n\nSince the actual record does not match the claimed record, the statement is false.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is found in Row 21 under the \"record\" column. Therefore, the JSON response will reflect this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based, so Row 21 in natural counting corresponds to index 20.",
