    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Bob Beamon have recently set his long jump record,\" we need to analyze the table with a focus on Bob Beamon's entry and evaluate the meaning of \"recently.\"\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The table row corresponding to Bob Beamon is Row 2.\n\n2. **Extract Key Information from Row 2:**\n   - Date of Record: October 18, 1968\n   - Venue: Mexico City\n\n3. **Assess the Claim for Truthfulness:**\n   - \"Recently\" implies a time close to the present moment when the claim is being evaluated.\n   - The date provided in Row 2 (October 18, 1968) is over five decades ago.\n   - Since it's not possible for an event from 1968 to be considered recent today, Bob Beamon setting his long jump record cannot be classified as \"recent.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because the record was set in October 1968 and hence cannot be considered recent.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant information to verify this claim is found in Row 2 under the columns \"athlete\" (to identify Bob Beamon) and \"date\" (to evaluate how long ago the event occurred).\n\nHere's the JSON object with the evaluation result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on several conditions from the claim and compare them with the data in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Dwight Phillips' Record**:\n   - Locate Dwight Phillips in the table: Row 7.\n   - Check his mark, venue, date, etc.\n\n2. **Determine if it's a Record Setting Performance**:\n   - Analyze whether the distance jumped by Dwight Phillips is a record-setting performance based on the data provided.\n   - Typically, records are noted with some indication in sports tables (e.g., \"a\" for equaling or breaking an existing world record), but here no such annotation exists.\n\n3. **Compare Against Other Performances**:\n   - Check if any other athlete's mark is higher than Dwight Phillips' from earlier dates.\n   - The table lists performances chronologically by date, so we need to verify that no prior performance (before June 7, 2009) has a greater distance or matches the highest known records.\n\nNow let\u2019s analyze the data:\n\n- **Dwight Phillips**:\n  - Mark: 8.74 m\n  - Date: June 7, 2009\n\n- Check for earlier performances with marks equal to or better than 8.74 m:\n  - Mike Powell (Row 1): 8.95 m on August 30, 1991.\n  - Bob Beamon (Row 2): 8.90 m on October 18, 1968, noted with \"a\".\n  - Carl Lewis (Row 3): 8.87 m on August 30, 1991.\n  - Robert Emmiyan (Row 4): 8.86 m on May 22, 1987, marked with \"a\".\n  - Larry Myricks and Erick Walder both have marks of 8.74 m but earlier dates than Dwight Phillips.\n\nSince there are several recorded performances exceeding Dwight Phillips\u2019 mark before his performance in June 2009, he cannot be the first person to set a long jump record based on this data.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because Dwight Phillips did not set the first or any new record with his performance. His mark does not exceed those listed earlier and does not have an annotation indicating it was a record-setting event.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- Row 7: All columns are relevant to identify Dwight Phillips' data.\n- Rows with dates prior to June 7, 2009, and marks equal or greater than 8.74 m (Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are also relevant to verify no earlier record-setting performances exist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mark\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
