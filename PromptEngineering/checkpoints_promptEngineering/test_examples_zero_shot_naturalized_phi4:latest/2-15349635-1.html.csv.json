The claim states \"less than 3,\" so this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **\"More than 5 have scored more goals against them\":**\n   - This condition implies counting teams where the number in the \"against\" column is greater than those in an unspecified \"for\" column (which would represent goals scored by each team). Since we don't have a specific \"goals for\" column, we assume it's implicitly meant that if their goal difference is negative, they've allowed more goals against them.\n   - The teams with negative differences are:\n     - Row 5 (portuguesa)\n     - Row 7 (vasco da gama)\n     - Row 8 (am\u00e9rica)\n     - Row 9 (s\u00e3o paulo)\n\n   These 4 teams have a negative difference, meaning they've conceded more goals than scored. However, the claim requires \"more than 5,\" so this part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are not met (\"less than 3\" is incorrect as there are 4 teams with a minus goal difference and \"more than 5 have scored more goals against them\" is incorrect because only 4 teams meet that criterion), the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are in the \"difference\" and \"against\" columns for each row.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"none team tie on point, but most be separate by more than 1 goal difference,\" we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. No teams have the same number of points.\n2. If there is a tie in points, those teams must be separated by more than 1 goal difference.\n\nLet's analyze each row from the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (Flamengo):** Points = 13\n- **Row 2 (Fluminense):** Points = 13\n- **Row 3 (Corinthians):** Points = 9\n- **Row 4 (Palestra It\u00e1lia):** Points = 8\n- **Row 5 (Portuguesa):** Points = 7\n- **Row 6 (Botafogo):** Points = 6\n- **Row 7 (Vasco da Gama):** Points = 6\n- **Row 8 (Am\u00e9rica):** Points = 6\n- **Row 9 (S\u00e3o Paulo):** Points = 4\n\nFirst, we identify any teams with the same points:\n\n- Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13 points.\n- Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, and Am\u00e9rica all have 6 points.\n\nNext, we check the goal difference for these tied teams:\n\n- **Flamengo vs. Fluminense:**\n  - Flamengo's Difference = 8\n  - Fluminense's Difference = 10\n  - Absolute difference in goal difference = |8 - 10| = 2 (which is more than 1)\n\n- **Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, Am\u00e9rica (all have 6 points):**\n  - Botafogo's Difference = 0\n  - Vasco da Gama's Difference = -2\n  - Am\u00e9rica's Difference = -10\n\n  Check pairwise:\n  - Botafogo vs. Vasco da Gama: |0 - (-2)| = 2 (more than 1)\n  - Botafogo vs. Am\u00e9rica: |0 - (-10)| = 10 (more than 1)\n  - Vasco da Gama vs. Am\u00e9rica: |-2 - (-10)| = 8 (more than 1)\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- Teams with tied points have a goal difference greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
