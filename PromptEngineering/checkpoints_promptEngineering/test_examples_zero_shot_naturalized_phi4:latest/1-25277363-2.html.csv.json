Since the table confirms that he is listed in the 'written by' field for this episode, the claim is supported.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Bob Sand is indeed listed as the writer for episode 149, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell to verify this information is found in row 5, column 'written by.'\n\nHere's the JSON response with the answer and the relevant cell details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The row index is 4 because the table rows are typically zero-indexed in programming contexts when referring to data structures.\n- The column name 'written by' directly addresses where we found confirmation of Bob Sand's involvement as a writer for episode 149.",
