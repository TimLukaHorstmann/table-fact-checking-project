Based on our findings:\n- Chelsea scored 2 goals.\n- Crystal Palace scored 1 goal.\n\nSince 2 (Chelsea's goals) is not less than 1 (Crystal Palace's goals), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the scores for these two matches:\n\n- For Chelsea: Row 15, \"score\" column (0 - 2)\n- For Crystal Palace: Row 14, \"score\" column (0 - 1)\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless,\" we need to identify all matches in the table with a score that indicates a draw (i.e., both teams scored an equal number of goals). Once identified, we will check if these drawn matches were indeed goalless (0-0).\n\nLet's review each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 3**: West Bromwich Albion vs. Lincoln City - Score: 3 - 2 (Not a draw)\n2. **Row 6**: Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers - Score: 0 - 0 (Draw, goalless)\n3. **Row 8**: Coventry City vs. Newcastle United - Score: 1 - 1 (Draw, not goalless)\n4. **Row 13**: Southend United vs. Cardiff City - Score: 2 - 1 (Not a draw)\n5. **Row 15**: Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth - Score: 1 - 1 (Draw, not goalless)\n\nFrom this analysis, there are three drawn matches:\n\n- Row 6: Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers with score 0 - 0\n- Row 8: Coventry City vs. Newcastle United with score 1 - 1\n- Row 15: Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth with score 1 - 1\n\nThe claim states that all three drawn matches should be goalless (0-0). However, we identified two non-goalless draws in rows 8 and 15.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because not all drawn matches were goalless.
