We need to find out if he participated in these years and how many points he scored each year.\n\n2. **Examine the Table for Marc Surer**:\n   - The table does not explicitly mention drivers, only teams, chassis, engines, and points.\n   - We must identify which team or teams Marc Surer drove for in 1984 and 1985.\n\n3. **Check Points for 1984 and 1985**:\n   - In 1984 (Rows 9 and 10), the entrants are \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" with points 1.\n   - In 1985 (Row 11), the entrant is \"motor racing developments ltd\" with points 5.\n\n4. **Determine Marc Surer's Participation**:\n   - Historical data indicates that Marc Surer drove for Arrows in 1984 and Brabham in 1985.\n   - Therefore, we associate Row 9 and 10 (Arrows) with 1984 and Row 11 (Brabham) with 1985.\n\n5. **Calculate Points Difference**:\n   - For 1984, Marc Surer scored 1 point (from Rows 9 and 10).\n   - For 1985, he scored 5 points (Row 11).\n   - The difference in points is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Marc Surer did indeed score 4 more points in 1985 compared to 1984.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.

Unfortunately, this specific detail about drivers is not provided in the table.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Points**: Assuming Marc Surer participated in these races and considering only the given data:\n   - From Row 6: The team scored 3 points.\n   - From Row 7: The team again scored 3 points.\n\n   Adding these gives us a total of \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) points for the two listed entries. Since there are no other entries for 1982 in the table, we cannot find any additional races or points that would contribute to Marc Surer's total score for that year from this data alone.\n\n4. **Determine Accuracy of the Claim**: The claim states a total of 9 points in four races. However, based on the information given:\n   - We only have two entries totaling 6 points.\n   - There are no additional races or point data provided in these rows for 1982 to account for a total of 9 points.\n\nThus, with the information available in the table and without further details about Marc Surer's participation beyond what is listed, we cannot verify that he scored 9 points across four races. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
