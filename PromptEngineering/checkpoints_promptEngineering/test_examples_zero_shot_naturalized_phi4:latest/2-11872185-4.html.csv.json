    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine whether all movies listed in the table were released on or after 2009. The claim states: \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0.\" This implies there should be no movies with a release year before 2009 for their distributor shares to be considered.\n\nLet's analyze each row and focus specifically on the column \"year\" to verify if any movie was released before 2009:\n\n1. **Row 1:** Movie: Chennai Express, Year: 2013\n2. **Row 2:** Movie: Ek Tha Tiger, Year: 2012\n3. **Row 3:** Movie: 3 Idiots, Year: 2009\n4. **Row 4:** Movie: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Year: 2013\n5. **Row 5:** Movie: Dabangg 2, Year: 2012\n6. **Row 6:** Movie: Bodyguard, Year: 2011\n7. **Row 7:** Movie: Dabangg, Year: 2010\n8. **Row 8:** Movie: Rowdy Rathore, Year: 2012\n9. **Row 9:** Movie: Agneepath, Year: 2012\n10. **Row 10:** Movie: Ready, Year: 2011\n\nEach movie listed has a release year of 2009 or later. Therefore, there are no movies in the table with a release year earlier than 2009.\n\nSince all entries comply with the condition set by the claim (no movies before 2009), the statement \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is supported by the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE.\"\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This does not affect our claim as it is after 2009.\n- **Row 2**: Movie \"ek tha tiger\" - Year: 2012. This also does not affect the claim.\n- **Row 3**: Movie \"3 idiots\" - Year: 2009. This year matches the earliest possible year according to the claim, so it supports the claim.\n- **Row 4**: Movie \"yeh jawaani hai deewani\" - Year: 2013. No effect on our analysis as this is after 2009.\n- **Row 5**: Movie \"dabangg 2\" - Year: 2012. Again, does not affect the claim.\n- **Row 6**: Movie \"bodyguard\" - Year: 2011.

Check the relevant column in this row, specifically the \"year\" column, to see when \"Ek Tha Tiger\" was released. According to the table:\n   - The year for \"Ek Tha Tiger\" (Row 2) is 2012.\n\n3. Examine all rows to determine if there were any movies released before \"Ek Tha Tiger\" in 2009 or earlier. We observe:\n   - Row 3 contains information about \"3 Idiots,\" which was released in 2009.\n   - There are no entries for the year 2008 or earlier.\n\nBased on this examination:\n\n- The claim asserts that \"Ek Tha Tiger\" was first released in 2009, but it was actually released in 2012.
