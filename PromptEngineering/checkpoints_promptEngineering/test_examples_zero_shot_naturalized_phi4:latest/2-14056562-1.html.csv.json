    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the third position have a finishing time of 2:12:53\" is true or false, let's analyze each component of the claim and relate it to the data in the table:\n\n1. **Position**: The claim mentions \"the third position.\" According to the table:\n   - Row 3 has a `position` of `3rd`.\n\n2. **Finishing Time**: The claim specifies a finishing time of `2:12:53`. Let's check if this time corresponds to the row where the position is `3rd`:\n   - In Row 3, under `notes`, we find `2:12:53`.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The position specified in the claim (`3rd`) matches the position listed in Row 3.\n- The finishing time mentioned in the claim (`2:12:53`) is also present in Row 3.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by Row 3, we can conclude that the claim is true. \n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells from the table:\n- For position verification: `row_index` 2 and `column_name` \"position\".\n- For finishing time verification: `row_index` 2 and `column_name` \"notes\".\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
