    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to verify which away team has scored the most points and if that team is Hawthorn.\n\nLet's examine each row where an away team is mentioned:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Away Team: Footscray\n   - Score: 6.14 (50)\n\n2. **Row 2**: \n   - Away Team: Melbourne\n   - Score: 10.16 (76)\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Away Team: Hawthorn\n   - Score: 10.14 (74)\n   \n4. **Row 4**: \n   - Away Team: Geelong\n   - Score: 14.16 (100)\n\n5. **Row 5**: \n   - Away Team: Collingwood\n   - Score: 15.11 (101)\n   \n6. **Row 6**:\n   - Away Team: Fitzroy\n   - Score: 9.11 (65)\n\nNext, we compare the scores of these away teams to determine which has the highest score:\n\n- Footscray scored 50 points.\n- Melbourne scored 76 points.\n- Hawthorn scored 74 points.\n- Geelong scored 100 points.\n- Collingwood scored 101 points.\n- Fitzroy scored 65 points.\n\nCollingwood, with a score of 101 points in Row 5, has the highest score among all away teams. Therefore, the claim that \"Hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\" is FALSE because Hawthorn only scored 74 points, which is not the highest.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the scores and away teams' names:\n\n- Row 3 (away team: hawthorn, away team score: 10.14 (74))\n- Row 5 (away team: collingwood, away team score: 15.11 (101))\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
