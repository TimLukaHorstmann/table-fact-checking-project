To evaluate this, we will:\n\n- Identify the division records for both schools.\n- Compare these records to see if Laurel indeed performed worse in terms of their win-loss ratio.\n\n#### Step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Column:**\n   - Row 1 corresponds to Milford with a \"division record\" of 5 - 1.\n   - Row 2 corresponds to Laurel with a \"division record\" of 5 - 1.\n\n2. **Compare the Division Records:**\n   - Both schools have identical division records (5 wins and 1 loss).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both Milford and Laurel share the same division record, it is not true that Laurel's record is worse than Milford\u2019s.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"division record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"division record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
