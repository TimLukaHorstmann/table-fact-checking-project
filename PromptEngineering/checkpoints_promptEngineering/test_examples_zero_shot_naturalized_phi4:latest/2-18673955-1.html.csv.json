    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate it against the provided table. The claim states: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\" \n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. Identify the game played on October 30, 1977.\n2. Verify if this game corresponds to Week 7 in the table.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Row 7 shows a game on \"date: october 30 , 1977\" with \"week: 7\".\n- The opponent is \"tampa bay buccaneers\", and the result is \"w 20 - 10\".\n\nThe claim checks if any other row in the table lists a game played on October 30, 1977, that corresponds to a week number greater than 7. \n\nUpon reviewing each row:\n- Only Row 7 has a date of October 30, 1977.\n- No other rows list this date with a different (and especially higher) week number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table, as no game on that date corresponds to a week greater than 7.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are those in Row 7 under \"week\" and \"date\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
