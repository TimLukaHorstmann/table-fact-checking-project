Goodling's Status:**\n   - Ensure that William F. Goodling is indeed marked as \"re-elected\" in the table.\n   - Confirm that he belongs to the Republican party.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\n- **Row 1:** Ron Klink (Democratic) \u2013 Re-Elected\n- **Row 2:** William F.

Clinger, Jr.\n- Row 3: Curt Weldon\n- Row 4: Bud Shuster\n- Row 6: George Gekas\n- Row 8: William F.
