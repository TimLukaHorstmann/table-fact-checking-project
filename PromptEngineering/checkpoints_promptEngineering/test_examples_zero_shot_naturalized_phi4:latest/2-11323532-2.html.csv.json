    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the show in Israel is true or false, we need to carefully verify each part of the claim against the information provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states:\n1. The show in Israel is in the Hebrew language.\n2. The status of the show is ongoing.\n\nLet's break down these conditions and identify which parts of the table are relevant for verification:\n\n- **Language Check:** We need to verify that the languages column for the row corresponding to Israel indicates \"hebrew\".\n- **Status Check:** We also need to check that the status column for the same row reads \"ongoing\".\n\nLet's find the relevant information in the table:\n\n### Relevant Row:\n- The table lists countries and regions, along with their respective details. We are interested in the row where the country/region is \"israel\". According to the table:\n  - **Row 12** corresponds to Israel.\n\n### Column Verification for Row 12:\n1. **Languages Column:** For Row 12 (Israel), the languages column reads \"hebrew\".\n2. **Status Column:** The status column for Row 12 indicates \"discontinued\".\n\nNow, let's compare this information with the claim:\n\n- The claim states that the show in Israel is in Hebrew. This part is supported by the table as the language is indeed Hebrew.\n- However, the claim also states that the show's status should be ongoing. This part of the claim is not supported because the table shows that the status is \"discontinued\".\n\nSince one condition (the status being ongoing) does not match the information in the table, the entire claim cannot be considered true.\n\nThus, our conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"languages\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that the claim is false and specifies which cells in the table were relevant to verifying it.",
