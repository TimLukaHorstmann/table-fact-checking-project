The claim states: \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1.\" Let's break this down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim suggests that the team \"SASOL Jordan\" should have participated in 1 race, and it should be tied with another team for having the fewest races.\n   \n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - We need to check how many entries (rows) each team has in the table, as each entry corresponds to a distinct race participation.\n\n3. **Checking SASOL Jordan**:\n   - Row 15 mentions \"sasol jordan\" with 0 points. This is the only mention of SASOL Jordan, indicating they participated in 1 race.\n\n4. **Finding Teams with the Least Participation**:\n   - We need to count how many races each team participated in by counting their occurrences across all rows.\n   - Teams with 1 entry: \n     - Row 1: \"arrows racing team\" (1 entry)\n     - Row 15: \"sasol jordan\" (1 entry)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - SASOL Jordan is indeed tied for the least number of races, as they both participated in only 1 race.\n   \n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those that mention \"sasol jordan\" and other teams with 1 entry.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Row 0 (index 1 in the table) and Row 14 (index 13 in the table) are checked to ensure no other teams have only 1 entry.\n- Row 15 is directly relevant as it mentions SASOL Jordan.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ligier gitanes 2 time earn 37 point in race during 1989\" is true or false, we need to verify if there are two entries for the team \"ligier gitanes\" with exactly 37 points in the year 1989.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to check for rows where:\n     - The `year` is 1989.\n     - The `team` contains \"ligier gitanes\".\n     - The `points` are equal to 37.\n\n2. **Examine the Table:**\n   - Row 1: Year 1983, Team \"arrows racing team\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 2: Year 1984, Team \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 3: Year 1984, Team \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 4: Year 1985, Team \"barclay arrows bmw\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 5: Year 1986, Team \"barclay arrows bmw\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 6: Year 1986, Team \"barclay arrows bmw\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 7: Year 1987, Team \"benetton formula ltd\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 8: Year 1988, Team \"benetton formula ltd\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 9: Year 1989, Team \"canon williams team\", Points 37.\n   - Row 10: Year 1989, Team \"canon williams team\", Points 37.\n   - Row 11: Year 1990, Team \"canon williams renault\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 12: Year 1991, Team \"ligier gitanes\", Points 0.\n   - Row 13: Year 1991, Team \"ligier gitanes\", Points 0.\n   - Row 14: Year 1992, Team \"ligier gitanes blondes\" (not relevant).\n   - Row 15: Year 1993, Team \"sasol jordan\" (not relevant).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no rows for the team \"ligier gitanes\" in the year 1989 with points equal to 37.\n   - The claim is about \"ligier gitanes\" earning 37 points twice in 1989, but no such entries exist.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.
