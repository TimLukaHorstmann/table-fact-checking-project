    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. Chelsea must be the away team when Sunderland is the home team.\n2. Stoke City must be the home team when Southampton is the away team.\n\nLet's examine each condition using the table data:\n\n### Condition 1:\n- **Chelsea as Away Team**: Look for a row where Chelsea is listed as the \"away team.\"\n  - Row 7: Chelsea is the home team, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n  - Row 10: Chelsea is the home team, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n\n- **Sunderland as Home Team**: Look for a row where Sunderland is listed as the \"home team.\"\n  - Row 11: Sunderland is the away team, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n  - Row 12: Sunderland is the home team. Check if Chelsea is the away team in this match:\n    - In Row 12, the away team is Stoke City, not Chelsea.\n\nSince there is no row where Chelsea is the away team when Sunderland is the home team, Condition 1 is not satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2:\n- **Stoke City as Home Team**: Look for a row where Stoke City is listed as the \"home team.\"\n  - Row 8: Stoke City is the away team, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n  - Row 11: Stoke City is the home team. Check if Southampton is the away team in this match:\n    - In Row 11, the away team is Sunderland, not Southampton.\n\n- **Southampton as Away Team**: Look for a row where Southampton is listed as the \"away team.\"\n  - Row 6: Southampton is the away team. Check if Stoke City is the home team in this match:\n    - In Row 6, the home team is West Bromwich Albion, not Stoke City.\n\nSince there is no row where Stoke City is the home team when Southampton is the away team, Condition 2 is also not satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNeither condition of the claim is met. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are those that pertain to the teams mentioned in each condition:\n\n- For Chelsea and Sunderland: Rows 10 and 12.\n- For Stoke City and Southampton: Rows 6, 8, and 11.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
