    "resp": "To verify the claim that during the 2003-04 Scottish football season, Scotland scored zero points three times, we need to examine each row in the table for matches involving Scotland where they scored zero goals and were part of a competition relevant to the 2003-04 Scottish football season.\n\nThe relevant competitions are likely the Euro 2004 qualifying group (ecqg5) and the Euro 2004 play-off (ecqpo), as these were the main international fixtures for Scotland during that period. Friendly matches may also be considered, but they generally don't contribute to competitive points unless explicitly stated.\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Competition is a friendly, score is 0-0.\n2. **Row 2**: Euro 2004 qualifying group (ecqg5), score is 3-1.\n3. **Row 3**: Euro 2004 qualifying group (ecqg5), score is 1-2.\n4. **Row 4**: Euro 2004 qualifying group (ecqg5), score is 1-0.\n5. **Row 5**: Euro 2004 play-off (ecqpo), score is 1-0.\n6. **Row 6**: Euro 2004 play-off (ecqpo), score is 0-6.\n7. **Row 7**: Competition is a friendly, score is 1-2.\n8. **Row 8**: Competition is a friendly, score is 0-1.\n9. **Row 9**: Competition is a friendly, score is 1-0.\n10. **Row 10**: Competition is a friendly, score is 4-1.\n\nNow, identify the matches where Scotland scored zero goals in relevant competitions:\n\n- **Row 6**: Euro 2004 play-off (ecqpo), score is 0-6.\n- **Row 1**: Friendly, score is 0-0. (Not a competitive match contributing to points)\n- **Row 8**: Friendly, score is 0-1. (Not a competitive match contributing to points)\n\nFrom the analysis, Scotland scored zero goals in two relevant matches that could affect their competitive standing: one in the Euro 2004 play-off and one friendly match. Only Row 6 counts towards competitive fixtures where they earned zero points.\n\nThus, Scotland scored zero points only once in a competition that would count for the 2003-04 season (the play-offs).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine how many times Scotland played at Easter Road, Edinburgh and Hampden Park, Glasgow during the Scottish football season. The table provides details for each match, including the venue, which is crucial for this analysis.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played at Each Venue:**\n   - **Easter Road, Edinburgh (h):**\n     - Row 10: Date: 30 May, Venue: Easter Road, Edinburgh (h), Competition: Friendly\n     - Total matches at Easter Road = 1\n\n   - **Hampden Park, Glasgow (h):**\n     - Row 2: Date: 6 September, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Competition: ECQG5\n     - Row 4: Date: 11 October, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Competition: ECQG5\n     - Row 5: Date: 15 November, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Competition: ECPo\n     - Row 7: Date: 31 March, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Competition: Friendly\n     - Total matches at Hampden Park = 4\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Scotland played at Easter Road 5 times more than at Hampden Park.\n   - From the analysis:\n     - Matches at Easter Road = 1\n     - Matches at Hampden Park = 4\n   - To satisfy the claim, matches at Easter Road should be \\(4 \\times 5 + 1 = 21\\) (since playing 5 times more means having 6 times the number of matches, i.e., \\(n + 5n\\)).\n   - Clearly, 1 is not 21.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because Scotland did not play at Easter Road 5 times more than Hampden Park during the season.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to check the \"venue\" column for each row to count matches at both venues.\n   - Relevant rows and columns are:\n     - Row 10, Column: Venue (Easter Road)\n     - Rows 2, 4, 5, 7, Column: Venue (Hampden Park)\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
