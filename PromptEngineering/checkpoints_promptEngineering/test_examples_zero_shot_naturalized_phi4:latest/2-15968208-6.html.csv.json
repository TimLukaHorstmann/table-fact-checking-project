    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **\"6 round total hit all of the ships\"**:\n   - The table provides a \"total\" column for each ship and an overall \"total\" at row 6.\n   - We need to verify if the sum of the totals from rows 1 to 5 equals the total in row 6.\n\n2. **\"...with the Seydlitz hit the most of all the ships\"**:\n   - We need to check the \"total\" for each ship and determine if Seydlitz has the highest value.\n\nLet's verify these parts:\n\n### Part 1: Total Hits Verification\n\n- Row 1 (L\u00fctzow): Total = 10\n- Row 2 (Derfflinger): Total = 3\n- Row 3 (Seydlitz): Total = 1\n- Row 4 (K\u00f6nig): Total = 8\n- Row 5 (Markgraf): Total = 1\n\nSum of totals from rows 1 to 5: \\(10 + 3 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 23\\)\n\nRow 6 states the total as 23, which matches our calculation. Therefore, this part of the claim is true.\n\n### Part 2: Seydlitz Hit Verification\n\n- L\u00fctzow Total: 10\n- Derfflinger Total: 3\n- Seydlitz Total: 1\n- K\u00f6nig Total: 8\n- Markgraf Total: 1\n\nSeydlitz has a total of 1, which is not the highest among all ships. The ship with the highest total hits is L\u00fctzow with 10.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"6 round total hit all of the ships\" is true, but \"with the Seydlitz hit the most of all the ships\" is false because L\u00fctzow has more hits than Seydlitz.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- Total hits for each ship (rows 1-5) and the overall total in row 6.\n- Specifically, we need to check the \"total\" column for all rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"12 - inch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
