    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to calculate and compare viewership numbers for combinations of episodes:\n\nThe claim is about comparing the combined US viewers for episode 1 (\"Redemption\") and episode 2 (\"The Scarlet Letter\") against all other possible pairs of episodes in terms of total viewers.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Viewers for Episode 1 and Episode 2:**\n   - Episode 1 (row 0): \"Redemption\" has US viewers = 15.07 million.\n   - Episode 2 (row 1): \"The Scarlet Letter\" has US viewers = 15.75 million.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Viewers for Episodes 1 and 2:**\n   \\[\n   15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare with All Other Pairs of Episodes:**\n   - We need to check if any other pair of episodes has a combined viewership greater than 30.82 million.\n\n4. **Calculate Combined Viewers for Each Pair of Episodes (except 1 & 2):**\n\n   Here's the calculation for relevant pairs:\n   - Episode 3 and 4: \\(15.86 + 16.02 = 31.88\\)\n   - No need to compute further as we've found a pair exceeding 30.82.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since episode 3 (\"Code Red\") and episode 4 (\"The Red Box\") have a combined viewership of 31.88 million, which is greater than 30.82 million (combined viewership for episodes 1 & 2), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Episodes 1 and 2: Rows 0 and 1, column \"US Viewers\".\n- Another pair exceeding their total: Rows 15 and 16, column \"US Viewers\".\n\nHere is the JSON object as per the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"us viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"us viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
