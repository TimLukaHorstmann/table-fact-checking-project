Since 96 is greater than 74, the claim that the most point score by the Owl in one game could be \"74\" is true because it did not exceed this number; rather, they scored more.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for verification are all rows from the \"score\" column where the points scored by the team are mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
