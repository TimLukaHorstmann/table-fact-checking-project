Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is TRUE based on the table's contents.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions against the provided table:\n\n1. Check if week 14 corresponds to September 26, 1971.\n2. Verify if the attendance for week 14 is 57,895.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition step-by-step using the data from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Week and Date\n\n- According to the claim, week 14 should be on \"September 26, 1971\".\n- From the table:\n  - Row 2 corresponds to week 2 with the date \"September 26, 1971.\"\n  - Row 14 corresponds to week 14 with the date \"December 19, 1971.\"\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates week 14 with September 26, 1971. Week 14 is actually on December 19, 1971.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Attendance\n\n- According to the claim, the attendance for week 14 should be 57,895.\n- From the table:\n  - Row 2 shows an attendance of 57,895 for week 2.\n  - Row 14 shows an attendance of 75,954 for week 14.\n\nThe claimed attendance for week 14 (57,895) does not match the actual attendance in the table (75,954).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are false based on the data from the table. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells that verify these findings are:\n- The date and week association: Row 2 (\"date\": \"September 26, 1971\", \"week\": 2) and Row 14 (\"date\": \"December 19, 1971\", \"week\": 14).\n- The attendance for week 14: Row 14 (\"attendance\": 75,954).\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
