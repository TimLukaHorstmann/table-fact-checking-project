In both cases, their total number of medals is less than or equal to 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the total medal for the nation with 1 silver and 0 gold be more than 2\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Bulgaria: Row 11, columns \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\", and \"total\".\n- East Germany: Row 12, columns \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\", and \"total\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
