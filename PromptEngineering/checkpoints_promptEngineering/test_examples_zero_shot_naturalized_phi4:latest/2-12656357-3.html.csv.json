    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ireland is true or false, we need to examine the relevant row in the provided table and check the medal counts for Ireland.\n\nThe claim states: \"Ireland scored only 1 silver medal and no other medal.\" This means that according to the claim:\n- Ireland should have exactly 1 silver medal.\n- Ireland should have 0 gold medals.\n- Ireland should have 0 bronze medals.\n- The total number of medals should be equal to the sum of gold, silver, and bronze, which is 1.\n\nLet's identify the relevant row for Ireland in the table:\n- Row 39 corresponds to the nation \"ireland\".\n\nNow, let's verify each condition using the data from this row:\n\n1. **Gold Medals**: According to Row 39, the number of gold medals for Ireland is 0.\n2. **Silver Medals**: According to Row 39, the number of silver medals for Ireland is 1.\n3. **Bronze Medals**: According to Row 39, the number of bronze medals for Ireland is 0.\n4. **Total Medals**: The total number of medals should be the sum of gold, silver, and bronze medals. For Ireland, this is \\(0 + 1 + 0 = 1\\), which matches the \"total\" value in Row 39.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are met by the data in Row 39:\n- Ireland has 0 gold medals.\n- Ireland has exactly 1 silver medal.\n- Ireland has 0 bronze medals.\n- The total number of medals is correctly calculated as 1.\n\nSince all aspects of the claim are consistent with the data from the table, we conclude that the claim is true. \n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is 38 because the table starts with row indices from 0. Row 39 in human-readable format corresponds to index 38 in zero-based indexing used here.",
