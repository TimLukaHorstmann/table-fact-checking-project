    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden against Diego Gonzalez, we need to carefully examine each condition stated in the claim and verify them against the provided table.\n\n1. **Condition: \"highest record win\"**\n   - We must identify all wins by David Bielkheden from the table.\n   - Calculate his winning record (number of wins minus number of losses) after each win.\n\n2. **Condition: \"in Stockholm, Sweden\"**\n   - Identify which matches took place in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n3. **Condition: \"against Diego Gonzalez\"**\n   - Locate any match against an opponent named Diego Gonzalez.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 21**: Indicates a win for David Bielkheden with a record of 7 - 2 after defeating Patrick Vallee in Stockholm, Sweden.\n- **Row 23**: Shows another win with a record of 6 - 2 in Stockholm against Tom Haddock. \n- **No mention of Diego Gonzalez** as an opponent anywhere in the table.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1.

This fight was won.\n\n- **Row 27**: \n  - Opponent is \"kimmo nurkse\", Method is \"submission\", Location is \"turku , finland\". This fight was won.\n\n- **Row 25**:\n  - Opponent is \"sigitas antanavicius\", Method is \"tko (strikes)\", Location is \"helsinki , finland\".\n\n- **Rows 30, 28, and 29 are relevant for Turku, Finland:**\n  - Row 30: Opponent is \"arben lafti\", Method is \"decision\", Location is \"turku , finland\".

Whether Tommy Depret appears in the table.\n2. If so, confirming that the result against him was a loss for David Bielkheden.\n\nLet's go through the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Losses**: We need to find all rows where the \"result\" is marked as \"Loss.\"\n2. **Check Against Tommy Depret**: From these identified rows, we check if any mention Tommy Depret as an opponent.\n3. **Count Total Losses**: Verify that there are indeed 14 losses listed in the table.\n\nBased on the data provided:\n\n- Row 23: Opponent is Shiko Yamashita, Result is \"Loss.\"\n- Row 11: Opponent is Steve Dawson, Result is \"Win.\"\n- Row 12: Opponent is Josenildo Ramarho, Result is \"Win.\"\n- **Row 10**: Opponent is Tommy Depret, Result is \"Loss.\"\n- Row 20: Opponent is Shiko Yamashita, Result is \"Loss.\"\n- Row 24: Opponent is Ryuta Sakurai, Result is \"Loss.\"\n\nFrom these entries, we confirm:\n- Tommy Depret appears as an opponent in row 10.\n- The result against him was a loss.\n\nCounting the total number of losses:\n1. Shiko Yamashita (Row 23)\n2. Tommy Depret (Row 10)\n3. Shiko Yamashita again (Row 20)\n4. Ryuta Sakurai (Row 24)\n\nBased on this, there are at least four distinct instances where David Bielkheden lost, and Tommy Depret is indeed one of them.\n\nThus, the claim \"Tommy Depret be 1 of the 14 fighter that David Bielkheden have lose to in his career\" appears to be true based on the information available from these rows.
