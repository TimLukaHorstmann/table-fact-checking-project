    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"tie no 5 have the same score for both team\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in Row 5 of the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Look at Row 5 and focus on the \"score\" column.\n   \n2. **Examine the Score:**\n   - In Row 5, the score is listed as \"4 - 1\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Score:**\n   - The home team (Barnsley) scored 4 goals.\n   - The away team (Bristol Rovers) scored 1 goal.\n\n4. **Determine if Scores are the Same:**\n   - Since 4 is not equal to 1, the scores for both teams are different.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"tie no 5 have the same score for both team\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need the row index and column name for the relevant data.\n   - Row index for tie no 5 is 4 (since indexing starts from 0).\n   - Column name for scores is \"score\".\n\nThe final JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
