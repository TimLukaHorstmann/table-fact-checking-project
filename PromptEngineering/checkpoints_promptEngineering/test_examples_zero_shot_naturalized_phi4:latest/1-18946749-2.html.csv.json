The claim involves two specific pieces of information: identifying the peak named \"barurumea ridge\" and verifying that its \"col (m)\" is indeed 340 meters.\n\n1. **Locate Barurumea Ridge**: We need to find the row where the peak name matches \"Barurumea ridge\". Examining the table, we see that this name appears in Row 22 under the \"peak\" column.\n\n2. **Verify Column Measurement (Col)**: Once we have located Barurumea Ridge in Row 22, we check the value in the \"col (m)\" column for that row to ensure it matches the claim of 340 meters.\n\nFrom examining the table:\n- In Row 22, under the \"peak\" column, the peak is listed as \"barurumea ridge\".\n- The corresponding entry under the \"col (m)\" column is indeed 340.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are verified against the data in the table. Since the conditions specified in the claim align perfectly with the information provided in Row 22 for \"Barurumea ridge\", we can confidently conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cell information needed to verify this claim includes:\n- The row where \"barurumea ridge\" is listed as a peak (Row 22).\n- The column entry under \"col (m)\" for that particular peak, which confirms the measurement as 340 meters.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"peak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index is 21 because the table provided uses zero-based indexing for rows.",
