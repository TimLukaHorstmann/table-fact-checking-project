It was closed in 1997.\n3. It had a capacity of 53,000 at the time of closure.\n4. It is the largest former rugby union stadium that meets the above criteria.\n\nLet's check each condition step-by-step using the table:\n\n- **Stadium Name**: \"the national stadium\"\n  - Found in Row 1.\n\n- **Location**: Cardiff, Wales\n  - Confirmed in Row 1 (City: Cardiff, Country: Wales).\n\n- **Year of Closure**: 1997\n  - Verified in Row 1 (Closed: 1997).\n\n- **Capacity at Time of Closure**: 53,000\n  - Confirmed in Row 1 (Capacity: 53000).\n\nNow, we need to ensure that no other stadium listed meets all these criteria and has a larger capacity:\n\n- Review each row for stadiums with the same closure year (1997) or later:\n  - **Row 2**: Lansdowne Road, Dublin, Ireland, closed in 2007, Capacity: 49,000.\n  - **Row 3**: Petco Park, San Diego, USA, closed in 2010, Capacity: 42,445.\n  - **Row 4**: Athletic Park, Wellington, New Zealand, closed in 1999, Capacity: 39,000.\n  - **Row 5**: Carisbrook, Dunedin, New Zealand, closed in 2011, Capacity: 29,000.\n  - **Row 6**: StubHub Center, Carson, USA, closed in 2007, Capacity: 27,000.\n  - **Row 7**: Loftus Road, London, England, closed in 2001, Capacity: 18,500.\n  - **Row 8**: Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland, closed in 2006, Capacity: 16,500.\n  - **Row 9**: Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, Wales, closed in 2009, Capacity: 15,500.\n  - **Row 10**: Stade Jean-Bouin, Paris, France, closed in 2010, Capacity: 12,000.\n  - **Row 11**: Edgeley Park, Stockport, England, closed in 2012, Capacity: 10,900.\n  - **Row 12**: Firhill, Glasgow, Scotland, closed in 2012, Capacity: 10,887.\n\nNone of the other stadiums meet all the criteria (location, closure year) and have a larger capacity than \"the national stadium.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close , in 2012,\" we need to analyze relevant data from each row concerning both stadiums' closure years and capacities.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:**\n   - The key columns for verifying the claim are \"stadium\" (to identify edgeley park and firhill), \"closed\" (to check their closure year), and \"capacity (at time of closure)\" to determine if they qualify as large stadiums.\n   \n2. **Verify Closure Year:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Edgeley Park closed in 2012.\n     - Firhill closed in 2012.\n   - Both closures happened in the same year, 2012.\n\n3. **Determine \"Large\" Stadium Definition:**\n   - The claim refers to these stadiums as \"large,\" though it does not specify a capacity threshold for what constitutes large. For this analysis, we will assume that larger than the smallest capacity listed would qualify.\n   - From the table, the smallest stadium capacity is 10,800 at Firhill. Thus, edgeley park with a capacity of 10,900 can be considered \"large\" by comparison.\n\n4. **Check for Any Stadiums Closed After 2012:**\n   - Review all rows to ensure no stadium has a closure year later than 2012.\n     - The table entries are:\n       - 1997, 2007 (x2), 2010 (x2), 1999, 2011, and 2001 for previous years.\n     - No stadium closed after 2012.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Edgeley Park and Firhill are indeed the latest stadiums to close in the year 2012 according to the table.\n   - Based on our analysis of available data, no other stadium closed after them.\n\nTherefore, given that both conditions specified in the claim are satisfied, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Lansdowne Road is one of two rugby union stadiums in Ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have closed,\" we need to analyze relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Lansdowne Road:**\n   - Row 2 corresponds to Lansdowne Road.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `capacity (at time of closure)`: 49000\n     - `city`: Dublin\n     - `country`: Ireland\n     - `closed`: 2007\n\n2. **Check for other Irish stadiums with capacity over 10000 that have closed:**\n   - We need to filter the table for:\n     - Stadiums in `country` \"Ireland\".\n     - `capacity (at time of closure)` greater than 10000.\n     - The stadium must be marked as `closed`.\n\n3. **Examine each row for Irish stadiums meeting these criteria:**\n   - Row 1: \n     - Country: Wales\n   - Row 2:\n     - Country: Ireland, Capacity: 49000 (Closed)\n   - Row 3 to Row 12:\n     - None of these rows have `country` as \"Ireland\".\n\n4. **Conclusion from the table:**\n   - Only Lansdowne Road fits all criteria.\n   - There is no second Irish stadium with a capacity over 10000 that has closed.\n\n### Final Determination:\n\n- The claim states there are two such stadiums, but only one (Lansdowne Road) is identified. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2 for Lansdowne Road to confirm it meets all criteria.\n- All other rows need checking for additional Irish stadiums with capacity over 10000 that have closed, confirming there are none.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
