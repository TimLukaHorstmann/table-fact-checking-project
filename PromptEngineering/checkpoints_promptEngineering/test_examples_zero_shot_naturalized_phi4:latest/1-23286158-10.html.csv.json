Therefore, this game was a home game for Portland.\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - Location Attendance: \"staples center 18997\"\n   - As previously noted, Staples Center serves as a home venue for LA teams, not Portland. This game was an away game for Portland.\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - Location Attendance: \"rose garden 20691\"\n   - Rose Garden is the home arena for Portland, indicating this game was a home game for them.\n\nBased on this analysis, only two out of the five games were home games for Portland (Rows 3 and 5). Therefore, the claim that all five games were home games is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions across all five games in early April 2010:\n\n1. **Brandon Roy led in assists for each game**: Check if Brandon Roy has the highest number of assists in each row.\n2. **Brandon Roy was never the high scorer in any of those games**: Ensure that someone else is listed as having the most points in each game.\n\nWe'll examine each relevant column (\"high assists\" and \"high points\") for all rows to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - High Assists: Brandon Roy (6)\n  - High Points: Brandon Roy (24)\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - High Assists: Brandon Roy (6)\n  - High Points: Lamarcus Aldridge (27)\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - High Assists: Brandon Roy (6)\n  - High Points: Lamarcus Aldridge (27)\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - High Assists: Andre Miller (7) \n  - High Points: Lamarcus Aldridge (24)\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - High Assists: Andre Miller (7)\n  - High Points: Marcus Camby (30)\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n1. Brandon Roy did not lead in assists for games 4 and 5, as Andre Miller had more assists in those games.\n2.
