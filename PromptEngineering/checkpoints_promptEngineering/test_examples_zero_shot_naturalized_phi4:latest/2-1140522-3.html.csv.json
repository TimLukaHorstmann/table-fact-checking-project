    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the latest prr class locomotive be build the year before 1967\" is true or false, we need to identify the most recent (latest) production year among the given PRR classes in the table and check whether it occurred before 1967.\n\nLet's break down the relevant information from each row:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Build Date: 1948 - 1950\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Build Date: 1965\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Build Date: 1965\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Build Date: 1966\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Build Date: 1967\n\nThe task is to find the latest year in which a locomotive was built. By comparing the build years:\n\n1. The earliest are from Row 1 (1948 - 1950).\n2. Rows 2 and 3 both have a build date of 1965.\n3. Row 4 has a build date of 1966.\n4. Row 5 has a build date of 1967.\n\nThe latest year is clearly 1967, from Row 5. The claim states that the most recent locomotive was built \"the year before 1967\", which means it should have been constructed in or before 1966. However, we have a locomotive built in 1967 (Row 5), indicating that there is indeed a build date equal to 1967.\n\nSince there exists a PRR class locomotive built in the year 1967, and not exclusively before 1967, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are from:\n- Row 4: \"build date\" = 1966\n- Row 5: \"build date\" = 1967\n\nThe JSON object with the result is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"build date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
