This should be the only record of a tied game for that year.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the data provided in the table:\n\n- The table lists games played by a team during the season of 1960.\n- Each row contains information about a specific week's game, including date, opponent, result, and other details.\n- We need to identify any tied game from this list.\n\nUpon examining each row for the \"result\" column (which shows whether a game was won, lost, or tied):\n\n- Row 12: The result is \"t 38 - 38,\" indicating a tie game against the Buffalo Bills on November 27, 1960.\n\nThere are no other rows with a result marked as a tie. Additionally, all dates mentioned in the table pertain to the year 1960, not 1980.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim mentions \"November 6, 1980,\" but there is no entry for that date or year in the table.\n- There is only one tied game recorded, which occurred on November 27, 1960.\n\nThus, the claim is false because it refers to a non-existent record from 1980 and incorrectly identifies the date of the tied game.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- The relevant cells include Row 12's result and date to show the only tie in the table.\n- The claim about November 6, 1980, is unsupported as there are no records from that year.",
