The earnings comparison and the wins comparison both contradict the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 4, Earnings: Dave Stockton's earnings\n- Row 5, Earnings: Lee Trevino's earnings\n- Row 4, Wins: Dave Stockton's wins\n- Row 5, Wins: Lee Trevino's wins\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
