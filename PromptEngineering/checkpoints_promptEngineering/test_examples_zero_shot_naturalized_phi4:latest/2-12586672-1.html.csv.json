    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"player in the 1937 master tournament have to play 4 round,\" we need to determine if the information provided in the table supports this statement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim is about the number of rounds each player had to play in the 1937 Masters Tournament. Specifically, it states that players were required to play four rounds.\n\n2. **Relevant Information from the Table**:\n   - Each row represents a player and their performance.\n   - The scores for each player are given as sums of individual round scores (e.g., \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\").\n   - This indicates that there are four numbers added together to get the total score, implying four rounds were played.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - For each row in the table, we observe that the score is a sum of four components (e.g., \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70\").\n   - This consistent format across all rows suggests that every player played four rounds to achieve their total score.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The structure of the scores provided for each player confirms that they played four rounds, supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"no player scored below 70 in the final round\" is true or false, we need to inspect each row of the table and focus on the scores for the fourth round (final round) specifically. The relevant column here is \"score,\" but only the last value (representing the final round score) needs to be checked.\n\nLet's examine each player's score in the final round:\n\n- Row 1: Byron Nelson - Final round score = 70\n- Row 2: Ralph Guldahl - Final round score = 76\n- Row 3: Ed Dudley - Final round score = 74\n- Row 4: Harry Cooper - Final round score = 74\n- Row 5: Ky Laffoon - Final round score = 73\n- Row 6: Jimmy Thomson - Final round score = 73\n- Row 7: Al Watrous - Final round score = 75\n- Row 8: Tommy Armour - Final round score = 72\n- Row 9: Vic Ghezzi - Final round score = 77\n- Row 10: Leonard Dodson - Final round score = 77\n- Row 11: Jimmie Hines - Final round score = 77\n\nAfter checking all the final round scores, we observe that none of them are below 70. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those containing the fourth component (final round score) of the \"score\" for each player. These cells can be identified as follows:\n\n- Row 1: Final round score = 70\n- Row 2: Final round score = 76\n- Row 3: Final round score = 74\n- Row 4: Final round score = 74\n- Row 5: Final round score = 73\n- Row 6: Final round score = 73\n- Row 7: Final round score = 75\n- Row 8: Final round score = 72\n- Row 9: Final round score = 77\n- Row 10: Final round score = 77\n- Row 11: Final round score = 77\n\nThese scores confirm that no player scored below 70 in the final round.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
