    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 1 release date in canada\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row of the table and focus on the relevant columns: country and release date.\n\nHere's how we can evaluate the claim step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify rows where the country is Canada.\n2. Check if there is exactly one unique release date for those entries.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Country: Canada\n  - Release Date: 1980\n\nThis row matches our criteria of having a country as Canada with a release date in 1980. \n\nNow, let's verify if there are any other rows with Canada as the country and a different release date:\n\n- There are no other rows where the country is Canada.\n\nSince only one entry for Canada exists and it has the release date 1980, the claim that \"there be 1 release date in canada\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 5: Country (Canada) and Release Date (1980)\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the provided table data:\n\nThe claim is: \"Canada have have 1 release date cat no 72 877\"\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Country Check**: The claim mentions \"Canada\". We'll look for entries in the table where the country is Canada.\n\n2. **Release Date Count Check**: The claim states there should be 1 release associated with Canada. We need to check if there is exactly one entry for Canada.\n\n3. **Catalog Number Check**: The claim specifies catalog number \"72 877\". We'll verify whether any entry under Canada matches this catalog number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- Row 5: \n  - Release format: vinyl\n  - Country: Canada\n  - Label: quality\n  - Cat no: sv 2070\n  - Release date: 1980\n\nOnly one row (Row 5) corresponds to the country \"Canada\". Additionally, its catalog number is \"sv 2070\", not \"72 877\".\n\nTherefore, we conclude:\n- There is only 1 release associated with Canada.\n- However, none of these releases have the catalog number \"72 877\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cat no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
