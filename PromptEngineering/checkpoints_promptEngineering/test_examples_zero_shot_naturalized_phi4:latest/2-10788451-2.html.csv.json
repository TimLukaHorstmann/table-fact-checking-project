Hawthorn must have played as an away team.\n2. Their score should be the lowest compared to all other away teams listed in this table.\n\n### Relevant Conditions and Steps:\n\n1. **Identify if Hawthorn Played as an Away Team:**\n   - Check each row for whether Hawthorn appears under the \"away team\" column.\n   - In Row 2, we find that Hawthorn is indeed listed as the away team with a score of 6.8 (44).\n\n2. **Compare Scores of All Away Teams in Table:**\n   - Extract scores from the \"away team score\" column for all rows where an away team is mentioned.\n   - Convert each score into points (e.g., `11.14` translates to \\(11 \\times 6 + 14 = 80\\)).\n\n3. **Calculate Points for Each Away Team:**\n   - Row 1: North Melbourne, Score = 10.12 = \\(10 \\times 6 + 12 = 72\\)\n   - Row 2: Hawthorn, Score = 6.8 = \\(6 \\times 6 + 8 = 44\\)\n   - Row 3: Richmond, Score = 9.10 = \\(9 \\times 6 + 10 = 64\\)\n   - Row 4: Geelong, Score = 9.11 = \\(9 \\times 6 + 11 = 65\\)\n   - Row 5: St Kilda, Score = 12.12 = \\(12 \\times 6 + 12 = 84\\)\n   - Row 6: Fitzroy, Score = 9.4 = \\(9 \\times 6 + 4 = 58\\)\n\n4. **Determine the Lowest Away Team Score:**\n   - Compare all calculated scores:\n     - North Melbourne: 72\n     - Hawthorn: 44 (lowest score)\n     - Richmond: 64\n     - Geelong: 65\n     - St Kilda: 84\n     - Fitzroy: 58\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the comparison, Hawthorn indeed has the lowest away team score of 6.8 (44) in the table.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe answer is TRUE because Hawthorn has the lowest away team score among the teams listed in the table.",
