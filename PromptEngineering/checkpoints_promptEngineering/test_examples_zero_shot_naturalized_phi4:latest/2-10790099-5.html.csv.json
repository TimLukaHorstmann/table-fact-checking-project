Check if \"geelong\" has the highest value among these.\n\n**Relevant Column:**\n- The relevant column is \"away team score\".\n\n**Extracting Away Team Scores:**\n\n- **Row 1:** Footscray vs St Kilda, away team score = 8.10 (58)\n- **Row 2:** Fitzroy vs Geelong, away team score = 20.10 (130)\n- **Row 3:** Carlton vs Collingwood, away team score = 11.7 (73)\n- **Row 4:** North Melbourne vs Melbourne, away team score = 12.16 (88)\n- **Row 5:** Richmond vs Hawthorn, away team score = 6.9 (45)\n- **Row 6:** South Melbourne vs Essendon, away team score = 9.11 (65)\n\n**Comparing Scores:**\n\nNow, let's compare the converted scores:\n\n- Row 1: 58\n- Row 2: 130\n- Row 3: 73\n- Row 4: 88\n- Row 5: 45\n- Row 6: 65\n\nThe highest score is 130, which corresponds to Geelong in Row 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGeelong indeed has the highest away team score of 20.10 (130) as per the data provided.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to extract and compare specific data from the table regarding the crowd sizes at two venues: Punt Road Oval and Arden Street Oval.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\nThe claim states that \"Punt Road Oval venue have 2000 crowd more than Arden Street Oval.\"\n\nTo verify this:\n1. Identify the row where Punt Road Oval is mentioned.\n2. Find the 'crowd' size for Punt Road Oval.\n3. Identify the row where Arden Street Oval is mentioned.\n4. Find the 'crowd' size for Arden Street Oval.\n5. Calculate the difference in crowd sizes between these two venues and check if it is 2000.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Punt Road Oval Data (Row 5):**\n   - Row index: 5\n   - Crowd: 10000\n\n2. **Arden Street Oval Data (Row 4):**\n   - Row index: 4\n   - Crowd: 12000\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Punt Road Oval crowd: 10000\n   - Arden Street Oval crowd: 12000\n   - Difference = 10000 - 12000 = -2000\n\nThe difference is -2000, meaning Punt Road Oval has 2000 fewer people than Arden Street Oval, not more.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim that \"Punt Road Oval venue have 2000 crowd more than arden street oval\" is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n- Punt Road Oval (Row 5, 'crowd')\n- Arden Street Oval (Row 4, 'crowd')\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to assess which crowd size at each venue ranks third largest among all provided games in the table.\n\n1. First, extract the crowd sizes for each row:\n   - Row 1: 14,000 (Western Oval)\n   - Row 2: 13,000 (Brunswick Street Oval)\n   - Row 3: 32,000 (Princes Park)\n   - Row 4: 12,000 (Arden Street Oval)\n   - Row 5: 10,000 (Punt Road Oval)\n   - Row 6: 28,000 (Lake Oval)\n\n2. Next, sort these crowd sizes in descending order to find their ranks:\n   - 32,000 (Row 3, Princes Park)\n   - 28,000 (Row 6, Lake Oval)\n   - 14,000 (Row 1, Western Oval)\n   - 13,000 (Row 2, Brunswick Street Oval)\n   - 12,000 (Row 4, Arden Street Oval)\n   - 10,000 (Row 5, Punt Road Oval)\n\n3. Determine the third largest crowd:\n   - The sorted order shows that the third largest crowd is 14,000 at Western Oval.\n\n4. Check if the claim \"the third largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval\" is true:\n   - The third largest crowd size (14,000) was at Western Oval, not Lake Oval.\n   \n5. Since the crowd size for the Lake Oval is 28,000 and it ranks first, not third, the claim is false.\n\n6. Identify relevant cells that contain information needed to verify this claim:\n   - Row 1: Crowd (14,000)\n   - Row 2: Crowd (13,000)\n   - Row 3: Crowd (32,000)\n   - Row 4: Crowd (12,000)\n   - Row 5: Crowd (10,000)\n   - Row 6: Crowd (28,000)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
