    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to calculate the average of all the home team scores from the provided table and check if it is less than 12.\n\nThe relevant data for this task is found in the \"home team score\" column of each row in the table. Let's extract these scores and convert them into decimal form:\n\n- Row 1: Home team score = 14.7\n- Row 2: Home team score = 16.14\n- Row 3: Home team score = 13.12\n- Row 4: Home team score = 20.8\n- Row 5: Home team score = 19.14\n- Row 6: Home team score = 10.13\n\nNow, we calculate the average of these scores:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{14.7 + 16.14 + 13.12 + 20.8 + 19.14 + 10.13}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. Sum of scores: \\(14.7 + 16.14 + 13.12 + 20.8 + 19.14 + 10.13 = 94.03\\)\n2. Average: \\(\\frac{94.03}{6} \\approx 15.6717\\)\n\nThe average home team score is approximately 15.67, which is greater than 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the average of all the home team scores be less than 12\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than half of the away teams have a score greater than 10\" is true or false based on the table provided, we need to examine the relevant column for each row, which is the \"away team score.\"\n\nThe process involves checking the scores listed under \"away team score\" for all six rows:\n\n1. **Row 1:** The away team (St Kilda) has a score of 9.11.\n2. **Row 2:** The away team (North Melbourne) has a score of 9.12.\n3. **Row 3:** The away team (Richmond) has a score of 17.9.\n4. **Row 4:** The away team (South Melbourne) has a score of 8.15.\n5. **Row 5:** The away team (Geelong) has a score of 15.8.\n6. **Row 6:** The away team (Melbourne) has a score of 8.10.\n\nNext, we count how many of these scores are greater than 10:\n- Row 1: 9.11 \u2192 not greater than 10\n- Row 2: 9.12 \u2192 not greater than 10\n- Row 3: 17.9 \u2192 greater than 10\n- Row 4: 8.15 \u2192 not greater than 10\n- Row 5: 15.8 \u2192 greater than 10\n- Row 6: 8.10 \u2192 not greater than 10\n\nOut of the six away teams, only two have scores greater than 10 (Rows 3 and 5). \n\nTo verify the claim \"more than half,\" we calculate:\n- Total number of rows = 6\n- More than half would mean more than \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) teams\n\nSince only 2 away teams have scores greater than 10, this does not satisfy the condition of being \"more than half.\"\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all rows with the column \"away team score\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
