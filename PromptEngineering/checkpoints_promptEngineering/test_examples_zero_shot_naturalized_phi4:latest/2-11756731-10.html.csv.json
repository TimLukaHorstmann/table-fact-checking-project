The series on April 16 is \"2 - 2\", not \"2 - 0\". This condition fails.\n2. The attendance is indeed \"17113\".\n3. Detroit is the visiting team.\n\nSince the first condition of the claim (\"The series go to 2 - 0\") is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 4** (April 16):\n  - \"date\" column: \"april 16\"\n  - \"series\" column: \"2 - 2\"\n  - \"attendance\" column: \"17113\"\n  - \"visitor\" column: \"detroit\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
