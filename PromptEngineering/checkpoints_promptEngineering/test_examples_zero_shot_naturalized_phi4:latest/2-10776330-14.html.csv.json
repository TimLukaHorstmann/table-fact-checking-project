Identify relevant data: We are interested in the \"home team,\" \"crowd,\" and possibly \"venue\" columns since these will help us verify if Melbourne had the largest crowd.\n2. Check each row for the home team name and corresponding crowd size:\n   - Row 1: Home Team = Geelong, Crowd = 25723\n   - Row 2: Home Team = Fitzroy, Crowd = 23012\n   - Row 3: Home Team = South Melbourne, Crowd = 14350\n   - **Row 4: Home Team = Melbourne, Crowd = 31455**\n   - Row 5: Home Team = North Melbourne, Crowd = 15000\n   - Row 6: Home Team = Footscray, Crowd = 21639\n\n3.
