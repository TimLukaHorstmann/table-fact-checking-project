    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all of the center draft be from the united state,\" we need to focus on the rows where the position is listed as \"center\" and check their nationality.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We look for rows where the position is \"center.\"\n\n2. **Check Nationality for Center Positions:**\n   - Row 3: Player Randy Andreachuk, Position: Center, Nationality: Canada\n   - Row 4: Player Dennis Sobchuk, Position: Center, Nationality: Canada\n   - Row 9: Player Marcel Labrosse, Position: Center, Nationality: Canada\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that all centers should be from the United States.\n   - However, we found three players in center positions who are Canadian.\n\nSince not all center draft picks are from the United States, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
