    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the model cvp501 hammer grade\" is true or false based on the table provided, we need to evaluate the characteristics of the model `cvp501` specifically concerning the \"graded hammer\" attributes.\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: Locate the row corresponding to the model `cvp501`. According to the table, this is Row 13.\n   \n2. **Check Conditions in the Claim**:\n   - The claim mentions \"hammer grade\", which implies a focus on graded hammer features. \n   - In the table, there are two related columns: \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" and \"graded hammer three (gh3)\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Condition for Row 13**:\n   - **Graded Hammer (Non GH3)**: For model `cvp501`, this column has a value of \"yes\".\n   - **Graded Hammer Three (GH3)**: For model `cvp501`, this column has a value of \"no\".\n\n4. **Interpret the Claim**:\n   - The claim does not specify which type of graded hammer is being referred to, but given that the model has \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" as \"yes\", it suggests that there is some form of graded hammer feature present.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the model `cvp501` indeed has a graded hammer (specifically, the non-GH3 version), the claim can be considered true based on the available data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 13, Column \"graded hammer (non gh3)\"\n- Row 13, Column \"graded hammer three (gh3)\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer (non gh3)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer three (gh3)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The row index is zero-based, so Row 13 corresponds to `row_index` 12.)",
