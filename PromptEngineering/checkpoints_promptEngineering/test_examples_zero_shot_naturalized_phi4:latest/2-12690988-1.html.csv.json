    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"on september 10 , 2013 , the result be 3 - 2\", we need to compare it with the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim specifies a date: September 10, 2013.\n   - We must find the row in the table that matches this date. From the naturalized format, Row 5 has the date \"10 september 2013\".\n\n2. **Check the Result in the Identified Row:**\n   - In Row 5, check the 'result' column to see if it corresponds with \"3 - 2\".\n   - The 'result' for Row 5 is indeed \"3 - 2\".\n\n3. **Verify Other Conditions (if any):**\n   - Since the claim only specifies a date and result, there are no additional conditions to verify.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cell information from the table confirms that the claim is accurate.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We used `row_index: 4` because indexing starts from 0 in the naturalized format (Row 5 corresponds to index 4).\n- The relevant columns are 'date' and 'result' as these directly pertain to the claim's conditions.",
