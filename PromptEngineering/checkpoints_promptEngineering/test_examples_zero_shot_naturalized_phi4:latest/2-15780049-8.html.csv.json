The table indicates the high rebounders for game 62 as \"Vince Carter\" and \"Hakeem Olajuwon (7)\".\n2.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding game 65 against Orlando, we need to verify specific conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **Game Number**: Check if the row corresponds to game 65.\n2. **Opponent**: Ensure the team playing is indeed Orlando.\n3. **Score and Outcome**: Verify the score and determine whether it was a win or loss.\n\nLet's break down the process using relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: The claim refers to \"game: 65\", which corresponds to Row 6 in the provided table.\n  \n- **Team/Opponent Verification**:\n  - Check the \"team\" column for Row 6. It lists \"orlando,\" matching the opponent mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Score and Outcome**:\n  - The \"score\" column shows \"l 79 - 92 (ot)\", indicating a loss (\"l\") with a score of 79 to 92.\n  - According to the claim, it states that Orlando won with a score of 79 - 92. However, the table indicates it was a loss.\n\nThus, comparing these conditions against the table:\n\n- The game number and opponent are correctly identified as Row 6 for \"orlando\".\n- However, the result mentioned in the claim (\"win\") contradicts the actual outcome recorded in the table (\"loss\").\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE**.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from Row 6 of the table:\n\n1. Check if \"Vince Carter\" had 43 high points on March 10.\n2. Verify if \"Alvin Williams\" had 9 high assists on March 10.\n\nLet's break down the relevant details from Row 6 for these checks:\n- **Row Index**: 6 (corresponding to game: 65, date: March 10)\n- **High Points**: The entry shows \"Vince Carter (16)\", which indicates that Vince Carter scored 16 points.\n- **High Assists**: The entry shows \"Chris Childs (7)\", indicating Chris Childs made 7 assists.\n\nNow, let's compare these details with the claim:\n- The claim states that \"Vince Carter (43) have high point\" on March 10. However, Row 6 indicates he had only 16 points.\n- The claim also states that \"Alvin Williams (9) have high assist\" on March 10. But according to Row 6, Chris Childs had the highest assists with 7, not Alvin Williams.\n\nGiven these discrepancies between the table and the claim, both conditions specified in the claim are false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We must check if this matches the details given for game number 72.\n   \n2. **Date and Opponent**: Verify that game number 72 indeed took place on March 28, and confirm whether the opponent was Cleveland.\n\n3. **Score**: Check if the score was a win (\"W\") with 94 - 80 in overtime (OT).\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the table provided:\n\n- From Row 13:\n  - **Game Number**: It is indeed game number 72.\n  - **Date**: The date listed is March 28, which matches the claim.\n  - **Team/Opponent**: The opponent listed is Atlanta, not Cleveland as claimed. This immediately contradicts the claim.\n  - **Score**: The score recorded is \"W 85 - 83 (OT)\", not \"W 94 - 80 (OT)\".\n\nGiven this information, all aspects of the claim do not match the data in Row 13 for game number 72:\n\n- The opponent should be Cleveland but is actually Atlanta.\n- The score is different from what is claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false.
