    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two key conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a game where the away team scored 9.4 (58).\n2. Check whether Footscray was the home team in that particular match.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Away team score: 9.4 (58) (matches one condition of the claim)\n  - Home team: Essendon (does not satisfy the second part of the claim)\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Away team score: 9.8 (62) (does not match the required away team score)\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Away team score: 9.8 (62) (does not match the required away team score)\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Away team score: 17.7 (109) (does not match the required away team score)\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Away team score: 13.9 (87) (does not match the required away team score)\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Away team score: 16.10 (106) (does not match the required away team score)\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 1 has an away team score of 9.4 (58), but in that game, Essendon was the home team, not Footscray.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there is no instance where Footscray was the home team with an away team scoring 9.4 (58).\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row 1, \"away team score\" for verifying the condition of the away team's score.\n- Row 1, \"home team\" for checking which team was at home.\n\nNow, we can construct the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
