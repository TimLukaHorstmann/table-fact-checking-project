We are interested in the entry where the date is \"June 13\".\n   \n2. **Locate the record for June 13:**\n   - According to Row 13, the date is indeed \"June 13\". We need to check the 'record' column of this row.\n\n3. **Verify the record value:**\n   - In Row 13, under the 'record' column, the entry is \"29 - 32\".\n\n4. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states that the record for June 13 should be \"29 - 32\". This matches exactly with what we found in Row 13.\n\nSince the recorded value of \"29 - 32\" for June 13 matches the claim, the statement is true.\n\nThus, the relevant cell to verify this is from Row 13 under the 'record' column. The JSON object reflecting our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: In programming, indexing typically starts from zero, so the row for June 13 corresponds to Row 12 in zero-based index.)",
