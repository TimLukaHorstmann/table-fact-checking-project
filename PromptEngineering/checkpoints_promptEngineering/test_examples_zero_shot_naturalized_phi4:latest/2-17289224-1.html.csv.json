We will look for rows that match these criteria.\n\n2. **Extract Data**:\n   - Row 4: This row matches both the season (2005) and the series (formula three sudamericana). It lists \"poles\" as 1.\n   - Row 5: Although this row also corresponds to the year 2005, it mentions a different series (\"formula renault 2.0 brazil\"), so it is not relevant for this specific claim.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that \"in season of 2005, the sum of pole with the series of formula three sudamericana be 1\". From Row 4, we see that the number of poles is indeed 1 for the specified series in 2005.\n\nSince there are no other rows matching both the season and series criteria, the sum of poles for \"formula three sudamericana\" in 2005 is confirmed to be 1.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"poles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
