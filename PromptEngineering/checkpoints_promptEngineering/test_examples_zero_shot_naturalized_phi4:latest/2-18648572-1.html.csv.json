    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the San Francisco 49ers play against the Los Angeles Rams four times in 1973,\" we need to focus on two columns from the table: \"opponent\" and \"week.\" We will check if there are exactly four entries where the opponent is the \"Los Angeles Rams.\"\n\nLet's examine each row for relevant information:\n\n- **Row 1**: Opponent = Miami Dolphins (Not relevant)\n- **Row 2**: Opponent = Denver Broncos (Not relevant)\n- **Row 3**: Opponent = Los Angeles Rams (Relevant)\n- **Row 4**: Opponent = Atlanta Falcons (Not relevant)\n- **Row 5**: Opponent = Minnesota Vikings (Not relevant)\n- **Row 6**: Opponent = New Orleans Saints (Not relevant)\n- **Row 7**: Opponent = Atlanta Falcons (Not relevant)\n- **Row 8**: Opponent = Detroit Lions (Not relevant)\n- **Row 9**: Opponent = Washington Redskins (Not relevant)\n- **Row 10**: Opponent = Los Angeles Rams (Relevant)\n- **Row 11**: Opponent = Green Bay Packers (Not relevant)\n- **Row 12**: Opponent = Philadelphia Eagles (Not relevant)\n- **Row 13**: Opponent = New Orleans Saints (Not relevant)\n- **Row 14**: Opponent = Pittsburgh Steelers (Not relevant)\n\nFrom this examination, we find that the San Francisco 49ers played against the Los Angeles Rams in:\n\n- Row 3\n- Row 10\n\nThus, they played against the Los Angeles Rams only twice in 1973.
