The specified attendance value of 17136 must be present in the \"attendance\" column.\n2. No other attendance value should be lower than 17136.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells from the provided table data:\n\n- **Row 1**: Attendance is 17136. This matches the claim.\n- **Row 2**: Attendance is 18098, which is higher than 17136.\n- **Row 3**: Attendance is 49372, which is much higher than 17136.\n- **Row 4**: Attendance is 51910, which is also higher than 17136.\n- **Row 5**: Attendance is 54092, which is again higher than 17136.\n- **Row 6**: Attendance is 25286, still higher than 17136.\n- **Rows 7 and 8**: Attendance is listed as \"postponed\", so not applicable.\n- **Row 9**: Attendance is noted as \"n/a\", thus not applicable for comparison.\n- **Row 10**: Attendance is 27219, which exceeds 17136.\n- **Rows 11 to 17**: All these attendance values (32962, 42173, 41087, 36501, 39114, 40383, and 20506 respectively) are higher than 17136.\n- **Row 18**: Attendance is 31021, which is also greater than 17136.\n- **Row 19**: Attendance is 23643, still above 17136.\n- **Rows 20 to 24**: These have attendance values of 32364, 30418, 26266, 46088, and 40131 respectively, all higher than 17136.\n- **Rows 25 to 28**: The attendance figures are 43328, 28253, 34844, and 32754; none is lower than 17136.\n\nFrom this analysis, the lowest attendance recorded in the table is indeed 17136.

The goal is to determine if any game had a higher score than 12 points by a single team.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We focus on the \"score\" column because it contains information about the scores of both teams in each match.\n\n2. **Parse Each Row**:\n   - Check each row for its \"score\" entry.\n   - Determine which team scored more points in that game by comparing the two numbers separated by a hyphen.\n\n3. **Compare Against Claim**: We need to find out if any single team's score exceeds 12 in any of these games.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Score is 6-5 (highest individual score = 6)\n   - Row 2: Score is 5-3 (highest individual score = 5)\n   - Row 3: Score is 7-6 (highest individual score = 7)\n   - Row 4: Score is 8-1 (highest individual score = 8)\n   - Row 5: Score is 2-1 (highest individual score = 2)\n   - Row 6: Score is 6-5 (highest individual score = 6)\n   - Row 7 and 8 are postponed, no scores.\n   - Row 9: Score is 9-7 (highest individual score = 9)\n   - Row 10: Score is 10-4 (highest individual score = 10)\n   - **Row 11**: Score is 12-7 (highest individual score = 12) \n     - This matches the claim but does not exceed it.\n   - Row 12: Score is 7-2 (highest individual score = 7)\n   - Row 13: Score is 3-2 (highest individual score = 3)\n   - Row 14: Score is 5-4 (highest individual score = 5)\n   - Row 15: Score is 7-4 (highest individual score = 7)\n   - Row 16: Score is 4-3 (highest individual score = 4)\n   - Row 17: Score is 8-1 (highest individual score = 8)\n   - Row 18: Score is 7-6 (highest individual score = 7)\n   - Row 19: Score is 4-2 (highest individual score = 4)\n   - Row 20: Score is 10-2 (highest individual score = 10)\n   - Row 21: Score is 6-3 (highest individual score = 6)\n   - Row 22: Score is 9-7 (highest individual score = 9)\n   - Row 23: Score is 3-1 (highest individual score = 3)\n   - Row 24: Score is 8-7 (highest individual score = 8)\n   - Row 25: Score is 1-0 (highest individual score = 1)\n   - Row 26: Score is 8-5 (highest individual score = 8)\n   - Row 27: Score is 4-3 (highest individual score = 4)\n   - Row 28: Score is 9-6 (highest individual score = 9)\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The highest single-team score observed was exactly 12, which occurred in row 11.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the lowest attendance in the 2004 Texas Ranger season being 54,092, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table. The specific column of interest is \"attendance,\" and we must check each entry for all games listed to identify the minimum value.\n\nLet's go through the attendance values step by step:\n\n1. Row 1: Attendance = 17,136\n2. Row 2: Attendance = 18,098\n3. Row 3: Attendance = 49,372\n4. Row 4: Attendance = 51,910\n5. Row 5: Attendance = 54,092\n6. Row 6: Attendance = 25,286\n7. Rows 7 and 8: Postponed (irrelevant for minimum attendance)\n8. Row 9: Attendance = N/A (not applicable for comparison)\n9. Row 10: Attendance = 27,219\n10. Row 11: Attendance = 32,962\n11. Row 12: Attendance = 42,173\n12. Row 13: Attendance = 41,087\n13. Row 14: Attendance = 36,501\n14. Row 15: Attendance = 39,114\n15. Row 16: Attendance = 40,383\n16. Row 17: Attendance = 20,506\n17.

Row 28: Attendance = 32,754\n\nFrom the above analysis, the smallest attendance number recorded is 17,136 (from Row 1). The claim states that the lowest attendance was 54,092, which is actually from Row 5. Thus, the claim is incorrect because there are attendance figures lower than 54,092.\n\nThe relevant cells for this determination involve checking all rows for the \"attendance\" column to find the minimum value.
