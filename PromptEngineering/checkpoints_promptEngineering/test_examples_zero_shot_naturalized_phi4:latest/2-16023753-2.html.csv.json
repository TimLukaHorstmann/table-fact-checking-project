Identify the relevant column: The 'result' column contains information about the scores. We are interested in extracting and comparing the first number from each result entry, which represents the points scored by the Dolphins.\n   \n2. Extract the Dolphin's score from each game:\n   - Week 1: Result \"w 12 - 0\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 12 points\n   - Week 2: Result \"w 34 - 24\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 34 points\n   - Week 3: Result \"l 27 - 14\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 14 points\n   - Week 4: Result \"w 14 - 6\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 14 points\n   - Week 5: Result \"l 17 - 7\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 7 points\n   - Week 6: Result \"l 38 - 35\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 35 points\n   - Week 7: Result \"w 32 - 14\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 32 points\n   - Week 8: Result \"w 21 - 7\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 21 points\n   - Week 9: Result \"w 30 - 14\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 30 points\n   - Week 10: Result \"w 20 - 17\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 20 points\n   - Week 11: Result \"l 17 - 6\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 6 points\n   - Week 12: Result \"w 37 - 0\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 37 points\n   - Week 13: Result \"w 38 - 14\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 38 points\n   - Week 14: Result \"w 24 - 17\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 24 points\n   - Week 15: Result \"w 31 - 24\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 31 points\n   - Week 16: Result \"w 34 - 14\" \u2192 Dolphins scored 34 points\n\n3. Determine the highest score:\n   - The maximum score from the list above is 38 points, which occurred in Week 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n4. Evaluate the claim: \n   - The claim states that the most point score by the Dolphin in a game is 34 points. However, we found that the Dolphins scored 38 points in a game.\n   \nThus, the claim is false because there was a game where they scored more than 34 points.\n\n5. Identify relevant rows and column:\n   - We need to verify all games where the Dolphins' scores were 34 or higher. This includes Week 2 (34 points), Week 6 (35 points), Week 12 (37 points), and Week 13 (38 points).\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
