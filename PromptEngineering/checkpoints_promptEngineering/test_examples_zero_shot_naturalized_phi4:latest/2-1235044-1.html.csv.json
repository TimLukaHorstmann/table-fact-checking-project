The number of laps completed (laps) must be 3.\n\nLet's examine each row in the provided table to check these conditions:\n\n- Row 1: qual is 144.208 and laps are 200.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 2: qual is 146.909 and laps are 200.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 3: qual is 146.52 and laps are 200.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 4: qual is 149.123 and laps are 200.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 5: qual is 153.932 and laps are 200.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 6: qual is 157.246 and laps are 184.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 7: qual is 162.433 and laps are 166.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- **Row 8:** qual is 165.229 and laps are 3.0, meeting both conditions.\n- Row 9: qual is 167.613 and laps are 200.0, so it does not meet the second condition.\n- Row 10: qual is 166.428 and laps are 105.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 11: qual is 168.895 and laps are 54.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 12: qual is 173.821 and laps are 174.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 13: qual is 181.415 and laps are 196.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 14: qual is 191.622 and laps are 21.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 15: qual is 181.699 and laps are 187.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 16: qual is 186.984 and laps are 7.0, so it does not meet the second condition.\n- Row 17: qual is 186.48 and laps are 100.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n- Row 18: qual is 190.84 and laps are 34.0, so it does not meet either condition.\n\nThe only row that satisfies both conditions (qual of 165.229 and laps of 3) is Row 8.
