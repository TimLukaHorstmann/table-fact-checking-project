Identify the row where B\u00f6rje Jansson appears:\n   - Row 8 corresponds to B\u00f6rje Jansson, as indicated by the rider column.\n\n2. Verify the speed for this row:\n   - In Row 8, under the \"speed\" column, it shows 90.57 mph.\n\n3. Compare this value with the claim:\n   - The claim states that B\u00f6rje Jansson's speed is 90.57 mph.\n   - The table confirms that his speed is indeed 90.57 mph in Row 8.\n\nSince the information from the table matches the claim, we conclude that the claim is true. \n\nThe relevant cell for verifying this claim is:\n- Row index: 8\n- Column name: \"speed\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The row index is zero-based in this context.)",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Rider Name and Country**: We must check if \"b\u00f6rje jansson\" is indeed listed as a rider from the \"United Kingdom\".\n2. **Speed**: We must confirm that his speed is 90.57 mph.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data from each row in the table for these conditions:\n\n- For Row 8:\n  - Rider: b\u00f6rje jansson\n  - Country: sweden\n  - Speed: 90.57 mph\n\nFrom this information, we observe:\n1. The rider \"b\u00f6rje jansson\" is listed with a speed of 90.57 mph, which supports the claim about his speed.\n2. However, the country associated with b\u00f6rje jansson is \"sweden\", not \"united kingdom\". This directly contradicts the part of the claim regarding his nationality.\n\nSince one of the conditions in the claim (country being \"United Kingdom\") does not match the table data, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
