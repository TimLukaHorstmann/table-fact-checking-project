Check if this attendance figure (61603) is indeed the lowest among those first ten weeks.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The claim refers to \"the first 10 weeks,\" so we need to consider weeks 1 through 10.\n- We will extract and compare the attendance figures for these weeks.\n\nHere are the relevant data points from the table (weeks 1 through 10):\n\n- Week 1: Attendance = 64006\n- Week 2: Attendance = 45653\n- Week 3: Attendance = 68481\n- Week 4: Attendance = 61535\n- Week 5: Attendance = 55435\n- Week 6: Attendance = 63406\n- Week 7: Attendance = 54328\n- **Week 8: Attendance = 61603** (This is the attendance figure mentioned in the claim)\n- Week 9: Attendance = 73118\n- Week 10: Attendance = 54759\n\nNow, let's compare these figures to see if 61603 is indeed the lowest:\n\n- The attendances are: 64006, 45653, 68481, 61535, 63406, 54328, **61603**, 73118, and 54759.\n- Among these, the lowest attendance figure is 45653 (Week 2).\n\nThus, week 8 does not have the lowest attendance during the first ten weeks.
