We will look for this date in the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Venue:** According to the claim, the venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna.\" We need to check the \"venue\" column to see if there's a match with this location.\n\n3. **Competition:** The competition mentioned is \"friendly\". We will verify this in the \"competition\" column.\n\n4. **Result:** Finally, the result stated is \"2 - 4\", which needs to be checked against the \"result\" column.\n\nNow let\u2019s go through the table to find Row 10 since it corresponds with the date:\n\n- **Row 10:**\n  - Date: \"26 May 1999\"\n  - Venue: \"lugo , emilia - romagna\"\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Result: \"1 - 4\"\n\nLet's evaluate each condition:\n- The date matches \"26 May 1999\".\n- The venue is correctly listed as \"lugo , emilia - romagna\".\n- The competition type is indeed \"friendly\".\n- However, the result in the table is \"1 - 4\", not \"2 - 4\" as claimed.\n\nSince one of the conditions (the result) does not match what's stated in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is false.
