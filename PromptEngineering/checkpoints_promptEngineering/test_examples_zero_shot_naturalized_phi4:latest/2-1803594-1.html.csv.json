Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute has the highest enrollment with 1895.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Extract Enrollment Data**: We will extract the enrollment numbers from each row to compare them.\n   - Row 1: Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute, Enrollment: 1533\n   - Row 2: Centre Dufferin District High School, Enrollment: 998\n   - Row 3: Centre Wellington District High School, Enrollment: 1459\n   - Row 4: College Heights Secondary School, Enrollment: 649\n   - Row 5: Erin District High School, Enrollment: 616\n   - Row 6: Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute, Enrollment: 1314\n   - **Row 7: John F.

Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute's 1895.\n   - The highest enrollment number in the list is indeed 1895 for John F. Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute.\n\n3. **Verify Claim**: Since no other school has an enrollment number greater than 1895, the claim that \"John F. Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute have the highest enrollment with 1895\" is true.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for John F. Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute's enrollment is in Row 7.\n   - Additionally, to ensure no other school has a higher enrollment, we need to check the enrollment numbers of all schools (Rows 1-11).\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are those containing the enrollment data for each school.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about \"erin district high school\" having the lowest enrollment of 649, we need to verify both parts: whether Erin District High School has an enrollment number of 649 and whether this is indeed the lowest in the table.\n\n1. **Identifying Erin District High School Enrollment:**\n   - From the naturalized format table:\n     - Row 5 corresponds to \"erin district high school\" with an enrollment value of 616.\n   \n2. **Comparing All Schools' Enrollments:**\n   - We need to check each row for its enrollment number and find the minimum value.\n   - Enrollment values from the rows are as follows:\n     - Row 1: 1533\n     - Row 2: 998\n     - Row 3: 1459\n     - Row 4: 649 (college heights secondary school)\n     - Row 5: 616 (erin district high school)\n     - Row 6: 1314\n     - Row 7: 1895\n     - Row 8: 795\n     - Row 9: 1574\n     - Row 10: 680\n     - Row 11: 996\n\n3. **Finding the Lowest Enrollment:**\n   - The lowest enrollment in this list is 616, belonging to Erin District High School.\n   - College Heights Secondary School has an enrollment of 649.\n\nThus, while Erin District High School indeed has one of the lowest enrollments (at 616), it does not have the lowest; that distinction belongs to another school with a higher number. Therefore, the claim is false because Erin District High School does not have the lowest enrollment, and its enrollment number is incorrectly stated as 649 instead of 616.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row 5, \"enrollment\" (to check Erin's actual enrollment)\n- All rows in the \"enrollment\" column to find the minimum value\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
