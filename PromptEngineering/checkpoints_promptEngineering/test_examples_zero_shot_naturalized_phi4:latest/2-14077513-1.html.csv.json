    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, let's break down each condition specified in it and verify against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Number of Games**: The claim states \"7 game\". We need to find rows with 7 games.\n\n2. **Number of Draws**: The claim specifies \"0 drawn\". We need to identify rows where the number of draws is 0.\n\n3. **Number of Losses**: The claim mentions \"4 loss\". We must locate rows that have exactly 4 losses.\n\n4. **Points Difference**: The claim provides a points difference of \"19 - 19\". This indicates both goals scored and conceded are 19, resulting in a zero net point difference (19 - 19 = 0).\n\n5. **Points**: The claim states \"6 point\". We should find rows where the total points are 6.\n\nNow let's analyze each row from the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 1\n  - Lost: 0\n  - Points Difference: 41 - 16 (Net = +25)\n  - Points: 13\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 4\n  - Lost: 0\n  - Points Difference: 30 - 21 (Net = +9)\n  - Points: 10\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 1\n  - Lost: 2\n  - Points Difference: 24 - 20 (Net = +4)\n  - Points: 9\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 2\n  - Lost: 2\n  - Points Difference: 23 - 28 (Net = -5)\n  - Points: 8\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 1\n  - Lost: 3\n  - Points Difference: 22 - 15 (Net = +7)\n  - Points: 7\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Lost: 4\n  - Points Difference: 19 - 19 (Net = 0)\n  - Points: 6\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Lost: 6\n  - Points Difference: 13 - 26 (Net = -13)\n  - Points: 2\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Games: 7\n  - Drawn: 1\n  - Lost: 6\n  - Points Difference: 13 - 40 (Net = -27)\n  - Points: 1\n\nNow, check Row 6 against all conditions of the claim:\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Games: 7 (Matches)\n  - Drawn: 0 (Matches)\n  - Lost: 4 (Matches)\n  - Points Difference: 19 - 19 (Net = 0, Matches)\n  - Points: 6 (Matches)\n\nRow 6 satisfies all the conditions specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are from Row 6 and pertain to \"games\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", \"points difference\", and \"points\".\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
