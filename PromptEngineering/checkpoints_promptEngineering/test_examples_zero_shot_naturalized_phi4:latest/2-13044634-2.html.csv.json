    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:\n\n1. **Identify games that went for 3 rounds:**\n   - Row 1 (Cliff Wright): 3 rounds\n   - Row 2 (LC Davis): 3 rounds\n   - Row 3 (Jonatas Novaes): 3 rounds\n\n2. **Check if the game against Cliff Wright is one of these 3-round games:**  \n   - Yes, the game against Cliff Wright went for 3 rounds.\n\n3. **Verify that all 3-round games are in Hammond, Indiana:**\n   - Row 1 (Cliff Wright): Location is Hammond, Indiana.\n   - Row 2 (LC Davis): Location is Valparaiso, United States.\n   - Row 3 (Jonatas Novaes): Location is Hoffman Estates, Illinois.\n\nThe claim states that all three games were in Hammond, Indiana. However, the game against LC Davis was held in Valparaiso, and the game against Jonatas Novaes was in Hoffman Estates. Thus, not all 3-round games took place in Hammond, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant cells to verify:**\n\n- For Row 1 (Cliff Wright): Check rounds, time, and location.\n- For Row 2 (LC Davis): Check rounds, time, and location.\n- For Row 3 (Jonatas Novaes): Check rounds, time, and location.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
