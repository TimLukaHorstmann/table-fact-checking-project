The claim specifies that two of Kelly's fights ended this way.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: Method is \"ko (punch)\". This indicates a knockout, not a technical knockout.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Method is \"submission (triangle choke)\", which is a submission, not a TKO.\n  \n- **Row 3**: Method is \"decision\", so this fight was decided by judges' decision, not a TKO.\n  \n- **Row 4**: Method is \"tko\". This could potentially be relevant, but we need to confirm if it's due to strikes. The event and opponent are the same as in Row 3, suggesting these were part of the same fight night or tournament. However, there's no specific mention of strikes here.\n  \n- **Row 5**: Method is \"decision\", so this was decided by judges' decision, not a TKO.\n  \n- **Row 6**: Method is \"tko (strikes)\". This matches the condition specified in the claim.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find:\n\n- Row 4: TKO but no specific mention of strikes.\n- Row 6: TKO via strikes.\n\nOnly one fight (Row 6) explicitly states a TKO due to strikes.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Kelly's third win against Rudy Vallederas by TKO outside of a typical round, let's break down the conditions in the claim and match them with the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Kelly's Wins**: We need to confirm that Kelly's wins occur sequentially, and determine which is her third win.\n2. **Opponent for Third Win**: The third win must be against Rudy Vallederas.\n3. **Method of Win**: The method should be TKO.\n4. **Round Information**: The round should not fall under the typical category (i.e., it should say \"n/a\" or some indication that is non-standard).\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- Row 6: Kelly's first win against Shad Smith via TKO in Round 1.\n- Row 5: Kelly's second win against Duane Ludwig via Decision in Round 3.\n- Row 4: Kelly's third win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO, with \"Round: n/a\".\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Kelly's Third Win**: Verified as the match in Row 4.\n- **Opponent is Rudy Vallederas**: Verified as per Row 4.\n- **Method of Win is TKO**: Verified as per Row 4.\n- **Non-standard Round Information (n/a)**: Verified as \"Round: n/a\" in Row 4.\n\nAll conditions from the claim match with the data provided in Row 4.
