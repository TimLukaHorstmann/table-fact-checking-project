Richard Simpson should belong to the Labour Party.\n2. He must hold the position specified in the title (which involves checking whether his name appears as \"first minister\").\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row from the table:\n\n- **Row 4**: This contains data about Richard Simpson:\n  - `name`: richard simpson\n  - `party`: labour\n  - `first minister`: jack mcconnell\n\nChecking this row, we confirm that Richard Simpson is indeed a member of the Labour Party.\n\nNext, the claim seems to suggest checking whether he was \"1 member of the labour party be,\" which implies he should have been a first minister. However, in Row 4:\n- The `first minister` for Richard Simpson is listed as Jack McConnell, not Richard Simpson himself.\n\nThus, Richard Simpson was not a first minister while serving as mentioned in Row 4. Therefore, he does not fulfill the criteria implied by the claim to be \"1 member of the labour party\" who held that specific office position (i.e., being the first minister).\n\nBased on this evaluation, the conditions of the claim are not fully satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"first minister\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, it only mentions him as part of this party and timeframe without specifying him holding the \"minister for community safety and legal affairs.\"\n\nSince there is no row explicitly stating that Fergus Ewing was the \"minister for community safety and legal affairs,\" we conclude the claim is not supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.
