    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we must analyze each part of it against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Claim:** \"Chris Mills be the tallest player.\"\n   - Chris Mills is listed with a height of 6-7.\n   - Other players' heights are: Alonzo Mourning (6-10), Chris Jackson (6-0), Billy Owens (6-9), Kenny Williams (6-10).\n   - Both Alonzo Mourning and Kenny Williams have the tallest recorded height at 6-10, not Chris Mills. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Claim:** \"Billy Owens be the shortest player.\"\n   - Billy Owens has a height of 6-9.\n   - The shortest listed player is Chris Jackson with a height of 6-0. Hence, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n3. **Claim:** \"Both be select for the NBA.\"\n   - Chris Mills was selected in the 1st round (22nd pick) of the 1993 draft by the Cavs.\n   - Billy Owens was selected in the 1st round (3rd pick) of the 1991 draft by the Kings.\n   - Both were indeed drafted into the NBA, so this part of the claim is true.\n\nThe entire claim must be true for it to hold.
