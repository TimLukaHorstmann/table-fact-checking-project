    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"3 game series in the 1989 world ice hockey championships only lost 1 out of 4 games,\" we need to examine the provided table and identify which row(s) match this description.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe claim specifies:\n- A total of 4 games played.\n- Only 1 game was lost.\n\nWe will check each row in the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Games: 4\n  - Lost: 1\n  - This matches the condition of losing only 1 out of 4 games.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Games: 4\n  - Lost: 1\n  - This also matches the condition, but it mentions a draw, which is not relevant to the specific claim about losses.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Games: 4\n  - Lost: 2\n  - Does not match the condition (lost more than 1 game).\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Games: 4\n  - Lost: 3\n  - Does not match the condition (lost more than 1 game).\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Games: 4\n  - Lost: 4\n  - Does not match the condition (lost all games).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is fully supported by Row 1, as it specifies a series where only 1 out of 4 games was lost. Therefore, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify this, we need to look at:\n- The number of games played in each row.\n- The number of games lost in each row.\n\nThe relevant cells are from Row 1 for both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
