    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Prince Park having the highest crowd participation during a match on 22 June 1974 is true or false, we need to examine the \"crowd\" column for each game listed in the table.\n\nThe relevant part of the claim pertains to the venue \"princes park\" and its associated crowd size. Here's how we break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the match at Prince Park**:  \n   - From Row 2, we see that Hawthorn (home team) played against Richmond (away team) at Princes Park.\n\n2. **Check the crowd size for this match**:\n   - The crowd for this match was 15,710.\n\n3. **Compare with other matches' crowd sizes**:\n   - Row 1: Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 9,016.\n   - Row 2: Princes Park (our target) had a crowd of 15,710.\n   - Row 3: Junction Oval had a crowd of 12,519.\n   - Row 4: Windy Hill had a crowd of 25,867.\n   - Row 5: MCG had a crowd of 23,336.\n   - Row 6: VFL Park had a crowd of 16,320.\n\nFrom this comparison, we see that the highest crowd recorded was at Windy Hill with 25,867 spectators. Therefore, Princes Park did not have the highest crowd participation on that date.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the crowd sizes for each match:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
