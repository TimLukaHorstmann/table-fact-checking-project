    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"potter co in copiah be the first project propose , but the last to be list,\" we need to examine two conditions based on the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **First Project Proposed**: This condition requires us to find the earliest \"proposed\" date across all rows and check if this corresponds to \"Potter Co, County: Copiah.\"\n\n2. **Last Project Listed**: This condition involves identifying which project has the latest \"listed\" date, ensuring it matches \"Potter Co, County: Copiah.\"\n\nLet's examine these conditions:\n\n### Check for First Proposed:\n- Row 1: proposed: 06 / 14 / 2001\n- Row 2: proposed: 06 / 23 / 1993\n- Row 3: proposed: 05 / 11 / 2000\n- Row 4: proposed: 09 / 08 / 1983\n- Row 5: proposed: 10 / 15 / 1984\n- Row 6: proposed: 03 / 08 / 2004\n- Row 7: proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993\n- Row 8: proposed: 09 / 27 / 2006\n- Row 9: Proposed date is given as \"cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL,\" which cannot be used for comparison.\n\nAmong the rows with explicit dates, **Row 4 (Flowood Site)** has the earliest proposed date, \"09 / 08 / 1983.\" Thus, **Potter Co** is not the first project proposed.\n\n### Check for Last Listed:\n- Row 1: listed: 09 / 13 / 2001\n- Row 2: listed: -\n- Row 3: listed: 07 / 27 / 2000\n- Row 4: listed: 09 / 21 / 1984\n- Row 5: listed: 06 / 10 / 1986\n- Row 6: listed: 07 / 22 / 2004\n- Row 7: listed: -\n- Row 8: listed: 03 / 07 / 2007\n- Row 9: listed: cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\n\nAmong the rows with explicit dates, **Row 8 (Sonford Products)** has the latest listed date, \"03 / 07 / 2007.\" Thus, **Potter Co** is not the last project listed.\n\nSince neither condition in the claim is met (\"Potter Co\" is neither the first proposed nor the last listed), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are related to the \"proposed\" and \"listed\" columns for all rows, specifically focusing on Row 7 (for Potter Co) and comparing against other rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
