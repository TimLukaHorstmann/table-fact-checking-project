    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on two main pieces of information for Justin Rose:\n\n1. **Country**: We must verify which country is listed as Justin Rose's country.\n2. **Relevance to Claim**: The claim pertains specifically to whether Justin Rose is from the United States.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 5 provides data about Justin Rose, stating that his \"country: england.\"\n\nTherefore, according to this row, Justin Rose is from England, not the United States. This directly contradicts the claim that he is from the United States.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are as follows:\n- **Row Index**: 4 (since rows are listed starting from index 0)\n- **Column Name**: \"country\"\n\nWith this information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn rank lower than Tiger Woods\" is true or false, we need to examine the specific pieces of information in the table relevant to this comparison:\n\n1. **Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's Information:**\n   - According to Row 6, Thomas Bj\u00f8rn has a placement of \"t6,\" which means he tied for 6th place.\n   \n2. **Tiger Woods' Information:**\n   - From Row 9, Tiger Woods also has a placement of \"t6,\" indicating that he also tied for 6th place.\n\nSince both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are listed as tying for the same position (6th place), neither ranks lower than the other. Therefore, the claim that Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods is false.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this conclusion include:\n\n- Row 6: The \"place\" column indicates Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's placement.\n- Row 9: The \"place\" column shows Tiger Woods' placement.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.
