    "resp": "To verify the claim about George Town's performance in NTFA Div 1, we need to check two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. George Town has exactly 8 wins.\n2. George Town has fewer than 2 draws.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row for the team named \"george town\" and identify the necessary columns:\n\n- **Row Index**: We are interested in Row 4 since it corresponds to George Town based on its position in the table:\n  - \"ntfa div 1: george town, wins: 9, byes: 0, losses: 8, draws: 1, against: 1431.\"\n\n- **Column Names and Values**:\n  - For wins: The value is 9, which does not match the required condition of exactly 8 wins.\n  - For draws: The value is 1, which satisfies the condition of having fewer than 2 draws.\n\nSince the condition regarding the number of wins (exactly 8) is not met (George Town has 9 wins), the entire claim is false. However, we still need to list all relevant cells that are used in verifying this claim:\n\n- The cell corresponding to \"wins\" for George Town:\n  - Row Index: 4\n  - Column Name: \"wins\"\n\n- The cell corresponding to \"draws\" for George Town:\n  - Row Index: 4\n  - Column Name: \"draws\"\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can construct the JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"draws\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
