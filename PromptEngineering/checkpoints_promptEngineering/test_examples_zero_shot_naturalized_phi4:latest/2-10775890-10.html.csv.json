    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding attendance and match details, we need to examine specific aspects of the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Attendance**: The claim states that the lowest attendance was 15,747 on July 2 at Brunswick Street Oval.\n   - We need to check the \"crowd\" column for all entries to confirm if 15,747 is indeed the lowest number.\n\n2. **Date and Venue**: According to the claim, this attendance occurred on July 2 at Brunswick Street Oval.\n   - We must verify that there is a match held on July 2 at Brunswick Street Oval with an attendance of 15,747.\n\n3. **Teams Involved**: The claim mentions a match between Fitzroy and North Melbourne.\n   - We need to check if the home team was Fitzroy and the away team was North Melbourne for the entry matching the lowest attendance.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  - Row 1: Date is June 25, venue is Kardinia Park. This does not match the claim's date or venue.\n  - Row 2: Date is June 25, venue is Princes Park. Again, this does not match the claim's date or venue.\n  - Row 3: Date is June 25, venue is Lake Oval. This does not match either.\n  - **Row 4**: Date is July 2, venue is Brunswick Street Oval, crowd is 15,747, home team Fitzroy, away team North Melbourne. All conditions of the claim are satisfied here.\n  - Row 5: Date is July 2, but venue is Windy Hill. This does not match the claimed venue.\n  - Row 6: Date is July 2, but venue is Punt Road Oval. This also does not match the claimed venue.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The lowest attendance of 15,747 indeed occurred on July 2 at Brunswick Street Oval in a match between Fitzroy and North Melbourne.\n- Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main conditions from the given table:\n\n1. **Geelong's score is 11.14 (80)**: This condition requires us to check Geelong's actual score in the specified row.\n2. **This score should be the lowest of the group and only half of its opponent**: We need to ensure that Geelong's score is indeed lower than all other scores listed, and it is approximately half of its opponent's score.\n\nLet\u2019s go through each relevant part:\n\n1. Check Geelong's Score:\n   - In Row 1: \n     - Home Team: Geelong\n     - Home Team Score: 6.5 (41)\n   - The claim mentions a score of \"11.14 (80)\", but the table shows Geelong scored \"6.5 (41)\". Thus, the first condition fails.\n\n2. Check if it is the Lowest and Half of Opponent\u2019s Score:\n   - For Row 1: \n     - Away Team (Melbourne) Score: 12.11 (83)\n     - Geelong's score as per table: 6.5 (41), which is indeed lower than Melbourne's 12.11 (83).\n     - Half of the opponent\u2019s score calculation: 83/2 = 41.5, and 41 is approximately half of 83.\n   - Even if we considered the second condition alone, Geelong's actual score in Row 1 does not match the claim.\n\nSince the first condition fails because Geelong did not have a score of \"11.14 (80)\", we can conclude that the overall claim is false without needing to check further conditions against other rows.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n- The relevant cells are those related to Geelong\u2019s score and the scores in Row 1.\n- We focus on the \"home team score\" of Row 1, and also compare it with the \"away team score\" from Row 1 for the second part of the claim.\n\nThus, our JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
