The result of the game should be a loss with a score of 20 - 17.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table to find if both these conditions are satisfied:\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Attendance: 76,059\n  - Result: L 20 - 17\n\nBoth conditions are met in Row 7. No other rows satisfy these exact conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cell for verification includes both \"attendance\" and \"result\" from Row 7.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
