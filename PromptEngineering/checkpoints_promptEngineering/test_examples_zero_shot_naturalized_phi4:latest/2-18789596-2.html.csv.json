    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"China scored the best in the event,\" we need to determine if the country China has the highest total score among all listed countries in the table.\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Scores:** The relevant column for determining which country scored the best is the \"total\" column since it aggregates the technical and free scores.\n2. **Compare Total Scores Across All Countries:**\n   - Row 1 (Russia): total = 99.251\n   - Row 2 (Spain): total = 98.334\n   - Row 3 (Japan): total = 97.167\n   - Row 4 (China): total = 96.334\n   - Row 5 (United States): total = 95.5\n   - Row 6 (Canada): total = 95.084\n   - Row 7 (Italy): total = 93.751\n   - Row 8 (Ukraine): total = 92.668\n   - Row 9 (Netherlands): total = 91.667\n   - Row 10 (Greece): total = 91.501\n   - Row 11 (France): total = 90.333\n   - Row 12 (Switzerland): total = 89.25\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Total Score:** From the list above, Russia has the highest total score of 99.251.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since China's total score is 96.334 and Russia has a higher score, the claim that \"China scored the best in the event\" is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - To verify this conclusion, we need to look at the \"total\" scores of all countries, especially those with the highest values.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1 (Russia), Column \"total\"\n- Row 2 (Spain), Column \"total\"\n- Row 3 (Japan), Column \"total\"\n- Row 4 (China), Column \"total\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
