The value is indeed 73.\n\n2. **Long**: The claim states that Kevin Nickerson's longest run (long) is \"8.\" We check the \"long\" column for Row 2. However, the table shows a value of 9 for his longest run.\n\nSince the long run value does not match the claim, the entire statement is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- Row 2, Column: \"yards\"\n- Row 2, Column: \"long\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"long\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
