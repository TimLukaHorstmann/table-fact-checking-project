    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if more than four racers completed exactly 68 laps in the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix according to the table provided.\n\nThe specific condition we are evaluating involves checking the \"laps\" column for each row and counting how many rows have the value \"68\".\n\nLet's go through the relevant entries:\n\n1. **Row 11:** \n   - Driver: \u00e9rik comas\n   - Laps: 68\n\n2. **Row 12:** \n   - Driver: andrea de cesaris\n   - Laps: 68\n\n3. **Row 13:** \n   - Driver: rubens barrichello\n   - Laps: 68\n\n4. **Row 14:** \n   - Driver: luca badoer\n   - Laps: 68\n\nThese four entries indicate that exactly four racers completed 68 laps.\n\nSince the claim states \"more than 4 racers,\" and we only have exactly four racers who completed 68 laps, the claim is not supported by the table data. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation are those in rows where the number of laps is 68:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"more than 8 racers completed exactly 60 laps in the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix,\" we need to focus on the \"laps\" column from the table and check how many racers completed exactly 60 laps.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this claim is the \"laps\" column since it contains information about the number of laps each driver completed.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**: We will go through each row in the table and check if the number of laps completed by a racer is exactly 60.\n\n3. **Count Racers with 60 Laps**:\n   - Row 18: John Herbert, 60 laps\n   - This is the only entry where a driver completed exactly 60 laps.\n\n4. **Compare Count to Claim**: The claim states that \"more than 8 racers\" completed exactly 60 laps. However, we found only one racer who completed 60 laps.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value**: Since only one driver completed 60 laps and not more than eight, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Only Row 18 in the \"laps\" column is relevant because it shows a driver completing exactly 60 laps.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is adjusted by -1 to account for zero-based indexing in programming contexts.",
