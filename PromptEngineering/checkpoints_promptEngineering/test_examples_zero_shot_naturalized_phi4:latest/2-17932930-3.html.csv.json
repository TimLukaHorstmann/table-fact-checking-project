We will first locate these names in the table:\n   - In Row 2, we find `name: v zapata`.\n   - In Row 5, we find `name: curiel`.\n\n2. **Destination of Moves**: The claim states that both players are moving to \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\":\n   - For \"v zapata\" (Row 2), the `moving to` column shows \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\", which matches the claim.\n   - For \"curiel\" (Row 5), the `moving to` column also shows \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\", which is consistent with the claim.\n\n3. **Type of Move**: The claim does not specify the type, but it mentions \"in 2008\". However, we lack explicit information about the year in the table. Therefore, we assume that the table's data implicitly represents all relevant moves within a given time context (like the transfer window mentioned) without requiring an explicit date:\n   - Both \"v zapata\" and \"curiel\" are involved in a `transfer`, as indicated in their respective rows.\n\n4. **Transfer Window**: The claim specifies winter, so we need to ensure that both players' moves occurred in the winter window:\n   - Row 2 shows `transfer window: winter` for \"v zapata\".\n   - Row 5 also shows `transfer window: winter` for \"curiel\".\n\nAll conditions specified by the claim are met according to the information provided in the table. There is no mention of a specific year like 2008 directly, but given the context that all data pertains to the same transfer window (winter), we assume this condition is implicitly satisfied.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data and analysis, the claim \"v zapata and curiel be both moving to alianza atl\u00e9tico in 2008\" can be considered TRUE when interpreted within the table's context.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transfer window\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer window\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, we have found only one transfer to \"g\u00f3rnik zabrze\" and two instances of being loaned out.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For transfers to g\u00f3rnik zabrze:\n  - Row 1: type (transfer), moving to (g\u00f3rnik zabrze)\n\n- For loaned out movements:\n  - Row 3: type (loaned out)\n  - Row 4: type (loaned out)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table provided, let's break down the statement:\n\nClaim: \"both v zapata and curiel be be loan out to alianza atl\u00e9tico in 2008\"\n\nThe claim contains two assertions that need verification:\n1. V Zapata was loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico.\n2. Curiel was loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico.\n\nAdditionally, the time frame mentioned is \"in 2008\". However, there's no year specified in the table data itself, so we cannot verify this part of the claim with the given information.\n\nLet's go through each relevant player:\n\n- **V Zapata**:\n  - From Row 2: nat: per, name: v zapata, moving to: alianza atl\u00e9tico, type: transfer, transfer window: winter.\n  - This indicates V Zapata moved to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico via a \"transfer\", not on loan. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n- **Curiel**:\n  - From Row 5: nat: per, name: curiel, moving to: alianza atl\u00e9tico, type: transfer, transfer window: winter.\n  - This indicates Curiel moved to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico via a \"transfer\", not on loan. Therefore, this part of the claim is also false.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data, we can conclude that the entire claim is false. \n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- For V Zapata: Row 2, columns \"name,\" \"moving to,\" and \"type.\"\n- For Curiel: Row 5, columns \"name,\" \"moving to,\" and \"type.\"\n\nTherefore, the final JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
