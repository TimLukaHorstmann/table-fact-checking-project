    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 point,\" we need to analyze the provided table data focusing on each row's relevant information, particularly the 'year' and 'points' columns.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Relevant Information:**\n   - The table consists of five rows, each representing a different set of details for \"team lotus.\"\n   - We are interested in checking if there is any year where \"team lotus\" has points less than 10, specifically focusing on the 'year' and 'points' columns.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Year: 1963\n     - Points: 0\n     - This row indicates that in 1963, \"team lotus\" has less than 10 points.\n   \n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Year: 1964\n     - Points: 11\n     - In 1964, the points are more than 10, so this does not support the claim.\n   \n   - **Rows 3, 4, and 5:** \n     - All these rows have the year 1966 with points equal to 1.\n     - Each of these entries shows that in 1966, \"team lotus\" has less than 10 points.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that 1963 is the only year where \"team lotus\" has less than 10 points.\n   - However, we found that in 1966 (rows 3, 4, and 5), the team also had less than 10 points.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.
