Identify the relevant column names:\n   - The date is given under the \"february\" column.\n   - The game result (score) is specified under the \"score\" column.\n\n2. Locate the row corresponding to the specific date, February 24:\n   - According to the table's data in the \"february\" column, we see that February 24 corresponds to Row 11.\n\n3. Check the score for this particular game:\n   - In Row 11 of the table, under the \"score\" column, it states: \"3 - 1.\"\n\n4. Compare this with the claim's specified score:\n   - The claim mentions a score of \"5 - 4,\" whereas the actual recorded score on February 24 is \"3 - 1.\"\n\nGiven that the actual game score differs from what the claim states, we can conclude that the claim is not accurate.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 11 under the \"february\" column (to confirm the date).\n- Row 11 under the \"score\" column (to check the actual score).\n\nBased on these evaluations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
