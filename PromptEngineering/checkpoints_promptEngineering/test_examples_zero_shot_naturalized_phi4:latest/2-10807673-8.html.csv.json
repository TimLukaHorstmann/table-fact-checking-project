    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the statement:\n\n1. **Identify Fitzroy's away match score**: The claim specifically mentions \"fitzroy while play as the away team.\" Thus, we need to locate the row where Fitzroy is listed as the away team and identify their score.\n\n2. **Compare scores across all matches**: Next, we compare Fitzroy's score with the away team scores from all six matches to see if it is indeed the highest.\n\nLet's examine each row in detail:\n\n- **Row 1**: Home Team: Richmond; Away Team: St Kilda\n  - Away Score (St Kilda): 6.11 (47)\n\n- **Row 2**: Home Team: Hawthorn; Away Team: Melbourne\n  - Away Score (Melbourne): 12.12 (84)\n\n- **Row 3**: Home Team: Collingwood; Away Team: Essendon\n  - Away Score (Essendon): 7.10 (52)\n\n- **Row 4**: Home Team: Carlton; Away Team: Fitzroy\n  - This is the row where Fitzroy plays as the away team.\n  - Away Score (Fitzroy): 12.13 (85)\n  \n- **Row 5**: Home Team: South Melbourne; Away Team: North Melbourne\n  - Away Score (North Melbourne): 6.6 (42)\n\n- **Row 6**: Home Team: Geelong; Away Team: Footscray\n  - Away Score (Footscray): 13.15 (93)\n\nNow, compare all away team scores:\n- St Kilda: 47 points\n- Melbourne: 84 points\n- Essendon: 52 points\n- Fitzroy: 85 points\n- North Melbourne: 42 points\n- Footscray: 93 points\n\nFootscray scored the most as an away team with 93 points, not Fitzroy.\n\nThus, the claim \"fitzroy while play as the away team score the most point (93) in all 6 match\" is FALSE. Fitzroy's score of 85 is less than Footscray's 93.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are:\n- Row 4, \"away team score\" for Fitzroy\n- All rows, specifically \"away team score\" to compare with the highest score\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
