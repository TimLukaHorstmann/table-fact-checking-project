Whether Keith Amor's speed is 120.953 mph.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Team Association**:\n   - The table specifies that Keith Amor is listed under \"team: honda\" in Row 10. This contradicts the claim stating he is part of team Yamaha.\n   \n2. **Speed Verification**:\n   - According to the table, Keith Amor's speed is recorded as 118.820 mph in Row 10. The claimed speed is 120.953 mph, which does not match the actual data.\n\nSince both conditions are not met (Keith Amor is with Honda, not Yamaha, and his speed is different), we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying these aspects of the claim are:\n- Row 10, \"team\" column: to check Keith Amor's team.\n- Row 10, \"speed\" column: to verify Keith Amor's speed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
