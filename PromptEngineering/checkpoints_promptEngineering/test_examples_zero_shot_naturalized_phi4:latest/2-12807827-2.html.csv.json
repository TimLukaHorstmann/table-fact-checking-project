Mallala\n\nThere are 7 unique cities.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Unique Provinces**\nFrom the \"city / state\" column, list all states and identify unique ones:\n- Row 1: Victoria\n- Row 2: Tasmania\n- Row 3: Western Australia\n- Row 4: Queensland\n- Row 5: Victoria (already counted)\n- Row 6: New South Wales\n- Row 7: South Australia\n- Row 8: Queensland (already counted)\n- Row 9: New South Wales (already counted)\n\nThe unique provinces are:\n1. Victoria\n2. Tasmania\n3. Western Australia\n4. Queensland\n5. New South Wales\n6. South Australia\n\nThere are 6 unique provinces.\n\n**Conclusion**\n- The claim states races were held in 6 cities, but we found 7 unique cities.\n- The claim also states races were held in only 3 Australian provinces, but we identified 6 unique provinces.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are incorrect based on our findings from the table, the answer is FALSE. \n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion:\n- \"city / state\" column for each row, since it provides information about both city and province.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"city / state\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
