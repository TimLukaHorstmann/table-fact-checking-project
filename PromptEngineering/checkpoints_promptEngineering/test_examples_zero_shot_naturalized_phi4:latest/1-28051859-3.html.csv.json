Verify if Coventry Comet is the team with the most recent tenure:\n   - Coventry's tenure ends in 1983, not the most recent.\n\n4. Check if any team has a tenure ending in 1990:\n   - Field's tenure ends in 1990.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The claim states that Coventry Comet is the team with the most recent tenure and ends in 1990. This is false because Barberton Magic (2011) has the most recent end year, not Coventry (1983), and Field (1990) ends in 1990.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Row 1 (\"tenure\": \"2005 - 2011\") to check Barberton's tenure.\n- Row 2 (\"tenure\": \"1969 - 1983\") to verify Coventry's tenure.\n- Row 3 (\"tenure\": \"1978 - 1990\") to confirm Field ends in 1990.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tenure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tenure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tenure\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
