    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 June 2008 be 4\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the row(s) in the table where the `original airdate` is 8 June 2008.\n2. Check if the `episode` number for that date is indeed 4, as specified by the claim.\n3. Verify if this episode has the lowest viewership among all episodes with an original airdate of 8 June 2008.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Find the relevant row(s):**\n   - The table specifies only one row where `original airdate` is 8 June 2008, which corresponds to Row 4:\n     - Episode: 4\n     - Viewers (millions): 1.364\n\n2. **Verify episode number:**\n   - For the date 8 June 2008, the episode number provided in Row 4 is indeed 4.\n\n3. **Check for least viewership on this specific date:**\n   - Since there is only one episode aired on 8 June 2008 (as confirmed by step 1), it inherently has the lowest viewership simply because there are no other episodes to compare it against from that day.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied with the available data, we can conclude:\n\n- The episode number for the airdate 8 June 2008 is indeed 4.\n- It is the least watched on this specific date due to being the only entry.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 4: `original airdate`, `episode`, and `viewers (millions)` are relevant to verify both parts of the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally air on june 8 , 2008\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The episode with the original airdate of June 8, 2008, must have an episode number of 4.\n2. There should not be any earlier episodes (with a smaller episode number) that aired on June 8, 2008.\n\nLet's examine the relevant information from the table:\n\n- Row 4 indicates that Episode 4 has an original airdate of June 8, 2008.\n- We need to check all other rows for any episodes with an earlier episode number (i.e., less than 4) and verify their airdates to ensure none were aired on June 8, 2008.\n\nChecking the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 1: Episode 1, Original Airdate: May 18, 2008\n- Row 2: Episode 2, Original Airdate: May 25, 2008\n- Row 3: Episode 3, Original Airdate: June 1, 2008\n\nNone of these episodes have an airdate of June 8, 2008. Thus, no earlier episode numbers are associated with that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because:\n\n- The earliest episode number (Episode 4) indeed originally aired on June 8, 2008.\n- There are no episodes with a smaller episode number airing on June 8, 2008.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are those indicating the original airdate and episode number for each row that could potentially affect the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
