    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Lincoln City have the highest scoring game within the 1930 - 31 FA Cup\" is true or false, we need to identify the games with the highest total number of goals scored and verify if Lincoln City was involved in such a match.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim asserts that among all matches listed for the specified date, Lincoln City participated in the game with the most goals scored (combined score of both teams).\n\n2. **Reviewing Each Match**:\n   - We need to calculate the total number of goals for each row by adding the home and away team's scores.\n   - Identify the maximum number of total goals from all matches.\n\n3. **Checking Lincoln City's Involvement**:\n   - Locate the match involving Lincoln City.\n   - Compare its total score with the highest recorded total from any match.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to extract the scores for each match and specifically for Lincoln City.\n\nLet\u2019s perform these steps:\n\n- **Row 8 (Lincoln City)**: Home Score = 5, Away Score = 0; Total Goals = 5\n- Calculate total goals for all matches:\n  - Row 1: Notts County vs. Nelson (2-0), Total = 2\n  - Row 2: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Accrington Stanley (3-0), Total = 3\n  - Row 3: Southampton vs. Gillingham (5-1), Total = 6\n  - ...\n  - Row 32: Halifax Town vs. Mansfield Town (2-2), Total = 4\n  - **Row 8**: Lincoln City vs. Netherfield (5-0), Total = 5\n  - ...\n  - Row 33: Mansfield Town vs. Halifax Town (1-2), Total = 3\n  - Row 34: Southport vs. Darlington (4-2), Total = 6\n  - Row 35: Dulwich Hamlet vs. Newport County (2-2), Total = 4\n  - ...\n  - Row 39: Newark Town vs. Rotherham United (2-1), Total = 3\n\n5. **Identifying the Highest Scoring Game**:\n   - The highest total goals in any match are found in two matches:\n     - Southampton vs. Gillingham with a total of 6 goals.\n     - Southport vs. Darlington also with a total of 6 goals.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Lincoln City's match had a total of 5 goals, which is less than the highest score (6) found in other matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there were higher-scoring games than the one involving Lincoln City.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will then check how many such differences amount to exactly 7.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 6**: Chesterfield vs. Notts County - Score: 1 - 2 (Difference: 1)\n- **Row 7**: Nelson vs. Workington - Score: 4 - 0 (Difference: 4)\n- **Row 8**: Rochdale vs. Doncaster Rovers - Score: 1 - 2 (Difference: 1)\n- **Row 9**: Walsall vs. Reading - Score: 3 - 4 (Difference: 1)\n- **Row 10**: Darwen vs. Manchester United - Score: 0 - 5 (Difference: 5)\n- **Row 11**: Gainsborough Trinity vs. Newcastle United - Score: 2 - 8 (Difference: 6)\n- **Row 12**: Grimsby Town vs. Bristol City - Score: 4 - 1 (Difference: 3)\n- **Row 13**: Southampton St Mary's vs. Plymouth Argyle - Score: 0 - 5 (Difference: 5)\n- **Row 14**: Aston Villa vs. Bradford Park Avenue - Score: 6 - 2 (Difference: 4)\n- **Row 15**: Luton Town vs. Arsenal - Score: 1 - 7 (Difference: 6)\n- **Row 16**: West Ham United vs. Queens Park Rangers - Score: 3 - 0 (Difference: 3)\n- **Row 17**: Bristol Rovers vs. Bolton Wanderers - Score: 5 - 2 (Difference: 3)\n- **Row 18**: Preston North End vs. Sunderland - Score: 4 - 1 (Difference: 3)\n- **Row 19**: Fulham vs. West Bromwich Albion - Score: 1 - 6 (Difference: 5)\n- **Row 20**: Cardiff City vs. Bury - Score: 2 - 0 (Difference: 2)\n- **Row 21**: Blackpool vs. Birmingham - Score: 3 - 7 (Difference: 4)\n- **Row 22**: Millwall vs. Leicester City - Score: 1 - 6 (Difference: 5)\n- **Row 23**: Port Vale vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers - Score: 2 - 9 (Difference: 7) \n- **Row 24**: Chesterfield vs. Notts County - Score: 1 - 8 (Difference: 7)  \n- **Row 25**: Nelson vs. Workington - Score: 4 - 3 (Difference: 1)\n- **Row 26**: Rochdale vs. Doncaster Rovers - Score: 2 - 9 (Difference: 7)\n- **Row 27**: Walsall vs. Reading - Score: 3 - 0 (Difference: 3)\n- **Row 28**: Darwen vs. Manchester United - Score: 1 - 8 (Difference: 7)  \n- **Row 29**: Gainsborough Trinity vs. Newcastle United - Score: 2 - 9 (Difference: 7) \n- **Row 30**: Grimsby Town vs. Bristol City - Score: 5 - 2 (Difference: 3)\n- **Row 31**: Southampton St Mary's vs. Plymouth Argyle - Score: 0 - 6 (Difference: 6)\n- **Row 32**: Aston Villa vs. Bradford Park Avenue - Score: 4 - 1 (Difference: 3)  \n- **Row 33**: Luton Town vs. Arsenal - Score: 2 - 9 (Difference: 7) \n- **Row 34**: West Ham United vs. Queens Park Rangers - Score: 0 - 7 (Difference: 7)\n- **Row 35**: Bristol Rovers vs. Bolton Wanderers - Score: 3 - 10 (Difference: 7)  \n- **Row 36**: Preston North End vs. Sunderland - Score: 1 - 8 (Difference: 7) \n- **Row 37**: Fulham vs. West Bromwich Albion - Score: 0 - 7 (Difference: 7)\n- **Row 38**: Cardiff City vs. Bury - Score: 2 - 3 (Difference: 1)  \n- **Row 39**: Blackpool vs. Birmingham - Score: 4 - 11 (Difference: 7) \n- **Row 40**: Millwall vs. Leicester City - Score: 0 - 7 (Difference: 7)\n- **Row 41**: Port Vale vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers - Score: 1 - 8 (Difference: 7)\n\nNow, counting the games with a score difference of exactly 7:\n\n1.
