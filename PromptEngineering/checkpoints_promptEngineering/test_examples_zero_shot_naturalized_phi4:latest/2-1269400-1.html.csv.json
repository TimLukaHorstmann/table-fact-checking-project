Tomasz S\u0142obodzianek participated in the 1994 Lillehammer event.\n2. He came in 32nd place in the sprint event.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The table lists events by year and location, with corresponding performance metrics for each athlete.\n   - For the 1994 Lillehammer event, we refer to \"Row 1\" of the table:\n     ```\n     Row 1: event: 1994 lillehammer, individual: -, sprint: 32nd, pursuit: -, mass start: -, relay: -\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Athlete Participation:**\n   - The claim specifies Tomasz S\u0142obodzianek's participation in this event.\n   - However, the table does not explicitly mention an \"individual\" column for any specific athlete's name or identity; it only lists positions for events such as sprint, pursuit, etc., without naming athletes directly.\n\n3. **Verify Sprint Position:**\n   - The table shows that the position for the sprint in Row 1 (1994 Lillehammer) is listed as \"32nd.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- While the table confirms that a participant came in 32nd at the sprint during the 1994 Lillehammer event, it does not specify that Tomasz S\u0142obodzianek was this participant.\n- The claim assumes knowledge beyond what's provided directly in the table regarding athlete identity.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available:\n\n- **Participation:** Not verifiable from the table due to lack of explicit athlete identification.\n- **Sprint Position:** Verified as 32nd for the event listed.\n\nGiven that we cannot confirm Tomasz S\u0142obodzianek's participation solely based on this data without additional context, the claim is not fully supported.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"sprint\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
