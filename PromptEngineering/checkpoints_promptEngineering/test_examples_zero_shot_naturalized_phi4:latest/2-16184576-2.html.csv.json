    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in the ATP Master Series in 1994, the annual win-loss be 2 - 4,\" we need to compare this statement against the relevant data provided in the table.\n\n1. Identify relevant columns:\n   - We're interested in the \"ATP Master Series\" row (Row 18) for details about performance during that year.\n   - Also, check the \"Annual win-loss\" row (Row 19) for confirmation of the specific annual win-loss record for 1994.\n\n2. Verify the claim using these rows:\n   - From Row 18 (\"ATP Master Series\"), in column 1994, we see the performance as \"0 / 4,\" indicating 0 wins and 4 losses.\n   - In Row 19 (\"Annual win-loss\"), in column 1994, it shows a record of \"2 - 4.\"\n\nThe claim states that the annual win-loss for the ATP Master Series in 1994 should be \"2 - 4.\" However:\n- The ATP Master Series data specifically indicates \"0 / 4\" (Row 18), meaning no wins in the series itself.\n- The Annual win-loss record of \"2 - 4\" pertains to overall performance and not restricted solely to the ATP Master Series.\n\nConclusion: \nThe claim is incorrect because it conflates the specific ATP Master Series result with the broader annual win-loss record. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"1994\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"1994\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

They did not play in 1987.\n\nLet's check these conditions against the provided table data:\n\n### Checking Part 1: Annual Win-Loss Record for 2001\n- The relevant row for \"annual win - loss\" is Row 19.\n- In Column \"2001\", it states: \"9 - 9\".\n\nThis confirms that in 2001, the annual win-loss record was indeed 9-9.\n\n### Checking Part 2: Participation in 1987\n- We need to verify if there's any entry for participation in 1987 across various tournaments.\n- In Row 18 (Masters Series SR), Column \"1987\" states \"n/a\", indicating no data or non-participation.\n- Similarly, other rows like Row 19 (\"annual win - loss\") and Row 20 (\"year end ranking\") show \"n/a\" for 1987.\n\nThis confirms that there was no participation in 1987 across all tournaments listed.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are verified as true based on the table data.
