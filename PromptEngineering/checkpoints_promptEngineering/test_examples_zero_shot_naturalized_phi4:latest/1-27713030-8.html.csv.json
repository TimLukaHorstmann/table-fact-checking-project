    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the team's score against Detroit, we need to locate and verify relevant details from the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"the team's score against detroit be w 97 - 72 (ot).\" This implies two conditions that must be satisfied:\n1. The game was against Detroit.\n2. The score of the team for this specific game was a win (W) with a final score of 97 - 72 in overtime (OT).\n\nWe will examine each row in the table to find these details:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - \"team\": detroit\n  - \"score\": w 97 - 72 (ot)\n\nThis row matches both conditions: it was indeed a game against Detroit, and the score recorded is a win with 97 - 72 in overtime.\n\nSince this row fully supports the claim, we can conclude that the statement is true. There are no other rows in the table that involve a game against Detroit, so there's no need to check further.\n\nThus, the relevant cell for verifying this claim is in Row 1 under both \"team\" and \"score\" columns.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
