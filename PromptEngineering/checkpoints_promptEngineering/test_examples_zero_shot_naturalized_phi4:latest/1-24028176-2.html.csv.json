    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. The European record should be set by Tatyana Kazankina (USSR), according to the table.\n2. The time and location mentioned in the claim for the European record do not match those provided in the table.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Claim**: \"The European record was set by Hassiba Boulmerka (Algeria) with a time of 4:05:67 in Rome, Italy.\"\n\n- **Table Verification**:\n  - The European record is actually listed as being held by Tatyana Kazankina (URS), not Hassiba Boulmerka.\n  - The recorded time for the European record is 3:52.47, not 4:05:67.\n  - The location for this record is Zurich, Switzerland, not Rome, Italy.\n\nThus, the claim does not align with any of the details in the table regarding the European record. We need to identify the relevant cells that provide information about the European record:\n\n- From Row 7:\n  - \"world record: european record\" confirms it's about the European record.\n  - \"tatyana kazankina ( urs )\" indicates the athlete who set the record.\n  - \"3:52.47\" is the time for this record.\n  - \"z\u00e3\u00bcrich , switzerland\" is the location where the record was set.\n\nTherefore, based on the information from Row 7, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tatyana kazankina ( urs )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"3:52.47\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"z\u00e3\u00bcrich , switzerland\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
