    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each part of it: \n\nThe claim states that \"Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska be 2 of the athlete that be no longer active.\" The key aspect here is determining whether these athletes are currently (present) listed as active in the table. This requires checking the \"years\" column for both Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska to see if it includes the word \"present.\"\n\n1. **Enza Barilla:**\n   - According to row 2, the years are given as \"2008-present.\" The presence of \"present\" indicates that she is still active.\n\n2. **Snez Veljanovska:**\n   - According to row 36, the years are listed as \"2010-present.\" Similarly, this also indicates ongoing activity.\n\nBoth athletes have their active status confirmed by the inclusion of \"present\" in their respective rows under the \"years\" column.\n\nSince both Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska are still active, the claim that they are no longer active is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion:\n- Row 2, Column \"years\" for Enza Barilla.\n- Row 36, Column \"years\" for Snez Veljanovska.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row indices are adjusted to be zero-based as per typical programming convention.",
