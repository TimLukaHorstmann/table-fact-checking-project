    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table provided, we need to verify each condition against the data in the relevant row for \"red cliffs\":\n\n1. **\"no bye\"**: We need to check if the value in the \"byes\" column is 0.\n2. **\"less than 4 loss\"**: We need to check if the value in the \"losses\" column is less than 4.\n3. **\"more than 2494 against\"**: We need to check if the value in the \"against\" column is greater than 2494.\n\nLet's examine these conditions for \"red cliffs\":\n\n- **Row 8 (red cliffs):**\n  - Byes: 0\n  - Losses: 18\n  - Against: 2422\n\nChecking each condition:\n1. The \"byes\" value is indeed 0, satisfying the \"no bye\" condition.\n2. The \"losses\" value is 18, which does not satisfy the \"less than 4 loss\" condition (since 18 is greater than 3).\n3. The \"against\" value is 2422, which does not satisfy the \"more than 2494 against\" condition (since 2422 is less than 2494).\n\nThe claim requires all conditions to be true for it to be considered TRUE. Since two of the three conditions are not satisfied, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells needed to verify this claim are in Row 8 and concern the \"byes\", \"losses\", and \"against\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"byes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
