    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare how many times each decision-maker (Harding and Backstrom) was responsible for a game during the specified period in the Minnesota Wild season.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - The relevant column for this analysis is \"decision\", as it indicates who made the decision.\n   \n2. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Count how many times Harding appears in the \"decision\" column.\n   - Count how many times Backstrom appears in the \"decision\" column.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Compare the counts for Harding and Backstrom to determine which name appears more frequently.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Harding** as a decision-maker:\n  - Row 5: Harding\n  - Row 6: Harding\n  - Row 10: Harding\n\n- **Backstrom** as a decision-maker:\n  - Row 1: Backstrom\n  - Row 2: Backstrom\n  - Row 3: Backstrom\n  - Row 4: Backstrom\n  - Row 7: Backstrom\n  - Row 8: Backstrom\n  - Row 9: Backstrom\n  - Row 11: Backstrom\n  - Row 12: Backstrom\n  - Row 13: Backstrom\n  - Row 14: Backstrom\n\n**Count Summary**:\n- Harding appears 3 times.\n- Backstrom appears 11 times.\n\nSince Backstrom appears more frequently than Harding, the claim that \"the decision be harding more time than it be backstrom\" is false.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant rows and column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
