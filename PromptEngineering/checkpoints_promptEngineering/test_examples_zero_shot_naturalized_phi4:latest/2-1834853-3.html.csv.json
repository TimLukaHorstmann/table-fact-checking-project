    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Carsten Jancker's team's lowest score of all time be 3,\" we need to focus on the 'score' column from each row in the table. The claim implies that the lowest score Carsten Jancker's team achieved was 3, meaning there should not be any scores lower than 3 recorded.\n\nLet's examine each relevant cell:\n\n1. Row 1: Score is 1 - 0.\n2. Row 2: Score is 6 - 2.\n3. Row 3: Score is 8 - 2 (duplicate of row 2).\n4. Row 4: Score is 2 - 2.\n5. Row 5: Score is 3 - 0.\n6. Row 6: Score is 1 - 0.\n7. Row 7: Score is 7 - 0.\n8. Row 8: Score is 4 - 0.\n9. Row 9: Score is 2 - 2.\n10. Row 10: Score is 1 - 1.\n\nFrom these scores, we can identify the lowest scores for Carsten Jancker's team:\n\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 4: 2\n- Row 6: 1\n- Row 9: 2\n- Row 10: 1\n\nThe lowest score among these is 1.
