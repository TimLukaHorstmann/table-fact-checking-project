    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Corinthians, we must verify the conditions outlined in it against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. The claim states that \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 points.\" This implies two conditions:\n   - Corinthians have accumulated 22 points.\n   - Corinthians have received fewer than 11 losses.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row for Corinthians (Row 6) in the table:\n\n- **Corinthians' Points:** The table lists that Corinthians have 22 points. This matches the first condition of the claim, which states they should amass 22 points.\n  \n- **Corinthians' Losses:** According to the table, Corinthians have lost 10 games (lost: 10). This satisfies the second condition since 10 is indeed less than 11.\n\nBoth conditions required by the claim are met. Therefore, based on the table data, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification of this claim are:\n- The \"points\" column in Row 6 to check if Corinthians have amassed 22 points.\n- The \"lost\" column in Row 6 to verify that they have fewer than 11 losses.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON specifies that both conditions are satisfied, confirming the claim's truthfulness.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians is true or false, we need to analyze the information in the table concerning their performance.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be zero loss that corinthians received when they score over 25 points.\"\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information for Corinthians**: \n   - From Row 6 of the table, we see that Corinthians has played 22 matches, scoring a total of 51 goals (\"against\": 51), and have lost 10 games.\n\n2. **Determine Points per Match**:\n   - In many football leagues, teams earn points based on match outcomes: typically 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.\n   - Corinthians has accumulated 22 points in total over these 22 matches.\n\n3. **Calculate Possible Outcomes**:\n   - With 22 points from 22 matches, let's explore possible scenarios:\n     - Wins (W), Draws (D), Losses (L) need to satisfy the equation: \\(3W + D = 22\\) and \\(W + D + L = 22\\).\n     - From the table, we already know that Corinthians has drawn 2 matches and lost 10 matches. Therefore:\n       \\[\n       W + 2 + 10 = 22 \\implies W = 10\n       \\]\n     - Check points calculation: \\(3 \\times 10 + 2 = 30 + 2 = 32\\), which contradicts the given total of 22 points.\n     - Correct this by recalculating using actual values:\n       - With \\(W = 6\\) and \\(D = 4\\) (as given in the table for calculations): \n         \\[\n         3 \\times 6 + 2 = 18 + 2 = 20\n         \\]\n       - This leaves 2 points unaccounted for, suggesting there might be a discrepancy or misunderstanding. Let's assume \\(W = 6\\), \\(D = 4\\) (as per the table) and verify:\n         \\[\n         3 \\times 6 + 4 = 18 + 4 = 22\n         \\]\n\n4. **Check Goals Scored in Wins**:\n   - To evaluate if they scored over 25 points in any match they won, we need to know their goals per match.\n   - Total goals scored by Corinthians: 51 across 22 matches implies an average of approximately \\( \\frac{51}{22} \\approx 2.32\\) goals per match.\n   - Without specific goal data for each match, we can't definitively state the exact number of goals in individual wins.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim involves verifying if Corinthians ever scored over 25 points in any single match they won and subsequently lost that match (which is contradictory since a win cannot be followed by a loss).\n   - Given the lack of detailed match-by-match data, we can't confirm or deny specific match outcomes based on goals alone.\n   - The claim seems logically flawed because it implies a scenario where a team wins a match but still \"receives\" a loss, which is not possible.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim cannot be substantiated with the given table data. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
