    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided, let's break down the conditions in the claim:\n\n1. **Nalchik with 4 played**: The player must have participated in 4 matches.\n2. **A RL qualification (RL)**: The player should be qualified under \"rl\".\n3. **100 Jermuk points and less than 140**: The player should have a score of exactly 100 for Jermuk, which is less than 140.\n\nWe need to identify any row in the table that matches all these conditions:\n\n- Check each row for `played` equal to 4.\n- Ensure that the qualification (`qual`) is \"rl\".\n- Verify the player's score for Jermuk is exactly 100 and confirm it is less than 140.\n\n### Checking Each Row\n\n**Row by Row Analysis:**\n\n1. **Row 1**: Levon Aronian\n   - Played: 3 (not 4, discard)\n\n2. **Row 2**: Teimour Radjabov\n   - Qualification: RL (match)\n   - Jermuk score: -, played 4, but no score for Jermuk\n\n3. **Row 3**: Alexander Grischuk\n   - Qualification: RR (not RL, discard)\n\n4. **Row 4**: Dmitry Jakovenko\n   - Qualification: HC (not RL, discard)\n\n5. **Row 5**: Vladislav Artemiev\n   - Qualification: PR (not RL, discard)\n\n6. **Row 6**: Wang Hao\n   - Qualification: CP (not RL, discard)\n\n7. **Row 7**: Baadur Jobava\n   - Qualification: HC (not RL, discard)\n\n8. **Row 8**: Hikaru Nakamura\n   - Qualification: PR (not RL, discard)\n\n9. **Row 9**: Sergey Karjakin\n   - Qualification: CP (not RL, discard)\n\n10. **Row 10**: Shakhriyar Mamedyarov\n    - Qualification: RL (match)\n    - Jermuk score: 100 (exactly matches condition and less than 140)\n    - Played: 4\n\n11. **Row 11 to Row 26**: Check remaining rows similarly, but none of them satisfy all the conditions together as row 10 does.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly Shakhriyar Mamedyarov from Row 10 meets all the criteria in the claim:\n\n- He has \"played\" equal to 4.\n- His qualification is \"rl\".\n- His Jermuk score is exactly 100, which is less than 140.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by this player\u2019s data. \n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"qual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Jermuk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
