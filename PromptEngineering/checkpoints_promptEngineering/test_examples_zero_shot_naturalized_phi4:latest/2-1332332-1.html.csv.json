Game 5 does not have the highest score, and it certainly does not have a total of 20 runs.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the scores for each game:\n\n- Row 1, Column \"score\"\n- Row 2, Column \"score\"\n- Row 3, Column \"score\"\n- Row 4, Column \"score\"\n- Row 5, Column \"score\"\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
