The date of the game should be November 17.\n2. Allen's points for that game should be 12.\n3. Allen must have scored more points than any other player in that game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**:\n   - Check the \"date\" column to find which row corresponds to November 17. \n   - From the table, Row 2 has the date: November 17.\n\n2. **Check Allen's Points**:\n   - In Row 2, the \"high points\" for Allen is listed as 12.\n   - This matches the claim that Allen scored 12 points on November 17.\n\n3. **Verify if Allen Scored the Most Points**:\n   - The same row (Row 2) should be checked to ensure no other player has a higher point score than Allen.\n   - Row 2 shows only Allen with 12 points as the \"high points\" scorer, meaning no other player scored more.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- All conditions in the claim are satisfied based on the data from Row 2 of the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Date check: Row 2, Column \"date\"\n- Allen's points: Row 2, Column \"high points\"\n- Ensure no other player scored more: Row 2, Column \"high points\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the final score be 61 - 50 when the temple owls beat virginia tech,\" we need to verify several aspects from the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify the game involving Virginia Tech:** \n   - From the table, Row 5 corresponds to a game against Virginia Tech on November 27.\n\n2. **Verify that Temple Owls won this game:**\n   - The \"team\" column in Row 5 does not explicitly state \"Temple Owls.\" However, considering all other information (location, score), we can infer that the team winning is indeed the home team of the game listed.\n   - In Row 5, it states \"score: w 61 - 50,\" indicating a win for the team mentioned in this row.\n\n3. **Check the final score:** \n   - The score given in Row 5 is \"61 - 50.\" \n\nBased on these checks:\n- Virginia Tech played against a winning team (inferred as Temple Owls) with a score of 61 - 50.\n- All conditions are met for the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is true.
