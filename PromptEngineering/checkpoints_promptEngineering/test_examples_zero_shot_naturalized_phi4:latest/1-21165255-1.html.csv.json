    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19,\" we need to verify two pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The production code \"4300062\" corresponds to a specific row.\n2. For this row, check the value in the column \"no in season.\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Locate the row with the production code \"4300062.\" According to Row 18: \n  - Production Code is \"4300062.\"\n  \n- Check the \"no in season\" for Row 18:\n  - The value is 18.\n\nNow, let's verify if the claim aligns with these observations:\n\n- The claim states that the number in season for production code \"4300062\" should be 19.\n- However, from our examination of the table, we found that the number in season is actually 18.\n\nTherefore, the claim does not match the data from the table. \n\nThe JSON response with relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"production code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
