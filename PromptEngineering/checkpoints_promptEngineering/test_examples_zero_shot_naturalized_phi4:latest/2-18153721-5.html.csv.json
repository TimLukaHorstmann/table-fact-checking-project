The relevant cells that confirm this analysis are:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2 in the `place` column (showing they are tied for first place).\n- Rows 1 and 2 in the `to par` column (indicating their score relative to par).\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
