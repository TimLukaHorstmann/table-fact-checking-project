    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of the statement against the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Great Britain (GBR) received 1 trophy which was bronze.\"\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. The nation should be Great Britain (gbr).\n2. The total number of trophies received by this nation should be 1.\n3. All these trophies should be bronze.\n\nNow, let's check these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Row Index and Nation Check:**\n  - We need to find the row where the nation is \"great britain (gbr).\" According to the table:\n    - Row 7 has \"nation: great britain (gbr)\" which matches our requirement.\n\n- **Bronze Trophy Count:**\n  - In Row 7, under the column \"bronze,\" we see the value is 1. This means Great Britain received 1 bronze trophy.\n\n- **Total Trophy Count:**\n  - In Row 7, under the column \"total,\" we see the value is 1. This confirms that the total number of trophies Great Britain received is indeed 1.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied (Great Britain received exactly 1 trophy and it was a bronze one), the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this:\n- Row 7, \"nation\" column: Confirms the nation is Great Britain.\n- Row 7, \"bronze\" column: Confirms they received 1 bronze trophy.\n- Row 7, \"total\" column: Confirms the total number of trophies is 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Here's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
