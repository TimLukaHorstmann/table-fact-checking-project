However, our calculation shows that it is actually 56 points higher.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference contradicts the claim (Frank Conover's pick is higher, not lower), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Frank Conover's overall pick: Row 6, column \"overall\"\n   - Michael Jackson's overall pick: Row 5, column \"overall\"\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
