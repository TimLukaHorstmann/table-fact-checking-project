    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Kim Woo-jin won the gold before Im Dong-hyun at a location in Africa,\" we need to verify several conditions using the provided table:\n\n1. **Verify Kim Woo-jin's Gold Medal**: Locate the row where Kim Woo-jin is listed as having won the gold medal.\n2. **Verify Im Dong-hyun's Gold Medal**: Identify when Im Dong-hyun won his gold medal and ensure it is after Kim Woo-jin.\n3. **Location in Africa**: Check if either of these events occurred in an African location.\n\nLet's break down the relevant information:\n\n- **Kim Woo-jin**:\n  - From Row 9, we see that Kim Woo-jin won the gold medal in the year 2010 at Guangzhou (China).\n\n- **Im Dong-hyun**:\n  - From Rows 7 and 8, Im Dong-hyun won gold medals in 2002 (Busan) and 2006 (Doha), respectively.\n\nNow let's verify each condition:\n\n1. **Kim Woo-jin won the gold before Im Dong-hyun**: Kim Woo-jin won in 2010, which is after Im Dong-hyun's wins in 2002 and 2006. This part of the claim is false since he did not win before Im Dong-hyun.\n\n2. **Location in Africa**:\n   - Neither Guangzhou (China) nor Busan or Doha are African locations. The only event listed in an African location was in Doha, Qatar (Row 8), which does not involve Kim Woo-jin winning gold.\n\nSince both conditions (winning before Im Dong-hyun and the location being in Africa) are not satisfied, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this evaluation:\n\n- Row 9: gold column for Kim Woo-jin's win.\n- Rows 7 and 8: gold column for Im Dong-hyun's wins.\n- All rows for checking locations to verify none were in Africa when either won gold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
