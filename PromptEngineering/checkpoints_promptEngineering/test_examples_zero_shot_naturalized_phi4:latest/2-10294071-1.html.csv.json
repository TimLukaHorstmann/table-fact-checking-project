We locate this name in Row 4 of the table.\n\n2. **Ties Played Verification**: The claim states that this player has \"29.0 tie\". According to Row 4, \"ties played\" for dragutin miti\u0107 is indeed 29.\n\n3. **Debut Year Verification**: The claim specifies a debut year of \"1936\". In Row 4, the debut year for dragutin miti\u0107 is listed as 1936.\n\nThe claim consists of three main components:\n- Player name: \"dragutin miti\u0107\"\n- Ties played: 29\n- Debut year: 1936\n\nAll these details match exactly with what is in Row 4. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- \"ties played\" from Row 4\n- \"debut\" from Row 4\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"debut\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
