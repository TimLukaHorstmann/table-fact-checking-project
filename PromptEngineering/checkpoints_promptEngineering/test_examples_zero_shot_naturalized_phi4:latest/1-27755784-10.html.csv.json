The relevant column for this verification is \"high rebounds.\"\n\nLet's go through each row (game) from March 1 to March 29 and check if David Lee is mentioned as having the highest rebounds:\n\n- **Row 1**: David Lee has 11 rebounds.\n- **Row 2**: David Lee has 16 rebounds.\n- **Row 3**: David Lee has 12 rebounds.\n- **Row 4**: David Lee has 14 rebounds.\n- **Row 5**: David Lee has 14 rebounds.\n- **Row 6**: David Lee has 10 rebounds.\n- **Row 7**: David Lee is listed along with Monta Ellis and Dorell Wright, each having 6 rebounds. However, since the claim only requires being one of the highest, this still supports the claim.\n- **Row 8**: Stephen Curry has 9 rebounds (David Lee is not mentioned).\n- **Row 9**: David Lee is listed along with Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107, each having 4 rebounds. Again, as David Lee is among the highest, this supports the claim.\n- **Row 10**: David Lee has 9 rebounds.\n- **Row 11**: David Lee has 10 rebounds.\n- **Row 12**: David Lee has 12 rebounds.\n- **Row 13**: David Lee has 9 rebounds.\n- **Row 14**: David Lee has 9 rebounds.\n- **Row 15**: David Lee has 7 rebounds.\n- **Row 16**: David Lee has 12 rebounds.\n- **Row 17**: David Lee has 15 rebounds.\n\nIn Row 8, Stephen Curry is noted as having the highest rebounds (9), and David Lee is not mentioned.

We will examine each row's \"high rebounds\" column.\n\n4. **Determine if Monta Ellis Had Most Rebounds**:\n   - **Row 3**: High rebounds: David Lee (12)\n   - **Row 4**: High rebounds: David Lee (14)\n   - **Row 5**: High rebounds: Monta Ellis (14), David Lee (14) \u2013 both have the same high rebounds.\n   - **Row 6**: High rebounds: David Lee (10)\n   - **Row 7**: High rebounds: Monta Ellis, David Lee, Dorell Wright (all 6) \u2013 all three have the same high rebounds.\n   - **Row 8**: High rebounds: Stephen Curry (9)\n   - **Row 9**: High rebounds: David Lee, Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 (4 each)\n   - **Row 10**: High rebounds: David Lee (9)\n   - **Row 11**: High rebounds: David Lee (10)\n   - **Row 12**: High rebounds: David Lee (12)\n   - **Row 13**: High rebounds: David Lee (9)\n   - **Row 14**: High rebounds: David Lee (9)\n   - **Row 15**: High rebounds: David Lee (7)\n   - **Row 16**: High rebounds: David Lee (12)\n   - **Row 17**: High rebounds: David Lee (15)\n\nFrom this analysis, Monta Ellis is not the sole player with the highest rebounds in any game.

The relevant cells will tell us how many games were won (\"win\") and how many were lost (\"loss\"). \n\nLet's analyze the given data:\n\n- Row 1: Record is 26 - 33\n- Row 2: Record is 27 - 33\n- Row 3: Record is 27 - 34\n- Row 4: Record is 27 - 35\n- Row 5: Record is 28 - 35\n- Row 6: Record is 28 - 36\n- Row 7: Record is 29 - 36\n- Row 8: Record is 30 - 36\n- Row 9: Record is 30 - 37\n- Row 10: Record is 30 - 38\n- Row 11: Record is 30 - 39\n- Row 12: Record is 30 - 40\n- Row 13: Record is 30 - 41\n- Row 14: Record is 30 - 42\n- Row 15: Record is 31 - 42\n- Row 16: Record is 32 - 42\n- Row 17: Record is 32 - 43\n\nFrom the first row, we see that the record starts at 26 wins and 33 losses. By the end of the last game in row 17, it's recorded as 32 wins and 43 losses.\n\nTo calculate the total number of wins and losses:\n- Total games played = Wins + Losses = 32 + 43 = 75\n- From the initial record (26 - 33), the team started with 59 wins and losses.\n- Therefore, additional wins = 32 - 26 = 6\n- Additional losses = 43 - 33 = 10\n\nAdding these to the starting point:\n- Total wins over the span of games listed = 26 + 6 = 32\n- Total losses over the span of games listed = 33 + 10 = 43\n\nThe claim states that the win-loss record is 5 and 12 respectively.

Out of these 16 games, only 6 were at home.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Total Games Played:**\n   - By examining the table, there are 17 rows listed (games 59 to 75).\n   - However, we need to focus on \"game\" numbers from 60 to 74 for verification because game 59 is not included in these calculations.\n   - From the data provided, games 60 through 74 are indeed a total of 15 games. Including game 59 makes it 16 games.\n\n2. **Home Games:**\n   - A home game can be identified by matching the \"location attendance\" venue with known Golden State Warriors' home venues in that period.\n   - The Oracle Arena is confirmed as the home arena for the Golden State Warriors during this time frame.\n   \n3. **Identifying Home Games:**\n   - Game 60: Verizon Center (not home)\n   - Game 61: TD Garden (not home)\n   - Game 62: Wells Fargo Center (not home)\n   - Game 63: Quicken Loans Arena (not home)\n   - Game 64: Prudential Center (not home)\n   - Game 65: Oracle Arena (home)\n   - Game 66: Oracle Arena (home)\n   - Game 67: Power Balance Pavilion (not home)\n   - Game 68: Oracle Arena (home)\n   - Game 69: US Airways Center (not home)\n   - Game 70: American Airlines Center (not home)\n   - Game 71: AT&T Center (not home)\n   - Game 72: Toyota Center (not home)\n   - Game 73: Oracle Arena (home)\n   - Game 74: Oracle Arena (home)\n\nFrom this, we see that games 65, 66, 68, 73, and 74 were played at home.
