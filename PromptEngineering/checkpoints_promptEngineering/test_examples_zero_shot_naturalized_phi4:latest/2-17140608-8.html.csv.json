The claim states: \"Ray Allen (30) have the most point in game over 59.\"\n\nLet's evaluate this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the games after Game 59, specifically looking at who had the highest points and what those points were.\n\n2. **Check Each Relevant Row**:\n   - **Row 11 (Game 59)**: High Points = Paul Pierce (20)\n   - **Row 12 (Game 60)**: High Points = Ray Allen (30)\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - In Game 60, Ray Allen scored 30 points, which is indeed the highest score in that game.\n\n4. **Verify Against the Claim**: The claim specifies \"Ray Allen (30) have the most point in game over 59.\" Since Game 60 is after Game 59 and Ray Allen had the most points with 30, the condition of the claim holds true for this specific instance.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the data from Row 12, the claim is supported by the table as Ray Allen scored 30 points in Game 60, which is over Game 59.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This involves verifying three aspects:\n1. The team involved is San Antonio.\n2. The result of the game was a loss (\"l\").\n3. The score was 99 - 105 in overtime.\n\nWe will look at Row 5, as it contains information about the game against San Antonio:\n\n- **Row Index**: 4 (since indexing starts from 0)\n- **Team**: \"san antonio\"\n- **Score**: \"l 99 - 105 (ot)\"\n\nEach aspect of the claim matches with the data in Row 5:\n1. The team is indeed San Antonio.\n2. The result is a loss, indicated by \"l\".\n3. The score is exactly 99 - 105 in overtime.\n\nThus, all conditions are satisfied, confirming that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The \"high assists\" column for Game 60 shows that Rajon Rondo himself is listed as having the highest assists.\n\nThus, no other player has more assists than Rajon Rondo in this game.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rajon rondo (30) have the most points after game 59\" is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table up to and including game 59 to identify which player scored the highest points in each game. Then, we'll compare these scores specifically for Rajon Rondo.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant cell:\n\n1. **Game 49**: \n   - High Points: Paul Pierce (36)\n2. **Game 50**: \n   - High Points: Paul Pierce (29)\n3. **Game 51**: \n   - High Points: Ray Allen (22)\n4. **Game 52**: \n   - High Points: Paul Pierce (26)\n5. **Game 53**: \n   - High Points: Kevin Garnett (26)\n6. **Game 54**: \n   - High Points: Paul Pierce (30)\n7. **Game 55**: \n   - High Points: Paul Pierce (31)\n8. **Game 56**: \n   - High Points: Paul Pierce (20)\n9. **Game 57**: \n   - High Points: Rajon Rondo (32)\n10. **Game 58**: \n    - High Points: Ray Allen (26)\n11. **Game 59**: \n    - High Points: Paul Pierce (20)\n\nNow, let's determine if Rajon Rondo scored the most points in any game up to and including game 59:\n\n- Game 57 is where Rajon Rondo scored the highest with 32 points.\n- In all other games, either another player or himself scored fewer than 30 points.\n\nTherefore, after game 59, Rajon Rondo's highest score was 32 points in game 57. This score of 32 points is indeed more than any 30-point performance by him because he did not have any other game where he scored exactly 30 points or more after game 59.\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm this are:\n\n- Game 49: High Points (Paul Pierce, 36)\n- Game 50: High Points (Paul Pierce, 29)\n- Game 51: High Points (Ray Allen, 22)\n- Game 52: High Points (Paul Pierce, 26)\n- Game 53: High Points (Kevin Garnett, 26)\n- Game 54: High Points (Paul Pierce, 30)\n- Game 55: High Points (Paul Pierce, 31)\n- Game 56: High Points (Paul Pierce, 20)\n- **Game 57**: High Points (Rajon Rondo, 32) - Rajon Rondo scored the most points here.\n- Game 58: High Points (Ray Allen, 26)\n- Game 59: High Points (Paul Pierce, 20)\n\nThus, the claim is true because after game 59, the highest point total for Rajon Rondo was indeed in game 57 with 32 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
