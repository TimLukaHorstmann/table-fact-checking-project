    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to compare the attendance figures for games played in three distinct time slots: middle of the day (12:00 pm), late afternoon (3:30 pm), and evening (7:00 pm).\n\nFirstly, let's identify which rows correspond to these times:\n\n1. **Middle of the Day (12:00 pm):**\n   - Row 2: Attendance = 90612\n   - Row 3: Attendance = 30807\n   - Row 4: Attendance = 37359\n\n2. **Late Afternoon (3:30 pm):**\n   - Row 6: Attendance = 51427\n\n3. **Evening (7:00 pm):**\n   - Row 1: Attendance = 41382\n   - Row 7: Attendance = 62418\n\nNow, let's compare the attendance figures:\n\n- The middle of the day games have attendances of 90612, 30807, and 37359. Among these, only one game (Row 2) has a higher attendance than any late afternoon or evening game.\n  \n- For the late afternoon game in Row 6, the attendance is 51427.\n\n- The evening games in Rows 1 and 7 have attendances of 41382 and 62418, respectively. Both are higher than the attendance for the late afternoon game (Row 6).\n\nTherefore, not all middle of the day games have lower attendance than those played in the late afternoon or evening. Specifically, Row 2's middle-of-the-day game has a higher attendance than both the late afternoon and one of the evening games.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
