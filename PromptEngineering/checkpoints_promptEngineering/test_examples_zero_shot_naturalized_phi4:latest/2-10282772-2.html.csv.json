    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"noriyuki haga be the rider that have the fastest time\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Noriyuki Haga's Time:** We need to find the row corresponding to Noriyuki Haga and check his recorded time.\n2. **Compare Times Across All Riders:** We must compare Noriyuki Haga's time with all other riders' times to ensure that he has the fastest (i.e., smallest) time.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Noriyuki Haga's Time:**\n   - In Row 1, we have Noriyuki Haga with a recorded time of \"35:26.734\". This is his absolute race time since he started first from the grid position 2 and completed all laps.\n\n2. **Compare Times Across All Riders:**\n   - For every rider, we need to examine if their recorded time indicates they finished faster than Noriyuki Haga. The times of other riders are given in a relative format (e.g., \"+0.111\"), which means these are the additional seconds taken compared to Noriyuki's time.\n\n   - By calculating each rider's absolute finish time:\n     - Row 2: Max Biaggi has a time of \"35:26.845\" (35:26.734 + 0.111), slower than Haga.\n     - Row 3: Troy Corser has a time of \"35:27.834\" (35:26.734 + 1.100), slower than Haga.\n     - Similarly, all subsequent rows have times that are greater than Noriyuki's time as they indicate positive offsets (e.g., \"+5.927\", etc.).\n\n   - Riders with retirements have no valid finish time for comparison.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is evident that Noriyuki Haga has the fastest recorded time among all riders listed in the table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim \"noriyuki haga be the rider that have the fastest time\" is TRUE. The relevant cells from which we derived this information are:\n\n- Row 1 (Noriyuki Haga's absolute finish time).\n- All subsequent rows where the relative times are compared to determine if anyone finished faster.\n\nHere is the JSON object containing the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
