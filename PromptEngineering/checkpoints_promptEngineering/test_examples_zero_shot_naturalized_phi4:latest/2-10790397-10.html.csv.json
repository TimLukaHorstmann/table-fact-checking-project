Whether \"lake oval\" and \"windy hill\" have the smallest crowds.\n\n### Analyzing Relevant Cells:\nWe will focus on the \"venue\" and \"crowd\" columns across all rows, as these are the relevant pieces of information for this claim.\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Venue: punt road oval\n  - Crowd: 13000\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Venue: windy hill\n  - Crowd: 11000\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Venue: lake oval\n  - Crowd: 10000\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Venue: corio oval\n  - Crowd: 15000\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Venue: glenferrie oval\n  - Crowd: 10000\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Venue: brunswick street oval\n  - Crowd: 33000\n\n### Verifying Conditions:\n\n1. Identify the smallest crowd value from the \"crowd\" column.\n   - The smallest crowd values are found in Row 3 and Row 5, both with a crowd of 10000.\n\n2. Check which venues correspond to these smallest crowd values:\n   - Row 3: Venue is lake oval\n   - Row 5: Venue is glenferrie oval\n\n3. Verify if \"lake oval\" and \"windy hill\" are venues with the smallest crowds:\n   - Lake oval indeed has a crowd of 10000, which is the smallest.\n   - Windy hill has a crowd of 11000, not the smallest.\n\nThe claim states that both \"lake oval\" and \"windy hill\" have the smallest crowds. However, only \"lake oval\" qualifies as having the smallest crowd (10000). Therefore, the claim is false because \"windy hill\" does not have the smallest crowd.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n- Relevant cells for verification include the ones associated with both venue and crowd details from rows 2, 3, and 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
