Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 14**:\n  - Column \"opponent\": Confirms the opponent was cleveland browns.\n  - Column \"result\": Confirms it was a win (w).\n  - Column \"record\": Shows the record as 7 - 7 after this game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the record of the team playing against the Los Angeles Rams in week 2 according to the table provided.\n\n1. The claim states: \"the record of the team who play against the los angeles ram be 3 - 3\".\n\n2. To verify this:\n   - Locate the entry where the opponent is the Los Angeles Rams.\n   - Check the row for the game against the Los Angeles Rams to find its date, result, and corresponding record.\n\n3. From the table:\n   - Row 2 indicates a game on September 17, 1989, against the Los Angeles Rams with a result of \"l 17 - 31\" (loss).\n   - The record for this week is given as \"0 - 2\".\n\n4. Therefore, at the time of playing against the Los Angeles Rams, the team's record was not \"3 - 3\", but rather \"0 - 2\".\n\n5. Based on this information:\n   - The claim that the team\u2019s record should be \"3 - 3\" is false.\n\n6. Relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n   - Row index 2, column name \"opponent\" (to confirm opponent as Los Angeles Rams).\n   - Row index 2, column name \"record\" (to check the actual record at that time).\n\nThe correct JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
