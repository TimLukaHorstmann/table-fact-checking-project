The school name and mascot combination: \"andrean fighting '59ers.\"\n2. The enrollment number for this school.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - School: andrean\n  - Mascot: fighting '59ers\n  - Enrollment: 587\n\nThe claim states that the \"andrean fighting '59ers\" have an enrollment of 587. Checking Row 1, we find that:\n- The school is indeed \"andrean.\"\n- The mascot matches as \"fighting '59ers.\"\n- The enrollment number listed is exactly 587.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 1. Thus, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- From **Row 1**, we need to check:\n  - Column \"school\" to confirm it matches \"andrean.\"\n  - Column \"mascot\" to confirm it matches \"fighting '59ers.\"\n  - Column \"enrollment\" to verify it is 587.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
