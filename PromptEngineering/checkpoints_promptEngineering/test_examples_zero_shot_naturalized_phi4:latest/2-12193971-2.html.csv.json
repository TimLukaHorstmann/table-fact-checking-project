This means that if Real Murcia's wins are \\( W_{RM} \\) and draws are \\( D_{RM} \\), then for CA Osasuna with wins \\( W_{CAO} \\) and draws \\( D_{CAO} \\), the following condition must hold:\n\\[ (W_{RM}, D_{RM}) > (W_{CAO}, D_{CAO}) \\]\nand\n\\[ D_{CAO} = W_{CAO} + 1 \\]\n\nLet's check these values from the table:\n\n- **Real Murcia** (Row 1):\n  - Wins: 19\n  - Draws: 9\n\n- **CA Osasuna** (Row 3):\n  - Wins: 20\n  - Draws: 4\n\nNow, compare Real Murcia's wins and draws with CA Osasuna's:\n- Real Murcia has 19 wins and 9 draws.\n- CA Osasuna has 20 wins and 4 draws.\n\nTo satisfy the \"draw on win\" condition, CA Osasuna should have one more draw than their wins compared to Real Murcia.
