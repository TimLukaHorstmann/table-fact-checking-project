    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim: \"there be no win when the top 25 and even the top 10 be less than 4,\" we must evaluate each row in the table against this statement.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n- The condition is that if both \"top - 25\" < 4 and \"top - 10\" < 4, then there should be no wins (\"wins\" = 0).\n\n### Evaluation of Each Row:\n\n1. **Row 1 (Masters Tournament):**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 5: 1\n   - Top - 10: 3\n   - Top - 25: 4\n   - The condition is not met because \"top - 25\" is not less than 4.\n\n2. **Row 2 (US Open):**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 5: 0\n   - Top - 10: 1\n   - Top - 25: 3\n   - Both conditions are met (\"top - 10\" < 4 and \"top - 25\" < 4) and wins = 0, so this supports the claim.\n\n3. **Row 3 (The Open Championship):**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 5: 1\n   - Top - 10: 1\n   - Top - 25: 2\n   - Both conditions are met (\"top - 10\" < 4 and \"top - 25\" < 4) and wins = 0, so this supports the claim.\n\n4. **Row 4 (PGA Championship):**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 5: 1\n   - Top - 10: 1\n   - Top - 25: 4\n   - The condition is not met because \"top - 25\" is not less than 4.\n\n5. **Row 5 (Totals):**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 5: 3\n   - Top - 10: 6\n   - Top - 25: 13\n   - The condition is not met because neither \"top - 10\" nor \"top - 25\" are less than 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim holds true for the rows where both conditions (\"top - 10\" < 4 and \"top - 25\" < 4) are satisfied. In these cases, there were indeed no wins.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the PGA Championship, we need to carefully evaluate each part of the statement against the table data provided for this tournament.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"pga championship when top - 25 be less than 4\"**\n   - We look at Row 4 (PGA Championship) under \"top - 25\".\n   - The value is 4, which does not satisfy the condition of being less than 4.\n   \nSince the first part of the claim is already false, there's no need to check further conditions for this claim. However, let's evaluate the other parts to confirm:\n\n2. **\"have 0 win\"**\n   - Check Row 4 under \"wins\".\n   - The value is 0, which satisfies this condition.\n   \n3. **\"with cut made 6\"**\n   - Check Row 4 under \"cuts made\".\n   - The value is 8, not 6.\n\n4. **\"and top - 5 be greater than 0\"**\n   - Check Row 4 under \"top - 5\".\n   - The value is 1, which satisfies this condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because the condition \"pga championship when top - 25 be less than 4\" is not met.
