Therefore, we only need to check relevant cells related to the Essendon game (Row 6) concerning \"crowd\" and \"date.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Crowd Size:** Row 6, column: \"crowd\"\n- **Date:** Row 6, column: \"date\"\n\nThe JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
