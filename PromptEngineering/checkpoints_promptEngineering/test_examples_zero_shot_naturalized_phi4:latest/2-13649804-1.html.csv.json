    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205,\" we need to examine all entries in the table that relate to championship scores.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant column for this evaluation is the \"score\" column, as it contains the information about the championship scores.\n2. **Scan Scores**: We need to scan through all rows of the table and identify which players have a score of 205, since this is explicitly mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet's review the data:\n\n- Row 15: year 1999, champion Randall Mc Cracken, score 211 (not relevant).\n- Row 25: year 1989, champion Mike West, score 210 (not relevant).\n- **Row 26**: year 1988, champion Webb Heintzelman, score 205 (relevant).\n- **Row 30**: year 1984, champion Fred Funk, score 206 (not relevant).\n- **Row 37**: year 1977, champion Mike Zack, score 209 (not relevant).\n- **Row 40**: year 1980, champion John Jackson, score 205 (relevant).\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Score**: From the data, we observe that a score of 205 is indeed mentioned twice: once for Webb Heintzelman in row 26 and once for John Jackson in row 40.\n\n4. **Confirm the Claim**: The claim states there's a tie between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman at this score of 205. Since both have scores listed as 205, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n5. **Relevant Rows Identification**: For validation, we identify rows where the score is relevant to the claim (i.e., rows with score = 205).\n\nThus, the JSON response should confirm that the lowest championship score of 205 was indeed a tie between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, initially, we confirm if this score exists for him in the table.\n   - Then we check all rows to see if any other champion has a higher score than 284.\n\n5. **Findings**:\n   - Row 23: Year 1991, Champion Kim Thompson, Score 278\n   - Row 21: Year 1993, Champion Steve Brady, Score 284 (Matches the claim)\n   - Row 22: Year 1992, Champion Bill Loeffler, Score 282\n   - Row 20: Year 1989, Champion Mike West, Score 210\n   - Row 24: Year 1977, Champion Mike Zack, Score 209\n\n   After checking all scores, the highest score is indeed 284 by Steve Brady in 1993.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since no other score exceeds 284 in the entire dataset, and Steve Brady's score of 284 matches the claim, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant rows for verifying this are those containing the scores including the row with Steve Brady's score.\n   - Specifically, Row 21 contains \"year\", \"champion\", and \"score\" which verifies the claim.\n\nThe following JSON object provides the answer and lists the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
