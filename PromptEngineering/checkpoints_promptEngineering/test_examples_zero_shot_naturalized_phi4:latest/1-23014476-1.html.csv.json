Bush for each county listed in the table.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the vote difference for each county by subtracting the number of votes for one candidate from the other (i.e., `abs(Gore Votes - Bush Votes)`).\n\n2. Identify which county has the smallest absolute difference, indicating the narrowest margin.\n\nLet's calculate these differences:\n\n- **Churchill**: |2191 - 6237| = 4046\n- **Clark**: |196100 - 170932| = 25168\n- **Douglas**: |5837 - 11193| = 5356\n- **Elko**: |2542 - 11025| = 8483\n- **Esmeralda**: |116 - 333| = 217\n- **Eureka**: |150 - 632| = 482\n- **Humboldt**: |1128 - 3638| = 2510\n- **Lander**: |395 - 1619| = 1224\n- **Lincoln**: |461 - 1372| = 911\n- **Lyon**: |3955 - 7270| = 3315\n- **Mineral**: |916 - 1227| = 311\n- **Nye**: |4525 - 6904| = 2379\n- **Pershing**: |476 - 1221| = 745\n- **Storey**: |666 - 1014| = 348\n- **Washoe**: |52097 - 63640| = 11543\n\nAfter calculating, we find that Mineral County has the smallest margin of votes with an absolute difference of 311.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For **Pershing**, the Gore votes are at `row_index: 12`, `column_name: \"gore\"` and Bush votes are at `row_index: 12`, `column_name: \"bush\"`.\n- For **Mineral**, the Gore votes are at `row_index: 10`, `column_name: \"gore\"` and Bush votes are at `row_index: 10`, `column_name: \"bush\"`.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Mineral County has a narrower margin than Pershing County.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"gore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bush\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This does not match the claim of 17.9%.\n\n- **Eureka County**:\n  - Look at row 6: The column \"gore %\" shows 17.9%. This matches the claim.\n\nSince Gore's percentage in Esmeralda county is not 17.9%, but it is 17.9% in Eureka county, the claim is not fully supported.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 5, column \"gore %\"\n- Row 6, column \"gore %\"\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gore %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gore %}\n  ]\n}\n```",
