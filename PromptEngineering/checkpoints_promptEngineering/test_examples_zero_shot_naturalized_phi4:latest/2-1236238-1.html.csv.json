    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Don Freeland's best and worst ranks based on the provided table data, we need to examine the `rank` column across all rows since it pertains directly to his ranking in each year.\n\n1. **Claim Breakdown:**\n   - Best rank should be 2.\n   - Worst rank should be 22.\n\n2. **Examine Each Year's Rank:**\n\n   - **1953:** Rank = 12\n   - **1954:** Rank = 17\n   - **1955:** Rank = 14\n   - **1956:** Rank = 22 (Worst rank based on current data)\n   - **1957:** Rank = 33 (Worse than 22, so new worst rank)\n   - **1958:** Rank = 17\n   - **1959:** Rank = 14\n   - **1960:** Rank = 14\n\n3. **Determine Best and Worst Ranks:**\n\n   - The lowest rank observed is 12 in 1953.\n   - The highest rank (worst) observed is 33 in 1957.\n\n4. **Claim Verification:**\n   \n   - The best rank according to the data is 12, not 2 as claimed.\n   - The worst rank according to the data is 33, not 22 as claimed.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim that Don Freeland's best rank is 2 and his worst is 22 does not match the data provided. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - All rows in the `rank` column are relevant to verify this claim since we need to evaluate all rankings to determine the best and worst ranks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
