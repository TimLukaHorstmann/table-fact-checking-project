    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Ryan Hunter-Reay and Jimmy Vasser in relation to the given table, we need to verify each condition specified:\n\n1. **Points Condition**: Both drivers should have fewer than 2 points.\n   - Row 12 (Ryan Hunter-Reay) shows \"points: 1\".\n   - Row 14 (Jimmy Vasser) also shows \"points: 0\".\n\n   Both drivers satisfy this condition since 1 and 0 are fewer than 2.\n\n2. **Grid Condition**: The grid position should be larger than 4.\n   - Row 12 indicates \"grid: 9\" for Ryan Hunter-Reay.\n   - Row 14 indicates \"grid: 16\" for Jimmy Vasser.\n\n   Both drivers satisfy this condition as both positions (9 and 16) are greater than 4.\n\n3. **Team Condition**: They should be on the American Spirit Team Johansson.\n   - Row 12 confirms \"team: american spirit team johansson\" for Ryan Hunter-Reay.\n   - Row 14 confirms \"team: american spirit team johansson\" for Jimmy Vasser.\n\n   Both drivers satisfy this condition as they are indeed part of the specified team.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are verified and supported by the table data, we can conclude that the claim is true.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify each condition against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Team**: The driver must be on the \"patrick racing\" team.\n2. **Points**: The driver must have fewer than 2 points.\n3. **Grid Position**: The grid position of the driver must be larger than 4.\n4. **Drivers Identified**: According to the claim, these drivers should be \"ryan hunter - reay\" and \"oriol servi\u00e0\".\n\nLet's check each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 10**: \n  - Driver: patrick lemari\u00e9\n  - Team: pk racing (not \"patrick racing\")\n  - Points: 3\n  - Grid: 12\n\n- **Row 18**:\n  - Driver: oriol servi\u00e0\n  - Team: patrick racing\n  - Points: 0 (fewer than 2)\n  - Grid: 4 (not larger than 4)\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - Driver: ryan hunter - reay\n  - Team: american spirit team johansson (not \"patrick racing\")\n  - Points: 1 (fewer than 2)\n  - Grid: 9\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- Oriol Servi\u00e0 is on the \"patrick racing\" team and has fewer than 2 points but does not meet the grid condition (grid position should be larger than 4).\n- Ryan Hunter-Reay does not meet the team condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE** because neither driver satisfies all conditions simultaneously.
