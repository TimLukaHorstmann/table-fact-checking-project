    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each relevant piece of information from the table related to the version labeled as \"album version\" and its release year.\n\nThe claim states: \"the album version be the only 1 release in 1997.\"\n\nSteps for evaluation:\n1. Identify which row corresponds to the \"album version.\"\n2. Check the release year for this version.\n3. Confirm if it is indeed released in 1997, as per the claim.\n4. Additionally, ensure that there are no other versions listed under the year 1997 in the table.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the \"album version\":**\n   - Row 1 mentions a \"version: album version\" and specifies the year as 1995.\n\n2. **Check the release year for \"album version\":**\n   - The relevant cell is from Row 1, under the column \"year,\" which indicates that it was released in 1995.\n\n3. **Confirm if this version was released in 1997:**\n   - From the information above, the album version was released in 1995, not 1997.\n\n4. **Check for any other versions released in 1997:**\n   - All other rows indicate years of release as either 1996 or do not mention a year for some versions.\n   - No row specifies the year 1997 for any version.\n\nConclusion:\n- The \"album version\" was not released in 1997. Therefore, the claim is false since it incorrectly states that the album version was released in 1997 and implies exclusivity to that year.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those indicating the version type and release year:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the claim against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"over 2 year\"**: We need versions from at least two different years.\n2. **\"there be 7 version of the same song\"**: There should be exactly seven distinct versions listed, regardless of other details.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Distinct Years\n- From Row 1 (Year: 1995), we have one year.\n- Rows 2 to 8 are from Year: 1996. We need at least one version in a different year to satisfy the \"over 2 year\" condition.\n\nSince only one distinct year is represented in the table, this part of the claim is false.\n\n#### Step 2: Count Distinct Versions\n- Let's count the total number of versions from all rows:\n  - Row 1: album version\n  - Row 2: single version\n  - Row 3: instrumental\n  - Row 4: aches remix\n  - Row 5: pain killer mix\n  - Row 6: upside down remix\n  - Row 7: music video\n  - Row 8: live version\n\nThere are 8 distinct versions listed, not 7. Thus, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions in the claim are not satisfied:\n- There isn't more than one year represented.\n- There are 8 versions instead of exactly 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify both parts of the claim, we need to consider the 'year' and 'version' information from each row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"version\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
