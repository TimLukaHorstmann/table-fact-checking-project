Check if this first win occurred in Baton Rouge, LA, US.\n\nLet's evaluate these based on the table:\n\n1. **Identify Kamke's First Win:**\n   - We are looking for the first instance where the outcome is \"winner\" in the table. \n\n2. **Check Location of This First Win:**\n   - Once we find the first win, verify if it happened in Baton Rouge, LA, US.\n\nLet's evaluate each row to identify Kamke's first win:\n\n- Row 1 (Outcome: runner-up): Not a win.\n- Row 2 (Outcome: runner-up): Not a win.\n- Row 3 (Outcome: runner-up): Not a win.\n- Row 4 (Outcome: runner-up): Not a win.\n- **Row 5 (Outcome: winner)**: This is Kamke's first recorded win. The tournament location and details are:\n  - Date: 26 July 2010\n  - Tournament: Granby, Canada\n  - Surface: Hard\n  - Opponent: Milos Raonic\n  - Score: 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 (7 - 4)\n\n- Row 6 (Outcome: winner): Not the first win.\n- Row 7 (Outcome: winner): Not the first win.\n- Row 8 (Outcome: runner-up): Not a win.\n- Row 9 (Outcome: winner): Not the first win.\n\nRow 5 confirms Kamke's first win was in Granby, Canada, not Baton Rouge, LA, US. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n- For determining the first win:\n  - Row 5, Column \"outcome\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"tournament\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"date\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can form the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
