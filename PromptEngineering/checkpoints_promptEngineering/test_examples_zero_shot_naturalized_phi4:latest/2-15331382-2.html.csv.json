    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the Cleveland Brown play the San Diego Charger in week 12,\" we need to check two specific aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Week Identification**: We need to find Row 12 since it corresponds to Week 12.\n2. **Opponent Verification**: For that row, we must ensure that the opponent is not \"Cleveland Browns\" because this claim states they are playing against \"San Diego Chargers.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - **Week**: 12\n  - **Opponent**: Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe claim is false for two reasons:\n\n1. The Cleveland Browns do not appear as an opponent in Week 12; instead, it was the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2. There is no mention of a game against the San Diego Chargers in Week 12.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 12, \"week\" (to verify we are indeed looking at the correct week)\n- Row 12, \"opponent\" (to confirm the opponent for that week)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that on November 28, 2004, the game held the least amount of crowd attendance, we need to compare the attendance figures for all games listed in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column and rows:**\n   - The column of interest is \"attendance\" since it contains the data about crowd attendance.\n   - We will look at each row's attendance value to determine which game had the least number of attendees.\n\n2. **Extract attendance values from each row:**\n\n    - Row 1: Week 1, September 12, 2004 - Attendance: 70255\n    - Row 2: Week 2, September 19, 2004 - Attendance: 57310\n    - Row 3: Week 3, September 26, 2004 - Attendance: 74553\n    - Row 4: Week 4, October 3, 2004 - Attendance: 54006\n    - Row 5: Week 5, October 10, 2004 - Attendance: 52101\n    - Row 6: Week 6, October 17, 2004 - Attendance: 70187\n    - Row 7: Week 7, October 24, 2004 - Attendance: 73096\n    - Row 8: Week 8, October 31, 2004 - Attendance: 66210\n    - Row 9: Week 9, November 7, 2004 - Attendance: 59662\n    - Row 11: Week 12, November 28, 2004 - Attendance: 77447 (Claimed to be the lowest)\n    - Row 10: Week 11, November 21, 2004 - Attendance: 46905\n    - Row 13: Week 13, December 5, 2004 - Attendance: 65395\n    - Row 14: Week 14, December 12, 2004 - Attendance: 65858\n    - Row 15: Week 15, December 19, 2004 - Attendance: 72489\n    - Row 16: Week 16, December 26, 2004 - Attendance: 57330\n    - Row 17: Week 17, January 2, 2005 - Attendance: 64920\n\n3. **Compare the attendance figures to find the minimum:**\n   - The lowest attendance is in Row 10 with 46905 attendees.\n   - The claim states that November 28, 2004 (Row 11) had the least attendance at 77447.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 46905 (Week 11) is lower than 77447 (Week 12), the claim is incorrect.\n\n5. **Relevant cells for verification:**\n   - The \"attendance\" values from all rows need to be considered, but specifically Row 10 and Row 11 are crucial in disproving the claim.\n\nHere is the JSON output with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
