The claim states: \"the deluxe edition be release in australia in the digital download format.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant components of this claim:\n\n1. **Deluxe Edition**: We should look for rows that mention a \"deluxe edition\" and are related to Australia.\n2. **Region**: Specifically, we need information about releases in Australia.\n3. **Format**: The release must be available in \"digital download\" format.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- Row 6 mentions \"australia (deluxe edition)\" with a date of 11 October 2008, label: mushroom, and format: cd, but it does not mention digital download.\n  \nSince Row 6 is the only relevant row for checking both the region (Australia) and the deluxe edition, we need to check if the format includes \"digital download.\" However, the format listed is just \"cd\" without specifying \"digital download.\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim specifies that the deluxe edition should be available in digital download format.\n- Row 6 does not mention digital download as part of its format.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\nThe relevant cell for verification is from Row 6, focusing on both the \"region\" and \"format\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
