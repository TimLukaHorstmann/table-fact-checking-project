Check the attendance figures for these games:\n   - In Row 10, the game against Miami Dolphins has an attendance of 34063.\n   - In Row 13, the game against Miami Dolphins has an attendance of 17881.\n\n3. Verify if any other conditions in the claim need to be checked:\n   - The claim specifies \"the game against the miami dolphin have 34063 in attendance.\" Since this condition is met exactly by Row 10 and not contradicted by Row 13 (as they mention different games), we confirm that there was indeed a game with an attendance of 34063.\n\nSince the table supports the claim about one of the games against the Miami Dolphins having an attendance of 34063, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- From Row 10: \"opponent\" and \"attendance\".\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based in this context.",
