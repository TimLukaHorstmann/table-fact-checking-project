    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the redskin lose 2 time to the cowboy in 2001,\" we need to evaluate two main components: \n\n1. **Existence and Frequency of Matches Between Redskins and Cowboys**: The table provided lists all games for a particular team, presumably the Dallas Cowboys based on context clues (e.g., opponent names like \"tampa bay buccaneers\" and the attendance figures that align with typical Cowboys home games). We need to check if there are any entries where the opponent is \"dallas cowboys.\" \n\n2. **Results of Any Such Matches**: If matches against the Dallas Cowboys exist, we must then verify if they resulted in losses for this team.\n\n### Analysis of the Table\n\n- The table lists 16 rows of data for games played.\n- We need to focus on the \"opponent\" and \"result\" columns to check for any games played against the Dallas Cowboys and their outcomes.\n\n#### Relevant Checks:\n\n1. **Check for Matches Against the Washington Redskins**:\n   - In this context, checking for matches against the \"Washington Redskins\" is irrelevant because we are interested in games against the \"Dallas Cowboys.\"\n   \n2. **Check for Matches Against the Dallas Cowboys**:\n   - Review each row to see if the opponent listed is \"dallas cowboys.\"\n\n3. **Verify Outcomes of Identified Games**:\n   - For any identified game(s) against the Dallas Cowboys, confirm whether the result indicates a loss (denoted by an \"L\").\n\n### Evaluation\n\n- Upon reviewing the table, none of the opponents listed are \"dallas cowboys.\" The closest related entry is games against \"washington redskins,\" which does not satisfy our requirement.\n  \n- There are no games or results involving a match with the Dallas Cowboys in 2001 within this dataset.\n\nSince there are zero matches against the Dallas Cowboys, it's impossible for them to have lost twice. Therefore, the claim is false based on the provided data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"the redskin lose 2 time to the cowboy in 2001\" is FALSE as there are no entries in the table involving games between this team and the Dallas Cowboys. Thus, there are no relevant cells directly supporting or refuting the specific condition about losses against the Cowboys.\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

This indicates a loss.\n   - For Row 9 (November 18, 2001), the result is \"l 36 - 3\". This also indicates a loss.\n\n3. **Count Wins and Losses**: \n   - From our identified November games, both results are losses (\"l\").\n   - There are no wins in November for the Dallas Cowboys based on this data.\n\nThe claim states that the team won 2 November games and lost 2.
