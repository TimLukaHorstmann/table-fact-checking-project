However, the position listed here is 3rd, not 1st.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim requires both conditions (position as 1st and location as Berlin, Germany) to be true for the claim to hold.

Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **In 2009, be the \"5000 m\" event:**\n   - Check each row where the year is 2009:\n     - Row 7: Year: 2009, Event: 10000 m.\n   - There is no row for the year 2009 with an event of \"5000 m\". Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\nSince neither condition in the claim is supported by the table, the entire claim is false. \n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim are those related to the years and events mentioned:\n\n- Row 4 for the year 2007: Event column\n- Row 7 for the year 2009: Event column\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
