    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, we need to determine if Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda were pitchers in the 7th inning according to the data provided.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim states: \"the pitcher who set a record in the 7th inning be joel peralta robinson tejeda.\"\n   - We need to find any row where the inning is the 7th and check if Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda are listed as pitchers.\n\n2. **Table Evaluation**:\n   - **Row 1**: Inning is the 7th, pitchers are Jim Maloney (2) Marshall Bridges.\n     - These do not match Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda.\n   - **Row 2**: Inning is the 6th, pitcher is Paul Foytack.\n     - This does not match as it's not the 7th inning.\n   - **Row 3**: Inning is the 11th, pitchers are Dan Pfister (3) Vern Handrahan.\n     - This does not match as it's not the 7th inning.\n   - **Row 4**: Inning is the 9th, pitchers are Jon Adkins (2) Trevor Hoffman.\n     - This does not match as it's not the 7th inning.\n   - **Row 5**: Inning is the 3rd, pitcher is Chase Wright.\n     - This does not match as it's not the 7th inning.\n   - **Row 6**: Inning is the 6th, pitchers are Joel Peralta (3) Robinson Tejeda.\n     - These do not match as it's not the 7th inning.\n   - **Row 7**: Inning is the 4th, pitcher is Dave Bush.\n     - This does not match as it's not the 7th inning.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - No row matches the condition of being in the 7th inning with Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda as pitchers.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those related to the inning and pitcher columns for each row since we need to verify both conditions across all rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
