    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"oh the issue affect time engine trouble be the most common\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for instances of issues related to engines and compare these with other types of issues.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the columns `laps`, `time / retired`, and `grid`. The key information comes from the `time / retired` column, which specifies the reason for retirement when it is not a straightforward number indicating laps completed.\n\n2. **Count Engine-Related Issues**:\n   - Look for entries where `time / retired` explicitly states \"engine\".\n   - Count these occurrences.\n\n3. **Count Other Types of Issues**:\n   - Identify and count all other types of issues mentioned in the `time / retired` column (e.g., accident, gearbox, physical, overheating, etc.).\n\n4. **Compare Counts**:\n   - Determine if engine-related issues are indeed the most common compared to other issues.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Engine Issues**:\n  - Row 14: Emerson Fittipaldi - Engine\n  - Row 19: Dave Charlton - Engine\n  - Row 20: Jo Siffert - Overheating (related but not exactly engine)\n  - Row 22: Jackie Pretorius - Engine\n  - Row 25: Alex Soler-Roig - Engine\n\n- **Other Issues**:\n  - Row 15: John Surtees - Gearbox\n  - Row 16: Fran\u00e7ois Cevert - Accident\n  - Row 17: Howden Ganley - Physical\n  - Row 18: Pedro Rodr\u00edguez - Overheating\n  - Row 20: Jo Siffert - Overheating (already counted)\n  - Row 21: John Love - Differential\n  - Row 23: Peter Gethin - Fuel Leak\n  - Row 24: Jo Bonnier - Suspension\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Engine Issues**: 4 clear instances (Rows 14, 19, 22, 25).\n- **Other Issues**: 7 different types of issues.\n\nSince engine-related issues are not the most common type of issue compared to other types listed, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"any driver above 75 lap care trouble of some kind thus no time list.\" This means we are looking for drivers with more than 75 laps who either retired or did not finish (DNS), indicated by a lack of actual race time and instead having information like \"+ X laps\" or \"Retired reason.\"\n\n2. We will identify the relevant rows by checking:\n   - Drivers with laps greater than 75.\n   - Whether they are listed under \"time / retired\" as either not having a specific finishing time (e.g., \"+ X laps\", engine failure, accident) or have some indication of retirement.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1:** Mario Andretti completed 79 laps with a finishing time of 1:47:35.5. He finished the race and did not retire.\n  \n- **Row 2:** Jackie Stewart also completed 79 laps, but his time is listed as \"+ 20.9,\" indicating he finished after the winner by 20.9 seconds. He did finish.\n\n- **Row 3:** Clay Regazzoni completed 79 laps with a time of \"+ 31.4.\" Like Stewart, he finished after the winner by 31.4 seconds and thus did not retire.\n\n- **Row 4:** Reine Wisell completed 79 laps, but his time is listed as \"+ 1:09.4,\" which means he finished 1 minute and 9.4 seconds behind the winner but still finished the race.\n\nNo further rows have more than 75 laps; thus, we can conclude:\n\n- All drivers with more than 75 laps are accounted for.\n- None of these drivers retired or failed to finish (i.e., all have an actual time or a \"+ X\" indicating they completed the race).\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because all drivers who completed more than 75 laps finished the race without retiring due to trouble.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
