The claim specifies a 42-point margin of victory.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: We are interested in the 'result' column for all rows because this contains information about the scores of each game. From these results, we will extract the scores and compute the margins of victory for games won by the Philadelphia Barrage.\n\n2. **Compute Point Differences**:\n   - Row 1: Result is \"w 12 - 11\". The margin is \\(12 - 11 = 1\\).\n   - Row 2: Result is \"w 18 - 6\". The margin is \\(18 - 6 = 12\\).\n   - Row 3: Result is \"w 16 - 15\". The margin is \\(16 - 15 = 1\\).\n   - Row 4: Result is \"w 13 - 12 ot\". The margin is \\(13 - 12 = 1\\).\n   - Row 5: Result is \"w 13 - 12\". The margin is \\(13 - 12 = 1\\).\n   - Row 6: Result is \"l 15 - 16\". This is a loss, so it's not relevant.\n   - Row 7: Result is \"l 5 - 16\". This is a loss, so it's not relevant.\n   - Row 8: Result is \"w 17 - 7\". The margin is \\(17 - 7 = 10\\).\n   - Row 9: Result is \"w 10 - 8\". The margin is \\(10 - 8 = 2\\).\n   - Row 10: Result is \"w 22 - 11\". The margin is \\(22 - 11 = 11\\).\n   - Row 11: Result is \"w 18 - 13\". The margin is \\(18 - 13 = 5\\).\n   - Row 12: Result is \"w 20 - 12\". The margin is \\(20 - 12 = 8\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Largest Margin**: From the calculations above, the largest margin of victory is 12 points (Row 2).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that the largest margin was 42 points.
