The column corresponding to the 1987 - 88 season is directly after the first season.\n\n3. **Verify the Score for Newell 's Old Boys in the 1987 - 88 Season:**\n   - According to Row 2, under the 1987 - 88 column, \"Newell 's Old Boys\" indeed has a score of 55 points.\n\nBy confirming these conditions from the table:\n- Row 2 corresponds to Newell 's Old Boys.\n- The 1987 - 88 season is represented in the second listed seasonal data for each team.\n- Newell 's Old Boys have precisely 55 points listed for that season.\n\nThe claim matches the information provided.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if there is a team in the table with exactly 114 games played, 107 points, and 31 points specifically for the year 1987 - 88.\n\n1. **Identify teams that have played 114 games:**\n   - Teams meeting this criterion based on the \"played\" column are:\n     - Independiente\n     - Newell 's Old Boys\n     - San Lorenzo\n     - Racing Club\n     - Boca Juniors\n     - River Plate\n     - Rosario Central\n     - Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol\n     - Gimnasia de la Plata\n     - V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield\n     - Estudiantes de La Plata\n     - Argentinos Juniors\n     - Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba\n     - Ferro Carril Oeste\n     - Platense\n     - Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba\n     - Racing de C\u00f3rdoba\n\n2. **From these teams, identify those with 107 points:**\n   - The team \"Ferro Carril Oeste\" has exactly 107 points.\n\n3. **Check if Ferro Carril Oeste scored 31 points in 1987 - 88:**\n   - For Ferro Carril Oeste, the points for 1987 - 88 are indeed 33.\n   - Therefore, this team does not satisfy all conditions of the claim since it needs to have 31 points in 1987 - 88.\n\nSince no team satisfies all three conditions (114 games played, 107 points total, and exactly 31 points in 1987 - 88), we conclude that the claim is false.
