    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if suet has the highest gram of polyunsaturated fat compared to other oils listed in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Polyunsaturated Fat Content:**\n   - Sunflower oil: 69 g (or 4 g in high oleic variety)\n   - Soybean oil: 58 g\n   - Canola oil: 28 g\n   - Olive oil: 11 g\n   - Corn oil: 55 g\n   - Peanut oil: 32 g\n   - Rice bran oil: 37 g\n   - Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): 37 g\n   - Lard: 11 g\n   - Suet: 3 g\n\n2. **Compare Polyunsaturated Fat Content:**\n   - The highest polyunsaturated fat content among the oils is sunflower oil with 69 g.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that suet has the highest gram of polyunsaturated fat, but suet only contains 3 g.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to check the \"polyunsaturated fat\" column for all rows to confirm which oil has the highest content.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
