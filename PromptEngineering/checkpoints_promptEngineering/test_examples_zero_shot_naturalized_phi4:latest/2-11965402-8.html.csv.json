The scores he achieved in these games were 26 and 21 points respectively.\n\nLet's verify each part of the claim against the table data:\n\n- **Row 1** (April 2, 2008):\n  - Leading Scorer: Al Thornton (21)\n  - This supports the first condition where Al Thornton led with 21 points on April 2, 2008.\n\n- **Row 7** (April 15, 2008):\n  - Leading Scorer: Al Thornton (26)\n  - This supports the second condition where Al Thornton led with 26 points on April 15, 2008.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied according to the table data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the April 16, 2008, game between the Clippers and Rockets, we need to examine several aspects as outlined in the table:\n\n1. **Date of the Game**: The claim specifies that the game occurred on April 16, 2008.\n2. **Teams Involved**: It mentions both the Rockets and Clippers playing against each other.\n3. **Home Team**: According to the claim, the game was played at both teams' home venues.\n4. **Game Outcome**: The claim states that the Rockets lost with a score of 75 to 93.\n\nLet's analyze these points using the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row 7** corresponds to April 16, 2008:\n  - **Visitor Team**: Clippers\n  - **Home Team**: Rockets\n  - **Score**: 75 (Clippers) - 93 (Rockets)\n  - **Leading Scorer for Clippers**: Corey Maggette with 22 points\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions against this data:\n\n1. The date matches as Row 7 represents April 16, 2008.\n2. The teams involved are indeed the Rockets and the Clippers as specified in the table.\n3. The home team is listed as the Rockets, meaning the game was played at their venue, not both teams' venues as claimed.\n4. The score confirms that the Rockets lost with a final score of 75 to 93.\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the game took place at \"their own home,\" which implies both teams were hosting. However, only the Rockets were listed as the home team for this specific matchup, meaning the Clippers played away. Therefore, the condition about playing at each other's homes is false.\n\nGiven these points, the relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n\n- Date of the game: Row 7, \"date\"\n- Visitor team: Row 7, \"visitor\"\n- Home team: Row 7, \"home\"\n- Score: Row 7, \"score\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE** because it incorrectly states that both teams played at their respective homes. Here's the corresponding JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
