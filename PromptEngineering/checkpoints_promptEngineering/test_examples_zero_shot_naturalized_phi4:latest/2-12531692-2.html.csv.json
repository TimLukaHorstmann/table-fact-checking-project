We then verify if they appear alongside both individuals listed under no6 and no9.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows for \"telmo\"**:\n   - Row 12: No2 has \"telmo\"\n   - Row 13: No2 has \"m\u00e1rio telmo\"\n   - Row 14: No2 has \"evicted (day 3)\" and further down the row, no specific mention of telmo.\n   - Row 15: No9 includes \"telmo\" within a larger string.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows for \"paulo\"**:\n   - Row 16 to 18: No6 consistently has \"paulo\".\n   - Row 15: No6 has \"carla paulo\", which implies the inclusion of paulo.\n\n3. **Checking Rows Where Both Appear**:\n   - **Row 15**: \n     - Telmo appears in no9: \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\"\n     - Paulo appears in no6: \"carla paulo\"\n\n4. **Check the Presence of No6 and No9 Individuals in Row 15**:\n   - No6 has \"carla paulo\", containing both individuals.\n   - No9 has \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\", containing both individuals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In row 15, telmo (in no9) and paulo (in no6) are present alongside the required team members in both columns no6 and no9.\n   - Therefore, this configuration satisfies the condition of the claim that \"telmo and paulo play on the same team as no 6 and no 9\".\n\nSince row 15 is the only relevant row where all conditions align to verify the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"no9\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"no6\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"no9\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- Row 14 is checked to confirm telmo's presence within the sequence of evictions leading up to row 15.\n- The final row index and column names are specifically used to verify that telmo and paulo appear together with the required individuals in no6 and no9.",
