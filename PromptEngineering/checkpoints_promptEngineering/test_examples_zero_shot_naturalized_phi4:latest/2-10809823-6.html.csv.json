Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nTo verify this, we need to look at the \"venue\" and \"date\" columns for each row:\n\n- Row 1: Date = 3 May 1980, Venue = MCG\n- Row 2: Date = 3 May 1980, Venue = Victoria Park\n- Row 3: Date = 3 May 1980, Venue = Princes Park\n- Row 4: Date = 3 May 1980, Venue = Junction Oval\n- Row 5: Date = 3 May 1980, Venue = Arden Street Oval\n- Row 6: Date = 3 May 1980, Venue = VFL Park\n\nAll rows have the date \"3 may 1980\", but there are multiple venues listed.
