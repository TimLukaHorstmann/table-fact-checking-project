    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the completion percentages in 2003 and over Sherdrick's career, we need to examine two specific pieces of data from the table:\n\n1. The completion percentage for the year 2003.\n2. The career total completion percentage.\n\nFrom the table:\n- In Row 10 (year: 2003), the completion percentage is listed as 67.1%.\n- In Row 16 (career statistics), the completion percentage is listed as 61.8%.\n\nThe claim states that in 2003, Sherdrick had a completion percentage that was 3.1% higher than his career total. To verify this:\n\n- Calculate the difference between the 2003 completion percentage and the career completion percentage:\n  - \\(67.1\\% - 61.8\\% = 5.3\\%\\)\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the actual difference is 5.3%, not 3.1%. Therefore, the claim does not hold true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is \"FALSE\". The relevant cells from the table needed to verify this are in Row 10 (column: comp%) and Row 16 (column: comp%).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"comp%\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"comp%\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
