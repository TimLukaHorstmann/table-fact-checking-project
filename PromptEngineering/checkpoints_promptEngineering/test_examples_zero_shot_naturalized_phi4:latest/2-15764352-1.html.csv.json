    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the start times of the games mentioned in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"the first game starts at 14:00 and the second game starts at 14:00.\"\n\n1. **Identify the First Game**:\n   - The games are ordered by their time in the table.\n   - Row 1 has a time of 10:00, which is the earliest among all listed times.\n   - Therefore, the first game starts at 10:00.\n\n2. **Identify the Second Game**:\n   - After the first game (Row 1), we look for the next earliest time.\n   - Row 3 has a time of 15:00 and Row 2 has a time of 12:00.\n   - Therefore, the second game starts at 12:00.\n\n### Verification Against Claim:\n- The claim states that both the first and second games start at 14:00.\n- From our analysis:\n  - The first game starts at 10:00 (not 14:00).\n  - The second game starts at 12:00 (not 14:00).\n\nSince neither of these conditions matches the claim, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\nTo verify this, we need to look at the \"time\" column for the first two rows in the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: time: 10:00\n- **Row 2**: time: 12:00\n\nThus, the relevant cells are from Row 1 and Row 2 in the \"time\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
