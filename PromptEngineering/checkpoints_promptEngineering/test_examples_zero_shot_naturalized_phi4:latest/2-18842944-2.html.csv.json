Our primary interest is the \"date\" field across all entries since it directly pertains to verifying the claim about the timing of games.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant part:\n\n1. **November 7, 1976** - This date falls in November.\n2. **November 15, 1976** - This date also falls in November.\n3. **November 21, 1976** - Again, this is a date in November.\n4. **November 25, 1976** - This date as well is in November.\n5. **December 5, 1976** - This date falls in December.\n6. **December 12, 1976** - Another date that falls in December.\n\nFrom the dates given, there are 4 games in November and 2 games in December. The claim states \"there be 2 game[s] that take place in the month of november december,\" which suggests a total count across both months but doesn't specify a sum or separate counts for each month separately. Therefore, we need to consider all games from both November and December.\n\nCounting these together gives us:\n- November: 4 games\n- December: 2 games\n\nTotal = 6 games in November and December combined.\n\nSince there are indeed more than two games taking place across these months (specifically six), the claim is correct if interpreted as any number \"at least 2\" occurring within the specified time frame. Thus, the claim holds true under this interpretation.\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n- Row Indexes: 9, 10, 11, 12 (for November games)\n- Row Indexes: 13, 14 (for December games)\n\nNow we compile our JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
