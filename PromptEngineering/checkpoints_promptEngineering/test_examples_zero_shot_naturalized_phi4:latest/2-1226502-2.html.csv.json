    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Maruicio Gugelmin scored 5 points in his first race in 1988 and scored 5 points again in 1991,\" we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n1. **First Part of the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions Maruicio Gugelmin scoring 5 points in his first race in 1988.\n   - We look at Row 1 (1988) where it states:\n     - Year: 1988\n     - Entrant: Leyton House March Racing Team\n     - Chassis: March 881\n     - Engine: Judd V8\n     - Points: 5\n\n   The table shows that 5 points were scored in 1988, but there is no specific mention of Maruicio Gugelmin. However, it is known historically that Maruicio Gugelmin was part of Leyton House March Racing Team in 1988.\n\n2. **Second Part of the Claim:**\n   - The claim also states he scored 5 points again in 1991.\n   - We look at Row 5 (1991) where it states:\n     - Year: 1991\n     - Entrant: Leyton House\n     - Chassis: Leyton House CG911\n     - Engine: Ilmor V10\n     - Points: 0\n\n   In 1991, the points scored are 0. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\nSince the second part of the claim is false (he did not score 5 points in 1991), the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim:\n- Row 1: \"pts\" column for checking points in 1988.\n- Row 5: \"pts\" column for checking points in 1991.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
