    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden\" is true or false, we need to examine each relevant condition in the claim and verify it against the provided table.\n\nThe claim can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The series score should be \"1 - 1\".\n2. The location attendance for that game should be \"boston garden\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n**Condition 1: Series Score is \"1 - 1\"**\n\n- **Row 2**: The series score is \"1 - 1\". This row matches the first part of our condition.\n\n**Condition 2: Location Attendance is \"boston garden\"**\n\n- **Row 2**: The location attendance is \"boston garden\". This also matches the second part of our condition.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied in Row 2, the claim is true for this specific game.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check these cells from Row 2:\n- Series: \"1 - 1\"\n- Location Attendance: \"boston garden\"\n\nThese correspond to:\n- Row Index: 2\n- Column Names: \"series\" and \"location attendance\"\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This indicates a loss, so Boston leads the series.\n   - **Row 2:** Score is \"W 109 - 103\", and the series is \"1 - 1\". This indicates a win, making it tied in the series.\n   - **Row 5:** Score is \"L 111 - 116\", and the series is \"2 - 3\". This indicates another loss, giving Boston a lead in the series.\n\n3. **Aggregate Series Record at Boston Garden:**\n   - From Row 1: Detroit loses (0-1).\n   - From Row 2: Detroit wins (1-1).\n   - From Row 5: Detroit loses again (2-3).\n\n4. **Calculate Final Series Record at Boston Garden:**\n   - Total games at Boston Garden = 3\n   - Wins for Detroit = 1\n   - Losses for Detroit = 2\n\nThe series record of Detroit Pistons at Boston Garden is therefore 1 win and 2 losses (1-2).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2,\" which implies that Detroit won 5 games while losing 2. However, from the data, we find that Detroit won only 1 game and lost 2 at Boston Garden.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: \"location attendance\", \"series\"\n- Row 2: \"location attendance\", \"series\"\n- Row 5: \"location attendance\", \"series\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
