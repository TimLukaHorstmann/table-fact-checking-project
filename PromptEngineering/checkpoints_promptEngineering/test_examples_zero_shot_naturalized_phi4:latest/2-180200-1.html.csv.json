The ranks between these are Great Britain (rank 3), Finland (rank 4), and France (rank 5).\n\n3. **Calculate the Medal Count Difference**:\n   - For each nation ranked after Sweden and before Germany, calculate how many medals they have compared to Sweden.\n   - We need to check if any of them is exactly 22 medals behind Sweden.\n\n4. **Check Great Britain's Total Medals**:\n   - According to Row 3: Great Britain has a total of 41 medals.\n   - Difference between Sweden (65) and Great Britain (41) = 24 medals.\n\n5. **Verify if the Difference is 22**:\n   - The claim states that the next closest nation by overall medal count should be 22 medals behind Sweden, which would imply they have 43 medals.\n   - Since Great Britain has only 41 medals, it does not meet this condition.\n\nThus, based on the above analysis:\n\n- No nation ranked between Sweden and Germany is exactly 22 medals behind Sweden.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.
