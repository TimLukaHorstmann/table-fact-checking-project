    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of it against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \n\"tom hilde from norway be rank 2nd overall with 682 overall wc point.\"\n\nLet's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Athlete's Name and Nationality**:\n   - The claim mentions \"tom hilde\". We need to check if there is a row for an athlete named Tom Hilde.\n   - Additionally, it states that he is from Norway (\"norway\"). We should confirm his nationality as well.\n\n2. **Overall Rank**:\n   - The claim specifies that Tom Hilde is ranked 2nd overall.\n   \n3. **Overall WC Points and Rank**:\n   - The claim mentions \"682 overall wc point\" for Tom Hilde and states his rank in terms of these points as 2nd.\n\nNow, let's verify each part:\n\n1. **Athlete's Name and Nationality**:\n   - Row 2: Name is \"tom hilde\", Nationality is \"nor\". This matches the claim.\n   \n2. **Overall Rank**:\n   - Row 2: The rank is given as 2nd, which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Overall WC Points and Rank**:\n   - Row 2: Overall WC Points are listed as 682, and the overall WC points rank is (4). This partially matches the claim; he has 682 points but his rank by these points is 4th, not 2nd.\n\nThe discrepancy in the claim lies in the statement about Tom Hilde's rank based on overall WC points. He indeed has 682 points, but his rank according to those points is 4th, not 2nd as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table used to verify the claim:\n\n- Row 2, Column \"name\": \"tom hilde\"\n- Row 2, Column \"nationality\": \"nor\"\n- Row 2, Column \"rank\": 2\n- Row 2, Column \"overall wc points (rank)\": \"682 (4)\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Anders Jacobsen has the same number of points as Tom Hilde.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Check Nationality\n- **Anders Jacobsen**: According to Row 3, his nationality is \"nor\".\n- **Tom Hilde**: According to Row 2, his nationality is \"nor\".\n\nBoth Anders Jacobsen and Tom Hilde represent Norway.
