This aligns with the claim, which states that both the record and time are \"nascar camp world truck series.\"\n\nSince Row 7 satisfies both conditions specified in the claim (record and time being \"NASCAR Camping World Truck Series\"), the claim is supported by this row.\n\nNow let's prepare the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Row Index**: Row indices in the provided table start from 1.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether there is a record in the table where the \"qualifying\" time is exactly \"24.521\". Let's evaluate each relevant row:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We only consider rows with the \"record\" type as \"qualifying\".\n   - Row 2: Record = Qualifying, Time = 28.509\n   - Row 5: Record = Qualifying, Time = 28.964\n   - Row 8: Record = Qualifying, Time = 31.007\n   - Row 11: Record = Qualifying, Time = 24.521\n\n2. **Check the Claim Against Relevant Rows**:\n   - For Row 2, the time is \"28.509\", which does not match \"24.521\".\n   - For Row 5, the time is \"28.964\", which does not match \"24.521\".\n   - For Row 8, the time is \"31.007\", which does not match \"24.521\".\n   - For Row 11, the time is exactly \"24.521\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The claim states that \"the time for the record qualifying be 24.521\".
