The relevant column for this task is \"score,\" as it indicates whether the Trail Blazers won (denoted by 'w') or lost (denoted by 'l'). We also need to keep track of the number of wins and losses.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Game 35):** Score: w 105 - 89 (ot) \u2192 Win\n- **Row 2 (Game 36):** Score: l 95 - 105 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 3 (Game 37):** Score: l 105 - 109 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 4 (Game 38):** Score: w 107 - 98 (ot) \u2192 Win\n- **Row 5 (Game 39):** Score: l 94 - 106 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 6 (Game 40):** Score: w 120 - 108 (ot) \u2192 Win\n- **Row 7 (Game 41):** Score: w 102 - 87 (ot) \u2192 Win\n- **Row 8 (Game 42):** Score: l 92 - 97 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 9 (Game 43):** Score: w 98 - 90 (ot) \u2192 Win\n- **Row 10 (Game 44):** Score: l 95 - 98 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 11 (Game 45):** Score: w 97 - 93 (ot) \u2192 Win\n- **Row 12 (Game 46):** Score: l 97 - 98 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 13 (Game 47):** Score: l 95 - 106 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n- **Row 14 (Game 48):** Score: l 100 - 104 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n\nCounting the wins and losses from game 35 to game 48:\n\n- Wins: 6 games (Games 35, 38, 40, 41, 43, 45)\n- Losses: 8 games (Games 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48)\n\nThe claim states that the Trail Blazers won 6 games and lost 8 games between game 35 and 48.
