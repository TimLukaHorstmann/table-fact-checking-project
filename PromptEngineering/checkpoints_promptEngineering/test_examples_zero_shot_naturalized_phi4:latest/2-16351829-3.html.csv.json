    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Crystal Palace be the home team for the lowest tie number with a 1 - 1 score,\" we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify all rows where the score is 1 - 1**: This will help us find which matches had this specific result.\n\n2. **Check the home teams in those matches**: We need to ensure that Crystal Palace was the home team for one of these matches and also check if it was for the lowest tie number (tie numbers are sequential, starting from 0).\n\n3. **Determine the lowest tie number with a 1 - 1 score**: By examining the rows where the score is 1 - 1, we can find the smallest tie number.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n- **Identifying Rows with a 1 - 1 Score:**\n\n  Based on the data provided:\n  - Row 32 (Tie no. 24): Crystal Palace vs. Port Vale, score 0 - 0\n  - Row 33 (Tie no. 25): Port Vale vs. Crystal Palace, score 4 - 3\n  - Row 34: Chelsea vs. Newcastle United, score 1 - 1\n  - Row 35: Newcastle United vs. Chelsea, score 2 - 2\n  - Row 36: Chelsea won 4 - 2 on penalties (after a replay)\n  - Row 39 (Tie no. 28): Arsenal vs. Sheffield United, score 1 - 1\n  - Row 40: Sheffield United vs. Arsenal, score 1 - 0\n  - Row 41 (Tie no. 29): Hereford United vs. Tottenham Hotspur, score 1 - 1\n  - Row 42: Tottenham Hotspur vs. Hereford United, score 5 - 1\n  - Row 43 (Tie no. 30): Stoke City vs. Nottingham Forest, score 1 - 1\n  - Row 44: Nottingham Forest vs. Stoke City, score 2 - 0\n\n- **Finding the Lowest Tie Number with a 1 - 1 Score:**\n\n  From the matches with a 1 - 1 score:\n  - Row 34 (Tie no. 25)\n  - Row 39 (Tie no. 28)\n  - Row 41 (Tie no. 29)\n  - Row 43 (Tie no. 30)\n\n  The lowest tie number with a 1 - 1 score is Tie no. 25, which corresponds to Row 34.\n\n- **Checking if Crystal Palace was the Home Team for This Match:**\n\n  In Row 34:\n  - Home team: Chelsea\n  - Away team: Newcastle United\n\nCrystal Palace was not the home team in this match with a 1 - 1 score.
