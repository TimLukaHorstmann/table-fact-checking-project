We need to check if these two teams were involved in a game on March 20, with one as the visitor and the other as the home team.\n3. **Score**: The claim states \"score be 2 - 4.\" We must verify that this score is correct for the game involving the Blues and Penguins.\n\nNow let's examine the relevant row from the table:\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Date: March 20\n  - Visitor: Blues\n  - Home: Penguins\n  - Score: 2 - 4\n\nThis matches all the conditions specified in the claim:\n- The date is correct (March 20).\n- The visitor team is the Blues, and the home team is the Penguins.\n- The score is indeed 2 - 4.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 8 of the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game between the Penguins and the Kings on March 20 is true or false, we need to identify and verify specific details from the table.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**:\n   - The claim mentions a game involving the \"Kings\" and the \"Penguins\" on \"March 20\".\n   - From the table, we can see that Row 8 has \"date: march 20\", with the visitor being \"blues\" and home being \"penguins\". This is not the correct row for the claim.\n   - However, Row 4 shows \"date: march 9\", \"visitor: kings\", and \"home: penguins\", which involves both teams but on a different date.\n\n2. **Check the score**:\n   - The claim states that the score was \"2 - 4\".\n   - From Row 4, we see \"score: 1 - 3\". This does not match the claimed score of \"2 - 4\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because no game between the Penguins and Kings on March 20 exists in the table. Additionally, the score for their actual matchup (March 9) was different from what is stated in the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - \"date\" column: to verify the date of the Penguins vs. Kings game.\n  - \"visitor\" column: to confirm that the visitor team was the Kings.\n  - \"home\" column: to confirm that the home team was the Penguins.\n  - \"score\" column: to check the actual score of the game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
