    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, let's break it down into two parts and verify each part against the data in the table:\n\n1. **The ship with the highest pennant number is launched on 12 June 1934.**\n2. **The same date (12 June 1934) is also when the ship with the lowest pennant number was launched.**\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n#### Part 1: Ship with the Highest Pennant Number\n- Identify the highest pennant number from the table:\n  - Row 1: h78\n  - Row 2: h67\n  - Row 3: h79\n  - Row 4: h68\n  - Row 5: h74\n  - Row 6: h70\n  - Row 7: h69\n  - Row 8: h76\n  - Row 9: h62\n\n- The highest pennant number is **h79** (Row 3).\n- Check the launch date for this ship:\n  - Row 3, \"launched\": 28 June 1934.\n\n#### Part 2: Ship with the Lowest Pennant Number\n- Identify the lowest pennant number from the table:\n  - The lowest is **h62** (Row 9).\n- Check the launch date for this ship:\n  - Row 9, \"launched\": 12 June 1934.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim states that both the highest and lowest pennant numbered ships were launched on 12 June 1934.\n- From our verification:\n  - The ship with the highest pennant number (h79) was launched on 28 June 1934, not 12 June 1934.\n  - The ship with the lowest pennant number (h62) was indeed launched on 12 June 1934.\n\nSince only one condition is met (the ship with the lowest pennant number), the claim as a whole is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row 3, \"launched\" (for the highest pennant number)\n- Row 9, \"launched\" (for the lowest pennant number)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"launched\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"launched\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
