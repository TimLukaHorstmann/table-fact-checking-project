Identify where North Melbourne and St Kilda appear in the table:\n   - Row 4 indicates: \n     - Home team: St Kilda\n     - Away team: North Melbourne\n\n2. From this information, we can see that St Kilda was the home team when playing against North Melbourne. Therefore, North Melbourne did not play at their home venue; they were the away team.\n\n3. Based on this analysis, the claim is false because the match between St Kilda and North Melbourne was played at St Kilda's home venue, Moorabbin Oval.\n\n4. The relevant cells to verify the claim are those containing information about the home and away teams for Row 4:\n   - \"home team\" in Row 4\n   - \"away team\" in Row 4\n\nTherefore, the JSON object representing this determination is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
