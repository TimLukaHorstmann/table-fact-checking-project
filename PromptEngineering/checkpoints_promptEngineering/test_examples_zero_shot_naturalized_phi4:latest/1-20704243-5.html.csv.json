In this case, it is Marc Roskin.\n- **Season 1:** This corresponds to episodes that are part of season 1 in the table. \n\nLooking at the relevant columns from the table:\n- **\"Directed by\":** We need to identify entries where Marc Roskin is listed as the director.\n- **\"Season\":** We must confirm if these entries correspond to Season 1.\n\nNow, let's systematically check each row to see which ones have Marc Roskin as a director and whether they belong to Season 1:\n\n1. **Row 3:**\n   - \"Directed by\": Marc Roskin\n   - \"Season\": 3 (Not Season 1)\n\n2. **Row 10:**\n   - \"Directed by\": Marc Roskin\n   - \"Season\": 11 (Not Season 1)\n\n3. **Row 12:**\n   - \"Directed by\": Marc Roskin\n   - \"Season\": 13 (Not Season 1)\n\n4. **Row 15:**\n   - \"Directed by\": Marc Roskin\n   - \"Season\": 16 (Not Season 1)\n\nAfter evaluating all rows, we find that while Marc Roskin directed several episodes, none of them were from Season 1.\n\nThus, the claim \"Marc Roskin directed season 1\" is not supported by any entries in the table.

The minor difference in spelling (\"grifter\" vs. \"grifters\") is negligible and doesn't change the meaning or identification of the title.\n   \n2. **Director Verification**:\n   - The claim states it was directed by \"Marc Roskin\".\n   - In Row 2, \"directed by: arvin brown\".
