The key information relevant to the claim are:\n1. **Date**: Matches within 1997 to 2004.\n2. **Competition**: Specifically \"friendly\".\n\nLet's check each row in the table:\n\n- Row 1: Date is 19 November 1997, Competition is \"friendly\".\n- Row 2: Date is 25 March 1998, Competition is \"friendly\".\n- Row 3: Date is 14 October 1998, Competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 4: Date is 31 March 1999, Competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 5 & 6: Dates are 5 June 1999, Competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 7: Date is 18 June 2000, Competition is \"uefa euro 2000\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 8: Date is 2 September 2000, Competition is \"2002 world cup qualification\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 9: Date is 29 March 2003, Competition is \"euro 2004 qualifying\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 10: Date is 6 November 2003, Competition is \"friendly\".\n- Row 11: Date is 19 November 2003, Competition is \"euro 2004 qualifying\" (not a friendly match).\n- Row 12: Date is 18 February 2004, Competition is \"friendly\".\n\nFrom the above evaluation:\n- Friendly matches are in Rows 1, 2, 10, and 12.\n\nThus, there are 4 friendly matches listed between 1997 and 2004.

The relevant column for this task is \"venue\" since it contains information about the location of the match.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Venue is \"llu\u00eds sitjar, palma, spain\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 2**: Venue is \"bala\u00eddos, vigo, spain\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 3**: Venue is \"ramat gan, tel aviv, israel\". In Israel. This matches the claim.\n- **Row 4**: Venue is \"olimpico, serravalle, san marino\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 5**: Venue is \"el madrigal, vila - real, spain\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 6**: Same as Row 5. Not in Israel.\n- **Row 7**: Venue is \"amsterdam arena, amsterdam, netherlands\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 8**: Venue is \"ko\u0161evo, sarajevo, bosnia and herzegovina\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 9**: Venue is \"olimpikiy, kiev, ukraine\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 10**: Venue is \"afonso henriques, guimar\u00e3es, portugal\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 11**: Venue is \"ullevaal, oslo, norway\". Not in Israel.\n- **Row 12**: Venue is \"llu\u00eds companys, barcelona, spain\". Not in Israel.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 3 meets the criteria of being a match played in Israel between 1997 and 2004. Therefore, there is only one match, not three as claimed.\n\nThe claim that \"3 of the matches between 1997 and 2004 be in Israel\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cell for verification:\n- Row 3: Venue\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
