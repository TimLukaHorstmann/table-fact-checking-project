    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. **Condition about Outcome**: The match outcome for the Marco Island tournament should be \"runner-up\".\n2. **Condition about Score**: The score of the Marco Island tournament match when Bonnie Gadusek was the opponent should be \"6 - 3 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6\".\n\nLet's examine these conditions one by one in relation to Row 5 of the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: We need to identify which row corresponds to the Marco Island tournament. The description provided in Row 5 is: \n  - \"outcome: runner-up\"\n  - \"date: January 23 , 1984\"\n  - \"tournament: marco island\"\n  - \"surface: clay\"\n  - \"opponent: bonnie gadusek\"\n  - \"score: 6 - 3 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6\"\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - The outcome listed is \"runner-up\", which matches the claim.\n  - The tournament is specified as Marco Island, matching the location mentioned in the claim.\n  - Bonnie Gadusek is identified as the opponent, fulfilling this part of the claim.\n  - The score given is \"6 - 3 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6\", which exactly matches the score stated in the claim.\n\nAll conditions from the claim are verified against Row 5 and confirmed to be true. Thus, the entire claim about the Marco Island tournament match where Bonnie Gadusek was the opponent is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"TRUE\". The relevant cells for verifying this claim are found entirely within Row 5 under the following columns:\n- Outcome\n- Date\n- Tournament\n- Surface\n- Opponent\n- Score\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This is found in **Row 9**.\n\n2. **Verify Surface Type (Carpet (i)):**\n   - Check the surface type in Row 9. The entry states \"clay\", not \"carpet (i)\".\n\n3. **Check Opponent:**\n   - Look at the opponent listed for Knokke in Row 9, which is \"bettina bunge\". It does not mention Elise Burgin.\n\n4. **Confirm Date:**\n   - Verify the date associated with Knokke in Row 9, which is July 6, 1987. The claimed date was January 23, 1984.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- None of the conditions in the claim are satisfied when compared to the data from Row 9.\n- Therefore, all aspects of the claim are false: surface type, opponent, and date do not match.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that were examined are associated with the Knokke tournament in Row 9.
