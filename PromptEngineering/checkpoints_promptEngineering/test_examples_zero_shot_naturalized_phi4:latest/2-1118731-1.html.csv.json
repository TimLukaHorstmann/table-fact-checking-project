    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the power of the 1972 engine being unspecified is true or false, let's carefully examine the relevant parts of the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\" which means we need to check if the power specification for any engine associated with the year 1972 is missing or marked as unavailable.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row(s):** We must find any rows where the year includes 1972.\n   - Row 3: The years are specified as 1972, and it mentions a \"455in cubic oldsmobile v8\" engine.\n\n2. **Check the power column for these rows:** For the identified rows, we need to verify the value in the \"power\" column.\n   - In Row 3, the \"power\" column is marked with \"-\".\n\nThe \"-\" indicates that the power specification is not given or available. Therefore, this supports the claim.\n\nNow, let's return a JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We focused on Row 3 since it directly corresponds to the year 1972 and verified that its power specification is not provided (\"-\" in the column).\n- This supports the claim, so we answer \"TRUE\".\n- The relevant cell for this verification is from Row 3 (0-indexed as 2) in the \"power\" column.",
