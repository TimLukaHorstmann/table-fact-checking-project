    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Lauryn Williams' competition participation in a year, we need to analyze each row of the table to see how many times she competed in events per year.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim states that \"the most races Lauryn Williams compete in a year be only 1 in 2004, which she do 2 time.\"\n   - This implies checking if she participated in more than one race in any other year and specifically verifying her participation count for the year 2004.\n\n2. **Checking Each Year**:\n   - **2002**: \n     - Row 1: 1 event (World Junior Championships)\n   - **2003**: \n     - Row 2: 1 event (Pan American Games)\n   - **2004**: \n     - Row 3: 1 event (Olympic Games)\n     - Row 4: 1 event (World Athletics Final)\n     - Total in 2004 = 2 events\n   - **2005**:\n     - Row 5: 1 event (World Championships)\n     - Row 6: 1 event (World Athletics Final)\n     - Total in 2005 = 2 events\n   - **2006**: \n     - Row 7: 1 event (World Indoor Championships)\n   - **2007**: \n     - Row 8: 1 event (World Championships)\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is incorrect because Lauryn Williams participated in 2 events both in the years 2004 and 2005.\n   - Therefore, she competed more than once not only in 2004 but also in 2005.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Rows relevant to checking participation per year are all rows since they represent her competitions across different years.\n   - Specifically, the \"year\" column is crucial to verify how many times she participated each year.\n\nThe final JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
