    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Virginia 19 be the only district that have a candidate first elected in 1811,\" we need to examine the relevant column for each row in the provided table. Specifically, we will focus on the \"first elected\" column since it contains information about when candidates were first elected.\n\nHere is how we can verify this:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the \"district\" column mentions Virginia.\n2. For each of these rows, check the \"first elected\" column to see if any candidate was first elected in 1811.\n3. Count how many districts have a candidate who was first elected in 1811.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (Virginia 2)**: First elected is 1825.\n- **Row 2 (Virginia 3)**: First elected is 1820 (special).\n- **Row 3 (Virginia 4)**: First elected is 1819.\n- **Row 4 (Virginia 5)**: First elected is 1826 (special).\n- **Row 5 (Virginia 6)**: First elected is 1825.\n- **Row 6 (Virginia 8)**: First elected shows two years, 1805 and 1821.\n- **Row 7 (Virginia 9)**: First elected is 1821.\n- **Row 8 (Virginia 10)**: First elected is 1823.\n- **Row 9 (Virginia 11)**: First elected is 1825.\n- **Row 10 (Virginia 12)**: First elected is 1817.\n- **Row 11 (Virginia 14)**: First elected is 1817.\n- **Row 12 (Virginia 15)**: First elected is 1823.\n- **Row 13 (Virginia 16)**: First elected is 1825.\n- **Row 14 (Virginia 19)**: First elected is 1811.\n- **Row 15 (Virginia 20)**: First elected is 1817.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that only Virginia 19 has a candidate who was first elected in 1811. No other district matches this criterion based on the \"first elected\" data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Row 13 (Virginia 19) is relevant because it confirms the candidate was first elected in 1811.\n- Row 6 (Virginia 8) is checked to ensure no other district matches the year 1811.",
