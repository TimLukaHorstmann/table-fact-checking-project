Identify any row where the `drop height` is 272 feet.\n2. Check if the `opened` date for that row matches March 22, 2003.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Drop Height of 272 Feet:**\n   - Row 4 has a drop height of 272 feet.\n\n2. **Check Opened Date for Row 4:**\n   - The `opened` date for Row 4 is March 22, 2003.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied by Row 4, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For Row 4:\n  - Column: `drop height`, value: 272 feet\n  - Column: `opened`, value: March 22, 2003\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drop height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opened\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The model is \"giant drop.\"\n2. The drop height is 200 feet.\n3. The speed associated with these conditions is indeed 62 mph.\n\nLet's analyze each row based on the relevant columns: model, drop height, and speed.\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Model: giant drop\n  - Drop Height: 200 feet\n  - Speed: 62 mph\n\nThis matches all criteria of the claim. Therefore, this row supports the claim.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Model: giant drop\n  - Drop Height: 100 feet\n  - Speed: 56 mph\n\nThe drop height does not match (200 feet), so it is irrelevant for verifying the claim.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Model: giant drop\n  - Drop Height: 207 feet\n  - Speed: 62 mph\n\nThe drop height does not match (200 feet), making this row irrelevant to the claim.\n\n- **Rows 4 and 5**:\n  - Both have the model as \"gyro drop,\" so they are irrelevant because we need a \"giant drop\" model for verification.\n\nSince Row 1 is the only entry that satisfies all conditions of the claim, it verifies that the speed of the giant drop with a drop height of 200 feet is indeed 62 mph.
