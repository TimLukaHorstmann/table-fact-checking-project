    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"oleksandr vorobiov ( ukr ) have a total score of 16.25\" is true or false, we need to locate Oleksandr Vorobiov in the table and verify his total score.\n\n1. **Locate Oleksandr Vorobiov:**\n   - According to Row 3, the gymnast named \"oleksandr vorobiov ( ukr )\" is listed.\n   \n2. **Verify Total Score:**\n   - In Row 3, check the column labeled \"total\" for Oleksandr Vorobiov's score. It states that his total score is 16.25.\n\nSince both the gymnast's name and the position in the table match with the claim, and the total score matches as well, we can conclude that the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row 3: Column \"gymnast\" (to confirm the gymnast's name)\n- Row 3: Column \"total\" (to check the total score)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
