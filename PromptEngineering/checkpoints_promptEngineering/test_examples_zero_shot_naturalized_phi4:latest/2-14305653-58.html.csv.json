    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark,\" we need to analyze two parts of this statement using the given table.\n\n### Part 1: Failing to Score Only Once\n\nWe must identify all games where Yugoslavia failed to score (i.e., their goal count is 0). We will go through each row and check the \"results\" column:\n\n- **Row 1:** Results are 2:1. Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n- **Row 2:** Results are 2:0. Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n- **Row 3:** Results are 2:1. Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n- **Row 4:** Results are 1:4. Yugoslavia scored 1 goal.\n- **Row 5:** Results are 5:0. Yugoslavia scored 5 goals.\n- **Row 6:** Results are 2:1. Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n- **Row 7:** Results are 0:2. Yugoslavia scored 0 goals.\n\nYugoslavia failed to score only in Row 7 (the match against Italy). Therefore, the statement that they failed to score \"only once\" is correct based on this part of the table.\n\n### Part 2: Dropping a World Cup Qualify Match 2:1 Against Denmark\n\nNext, we need to verify if there was a World Cup qualifying match against Denmark with a result of 2:1. \n\n- **Row 6:** The opponent is Denmark, type of game is \"1982 wcq\" (World Cup qualifier), and the results are 2:1 in favor of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe claim states that they \"drop\" the match, meaning they lost it, which contradicts what we see in Row 6. In fact, they won this match with a score of 2:1. Therefore, this part of the statement is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the second part of the claim (dropping the World Cup qualifier against Denmark) is false, the overall claim must be false.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the rows of the table related to matches in the \"1982 World Cup Qualifying\" (wcq) section and verify if the Yugoslavian national team scored 7 goals and allowed 3 against them.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions the \"1982 world cup qualifier,\" so we need to look at rows where the type of game is marked as \"1982 wcq\".\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Match in the 1982 WCQ**:\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Opponent: Luxembourg\n     - Results: 5:0 (Yugoslavia scored 5, allowed 0)\n     - Type of game: 1982 wcq\n\n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Opponent: Denmark\n     - Results: 2:1 (Yugoslavia scored 2, allowed 1)\n     - Type of game: 1982 wcq\n\n   - **Row 7**: \n     - Opponent: Italy\n     - Results: 0:2 (Yugoslavia scored 0, allowed 2)\n     - Type of game: 1982 wcq\n\n3. **Calculate Total Goals Scored and Allowed**:\n   - Total goals scored by Yugoslavia = 5 (row 5) + 2 (row 6) + 0 (row 7) = 7\n   - Total goals allowed to Yugoslavia = 0 (row 5) + 1 (row 6) + 2 (row 7) = 3\n\n4. **Verification Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the Yugoslavian national team scored 7 goals and allowed 3 in their matches during the 1982 World Cup qualifiers.\n   - Our calculations confirm this statement based on the data from rows 5, 6, and 7.\n\nGiven the analysis above, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.
