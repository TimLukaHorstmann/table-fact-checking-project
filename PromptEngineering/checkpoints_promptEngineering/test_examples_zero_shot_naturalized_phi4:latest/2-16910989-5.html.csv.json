This matches part of the claim.\n\n2. **\"At the 16th Long Island International Film Expo.\"**\n   - Confirmed in Row 2 as the award giving body for this nomination.\n\n3. **\"But win best actor in a supporting role for OROS at the FAMAS Award.\"**\n   - Check for \"best actor in a supporting role\" related to OROS and awarded by FAMAS in 2013.\n   - From Row 3: Year is 2013, award giving body is the 10th Golden Screen Awards (not FAMAS), category is \"best actor in a supporting role,\" nominated for is OROS, and result is won. This part of the claim is incorrect because it mentions FAMAS instead of the correct awarding body.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first part of the claim regarding the honorable mention at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo is true.\n- The second part about winning \"best actor in a supporting role\" for OROS at the FAMAS Award is false because it was awarded by the Golden Screen Awards, not FAMAS.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is **FALSE**.
