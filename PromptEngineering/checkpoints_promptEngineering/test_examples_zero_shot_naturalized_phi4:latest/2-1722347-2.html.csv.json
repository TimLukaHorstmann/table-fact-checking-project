Since all three have the same number of floors, they do not meet the condition specified in the claim that their floor counts should be different.\n\n3. **Determine Truth Value**: Based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because not all buildings listed under \"centretown\" have a different number of floors; instead, they all share the same count of 27 floors.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells Identification**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those that pertain to the location and floor count for each Centretown building.
