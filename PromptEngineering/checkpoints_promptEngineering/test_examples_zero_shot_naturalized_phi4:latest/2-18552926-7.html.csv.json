Both rows indicate that the show was nominated for two categories, specifically for its leading actors (david duchovny and gillian anderson). Row 9 shows a win for \"best series - drama,\" which does not count as a nomination.\n\nTherefore, \"The X-Files\" was nominated for exactly 2 awards in 1997.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Duchovny be nominate for best actor in lead role - drama series every other year\" is true or false based on the provided table, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - David Duchovny should be nominated for \"Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series\" every alternate year.\n\n2. **Relevant Table Rows**:\n   - We need to focus on rows where the category is \"best actor in leading role - drama series\".\n   - The claim implies we are interested in years when he was either nominated or not nominated.\n\n3. **Extracting Relevant Data from the Table**:\n   - Row 2 (1995): David Duchovny was nominated.\n   - Row 4 (1996): David Duchovny won, but for evaluation purposes, winning counts as a nomination since it is included in that category and year.\n   - Row 7 (1997): David Duchovny was nominated.\n   - Row 10 (1998): David Duchovny was nominated.\n\n4. **Checking the Claim**:\n   - **1995**: Nominated\n   - **1996**: Won (counts as a nomination)\n   - **1997**: Nominated\n   - **1998**: Nominated\n\nThe pattern from the table is that he was either nominated or won in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. The claim requires evaluation of every other year:\n\n- **1995 (Year 1)**: Nominated\n- **1996 (Year 2)**: Won (counts as a nomination)\n- **1997 (Year 3)**: Nominated\n- **1998 (Year 4)**: Nominated\n\nFor the claim to be true, he should have been nominated in every other year starting from 1995:\n- Year 1 (1995): Nominated \u2714\ufe0f\n- Year 3 (1997): Nominated \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHe is also nominated or wins in years 2 and 4. The pattern holds for \"every other year\" as per the claim, which does not exclude nominations in the intervening years.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is supported by the data: he was nominated every other year starting from 1995.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
