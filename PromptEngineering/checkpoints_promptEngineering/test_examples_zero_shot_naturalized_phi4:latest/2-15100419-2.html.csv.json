    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2,\" we need to examine each row in the table for a player whose position is \"defensive end\" and whose \"overall\" number is less than 2.\n\nLet's go through each relevant column for every row:\n\n- **Row 1:** Position: linebacker, Overall: 2.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 2:** Position: defensive end, Overall: 33.  \n  - Defensive end present but overall number is not smaller than 2.\n- **Row 3:** Position: center, Overall: 60.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 4:** Position: cornerback, Overall: 63.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 5:** Position: wide receiver, Overall: 110.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 6:** Position: guard, Overall: 146.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 7:** Position: defensive back, Overall: 170.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 8:** Position: wide receiver, Overall: 185.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 9:** Position: wide receiver, Overall: 227.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n- **Row 10:** Position: wide receiver, Overall: 228.  \n  - Not a defensive end.\n\nThe only row with a \"defensive end\" is Row 2, and the overall number there is 33, which is not smaller than 2. Therefore, there are no entries that satisfy both conditions of being a \"defensive end\" with an \"overall\" number less than 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
