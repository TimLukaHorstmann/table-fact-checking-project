Row 9 matches this criterion.\n\n- **Season**: 2012\n\n  The season in Row 9 is 2012, which matches the claim.\n\n- **Number**: 26\n\n  In Row 9, the number for Jessica Quinones is 26, matching the claim.\n\n- **Team Name**: \"mcgill\"\n\n  According to Row 9, Jessica Quinones' school/club team is \"far eastern\", not \"mcgill\".
