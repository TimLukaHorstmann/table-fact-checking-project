    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the tampa bay buccaneers' highest draft pick be from outside of alabama\" is true or false, we need to analyze each row in the table and identify the pick with the lowest number (which represents the highest draft position) and check if that player's school is Alabama.\n\n1. **Identify the highest draft pick:** \n   - The \"pick\" column indicates the order of selection.\n   - We look for the smallest number in this column, which corresponds to the highest draft pick.\n\n2. **Verify the school of the highest draft pick:**\n   - Once we identify the player with the highest draft pick, we need to check their school from the \"school\" column.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row 1: pick = 6, school = alabama\n- Row 2: pick = 34, school = notre dame\n- Row 3: pick = 60, school = miami\n- Row 4: pick = 82, school = stanford\n- Row 5: pick = 91, school = clemson\n- Row 6: pick = 104, school = miami\n- Row 7: pick = 145, school = california\n- Row 8: pick = 176, school = central arkansas\n- Row 9: pick = 220, school = hawaii\n- Row 10: pick = 224, school = akron\n\nThe smallest \"pick\" number is 6, which corresponds to Eric Curry from Alabama. Therefore, the highest draft pick is from Alabama.\n\nSince the claim states that the highest draft pick should be from outside of Alabama and we have determined that it is actually from Alabama, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this determination are those in Row 1 under the columns \"pick\" and \"school.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"the Buccaneer have only one round with multiple draft picks, the third,\" we need to analyze the table data to check which rounds contain more than one pick.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"round\" and \"pick\", as they indicate in which round a player was picked. We will go through each row and note how many picks were made per round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** \n   - Row 1: Pick 6, Round 1\n\n2. **Round 2:** \n   - Row 2: Pick 34, Round 2\n\n3. **Round 3:** \n   - Row 3: Pick 60, Round 3\n   - Row 4: Pick 82, Round 3 \n\n   *Note:* There are two picks in round 3.\n\n4. **Round 4:** \n   - Row 5: Pick 91, Round 4\n   - Row 6: Pick 104, Round 4\n\n   *Note:* There are two picks in round 4.\n\n5. **Round 6:** \n   - Row 7: Pick 145, Round 6\n\n6. **Round 7:** \n   - Row 8: Pick 176, Round 7\n\n7. **Round 8:** \n   - Row 9: Pick 220, Round 8\n   - Row 10: Pick 224, Round 8\n\n   *Note:* There are two picks in round 8.\n\nBased on this analysis, rounds 3, 4, and 8 each have multiple draft picks.
