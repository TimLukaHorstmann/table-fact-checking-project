    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the fullback Ken Snelling be pick 58 in round 7\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of the claim against the given table:\n\n1. **Identify the player**: The claim mentions a player named \"Ken Snelling\".\n2. **Position verification**: It states that Ken Snelling is a \"fullback\".\n3. **Round and pick number**: It asserts that he was picked 58 in round 7.\n\nNow, we will look at the relevant row for this information:\n\n- **Row 5** of the table provides details about:\n  - Player: Ken Snelling\n  - Position: Fullback\n  - Round: 7\n  - Pick: 58\n\nThe cells from Row 5 confirm each part of the claim:\n- The player's name is \"Ken Snelling\".\n- His position is indeed \"fullback\".\n- He was picked in round 7.\n- The pick number for this selection is 58.\n\nSince all conditions in the claim match the data from Row 5, the claim is supported by the table.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".
