We need to check the \"surface\" column for Row 2 in the table.\n\nLet's examine these aspects:\n\n- From the table:\n  - Row 2 specifies the tournament as Key Biscayne, which occurred during the week of March 16.\n  - The surface listed for this row is \"hard.\"\n\nSince both conditions specified in the claim are satisfied (the game took place during the week of March 16 and was played on a hard surface), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.
