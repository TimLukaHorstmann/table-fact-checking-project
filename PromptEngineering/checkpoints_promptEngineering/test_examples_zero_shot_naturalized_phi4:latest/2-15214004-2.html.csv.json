Whether Joe Germanese is indeed the 27th pick.\n\n### Steps to Verify\n\n- **Find Joe Germanese in the Table:**\n  - Look through each row for a player with the name \"Joe Germanese.\"\n  \n- **Check the Pick Number Associated with Joe Germanese:**\n  - Once located, check the value of the \"pick\" column for that particular row.\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Row Search:**\n   - Scan through each row to find where the player is listed as \"Joe Germanese.\"\n\n2. **Pick Validation:**\n   - For the identified row with Joe Germanese, confirm if the \"pick\" number is 27.\n\n### Relevant Rows from the Table:\n\n- **Row 13**: The player name is \"joe germanese,\" and the pick number is 27.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"Joe Germanese be the 27th pick\" is TRUE based on the data provided in row 13 of the table. \n\nHere is the JSON representation of this verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Row Index**: Note that the row index is adjusted to be zero-based (i.e., starting from 0).\n- **Column Names**: Relevant columns are \"player\" for identifying Joe Germanese and \"pick\" to confirm the pick number.",
