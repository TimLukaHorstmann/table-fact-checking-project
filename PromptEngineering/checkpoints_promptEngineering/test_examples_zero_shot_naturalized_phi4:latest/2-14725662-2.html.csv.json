The result column should mention \"Iowa.\"\n     2. The site column should list \"Memorial Stadium Minneapolis, MN.\"\n\n3. **Table Examination**:\n   - Row 5: \n     - Opponent: Iowa\n     - Site: Memorial Stadium Minneapolis, MN\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Row 5 confirms that the opponent is indeed Iowa.\n   - The site listed for this game is \"Memorial Stadium Minneapolis, MN,\" which matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the information in row 5, the claim is true.\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to focus on two specific pieces of information from the table: the opponent (Michigan) and the site of the game. The relevant rows in the table will be those where Michigan is listed as the opponent.\n\n1. **Identify Row with Opponent \"Michigan\":**\n   - We examine each row for an entry under the column labeled \"opponent\" to find \"michigan\".\n   - In Row 9, we see:\n     - date: 11 / 21 / 1931\n     - opponent: michigan\n     - site: michigan stadium ann arbor , mi\n     - result: l0 - 6\n     - attendance: 37251\n\n2. **Verify the Site of the Game:**\n   - The claim states that the game against Michigan took place at \"memorial stadium, minneapolis, mn\".\n   - From Row 9, we observe:\n     - site: michigan stadium ann arbor , mi\n   - This information indicates that the game actually occurred at \"michigan stadium, ann arbor, mi\", not \"memorial stadium, minneapolis, mn\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because the location does not match.\n\nThus, the JSON response with relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
