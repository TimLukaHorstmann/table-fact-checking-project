    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table and compare them with the statements made in the claim:\n\n1. The claim states that \"luke hall be higher than jonathan calderon even though both of them have a rank of 100 and a time of 25.00 exactly.\"\n\n2. We should look for the row containing information about \"luke hall\" and check his overall rank, as well as his swim time.\n\n3. Similarly, we need to find the row for \"jonathan calderon\" and verify his overall rank and swim time.\n\n4. Next, compare their overall ranks since the claim discusses one being higher than the other based on these ranks.\n\n5. Check if either swimmer has an overall rank of 100 or a swim time of exactly 25.00, as stated in the claim.\n\nNow let's examine the data for each:\n\n- **Luke Hall** (Row 5):\n  - Overall Rank: 105\n  - Time: 27.47\n\n- **Jonathan Calderon** (Row 3):\n  - Overall Rank: 101\n  - Time: 27.16\n\nFrom these findings:\n- Luke Hall's overall rank is 105, not 100.\n- Jonathan Calderon's overall rank is 101, not 100.\n- Neither swimmer has a time of exactly 25.00.\n\nSince the claim states that both swimmers have an overall rank of 100 and a time of 25.00 which contradicts the actual data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used to verify this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
