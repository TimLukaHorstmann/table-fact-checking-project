    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table regarding the number of wickets taken by each player.\n\nThe claim states: \"Tom Richardson has the highest number of wicket takes of any player.\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant column (\"wickets taken\") for each row:\n\n- Row 1 (John Hearne): 212 wickets\n- Row 2 (Tom Richardson): 174 wickets\n- Row 3 (Johnny Briggs): 166 wickets\n- Row 4 (Arthur Mold): 166 wickets\n- Row 5 (Bill Lockwood): 150 wickets\n\nFrom this data, we can see that John Hearne has the highest number of wickets taken with a total of 212. Tom Richardson has taken 174 wickets, which is less than John Hearne.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Tom Richardson has the highest number of wicket takes of any player\" is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- Row 1, Column: \"wickets taken\"\n- Row 2, Column: \"wickets taken\"\n- All other rows are also relevant for comparison to ensure that Tom Richardson does not have the highest number of wickets. However, since we've already identified John Hearne with more wickets in Row 1, further examination is not strictly necessary but can be done for completeness.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1: \"wickets taken\"\n- Row 2: \"wickets taken\"\n\nThus, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
