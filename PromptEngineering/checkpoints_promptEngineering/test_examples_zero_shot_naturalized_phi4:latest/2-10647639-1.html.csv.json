In the \"result\" column, this information can be deduced from the scores provided (e.g., \"w 26 - 20\" indicates the Patriots scored 26 points).\n\n2. **Extract and Compare Scores**:\n   - Row 1: Result is \"w 26 - 20\". Patriots scored 26 points.\n   - Row 3: Result is \"w 17 - 14\". Patriots scored 17 points.\n   - Row 6: Result is \"w 28 - 6\". Patriots scored 28 points.\n   - Row 7: Result is \"w 20 - 13\". Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Row 8: Result is \"w 32 - 14\". Patriots scored 32 points.\n   - Row 9: Result is \"w 17 - 13\". Patriots scored 17 points.\n   - Row 10: Result is \"w 34 - 15\". Patriots scored 34 points.\n   - Row 11: Result is \"w 20 - 13\". Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Row 13: Result is \"w 38 - 31\". Patriots scored 38 points.\n   - Row 14: Result is \"w 23 - 6\". Patriots scored 23 points.\n   - Row 16: Result is \"w 34 - 23\". Patriots scored 34 points.\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum Score**: From the scores above, the maximum number of points that the Patriots scored in a single game is 38 (Row 13).\n\n4. **Verify Claim**: The claim states that 38 is the most points they scored in a single game. Our analysis confirms this to be true.\n\n5. **Relevant Rows and Columns**: The rows relevant for verifying the claim are those where the \"result\" column indicates the scores of the games: Rows 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16.\n\nNow, let's format this information in JSON as specified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
