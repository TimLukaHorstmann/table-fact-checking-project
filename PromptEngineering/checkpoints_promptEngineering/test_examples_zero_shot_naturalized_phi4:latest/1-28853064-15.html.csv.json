    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Sergio Luis Henao received both the general classification award and the points classification award\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for relevant information.\n\n1. **General Classification**:\n   - We must identify the stages where Sergio Luis Henao was listed as the winner of the general classification.\n   \n2. **Points Classification**:\n   - We also need to check if there are any stages where Sergio Luis Henao is mentioned as the winner in the points classification.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **General Classification**: \n  - Row 1: Winner: Ind Ant - Idea - Fla - Lot de Medell\u00edn, General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  - Row 3: Winner: Jairo P\u00e9rez, General Classification: Jairo P\u00e9rez\n  - Row 4 to 6: General Classification: \u00d3scar Sevilla\n  - Row 9 to 13: General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n\n- **Points Classification**:\n  - Rows 1 and 2: No award\n  - Row 3: Points Classification: Jaime Casta\u00f1eda\n  - Row 4 to 6: Points Classification: \u00d3scar Sevilla\n  - Row 9 to 13: Points Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n\nFrom the analysis, we see:\n- Sergio Luis Henao was awarded the general classification in Rows 1 and 9-13.\n- He also won the points classification in Rows 9-13.\n\nThus, Sergio Luis Henao received both awards at some point during the stages.
