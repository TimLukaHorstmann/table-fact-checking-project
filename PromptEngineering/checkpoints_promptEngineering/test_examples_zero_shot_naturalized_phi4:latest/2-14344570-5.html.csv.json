We will look for this specific date within the table's records.\n\n3. **Result of the Game**: The claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Dallas Stars by 5 points on this date. In hockey, the term \"points\" typically refers to a game point earned for a win or overtime loss, but here it seems to refer to goal difference, so we need to verify if the score was indeed such that the Flyers won by a margin of 5 goals.\n\nNow let's examine the relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 6**: This row corresponds to \"game: 45\", \"january: 15\" with the opponent being \"dallas stars\". The score listed is \"6 - 1\".\n  - The Philadelphia Flyers scored 6, and the Dallas Stars scored 1. The difference in goals is indeed 5 (6 - 1 = 5).\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The team involved was indeed the Philadelphia Flyers.\n- The game took place on January 15, as stated in the claim.\n- The score margin was 5 points (goals), which matches the claim.\n\nThus, all parts of the claim are verified by Row 6 of the table.
