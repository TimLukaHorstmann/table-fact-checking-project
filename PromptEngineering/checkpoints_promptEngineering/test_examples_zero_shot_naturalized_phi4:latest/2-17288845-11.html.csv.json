    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\", we need to verify each part of the claim against the given table:\n\n1. **Game Number**: The claim mentions \"game 4.0\". In the table, games are labeled with whole numbers (e.g., game: 1, game: 2). There is no indication that any game number includes a decimal like \"4.0\". However, it can be inferred that \"game 4.0\" likely refers to \"game 4\".\n\n2. **Series Score**: The claim states \"series 1 - 4\". We need to check the series score for Game 4 in Row 4.\n\n3. **Date**: The claim specifies \"be on april 25\". We need to verify that Game 4 occurred on this date.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row:\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - \"game: 4\" matches with \"game 4.0\".\n  - \"series: 1 - 3\" does not match \"series 1 - 4\". The claim is incorrect here.\n  - \"date: april 25\" matches the date specified in the claim.\n\nSince the series score for Game 4 is \"1 - 3\" and not \"1 - 4\", the claim is false. \n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- Row 4, \"game\"\n- Row 4, \"series\"\n- Row 4, \"date\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
