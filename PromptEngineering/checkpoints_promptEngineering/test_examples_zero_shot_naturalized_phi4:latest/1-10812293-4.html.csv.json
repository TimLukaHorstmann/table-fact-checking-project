    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"on december 23 , tj ford be the highest scorer with 24 point,\" we need to verify specific details from the table.\n\n1. **Date and Game Row Identification**: First, locate the game played on December 23rd.\n   - This is found in Row 13: the date column indicates December 23.\n\n2. **Scoring Verification**:\n   - Check who had the highest points for that game. According to Row 13, TJ Ford had 24 points, which matches the claim of being the highest scorer with 24 points.\n   - Confirm if any other player scored higher than 24 points in this game. The table specifies \"high points: t j ford (24),\" indicating no other player scored more.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data from Row 13, TJ Ford was indeed the highest scorer with 24 points on December 23rd.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to examine the relevant row in the table for the specified date and check if the high points recorded exceed 25.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim refers to a game on December 20.\n   - From the table provided, this corresponds to Row 11 (game number 26).\n\n2. **Check High Points in Identified Row:**\n   - In Row 11, look at the \"high points\" column which lists:\n     - \"fred jones (23)\"\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim Against Data:**\n   - The claim states that the high point getter had more than 25 points.\n   - Fred Jones scored 23 points on December 20.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Fred Jones's score of 23 is not greater than 25, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell for this verification is:\n- Row index: 11\n- Column name: \"high points\"\n\nThus, we can provide the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
