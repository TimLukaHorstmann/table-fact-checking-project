    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"3.0 be the highest number of goal score in the play - offs that have score 2 in the fa cup\", we need to check two conditions from each row:\n\n1. The player must have scored exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n2. Among those players, the one with the highest number of goals in the Play-offs should be checked.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 2 (Kirk Jackson):**\n  - FA Cup: 1 (Does not meet the condition of scoring 2)\n\n- **Row 9 (Christian Moore):**\n  - FA Cup: 2 (Meets the first condition)\n  - Play-offs: 0\n\n- **Row 13 (Mark Quayle):**\n  - FA Cup: 1 (Does not meet the condition of scoring 2)\n\n- **Row 17 (Lee Elam):**\n  - FA Cup: 1 (Does not meet the condition of scoring 2)\n\nOnly Row 9 meets the first condition. Now, check if there are any players with more goals in the Play-offs:\n\n- **Row 8 (Mark Stein):**\n  - FA Cup: 0\n\n- **Row 10 (Steve West):**\n  - FA Cup: 0\n\n- **Row 11 (David Brown):**\n  - FA Cup: 0\n\n- **Row 16 (Kayode Odejayi):**\n  - FA Cup: 1\n\nNo other player who scored exactly 2 in the FA Cup has more than 0 goals in the Play-offs. Therefore, the highest number of goals in the Play-offs for players with 2 in the FA Cup is indeed 0.\n\nThe claim states \"3.0\" as the highest number, which does not match our finding of 0. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
