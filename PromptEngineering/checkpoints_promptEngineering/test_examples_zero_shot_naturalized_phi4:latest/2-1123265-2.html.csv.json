    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap,\" we need to examine the relevant information in the table for Tarso Marques. The relevant columns here would be \"laps\" and \"time / retired,\" as these detail how many laps were completed or whether they finished the race.\n\nFrom the provided table:\n- Row 22: driver \"tarso marques\" has \"laps\": 0, and \"time / retired\": spun off.\n\nThe key cell to consider is in row 22 under the column \"laps.\" This value indicates that Tarso Marques completed 0 laps during the race. Thus, the claim stating he did not complete any laps is supported by this data.\n\nTherefore, based on the information from the table, the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding Tarso Marques, we need to verify two key components from the table:\n\n1. **Grid Position**: The claim states that Tarso Marques started in grid position 13.\n2. **Laps Completed**: The claim states that he did not complete any laps.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row for Tarso Marques (Row 22):\n\n- **Driver**: Tarso Marques\n- **Constructor**: Minardi - Ford\n- **Laps**: 0\n- **Time / Retired**: Spun off\n- **Grid**: 21\n\nNow, let's compare these details with the claim:\n\n1. **Grid Position**:\n   - Claim: Grid position is 13.\n   - Table (Row 22): Grid position is 21.\n\n2. **Laps Completed**:\n   - Claim: Did not complete any laps.\n   - Table (Row 22): Laps completed are 0, which means he did not complete any laps.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The grid position in the claim does not match the table information; it should be 21 instead of 13.\n- The number of laps matches the claim as Tarso Marques did not complete any laps (0).\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (the grid position), the overall claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
