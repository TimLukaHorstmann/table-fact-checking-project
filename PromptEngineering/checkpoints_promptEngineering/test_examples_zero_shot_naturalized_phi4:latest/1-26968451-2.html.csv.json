    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two key components of the statement:\n\n1. **Directs Series Number 39**: The claim states that Michael Lembeck directed series number 39.\n2. **Title \"Fly Solo\"**: The title for this specific series should be \"fly solo\".\n\nLet's break down the relevant details from the table to check these conditions:\n\n- Look at row where `series: 39` (as mentioned in the claim).\n- Check if `directed by :: michael lembeck`.\n- Verify that the `title` is \"flying solo\" or \"fly solo\" (since titles are often case-sensitive, we'll consider exact matches).\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Series Number 39**: Locate row where `series` equals 39.\n   - From Row 13:\n     - Series: 39\n     - Directed by: Michael Lembeck\n     - Title: flying solo\n\n2. **Title Check**: The title in the table is \"flying solo\", which matches with \"fly solo\" when case and pluralization are considered.\n\nSince both conditions match \u2014 Michael Lembeck directed series number 39, and the title corresponds to \"fly solo\" (as \"flying solo\"), the claim can be confirmed as true.\n\nNow, compile the relevant cell details:\n\n- Row index: 13\n- Column names for validation: `series`, `title`, `directed by`\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The row index is adjusted to zero-based indexing (13 in naturalized format corresponds to index 12).\n- Relevant columns are `series`, `title`, and `directed by` for verifying the claim.",

Identify the relevant rows and columns from the table that contain information about the director and writer of the episodes.\n\nLet's break down each step for verification:\n\n- The claim specifies \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck\". It is essential to check whether series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck.\n  \n- From the table, we locate Row 13, which corresponds to Series 39. According to the row details:\n  - Directed by: Michael Lembeck\n  - Written by: Leslie Rieder\n\nThe claim asserts that Michael Lembeck wrote this episode (Series 39). However, as per the data in the table, it was written by Leslie Rieder and not Michael Lembeck.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to check are those containing information about who directed and wrote series number 39.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
