They played on a clay surface.\n  \nThe only partnership between Flavio Cipolla and Pablo And\u00fajar occurred on a clay surface (Row 14), not exclusively hard surfaces.\n\nBased on these observations:\n- The first condition is true since Flavio faced Pablo as an opponent before partnering with him (Row 5).\n- The second condition is false because they did play together on a clay surface (Row 14).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. \n\n### Relevant cells for verification:\n- **Condition 1:** \n  - Row 5: Partners and Opponents columns show Flavio faced Pablo before partnering with him.\n- **Condition 2:** \n  - Row 14: Surface column shows they played on clay together.\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partnering\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
