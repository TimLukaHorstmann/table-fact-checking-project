Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum points:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 456 - 58 = 398\n   \\]\n\n4. Compare this difference to the claim, which states that \"between all of the constructors there be a difference of at most 11 point.\"\n\nSince the calculated difference (398) is much greater than 11, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. Identify the relevant cells for verifying the claim:\n   - The points values from each row are relevant.\n   \nTherefore, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
