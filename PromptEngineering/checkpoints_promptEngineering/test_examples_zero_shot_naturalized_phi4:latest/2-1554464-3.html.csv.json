    "resp": "To evaluate the claim:\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- The first part of the claim states that on 24 September 2007, the outcome was \"runner-up\", and the surface should be \"carpet\" with the opponent being \"Mardy Fish\".\n- Additionally, it claims that Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus every time they played against each other.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Outcome, Date, Surface, Opponent on 24 September 2007:**\n   - According to Row 6:\n     - Outcome is \"runner-up\".\n     - Date is 24 September 2007.\n     - Surface is \"hard\" (not \"carpet\").\n     - Opponent is \"Richard Gasquet\" (not \"Mardy Fish\").\n\n2. **Checking if Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus every time they played:**\n   - There is no information provided about matches between Mardy Fish and Olivier Rochus in the table, so this part of the claim cannot be verified from the given data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe first condition regarding the surface being \"carpet\" and the opponent being \"Mardy Fish\" on 24 September 2007 is not met according to the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE based solely on these verifiable conditions without needing to consider the second part about Mardy Fish and Olivier Rochus.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 6, Date\n- Row 6, Surface\n- Row 6, Opponent\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Mardy Fish beating Olivier Rochus with specific scores on a carpet surface, we need to examine whether the table provides any information regarding matches between these two players and their outcomes.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that every time Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus with the scores 3-6, 4-6 or 1-6, 5-7, it happened on a carpet surface. \n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - We need to check if there are any rows mentioning matches between Mardy Fish and Olivier Rochus.\n   - Verify if in these rows (if they exist), the scores match either 3-6, 4-6 or 1-6, 5-7.\n   - Check the surface for those specific rows.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Table**:\n   - The table contains matches involving Olivier Rochus only once (Row 8).\n   - In Row 8: \n     - Date: 11 July 2010\n     - Surface: Grass\n     - Opponent: Mardy Fish\n     - Score: 7-5, 3-6, 4-6\n   - The outcome of this match is \"runner-up,\" meaning Olivier Rochus lost to Mardy Fish.\n   - The surface was grass, not carpet.\n\nSince there's only one relevant instance where Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus and it occurred on a grass court, the condition specified in the claim (carpet surface) does not hold. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 8 contains all necessary details to verify the claim since it's the only row involving Mardy Fish as the winner over Olivier Rochus.\n   - Relevant columns are \"surface\" and \"opponent.\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
