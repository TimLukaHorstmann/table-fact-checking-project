    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant cells in each row of the table to verify how many games were won and lost during the specified stretch.\n\nThe claim states: \"the celtic lose 6 of their 7 games during this stretch.\" Therefore, for the claim to be true, there should be only one win among these seven games. If there are more than one win, the claim is false.\n\nLet's check each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (Game 76):** \n  - Score: \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\" indicates a win.\n  \n- **Row 2 (Game 77):**\n  - Score: \"w 104 - 92 (ot)\" indicates a win.\n\n- **Row 3 (Game 78):**\n  - Score: \"w 106 - 104 (ot)\" indicates a win.\n\n- **Row 4 (Game 79):**\n  - Score: \"w 105 - 98 (ot)\" indicates a win.\n\n- **Row 5 (Game 80):**\n  - Score: \"l 76 - 107 (ot)\" indicates a loss.\n\n- **Row 6 (Game 81):**\n  - Score: \"w 100 - 98 (ot)\" indicates a win.\n\n- **Row 7 (Game 82):**\n  - Score: \"w 115 - 107 (ot)\" indicates a win.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can count the wins and losses:\n- Wins: Games 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, and 82. Total of six wins.\n- Losses: Game 80. Total of one loss.\n\nSince there are six wins and only one loss, the claim that \"the celtic lose 6 of their 7 games during this stretch\" is false because they actually won six out of seven games.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are the 'Score' column in each row. The JSON object with the answer is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify the highest point total for a Celtic player in one game.\n2. Check if Stephon Marbury achieved this high score.\n\nLet's go through the table row by row and extract relevant information about the \"high points\" scored by players.\n\n- **Row 1:** Paul Pierce scored 32 points, which is noted as the highest point total for this game.\n- **Row 2:** Paul Pierce scored 21 points, which is the highest in this game.\n- **Row 3:** Rajon Rondo scored 31 points, which is the highest in this game.\n- **Row 4:** Paul Pierce scored 28 points, which is the highest in this game.\n- **Row 5:** Paul Pierce scored 14 points, which is the highest in this game.\n- **Row 6:** Paul Pierce scored 31 points, which is the highest in this game.\n- **Row 7:** Glen Davis scored 21 points, which is the highest in this game.\n\nFrom these observations:\n\n- The highest point total for a Celtic player in any single game was 32 points by Paul Pierce (Row 1).\n- Stephon Marbury did not achieve the highest point total of 32 or any other high score listed; his highest contribution in terms of assists is noted but not as a top scorer.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the highest point total for a Celtic player in one game be 32, by Stephon Marbury\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this are those that list the players who scored the highest points in each game:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
