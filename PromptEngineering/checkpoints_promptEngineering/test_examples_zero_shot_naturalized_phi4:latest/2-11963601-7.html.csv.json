Visitor team is Spurs.\n  \n- **Row 2 (February 6, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 23 points. Visitor team is Spurs.\n\n- **Row 3 (February 8, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 21 points. Visitor team is Spurs.\n\n- **Row 4 (February 10, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 22 points. Visitor team is Spurs.\n\n- **Row 5 (February 11, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points. Visitor team is Spurs.\n\n- **Row 6 (February 13, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 46 points. Visitor team is Spurs.\n\n- **Row 7 (February 19, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 18 points. Home team is Spurs; visitor is Bobcats.\n\n- **Row 8 (February 21, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 44 points. Visitor team is Spurs.\n\n- **Row 9 (February 23, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 30 points. Home team is Spurs; visitor is Hornets.\n\n- **Row 10 (February 25, 2008)**: Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 23 points.
