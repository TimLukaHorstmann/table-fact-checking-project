    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The home team score for St Kilda.\n2. The home team score for Collingwood.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition step-by-step against the table:\n\n### Checking St Kilda's Home Team Score\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Home Team: St Kilda\n  - Home Team Score: 14.17 (101)\n\nThe claim states that St Kilda have a home team score of 9.11, but according to the table, their actual home team score is 14.17 (101). This condition does not hold true.\n\n### Checking Collingwood's Home Team Score\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Home Team: Collingwood\n  - Home Team Score: 13.23 (101)\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood have a home team score of 11.13, but according to the table, their actual home team score is 13.23 (101). This condition also does not hold true.\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim are satisfied based on the data from the table, we conclude that the entire claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim include:\n- Row 6, Column: Home Team Score (for St Kilda)\n- Row 4, Column: Home Team Score (for Collingwood)\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
