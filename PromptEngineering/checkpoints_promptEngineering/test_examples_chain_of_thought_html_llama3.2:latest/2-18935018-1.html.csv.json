If so, note the corresponding row index and the values in the relevant columns.\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n * In the 4th row, the value in the 'location' column is 'trafalgar', not 'greensburg'.\n * In the 5th row, the value in the 'location' column is indeed 'trafalgar', but there is no match.\n * In the 6th row, the value in the 'county' column contains 'greensburg', and it's part of the school name '30 hancock', which implies that 'greensburg' might be a location for this school. However, the exact relationship between counties and locations isn't explicitly stated, so we cannot confirm this immediately.\n * In the 7th row, the value in the 'location' column is indeed 'knightstown', not 'Greensburg'.\n * In the 8th row, the value in the 'county' column contains 'greensburg', similar to the previous school. Again, the exact relationship isn't stated, but it seems plausible that this could be another location for a school.\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, we can confirm two schools with potential locations of Greensburg: one from row 6 and one from row 8.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
