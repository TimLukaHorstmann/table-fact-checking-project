    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. The claim states that 100% of the players drafted between pick 43 and 63 in 1989 are male.\n2. To verify this, we need to analyze the table to see if there are any female players listed within the specified range.\n3. We will look for rows where the \"nationality\" column indicates a country or region that is not typically associated with having female hockey players at the professional level in 1989.\n4. If we find such an entry, it would indicate that the claim is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued)\n\n5. However, given the typical structure of hockey leagues and nationalities during the 1980s, it's reasonable to assume that female players were not as prevalent in professional leagues.\n6. We'll focus on checking rows for \"nationality\" that might hint at a female player.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued)\n\n7. After reviewing each row from pick 43 to 63, we notice:\n   - Row 50: Finland has a known female hockey league and has produced professional female players.\n   - Other nationalities mentioned are associated with having professional male hockey leagues in the 1980s.\n\n8. Thus, based on this observation alone, it seems unlikely that all players drafted between these picks were male, as there's at least one instance of a female player (from Finland).\n\n9. To confirm our suspicion, we should ideally check if Finland produced any notable female hockey players around the time of the draft or verify if Finnish women's league had professional players during that period.\n\n10. However, without direct information on this in the question, and given the specificity required by your format instructions, we proceed under the assumption made from step 7.\n\n11. Our reasoning indicates that not all players drafted between pick 43 and 63 are male, especially considering Finnish nationality as a case of potential female involvement.\n\n12. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that not all players drafted in this range were male.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 50,\n            \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 50,\n            \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to count the number of players from pick 43 to 63 who have Canadian nationality.\n\n2. Next, we will look at each row in the \"nationality\" column for picks 43-63 and check if it contains the word \"canada\".\n\n3. If a row has \"canada\" in the \"nationality\" column, we will increment a counter to keep track of the number of players with Canadian nationality.\n\n4. After examining all rows from pick 43 to 63, we will divide the total count by the total number of rows (20) and multiply it by 100% to get the percentage.\n\n5. If this percentage is between 14 and 20 (inclusive), then the claim that \"14 / 20 of the player pick 43 - 63 be of canadian nationality\" is TRUE, otherwise it's FALSE.\n\n6. Now let's list the relevant rows from the table with their row index and column names:\n\n- Row Index: 1 (Stephane Morin) [Row 1]\n    - Column Names: [pick=\"43\", player=\"stephane morin\", position=\"center\", nationality=\"canada\"]\n- Row Index: 2 (Jason Zent) [Row 4]\n    - Column Names: [pick=\"44\", player=\"jason zent\", position=\"right wing\", nationality=\"united states\"]\n- Row Index: 3 (Jason Woolley) [Row 7]\n    - Column Names: [pick=\"45\", player=\"jason woolley\", position=\"defence\", nationality=\"canada\"]\n- Row Index: 4 (Corey Lyons) [Row 9]\n    - Column Names: [pick=\"46\", player=\"corey lyons\", position=\"right wing\", nationality=\"canada\"]\n- Row Index: 5 (Wes Walz) [Row 10]\n    - Column Names: [pick=\"47\", player=\"wes walz\", position=\"centre\", nationality=\"canada\"]\n- Row Index: 6 (John Brill) [Row 11]\n    - Column Names: [pick=\"48\", player=\"john brill\", position=\"left/right wing\", nationality=\"united states\"]\n- Row Index: 7 (Corey Lyons is not actually in this range so we can stop here.)\nLet's count the rows:\n\n1. From pick 43, \"Stephane Morin\" is Canadian.\n2. From pick 45, \"Jason Woolley\" is Canadian.\n3. From pick 46, \"Corey Lyons\" is Canadian.\n4. From pick 47, \"Wes Walz\" is Canadian.\n\nTotal count: 4\n\nNow we will compare the total count to 20:\n\n- Total count / Total rows = 4/20 * 100% = 20%\n\nSince the percentage (20%) is between 14 and 20 (inclusive), the claim that \"14 / 20 of the player pick 43 - 63 be of canadian nationality\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's put all our steps in a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of players from pick 43 to 63 who have Canadian nationality.\",\n    \"Look at each row in the 'nationality' column for picks 43-63 and check if it contains the word 'canada'.\",\n    \"If a row has 'canada' in the 'nationality' column, increment a counter to keep track of the number of players with Canadian nationality.\",\n    \"After examining all rows from pick 43 to 63, divide the total count by the total number of rows (20) and multiply it by 100% to get the percentage.\",\n    \"If this percentage is between 14 and 20 (inclusive), then the claim that '14 / 20 of the player pick 43 - 63 be of canadian nationality' is TRUE, otherwise it's FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the position to check**: The claim mentions a centre, so we need to find the rows related to centres.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant rows for centres**: Looking at the table, we can see that columns 3 and 4 have 'centre' and 'right wing' respectively in them for some of the players. We also see in column 4 (nationality) that Canada is mentioned, indicating centres with Canadian nationality.\n\n   The relevant row indices are between 43 to 63 inclusive since all draft numbers from 43 - 63 were included as per claim \"draft 43 - 63\".\n\n3. **Extract the centre details**: From the above rows for centres:\n   - Row index: 43, player is Stephane Morin\n   - Row index: 46, player is Jason Cirone \n   - Row index: 47, player is Scott Pellerin \n   - Row index: 57, player is Wes Walz\n   - Row index: 62, player is Kris Draper\n\n4. **Check if Blair Aitcheynum was indeed draft 56**: According to our logic so far, since we are given the draft numbers range 43-63 and need to find the first centre who got drafted within this range, there seems to be an inconsistency in the information given - as the claim mentions \"draft 43-63\" yet only provides details about centres that fell in the range between row index 43 to 62.\n\n   However, since 57 was not included in our initial list of possible first centre's draft number (as per the assumption made above), we will directly check for row index 56 and compare its draft number to find out if Blair Aitcheynum indeed falls under this category. Row 56 details player Scott Thomas who is a right wing, thus does not fit in our initial criteria.\n\n5. **Directly verify if Blair Aitcheynum's detail matches with any of the drafted numbers from row index 43 to 63**: As per the claim \"draft 43-63\", we can conclude that the relevant centre must fall under one of these draft numbers between 43 and 63.\n \n   However, upon closer inspection, we notice the player details at row index 58 with player name John Brill which has Canadian nationality but also shows an ambiguous role description - as it is both left / right wing which doesn't help much in identifying our first centre. Thus no conclusion can be drawn from this record yet.\n\n6. **Analyze each draft number**: We go back to the original claim \"draft 43-63\" where we are asked for player details within a certain range of draft numbers, and based on previous steps conclude that there seems to be an inconsistency in the provided data regarding which centre fell under what draft number between row index 43 - 63.\n\n   To find out if Blair Aitcheynum was indeed drafted at any point from his record we need more details. However since he was mentioned as part of a range (draft 43-63) and not with any specific draft number, we can't directly conclude anything about him without knowing the actual draft number that corresponds to him.\n\n   After looking closely at the data again we find row index: 56 has player name Scott Thomas who is drafted but his role description does not fit into centre category. We move on.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   The claim was asking for a centre \"draft 43 - 63\", however Blair Aitcheynum is only found at row index 56, thus with Canadian nationality and no information regarding any draft number associated with him in the given data.\n\n8. **Relevant cells for this problem**: \n   ```\n    [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 58,\n            \"column_name\": \"DRAFT NUMBER\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 56,\n            \"column_name\": \"DRAFT NUMBER\"\n        }\n    ]\n```\n\n9. **Final Answer in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted relevant centre details and noticed inconsistency in the claim regarding draft number associated with Blair Aitcheynum's record.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 58,\n            \"column_name\": \"DRAFT NUMBER\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 56,\n            \"column_name\": \"DRAFT NUMBER\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
