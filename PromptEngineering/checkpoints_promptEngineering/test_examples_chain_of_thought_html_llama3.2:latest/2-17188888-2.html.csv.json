To determine whether the claim about the number of games played in the 1947 championship is true or false, we first need to understand what data we have in the table.\n2. The relevant column for tracking game count is not explicitly provided, but based on the context, it seems that \"score in the final\" might be a proxy for tracking the total number of games played.\n3. In 1947, Don Budge played against Jack Kramer. \n4. According to the table, their match had multiple sets: 3 - 6, 6 - 3, 10 - 8, 4 - 6, and 6 - 3.\n5. The total number of games won by each player can be calculated as follows:\n   - Don Budge: (0+1+2+0+1) = 4\n   - Jack Kramer: (1+0+2+1+0) = 4\n6. Since both players played the same number of games, we cannot determine if one player had a \"higher\" or \"more\" game count than the other based solely on their final match.\n7. However, since Don Budge also won in another championship that year (1949), and Jack Kramer's record does not show any higher total games played for 1949, it is more plausible to think that the most number of games be played by Don Budge in 1947 given his performance in 1949.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The data on game count can't be determined solely from 'score in the final'.
