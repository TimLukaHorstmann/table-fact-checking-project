According to his record, he won both WEC 9 (with a corner stoppage) and WEC 8 (with a submission via strikes).\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Anthony Fuller's Record\nSimilarly, review Anthony Fuller's record. He won WEC 8 with a submission via strikes but did not win any other previous fights mentioned in the table.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Validity of Claim\nBased on the analysis:\n- Lavar Johnson has indeed participated in and won both WEC 9 and WEC 8.\n- Anthony Fuller, while winning WEC 8, does not have a record that suggests he was part of any other fights or events before this one.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"lavar johnson and anthony fuller be at the wec 9 and wec 8 , respectively\" is **TRUE**.\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Relevant Cells\nRelevant cells for Lavar Johnson:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"Fighter\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 11,\n    \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n  }\n]\n```\nRelevant cells for Anthony Fuller:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 17,\n    \"column_name\": \"Fighter\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 6: Output Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified Lavar Johnson and Anthony Fuller participated in WEC 9 and WEC 8 respectively based on their win records.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"Fighter\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This makes Rafael Real not part of our claim.\n\nHowever, for Phil Collins' case, we notice that his entry doesn't explicitly state when the knockout occurred (just that it was a tko (punches) ), which could imply it might have happened within the first two rounds since those are often shorter.
