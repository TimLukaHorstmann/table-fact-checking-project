    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the table structure\nThe given table has a header row with columns for 'round', 'pick', 'overall', 'name', 'position', and 'college'. Each subsequent row represents a player, with their respective round number, pick position, overall ranking, name, position played, and college attended.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the claim's focus\nThe claim focuses on players being picked during the 2nd round of the draft. We need to verify if any player was indeed selected in the 2nd round.\n\n### Step 3: Locate rows corresponding to the 2nd round\nTo confirm, we'll look for rows where 'round' equals '2'. This will indicate which players were picked during this round.\n\n### Step 4: Verify player picks in the 2nd round\nWe need to verify if any player was selected in the 2nd round. If such a player exists, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze relevant rows\nUpon inspecting the table, we find two rows that correspond to the 2nd round:\n- Row 3: 'round' = 2 and 'pick' = 4\n- Row 6: 'round' = 6 and 'pick' = 6\n\n### Step 6: Draw conclusion based on analysis\nSince there are players selected in the 2nd round (e.g., Ray Donaldson, who was picked at pick #4), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Step 7: Identify relevant cells for JSON output\nFor JSON output, we need to specify the relevant rows and columns that led to our conclusion. These are the cells where 'round' = 2 and any other column values that were crucial to understanding our reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We looked at the table's structure to understand its meaning.

Then, we need to identify the rounds for which there is at least one pick after the 10th round.\n   The only relevant data for this claim comes from:\n   - round 1\n   - round 2\n   - round 3\n   We can find all players who have been picked before or after round 10 (the cut-off) and check if their respective column contains pick values above 10.\n   - For round 1, we know there are two picks from running backs but neither of them is after the 10th round.

Next, let's identify the relevant cells from the table that match this criteria:\n\t* For curtis dickey: The first row of the table has a pick value of 5 (not matching), but the second row has a pick value of 24 (also not matching). However, there is no row with a pick value equal to \"curtis dickey\" in round 2.\n\t* For randy bielski: The sixth row of the table has a pick value of 6 (matching) and the column name \"pick\" matches. Additionally, the twelfth row also has a pick value of 19 which doesn't match but does have 'randy bielski' in the \"name\" column.\n\t* However we notice randy bielski can only be matched when both columns are equal so it is the second row that contains matching data for Randy Bielski.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the round values again and see if there are any rows where the pick value matches either curtis dickey or randy bielski in round 2.\n   - There is no \"curtis dickey\" match in round 2 because none of the columns have a column name that contains 'dickey' so this can be removed from our relevant cells list \n   - However there is one row with matching data for Randy Bielski at row index 12 which is in round 2.\n\n4.
