Each row represents a player's information, including their score, country, and whether they are tied (or not) for a specific place.\n\n### Step 3: Determine how to identify players tied for 6th place\nTo find the players tied for 6th place, we need to look at the \"place\" column and filter rows where the value is \"t6\". We also need to check if there are multiple rows with the same score in this column.\n\n### Step 4: Identify relevant cells\nWe will examine the table row by row, starting from the bottom (row_index=6) because we're interested in players tied for 6th place. The relevant columns are \"place\", \"score\", and \"player\".\n\n### Step 5: Count the number of unique scores among players tied for 6th place\nCounting the unique scores among these players will tell us if there indeed are 7 players tied for 6th place.\n\n### Step 6: Check uniqueness of scores and tie count\nWe find multiple rows for \"t6\" with different scores (e.g., \"70 + 71 = 141\", \"72 + 69 = 141\", etc.). This means we have multiple unique scores. \n\nLet's list the scores to check if there are indeed 7 players tied:\n- 141 (4 times)\n- 140 is not present in this table, which tells us that only one score of 141 can be tied with another player.\nThus, our claim seems False.\n\n### Step 7: Compile the relevant cells into JSON format\nHere's how we'll present our findings in a valid JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed table to identify players tied for 6th place.\\n\\nIdentified 't6' as the rows of interest and counted unique scores among these rows.

To verify this, we need to check if any two players have the same score as indicated by \"to par\" which is +1 and also the total score calculated from \"score\".\n3. From the table, we can see that each row has a score with an equation that shows how it was calculated (e.g., 68+71=139).\n4. We need to check all rows in the table to find any two players who have scores that add up to the same total.\n5. In the first column of the \"place\" column, we see multiple places like T1, T3, T6 and so on for each row. These represent which hole is being played (i.e., the number).\n6. Since there are multiple \"to par\" values, this could potentially indicate if a player has finished at par or under it.\n7.

The 'to par' value seems to be a measure of how well each player performed compared to the course par.\n\nStep 3: Look for any evidence of multiple players sharing the same score in the 'score' column.\nIn some cases, the scores have been calculated using the \"+\" or \"-\" operator (e.g., \"68 + 71 = 139\" or \"70 + 73 = 141\"), indicating that these are aggregate scores.
