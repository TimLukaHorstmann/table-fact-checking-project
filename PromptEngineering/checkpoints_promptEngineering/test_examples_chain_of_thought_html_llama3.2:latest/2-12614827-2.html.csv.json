To answer this question, we need to count the number of losses in Emerson's career.\n4. We can do this by looking at the \"result\" column in the table and counting the number of rows with a value indicating a loss (e.g., \"loss\", \"decision (split)\", etc.).\n5.

For example, some losses may be due to decisions rather than knockouts or submissions, which could affect the outcome of the fight.\n7.
