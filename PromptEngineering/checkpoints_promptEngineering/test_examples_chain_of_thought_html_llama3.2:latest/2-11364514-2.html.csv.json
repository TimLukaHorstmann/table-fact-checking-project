    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the Claim and Table Structure\nThe claim states that Rob Howell was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Set Design and also Best Costume Design in 2008.\n\n#### Step 2: Find Relevant Cells in the Table\nTo verify this claim, we need to find the cells in the table where Rob Howell's information matches both Best Set Design and Best Costume Design. The table structure is as follows:\n\n| row_index | column_name    |\n|-----------|----------------|\n|          | year           |\n| 0        | award          |\n| 1        | category       |\n| 2        | nominee         |\n| 3        | result         |\n\nIn the table, we need to look for rows where:\n- The \"nominee\" column contains Rob Howell.\n- The \"award\" column contains \"laurence olivier award\".\n- One of the columns \"category\" and \"result\" contains either \"best set design\" or \"best costume design\".\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Rows with Rob Howell as Nominee\nLooking at rows where \"nominee\" is Rob Howell, we can find:\n- Row 2: Has Rob Howell as nominee for \"best new musical\", which does not match our criteria.\n- Row 5: Has Rob Howell as nominee for \"best set design\" and also has the Laurence Olivier Award nomination award.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if Best Costume Design is Mentioned\nThe claim includes both Best Set Design and Best Costume Design. However, only one entry per year exists in the table for each category (set design and costume design). Rob Howell was nominated for \"best set design\" but there's no separate nomination for \"best costume design\".\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion Based on Table Data\nSince we found that Rob Howell was indeed nominated for Best Set Design in 2008 and has a Laurence Olivier Award nomination, but the claim inaccurately includes Best Costume Design separately without any evidence from the table data, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not provide evidence of an award specifically for Best Costume Design being given to Rob Howell.

We can see that there is a row for the year 2008, and within that row, we can see multiple columns labeled \"award\", \"category\", and \"nominee\".

Looking at the table, there is indeed a row for 2008 with an award of \"Best Set Design\" (column 4). Now, we need to check if the nominee column contains the name \"simon baker\".\n\n4. Upon inspection, we can see that in another part of the same row where award = Best Set Design, nominee = simon baker.\n\n5.
