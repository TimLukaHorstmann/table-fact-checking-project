This means we need to check if there is at least one row in the table where the home team (New Jersey) did not have any points scored against them.\n\n2. **Look for rows where New Jersey did not have any points scored**: We will go through each row of the table, and specifically look for rows where \"home\" equals \"new jersey\", because those are the games we want to check for a score being recorded.\n\n3. **Determine if there is at least one row without score**: If we can find a row in which \"score\" does not contain any number (indicating no points were scored), then we know the claim about New Jersey devils never finishing a game without score, is false. Otherwise it's true.\n\n4. **Find the relevant cells**:\n\n    - The first step to finding the correct rows was to identify that row 0 corresponds to the \"date\" and does not have the value for points scored against them.\n    - Row 1: In this row we can see New Jersey (the home team) had a score of \"1 - 2\". This means they did not finish with no points against any opponent.\n    - The second relevant row to find is the one where the Devils didn't record a point. However, since that does not occur in row 0, we can move on to another step.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim about New Jersey devils never finishing a game without score, is false.

In this context, it means that neither team scores any points.\n\n#### Step 3: Look for rows where both teams have a score of 0 or no score is mentioned in the score column\nWe need to look for instances where both teams' score columns do not show any numbers (indicating zero or no score) and also check if either \"None\" or \"-\" are present, but since these words aren't found we must rely on scores like \"0-0\", 2-0. \n\n#### Step 4: Identify the row(s) where New Jersey Devils lose a shutout game\nWe will identify which row indicates that a shutout loss for New Jersey occurs.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify if there is any instance of score no point\nCheck if there are any rows indicating no points were scored by either team.\n\n#### Step 6: Output the final answer in JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified shutout game definition, looked for rows where both teams have a score of zero or no score mentioned.
