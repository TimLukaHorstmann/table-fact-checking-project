This means we need to find the row with the earliest broadcast date that has 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' in its romanized title.\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant information from the table\nLooking at the table, we can see that there is a column for the broadcast date and another for the romanized title. We need to find the row where 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' appears as the romanized title and determine if it has the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\n\n### Step 3: Identify rows with 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' in their romanized titles\nWe can see that there is only one row with 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' in its romanized title. This row corresponds to episode 3, which has a broadcast date of May 24, 2010.\n\n### Step 4: Find the most recent and second most recent dates\nComparing the broadcast dates, we can see that there are only two dates that appear after May 24, 2010.

Therefore, we need to check if another episode also has a broadcast date of June 7 or May 31.\n\n### Step 6: Find other episodes with similar dates\nEpisode 5 and Episode 4 both have broadcast dates on June 7, 2010 and May 31, 2010 respectively. However, only one of these is the second most recent.\n\n### Step 7: Determine if 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' has the 2nd most recent broadcast date\nSince we are only looking at 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu', which appears in episode 3 with a May 24, 2010 broadcast date and another date of June 7 does not appear for it but rather for 'suki to ietara iinoni' which is different romanized title.

Identify the rating for the episode with the most recent broadcast date by looking at the `ratings` column.\n3. Look up the rating of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (the romanized title) in the table by matching the \"episode title\" and finding the corresponding value in the \"ratings\" column.\n4. Extract the actual rating from the \"ratings\" cell, which is a percentage represented as a string (\"22.4%\").\n5. Convert the extracted rating to a numerical value by removing the \"%\" sign and dividing by 100: 22.4 / 100 = 0.224\n6. Now that we have both ratings (0.224 for \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" and x for the episode with the most recent broadcast date), subtract the first rating from the second to find the difference in ratings: x - 0.224.\n7. Look up the row of the cell containing the most recent broadcast date to determine which cell contains this value (this value will be at index 4, since we're counting the rows starting at 1).\n8. Extract the rating from this value and store it in variable y\n9. Compute the percentage difference by dividing the difference between x and 0.224 by the original value of x: ((x - 0.224) / x) * 100.\n10. Check if the computed difference is greater than or equal to 3.2% to determine whether the claim is true.\n\nLet's look at which row corresponds to a May date in this table, as that would be our most recent one: \n\nMay 24 and May 31 corresponded to \"\u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\" (index 3) and \"\u3053\u3093\u306a\u306b\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u2026\" (index 4), respectively. We can see that \"\u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\" was the earlier one.\n\nNext, we can determine the column name for ratings: it is \"ratings\".

The corresponding values are:\n\n\"broadcast date\" (index 2) = June 14, 2010\n\"ratings\" (index 1) = 13.4%\n\nNext, we can determine the column name for \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\": it is \"romanized title\". This means our original table has a cell with romanized data at index [3][2].\n\nNow let's look up the value of y in index 3. The corresponding values are:\n\n\"romanized title\" (index 2) = fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\n\"ratings\" (index 1) = 15.6%\n\nNext, we can compute the difference between x and 0.224: 13.4 - 0.224.\n\nNow let's compute the percentage difference ((x - 0.224) / x) * 100:\n((13.4 - 0.224) / 13.4) * 100 = (13.176) / 13.4 * 100 = 98.86%\n\nFinally, we can compare our computed value to the specified percentage of 3.2%:\n\n98.86 % is greater than 3.2%\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Find the most recent broadcast date from the table by looking at the `broadcast date` column.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Identify the rating for the episode with the most recent broadcast date by looking at the `ratings` column.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Look up the rating of \\\"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\\\" (the romanized title) in the table by matching the \\\"episode title\\\" and finding the corresponding value in the \\\"ratings\\\" column.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Extract the actual rating from the \\\"ratings\\\" cell, which is a percentage represented as a string(\\\"22.4%\\\").\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Convert the extracted rating to a numerical value by removing the \\% sign and dividing by 100: 22.4 / 100 = 0.224\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Now that we have both ratings (0.224 for \\\"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\\\" and x for the episode with the most recent broadcast date), subtract the first rating from the second to find the difference in ratings: x - 0.224.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Look up the row of the cell containing the most recent broadcast date to determine which cell contains this value (this value will be at index 4, since we're counting the rows starting at 1).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Extract the rating from this value and store it in variable y\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Compute the percentage difference by dividing the difference between x and 0.224 by the original value of x: ((x - 0.224) / x) * 100.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Check if the computed difference is greater than or equal to 3.2% to determine whether the claim is true.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"ratings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"romanized title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the lowest rated episode\nTo compare ratings, we first need to identify the episode with the lowest rating. We can do this by looking at the table and finding the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Extract the value of the lowest rated episode\nNow that we have identified the row with the smallest value, we can extract its rating. This will be used as a reference point to compare the ratings of other episodes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\",\n    \"Extract the rating of that row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare suki to ietara iinoni's rating\nNext, we need to compare the rating of the specified episode ('suki to ietara iinoni') with the lowest rated episode. If it is higher by at least 5.8%, then the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\",\n    \"Extract the rating of that row\",\n    \"Compare suki to ietara iinoni's rating with the lowest rated episode's rating\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Extract suki to ietara iinoni's rating\nNow we extract the actual value of suki to ietara iinoni's rating from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\",\n    \"Extract the rating of that row\",\n    \"Compare suki to ietara iinoni's rating with the lowest rated episode's rating\",\n    \"Extract suki to ietara iinoni's actual rating\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the comparison\nNow that we have both ratings, we can evaluate whether suki to ietara iinoni has a 5.8% higher rating than the lowest rated episode.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\",\n    \"Extract the rating of that row\",\n    \"Compare suki to ietara iinoni's rating with the lowest rated episode's rating\",\n    \"Extract suki to ietara iinoni's actual rating\",\n    \"Evaluate whether suki to ietara iinoni has a 5.8% higher rating\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Determine the answer\nAfter evaluating the comparison, we can determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\",\n    \"Extract the rating of that row\",\n    \"Compare suki to ietara iinoni's rating with the lowest rated episode's rating\",\n    \"Extract suki to ietara iinoni's actual rating\",\n    \"Evaluate whether suki to ietara iinoni has a 5.8% higher rating\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Output the answer\nNow that we have finished all the steps, we can output our final answer in the required format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode with the lowest rating\",\n    \"Find the row with the smallest value in the 'ratings' column\",\n    \"Extract the rating of that row\",\n    \"Compare suki to ietara iinoni's rating with the lowest rated episode's rating\",\n    \"Extract suki to ietara iinoni's actual rating\",\n    \"Evaluate whether suki to ietara iinoni has a 5.8% higher rating\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"ratings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"ratings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
