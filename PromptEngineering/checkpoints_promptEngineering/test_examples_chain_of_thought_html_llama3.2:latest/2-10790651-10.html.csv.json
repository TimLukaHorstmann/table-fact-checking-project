    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to determine if Geelong scored the most points on the day. To do this, we need to find out how many points each team scored.\n\n2. We look at the table and see that for each match, there is a column labeled \"home team score\". However, these scores seem to be in a non-standard format (e.g., 26.16 (172)), indicating that they are not just numeric values but rather a way of expressing points scored.\n\n3. In Australian Rules football, the scoring system is based on goals and behinds. A goal is worth 6 points, while a behind is worth 1 point. Therefore, we can convert each score into its equivalent number of points.\n\n4. We look at Geelong's score: 26.16 (172). This means they scored 26 goals and 16 behinds, for a total of 162 points (26 * 6 + 16 * 1 = 162).\n\n5. To determine if this is the highest score on the day, we need to compare it with all other scores in the table.\n\n6. We can start by comparing it with each match at Corio Oval: The first row indicates that Geelong scored 172 points against North Melbourne at Corio Oval.\n\n7. Looking through the remaining rows, no team appears to have scored more than 172 points against any of their matches at Corio Oval.\n\n8. Since there is only one instance where a team scored 172 points on this specific match day and that was Geelong, we can deduce the truth value of our claim.\n\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Geelong scored the most point of the day with 26.16 (172) in their match at corio oval.
