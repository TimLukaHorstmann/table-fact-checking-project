However, there are multiple instances of other teams having 6-0 victories over their opponents, which indicates that this margin of victory is indeed possible.\n\n5. **Identify potential matches with a 6-0 margin of victory**:\n   - Find Row 12, where Crystal Palace defeats Everton by 6 goals.\n   - Also find Rows 13 and 15 where Chelsea and Southport each defeat Arsenal and Blackpool respectively by 6 goals.\n\n6. **Determine which match has the biggest margin of victory**: Although multiple teams achieve a 6-0 margin of victory over their opponents, to determine if it's true that Everton defeating Tottenham Hotspur is the largest such margin, we must check if any other matches are larger than this one.\n   - Since no team beats another by 7 or more goals in the table provided (besides Crystal Palace beating Everton), we can conclude the claim as likely being false based on this fact.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given that multiple teams achieve a 6-0 margin of victory, but there isn't any record of an even larger margin for Everton defeating Tottenham Hotspur, it is reasonable to assume the claim is not entirely true.

A shut-out occurs when only one team scores, and the other team does not score at all.\n\nFrom the table, the games where one team was shut out are:\n- Birmingham 2 - 0 (Port Vale)\n- Bury 1 - 2 (Exeter City)\n- Watford 2 - 0 (Brighton & Hove Albion)\n- Blackburn Rovers 5 - 1 (Bristol Rovers)\n- Bolton Wanderers 1 - 1 (Sunderland) -> This game is not a shut-out, as both teams scored.\n- Grimsby Town 1 - 0 (Manchester United)\n- West Bromwich Albion 1 - 0 (Tottenham Hotspur)\n- Sheffield United 4 - 1 (Notts County)\n- Barnsley 2 - 1 (Sheffield Wednesday) -> This game is not a shut-out, as both teams scored.\n- Brentford 0 - 1 (Portsmouth)\n- Bradford City 0 - 0 (Wolverhampton Wanderers) -> This game was a draw, so it's not counted as one team being shut out.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Claim\nNow we need to count how many games were identified where one team was shut out.\n\nGames with one team shut out:\n- Birmingham\n- Grimsby Town\n- West Bromwich Albion\n- Sheffield United\n\nThere are 4 games where one team was shut out. The claim states that there should be 7 such games, but our analysis shows that only 4 do not have any relevant data in the table.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze Claim Further and Conclusion\nUpon reviewing again, we noticed a few more instances of teams being shut out - Crystal Palace (0-6 Everton), Chelsea (2-1 Arsenal) is not one team being completely shutout. Only Crystal palace was, Bradford park avenue and southport (2-1) also were.\n\nGames with one team shut out:\n- Birmingham\n- Grimsby Town\n- West Bromwich Albion\n- Sheffield United\n- Crystal Palace\n\nThere are 5 games where one team was shut out.\n\n#### Step 5: Final Answer\nNow that we have verified the claim, we can give our final answer.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Understand the Claim\\nStep 2: Identify Games Where One Team Was Shut Out\\nStep 3: Verify the Claim\\nStep 4: Analyze Claim Further and Conclusion\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Observe the table structure\nThe table has 16 rows, each representing a game. The columns include tie number, home team, score, away team, and date.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the scoring system\nIn each row, the score is represented as \"home team - away team\". For example, in the first row, Birmingham scored 2 goals against Port Vale.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the condition for a game to have more than 2 goals\nA game has more than 2 goals if either the home team or the away team scores more than 2 goals. We need to find out if this condition is met in only 5 games.\n\n#### Step 4: Examine each row of the table\nWe will go through each row of the table and check if the condition is met for that game.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze rows 1-3\nIn these three games, Birmingham scored 2 goals against Port Vale, Bury scored 1 goal against Exeter City, and Watford scored 2 goals against Brighton & Hove Albion. No team has more than 2 goals in these games.\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze rows 4-5\nIn these two games, Blackburn Rovers scored 5 goals against Bristol Rovers and Bolton Wanderers scored 1 goal against Sunderland. In the first game, Blackburn Rovers have more than 2 goals. We need to check if this is one of the \"only 5\" games.\n\n#### Step 7: Analyze rows 6-10\nIn these five games, Grimsby Town scored 1 goal against Manchester United, West Bromwich Albion scored 1 goal against Tottenham Hotspur, Sheffield United scored 4 goals against Notts County, Barnsley scored 2 goals against Sheffield Wednesday, and Brentford scored 0 goals against Portsmouth. No team has more than 2 goals in these games.\n\n#### Step 8: Analyze rows 11-12\nIn these two games, Bradford City scored 0 goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Crystal Palace scored 6 goals against Everton. In the first game, no team has more than 2 goals, and in the second game, Crystal Palace has more than 2 goals.\n\n#### Step 9: Analyze rows 13-16\nIn these four games, Chelsea scored 2 goals against Arsenal, Bradford Park Avenue scored 2 goals against Burnley, Southport scored 2 goals against Blackpool, and Leeds United scored 4 goals against Newcastle United. No team has more than 2 goals in three of these games.\n\n#### Step 10: Determine if the condition is met\nWe found one game (row 5) where a team (Blackburn Rovers) has more than 2 goals. We also found another game (row 16) where Crystal Palace has more than 2 goals.\n\n#### Step 11: Check if only 5 games meet the condition\nOnly two games have more than 2 goals, but we are looking for \"only 5\" games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Step 12: List relevant cells\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze each row of the table to check if the condition is met.
