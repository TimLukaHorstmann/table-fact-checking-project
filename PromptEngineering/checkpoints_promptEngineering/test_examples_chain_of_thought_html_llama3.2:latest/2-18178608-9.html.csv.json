However, it seems that the data contains two separate scores in the second column.\n\nFor the first test in Brisbane:\n- The relevant cell is: <td>22</td>\n- Row index: Not explicitly stated but can be determined as the row corresponding to Australia's first test match\n\nFor the two tests in London:\n- Relevant cell 1: <td>19</td>\n  - Column name: against\n  - Row index: Determined as the row corresponding to Australia's second test match\n- Relevant cell 2: <td>28</td>\n  - Column name: against\n  - Row index: Determined as the row corresponding to Australia's third (and last) test match\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if the claim is true or false based on the comparison\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if 22 is less than both 19 and 28.\n\nSince 22 is not greater than 19 but also not lesser in comparison with the two different scores of 19 and 28, it does not fulfill the condition of being \"less\" in a numerical sense. \n\nHowever, considering the context that we should be comparing against individual matches:\n\n- The score for Brisbane is indeed lower (22) compared to the London match (19).\n- Similarly, comparing against two separate games, the first Brisbane game had 22 points against while the London games cumulatively held 28 points.\n\nThus the claim seems false considering 'less point' should hold true for both scenarios (Brisbane vs. London individually and cumulatively).\n\n#### Step 5: Provide a JSON answer\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"<The score in Brisbane was lower than in London individually, but not cumulatively; the claim is false considering 'less point' should be true for individual games as well as cumulative scores of those games>\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
