The claim states that the lowest attendance occurs when Kettering Town faces Fulham.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's identify the relevant rows for the claim about the replay of Nottingham Forest against Derby County.\n   The claim states \"the replay of nottingham forest against derby county have a lower attendance than when they tie\", so we need to find the row where the home team is 'nottingham forest' and the away team is 'derby county'. \n\n2. In the table, the relevant rows are:\n   - Row 15: This is the initial match between Nottingham Forest and Derby County.\n     - Attendance = 32035\n   - Row 16: This is the replay of the same match.\n     - Attendance = 29001\n\n3. Now, let's compare these two attendances to determine if they are lower or not:\n\n- The attendance for row 15 (initial match) is higher than that of row 16 (replay).\n\n4. Since we need to check if the attendance in the replay ('replay' row) is lower than when Nottingham Forest and Derby County tie, we also need to identify all other rows where 'nottingham forest' and 'derby county' appear together as teams.\n\n5. Upon inspecting the table, there's no other instance of 'nottingham forest' and 'derby county' appearing together as teams in any match except for the replay.\n\n6.

However, to confirm if 5006 is indeed the highest attendance, we need to verify if Kettering Town's attendance matches this number.\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the given problem:\n\n1. To determine if the claim about the replay of Nottingham Forest against Derby County has the highest attendance than when they tie, we need to find the attendance values for both scenarios.\n\n2. Let's start by finding the attendance value for the original match between Derby County and Nottingham Forest (match 15). The relevant cell is:\n   ```html\n<tr>\n    <td>15</td>\n    <td>derby county</td>\n    <td>1 - 1</td>\n    <td>nottingham forest</td>\n    <td>32035</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n3. Next, we need to find the attendance value for the replay of Nottingham Forest against Derby County (replay match 16). The relevant cell is:\n   ```html\n<tr>\n    <td>16</td>\n    <td>wolverhampton wanderers</td>\n    <td>1 - 2</td>\n    <td>middlesbrough</td>\n    <td>18013</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n4. Now that we have the attendance values for both matches, let's compare them. If the attendance value of the replay match is higher than the attendance value of the original match, then the claim is true.\n\n5. Comparing the two values:\n   - Original match: 32035\n   - Replay match: 18013\n\n6. Since 32035 > 18013, we can conclude that the replay of Nottingham Forest against Derby County has a higher attendance than when they tie.\n\n7. Now let's format our answer into a valid JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if the claim about the replay of Nottingham Forest against Derby County has the highest attendance than when they tie, we found the attendance values for both scenarios (32035 for the original match and 18013 for the replay match).

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the rows that need a replay\nTo determine if the claim is true, we first need to identify the rows that need a replay. A replay indicates that there was an initial tie, and the game had to be replayed due to the rules of the competition.\n\nLooking at the table, we can see that there are two types of rewrites: \"replay\" in the row name (for matches with no initial result) and \"replay\" in a column other than \"tie no\" (for ties that did not have an initial result). We need to find all occurrences of these \"replays\".\n\n#### Step 2: List rows that need replay due to initial tie\nLooking at the table, there are six matches where the game ended in a draw without an official replay before it. These match indices are:\n- Row index: 4 (sunderland)\n- Column name: away team\n- Value: blackburn rovers\n- Row index: 6 (sheffield united)\n- Column name: away team\n- Value: charlton athletic\n- Row index: 7 (cardiff city)\n- Column name: away team\n- Value: arsenal\n- Row index: 8 (portsmouth)\n- Column name: away team\n- Value: swansea city\n- Row index: 11 (west bromwich albion)\n- Column name: away team\n- Value: burnley\n- Row index: 13 (kettering town)\n- Column name: away team\n- Value: fulham\n\n#### Step 3: Verify that there are only six matches with replay due to initial tie and compare with total number of games\nThere are a total of 16 games in the table, and we identified six matches where the game ended in a draw without an official replay before it. To verify if this is true, let's look at the \"tie no\" column to ensure that there are no more ties among these six that require replays.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify there are no additional games with replay due to initial tie\nLooking at the table, we see that for each of the initially tied games we found in step 2, there is an indication of a replay (with either \"replay\" in row name or \"replay\" in another column).
