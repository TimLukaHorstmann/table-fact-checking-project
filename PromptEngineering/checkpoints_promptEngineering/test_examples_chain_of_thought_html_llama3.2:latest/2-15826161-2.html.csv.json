We need to find the row with \"france\" in the \"nation\" column.\n\n2. **Verify the values in the row**: Once we locate the correct row, we will check if the values for gold, silver, and total are indeed 4, 1, and 8 respectively.\n\n3. **Check the year**: The claim specifies that the event took place in the \"1982 world judo championship\". We should confirm if the table contains any information about the year of the event.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (continued):\n\nSince there is no explicit mention of the year, we will assume that the table provides this information. We need to find a row with a match for \"1982\" in either the \"rank\", \"nation\", or other columns.\n\n4. **Identify the correct rank**: Since France is the country mentioned, we are likely looking for a specific ranking within the event. In this case, it's unlikely that France has a rank of 1. The top-ranked nation in the table is Germany with a rank of 3.\n\n5. **Check if there is a row matching \"france\" with correct values**: Looking at the rows again, we find that France appears in the second row, which lists gold = 4 and silver = 1, along with total = 8.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on the reasoning steps**:\n\n### Final Answer Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the relevant row in the table, Verify the values in the row, Check if there is a row matching France with correct values, Conclusion based on the reasoning steps\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We can do this by comparing the ranks of all countries.\n   - Compare rank 3 with the other ranks (rank 1 has France, rank 2 has Great Britain, etc.)\n   - Germany's rank (3) is less than the rank of Belgium (4), so we know that Germany is not in third place. However, we can still verify if it has 1 gold medal, 1 silver medal and 2 bronze medals.\n\n2. Next, let's find out how many countries have 1 gold medal, 1 silver medal and 2 bronze medals.\n   - From the table, we see that Germany indeed has 4 medals in total, with a gold value of 1, a silver value of 1 and a bronze value of 2.\n\n3. Now let's compare these numbers with those from other countries to confirm if it's actually true.\n   - Belgium also has this same combination (total=3, gold = 1, silver=1, bronze=1).\n   - We don't have Japan having more than 1 gold medal , so we can ignore that.\n\n4.
