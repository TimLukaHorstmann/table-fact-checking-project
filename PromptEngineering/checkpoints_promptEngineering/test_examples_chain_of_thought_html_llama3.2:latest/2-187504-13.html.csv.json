We need to find the number of gold medals won by each country to determine if the claim is true.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Gold Medal Counts from the Table\nWe will extract the gold medal counts for each country from the table:\n\n- Italy: 2\n- Canada: 0\n- United States (and West Germany): 2\n\nNote that we consider both the United States and West Germany as having won 2 gold medals, but this is not explicitly stated in the claim. However, based on the table, it appears that they are tied.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Claim\nThe claim states that \"Italy receive 2 more gold medal than canada do\" which implies Italy has more gold medals than Canada by exactly 2 (not necessarily \"receive\"). The second part of the claim is \"but tie with the united state and west germany\", stating there is a tie.\n\nHowever, this analysis was not accurate. Based on the data in the table, it actually reads \"tie with the United states and West Germany\". Italy has more gold medals than Canada by 2.\n\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the Claim is True\nBased on our analysis, the claim that Italy receives 2 more gold medals than Canada is true because Italy indeed won 2 more gold medals. The second part of the claim that Italy ties with both United States and West Germany is also true as they all have the same amount of gold medals.\n\n\n### Step 5: Finalize Answer\nWe can now provide a final answer to the problem.\n\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify relevant information, extract data from table, analyze claim statement, determine if claim is true or false based on extracted data and analysis, finalize answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n    ]\n}",
