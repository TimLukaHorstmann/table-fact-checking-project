Determine when Steve Yoder coached.\n   - Look at the table again, we find that Steve Yoder coached from 1982-1992 (cell with value \"128 - 165\").\n\n3. Calculate how many years after 1898 that was for Haskell Noyes coaching.\n   - If 1908 is considered the start year of his tenure and it corresponds to the start year of his coaching, then 1908-1898 = 10 years.\n\n4. Compare Steve Yoder's coaching duration to Haskell Noyes.\n   - For Steve Yoder, he coached for 10 years (from 1982-1992).\n   - For Haskell Noyes, he coached for 3 years after 1908 (1908-1911). We can now calculate that the time difference between the end of his coaching tenure and Steve Yoder's is 7 years.\n\n5. Determine if 7 years is more than 50.\n   - Since 7 > 50, we have determined that Haskell Noyes coached for less than 50 years before Steve Yoder started coaching.\n\nTherefore, our final answer should be FALSE because it was found that Haskell Noyes did not coach more than fifty years before Steve Yoder.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"<haskell noyes started in 1908 and steve yoder started in 1982.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, let's compare Walter Meanwell's overall win percentage (91%) to Stan Van Gundy's overall win percentage (48%). The claim suggests that Walter Meanwell's conference record would be better if his overall win percentage were higher than Stan Van Gundy's.\n\n2. However, the table does not provide separate conference records for each coach. Instead, it provides a total conference record and overall conference record (or win-loss records within the conference) at the end of the table.\n\n3. We need to examine if Walter Meanwell's conference record is actually better than Stan Van Gundy's based on their totals. This can be done by comparing the values in cells with column names \"conference record\" for both coaches.\n\n4. According to the table, Walter Meanwell has a total of 63 - 9 = 54 wins and losses within the conference, while Stan Van Gundy has a total of 7 - 11 = -4 wins and losses within the conference.\n\n5. Although it might seem that Walter Meanwell had more conference wins, we must consider the actual numbers to compare them accurately, as losing doesn't count as a win in this context.\n\n\n\n6. Since Walter Meanwell had 63-9 while Stan Van Gundy had 7-11 total records within the conference during their respective tenures, it appears that Walter Meanwell indeed has better win percentage than Stan Van Gundy's.\n\n7.
