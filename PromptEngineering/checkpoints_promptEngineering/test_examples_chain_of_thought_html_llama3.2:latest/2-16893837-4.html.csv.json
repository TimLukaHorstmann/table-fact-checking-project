However, we need to identify matches played by her partner or opponent. \n\nUpon inspection of each match, there is one case where a player with the name \"neuza silva\" has appeared: \n- In 2009 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group II, Frederica Piedade was paired with Neuza Silva in both her Morocco and Latvia matches.\n\n### Step 4: Identify surface type for these matches\nWe now check which surfaces were used. For Neuza Silva's opponents:\n- The Morocco match was on \"hard\".\n- Her Latvia match was also \"hard\".\n\nThis means that at least two of the four required non-clay surface matches, happened to be played on \"hard\" instead.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the relevance of these findings\nBased on our results from step 3 and 4, we conclude that Neuza Silva did indeed have more than four matches outside clay surfaces (both Morocco and Latvia matches were hard).\n\nTherefore, it appears false that she only played 4 non-clay surface matches.\n\n### Step 6: Output final answer in JSON format\n```\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"We looked for Neuza Silva's playing history.

The relevant information for the claim would be found in the 'round' column, where it says 'rr' (Round Robin) for most years but has a specific date for playoffs ('giii play-offs').\n\n4. **Find Relevant Cell Information**: In the table, we can find Neuza Silva's data by looking for rows related to 2005 and any row that mentions 'play - offs'. This would help us determine if she made it to a playoff at all in 2005.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim**: Once we have found the relevant cell(s) for 2005, we can see if Neuza Silva played in only one playoff match by checking how many times she appears in 'round' as 'giii play-offs'.
