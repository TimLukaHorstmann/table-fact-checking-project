Therefore, we should only consider the rows where the school is Texas Christian University (T.C.U.).\n\n*   Relevant row index: 3 and 4\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate William Camp's draft round and position\nWilliam Camp's information can be found in columns #2 and #3. In column #3, his position is RHP.\n\n*   Camp's round: Not available (but he was drafted in the \"no cubs - 1970\" entry)\n*   Relevant information for comparison: Round #2\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the player from T.C.U.\nFor the two players going to Texas Christian University, their round and position are given in columns #1 and #3.\n\n*   The first player's position is INF.\n*   The second player's position is 1B (or LHP for George Pugh).\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the player from T.C.U. was drafted 2 rounds after William Camp\nSince we are only considering players going to Texas Christian University, and given that there are two relevant players with different positions (INF and 1B/LHP), we can't directly apply a one-to-one comparison of \"2 rounds\" between these individuals without additional context (such as the exact round number for both). However, if we look at William Camp's row again (#2) we see his draft round is mentioned in the cell with the label \"no cubs - 1970\", so it seems like he was drafted 2nd.\n\n*   Given that there are two players going to T.C.U., and given their respective positions (INF, LHP/1B), only the second player's position can be related back to Camp's draft round. However, without knowing his actual round number (#2 has \"no cubs - 1970\" in that cell, which is an additional information) we cannot accurately state if T.C.U.'s players went exactly two rounds after him.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince the claim uses a broad term (\"be drafter\") and does not give us specific round numbers for both the player going to Texas Christian University AND William Camp's draft number, it seems that the statement is based on incomplete data.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that Pat Harrison did not sign with the Cubs in 1970.\n2. To verify this, we need to look at the table and find the relevant information.\n3. We'll start by looking at the row for Pat Harrison (row index: 1).\n4. In the \"name\" column, we see that it is indeed Pat Harrison.\n5. Now, let's look at the \"signed\" column in the same row.\n6. According to the table, Pat Harrison signed with a Cubs team in 1970, but with the note \"(no cubs - 1970)\" which suggests the opposite of what the claim states.\n7. However, upon closer inspection of the cell containing this information (column: \"signed\", row index: 2), it actually indicates that William Camp signed with a Cubs team in 1970, not Pat Harrison.\n8. So, let's correct our search to find Pat Harrison's signing information for another column.\n9. Upon re-examining the table, we see that Pat Harrison (row index: 1) has an entry in the \"signed\" column which indicates he signed with a team referred to as 'no cardinals - 1969 june'.\n10. Given that his actual name is indeed Pat Harrison and according to this row of data, we should confirm if he actually didn't sign with Cubs. So let's focus on checking if there is any evidence supporting the claim.\n\n\nGiven our analysis:\n- The statement can be confirmed as False because of \"no cardinals - 1969 june\" entry which indicates Pat Harrison signed in 1969 but we cannot disprove that it was a Cardinals related signing\n- Therefore, since there is ambiguity on whether he actually didn't sign with the Cubs in '70 or not (it can be argued that indeed did but wasn't for 'Cubs'), we have to correct our stance\n- To better confirm if Pat Harrison signed with the Cubs, let's look at column \"signed\" of row 1 and see what value it holds: \"no\"\n- Thus, as indicated by this value, the claim can be verified that indeed did sign\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1-10\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"signed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}",

This column indicates the position on a baseball field.\n\n2. Look for a row where William Camp is listed in this column. Since his position is listed as \"rhp\", which stands for right-handed pitcher, it can be inferred that he was drafted to play as a pitcher.\n\n3. Consider if other players with positions that require them to be pitchers (e.g. 1b: first baseman) could have been the last player drafted and still ended up pitching in the major leagues.\n\n4. Note that the table shows William Camp's row number (2) and his signed date (\"no cubs - 1970\"). This implies that he was indeed drafted by a team, but not necessarily as a pitcher from an early stage of his career.\n\n5. Consider if there are other players with positions that could have led to them being the last player drafted and still playing in the major leagues.\n\n6. From the table, we can see that George Pugh is listed as \"lhp\" which stands for left-handed pitcher, another position that typically means a pitcher. However, unlike William Camp, George Pugh's row number (3) is not greater than William Camp's, indicating that he may have been drafted earlier.\n\n7. Given the above information and considering other possible pitchers who could be considered to be the last player drafted before William Camp based on their position, it can be determined that William Camp would not necessarily be the last player drafted.\n\n8. However, as per rule of thumb in baseball drafts, a pitcher is typically drafted more later than an infielder or outfielder. So when looking at his row index (2) and comparing with George Pugh's row index (3), which was lower than William Camp's (the lower the number, the earlier draft position), it can be concluded that William Camp would likely be one of the last players drafted as a pitcher.\n\n9. Considering other information from the table such as his signed date (\"no cubs - 1970\"), William Camp seems to have had a relatively late start in terms of when he was drafted, which may have contributed to him being among the later picks for pitchers in that year's draft.\n\n10.

However, based on the information provided, it is likely that Pat Harrison signed with the Cardinals (as mentioned in the second row) rather than the Dodgers.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Find relevant info about Pat Harrison\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Pat Harrison's name is in the second row of the table\"},\n    {\"step\": \"The \\\"name\\\" column for row index 1 contains \\\"pat harrison\\\"\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Check if Pat Harrison signed with the Dodgers in 1969\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Look at the \\\"signed\\\" column for row index 1: \\\"no cubs - 1970\\\"\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Find another entry for Pat Harrison with a different signing date\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Pat Harrison signed with the Cardinals (as mentioned in the second row) rather than the Dodgers\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Claim Evaluation Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The claim states that only non-pitcher players were drafted last. To evaluate this, we need to identify which players were drafted as their final team.\n\n2. **Locate column \"signed\" in table**: This column contains information about the players' signing status. We are looking for players who signed after they were drafted and before being traded or released.\n\n3. **Check rows where \"signed\" shows a non-empty value**: These players likely had a non-pitcher position. We'll check if these players indeed got drafted last among all other players with different positions.\n\n4. **Identify the player's round draft number**: This tells us the order in which they were drafted, with lower numbers indicating earlier drafts.\n\n5. **Compare with other rows for same \"signed\" value and higher round number**: To ensure the claim is true, there should be no other non-pitcher players who got drafted later than these identified players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nLooking at table data:\n- For player 'pat harrison', he was drafted 1st but signed with \"no\" which means he wasn't picked last in terms of round number.\n- For William Camp, who was drafted 2nd and his team said \"no cubs - 1970\", no clear information is given about the position, so it cannot be deduced if he was indeed a non-pitcher player or not. However, he was definitely picked as one of the last rounds.\n- For George Pugh, he got drafted 3rd with the team saying 'no'. He also wasn't picked as his final round, indicating he might have been taken later in another year but this particular draft was one of the last for him.\n- There isn't enough info to conclude that William Fergusson and George Putz were indeed non-pitcher players drafted last.\n\n### Relevant Cells Analysis:\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"signed\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"signed\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"signed\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim seems to be partially true because we can't confirm all the non-pitcher players.
