    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the claim statement: \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight\". This implies that there are at least two fights involving Kelly where a technical knockout using strikes occurred.\n\n2. Next, let's look for relevant information in the table about Kelly's fights and technical knockouts by strikes.\n   - In the table, we find Kelly's record: <td>1 - 0</td>\n     This indicates that Kelly has won one fight, but does not tell us if it was a technical knockout using strikes.\n\n3. Looking at the \"opponent\", we can identify Shad Smith as the opponent in this win:\n   - In the table, we find: <td>shad smith</td>\n\n4. Since we're looking for technical knockouts by strikes, let's examine the \"method\" of the win against Shad Smith.\n   - In the table, we find: <td>tko (strikes)</td>\n     This confirms that Kelly won via a technical knockout using strikes.\n\n5. Now we know Kelly has won one fight with a KO using strikes but need to confirm if this was indeed a \"technical\" knockout for that statement to be valid.\n   - A technical knockout is often indicated when the opponent is unable to continue due to injuries sustained during the fight.\n   - Looking at the table, there isn't explicit information on how Shad Smith's injury occurred in the \"event\" column.\n\n6. Based on common terminology used in MMA (mixed martial arts), a technical knockout by strikes would be announced if it was a legitimate knockdown that left an opponent unable to continue due to strikes.\n   - Therefore, we can assume this is indeed a \"technical\" knockout as per MMA standards.\n\n7. Our next step is to verify if there are at least two such fights involving Kelly where a technical knockout by strikes occurred.\n   - Looking through the table again for other relevant information about Kelly's fights and wins:\n     - In the table, we find another win: <td>4 - 0</td>, but this loss was not due to strikes; it was a decision win.\n     - Therefore, there is only one fight involving Kelly that resulted in a technical knockout by strikes.\n\n8. Given our analysis above, since there's exactly one record of a technical knockout by strikes for Kelly's win, the claim cannot be considered TRUE as it states \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight\". However, this is due to the exact wording and not an actual dispute about data.\n\n9.

Identify the rows where Rudy Vallederas won by TKO: Looking at the table, we see that Rudy Vallederas won against Shad Smith with a TKO (strikes) in the first round.\n\n2. Check if there is any other row where Rudy Vallederas wins by TKO outside of the typical round 1: In this case, there is no other row where Rudy Vallederas wins by TKO.\n\n3. Verify that Shad Smith's win over Rudy Vallederas was indeed by TKO (strikes) and not against Kelly: We see in the table that it was indeed Shad Smith vs. Rudy Vallederas with a TKO (strikes).\n\n4. Confirm if there is any other fighter who has never lost to Rudy Vallederas or won against Kelly by third win via TKO outside of typical round 1: After checking, we find no such fighters.\n\n5. Based on the steps above, conclude that the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states that only one person (Kelly) will never have a third win come against Rudy Vallederas by TKO, but there are other instances where Shad Smith wins via TKO against Rudy.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
