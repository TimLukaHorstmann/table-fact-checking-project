    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim and what it's saying about the table.\n2. The claim states that Kardinia Park be 1 of 2 venue where the home team score be higher than the away team score. This means we need to check if there is at least one instance in the table where the home team score is higher than the away team score and if this instance occurs at Kardinia Park.\n3. Looking at the table, let's find rows where the home team score is higher than the away team score:\n   - Row 1: geelong 13.12 (90) vs hawthorn 7.6 (48)\n     - Home team score (90) is higher than away team score (48).\n   - Row 2: collingwood 12.16 (88) vs south melbourne 13.12 (90)\n     - Away team score (90) is not lower than home team score (88), so this row does not meet our criteria.\n   - ... other rows ...\n4. Now, let's check if Kardinia Park is one of the venues where this occurs:\n   - Row 1 has a match at Kardinia Park: geelong vs hawthorn.\n5. Next, we need to find at least another instance of a home team score being higher than an away team score that also occurs at the same venue (Kardinia Park) or in any other venue:\n   - Row 1 already has an example where home team's score is higher at Kardinia Park.\n6. Now let's check if there are enough instances to support our claim:\n   - We have found one instance for each of two venues: geelong vs hawthorn (at kardinia park) and no other venue with such a match, and collingwood vs south melbourne doesn't meet the condition but st kilda vs fitzroy does.\n7.

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Kardinia Park should be one of three venues where the home team's score is higher than the away team's score.\n2. **Identify Relevant Venues and Scores**: From the table, we need to check if there are any matches at Kardinia Park or other venues where the home team has a higher score than the away team.\n3. **Check Kardinia Park Venue**: Look for rows in the table with \"Kardinia Park\" as the venue and verify that the home team's score is indeed higher than the away team's score.\n4. **Identify Other Relevant Venues**: Check if there are other venues listed in the table where the home team has a higher score than the away team.\n5. **Verify Additional Matches**: Ensure that these additional matches meet the condition set by the claim and list all such relevant rows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n6. **Scan Table for Kardinia Park Match**: From the given table, we see that there is indeed a match at Kardinia Park with \"geelong\" as the home team and \"hawthorn\" as the away team. The score difference shows geelong having a higher score than hawthorn.\n7. **Scan Table for Other Venues**: Next, we need to scan the table for other matches where the home team's score is higher than the away team. Upon scanning, we find that there are at least two more such venues:\n   - \"collingwood\" vs. \"south melbourne\"\n   - \"carlton\" vs. \"essendon\"\n8. **Verify Additional Matches**: The match between \"richmond\" and \"melbourne\" does not meet the condition as the away team's score is higher.\n9. **List Relevant Rows**:\n   ```json\n[\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 0,\n        \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n      }\n    ]\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim: Kardinia Park should be one of three venues where home team score is higher than away team score\",\n    \"Identify relevant venues and scores: Check table for matches at Kardinia Park and other venues with home team having a higher score than away team\",\n    \"Check Kardinia Park venue: geelong vs. hawthorn shows geelong's score is higher\",\n    \"Identify Other Relevant Venues: collingwood vs. south melbourne, carlton vs. essendon also show home teams' scores are higher\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
