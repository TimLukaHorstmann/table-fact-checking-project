To find if Evan Tanner has the most KO wins, we need to identify all individuals with KO wins.\n2. Look at the table and filter rows where the outcome is 'KO' (or 'KO' abbreviation).\n3. From these rows, count the number of times each individual appears as the winner (i.e., the person whose opponent got knocked out).\n4. Compare this count to Evan Tanner's KO win count.\n5. If Evan Tanner has more KO wins than any other individual, then he is indeed the only person with that achievement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:**\n\n6. Since our claim specifies \"only one person\" having a KO win, we need to ensure there are no ties in the number of KO wins among different individuals.\n7. If Evan Tanner has more KO wins than anyone else and there are no other individuals with an equal or higher number of KO wins, then our claim is true.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:**\n\n8. Finally, we must verify that there are indeed no ties in the number of KO wins among different individuals.\n9. Review all individuals who have a KO win and count their wins.\n10.

First, we need to identify which fights were decided by decision (not knockout or submission) and if they took place within rounds 1-5.\n2. We can observe that there are two fights in the table where a win was awarded due to a cut, but this is not relevant to our claim since we're looking for decisions between rounds 1-5.\n3. We can focus on the rows with \"decision\" as the outcome and check if they occurred within rounds 1-5.\n4. Looking at the table, we see that fights #22, #29, #30, #32, #25, #18, and #19 were decided by decision, but only some of these decisions happen in round 1-5. \n   - Fight #19 occurs after rounds 5 (due to a 14:31 KO time), which is outside our target range.\n   - Fight #30 occurred in round 2, so this is also outside our target range.\n   - However, fights #25 (#29) and #18 occur within the desired range of round 1-5.\n\n#### Final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Fights #25 and #29 were decided by decision and occurred in rounds 1-5.

It says that all decisions are unanimous except for two, which are split.\n2. We need to find out if this is true or false based on the given data.\n3. Since there are only two types of outcomes in a fight (unanimous and split), we can use this information to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n4. Let's look at the table structure. The 'column_name' is 'decision_type', which has the following values: 'unanimous', 'split'.\n5. We need to count the number of unanimous and split decisions separately.\n6. If there are more unanimous decisions than split decisions, the claim will be false. Otherwise, it will be true.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n7.

We can see that there are more unanimous decisions than split decisions.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n9. However, the claim states \"all be unanimous except 2 , which be split\".

From the given table, we see:\n- Row 14 has a win for Guy Mezger against Jerry Bohlander with a KO due to cut.\n- Row 13 shows another win for Guy Mezger against Jeremy Screeton with a submission via knees.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if the duration matches\nSince the problem doesn't explicitly state how long the fight was, we must rely on common knowledge about this event. The West Coast NHB Championships 1 took place in Los Angeles and Guy Mezger won against Jeremy Screeton in just 0:16 minutes. This suggests that the time mentioned could be an error or a typo since fights are usually much longer.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate if round 4 matches\nFor Row 13 (Guy Mezger vs. Jeremy Screeton), the fight was over before the fourth round started, so it doesn't match the \"round 4\" part of the claim.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven that there's no row with Guy Mezger winning in exactly Round 4 and lasting for 5 minutes, we can conclude that this specific event does not happen as claimed.
