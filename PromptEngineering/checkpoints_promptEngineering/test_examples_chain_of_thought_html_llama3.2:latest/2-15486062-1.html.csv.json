Therefore I will only look at rows with Washington Redskins' opponent being \"Washington Redskins\" or \"Cowboys\".\n\n   In row 12 we see a match-up between Washington Redskins and Washington Redskins while their attendance was high at 85112, so this must be a home match.\n\n   Similarly for row 5 there is a match between Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys. For the other rows of \"Washington Redskins\" with opponent as 'Cowboys', I can not verify whether it's a win or loss since only results are given which have been a loss in most cases.\n\n\n\n2. **List all losses suffered by the Washington Redskins**: To confirm if the Redskins lost two times to the Cowboys, we need to find out how many times they lost.\n\n   From row 5, we see that Washington Redskins lost against Dallas Cowboys with result 'l 9 - 7'.\n\n   From row 12, we see that Washington Redskins won their match-up.\n\n   Therefore from above steps, it is clear that the redskins have lost only one game to cowboys.\n\n\n\n3. **Compare number of losses with claim**: Since the Redskins lost only one time to Cowboys in 2001, this contradicts the given statement in claim and hence makes it FALSE.\n\n\n\n4. **List relevant cells for verification**:\n\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 5,\n     \"column_name\": \"result\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 12,\n     \"column_name\": \"result\"\n   }\n\nSo, here is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"List all games played by the Washington Redskins in 2001, List all losses suffered by the Washington Redskins, Compare number of losses with claim and List relevant cells for verification\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we compare the given claim (\"the lowest attendance figure for a game be 61521\") with our findings from the table to confirm if the attendance figures are indeed less than or equal to 61521.\n   - We find that some of the attendance figures in the table are indeed 61521 or lower.\n\n3. To confirm the accuracy of the claim, we need to check whether there's a cell with an attendance figure strictly higher than 61521.\n   - Upon checking, we find that there is at least one attendance figure (in row=16, column=\"attendance\") equal to 64366 which is greater than 61521.\n\n4. After verifying the claim by examining all relevant cells, we conclude whether the claim is true or false based on our findings.\n   - Since we found a cell with an attendance figure higher than the claimed value of 61521, the claim must be false.\n\n5. We list the specific cells that were used to verify our conclusion:\n   - Relevant Cells: [{\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n\n6.

To verify this, we need to find the highest point score in the table provided.\n3. Looking at the \"result\" column, we see that there are several games with scores that could potentially be higher than 36 (e.g., 32-21, 40-18, etc.).\n4. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the game between Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Philadelphia Eagles has a score of 10-6.\n5. Comparing this to other scores, such as 32-21 or 40-18, it's clear that 36 is not the highest point score in any single game.\n6. However, there is one more value in the \"result\" column that we need to verify - the score of 29-3.\n7. Let's take a closer look at this game and confirm if indeed, 29 is the highest point score by any team in a single game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. Looking at the \"result\" cell for week 14, we see that the score is indeed 29-3.\n2. We can verify this value by comparing it to other scores in the table.\n3. Upon reviewing the table again, we find that there are no higher point scores than 36 (e.g., there's a score of 32-21).\n4. However, the highest score found is indeed 29, which does not confirm our initial assumption.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince we have verified that 29 is the highest point score by any team in a single game and it's lower than 36, the claim \"the most point score by any team in a single game be 36\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified that the highest point score found was indeed 29-3 for week 14, which is lower than 36.
