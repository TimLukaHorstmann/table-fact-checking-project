    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will sort the table by the \"song\" column to find the longest song title.\n2. Next, I will compare the lengths of the song titles before and after the longest one to verify that the winner indeed has the longest song title.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Continued:\n\n3. The sorted table by the \"song\" column is as follows:\n```\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe table table-striped\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>song</th>\n      <th>draw</th>\n      <th>artist</th>\n      <th>televote / sms</th>\n      <th>place</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>crazy</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>mariana popova</td>\n      <td>8.45%</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>everlasting</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>stefan dobrev</td>\n      <td>1.16%</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>illusion</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>krassimir avramov</td>\n      <td>55.52%</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>get up</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>stefan ilchev</td>\n      <td>2.95%</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>ready for love</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>ivelina</td>\n      <td>2.53%</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>vrag</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>grafa</td>\n      <td>3.91%</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>don't kiss for the money</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>sahara</td>\n      <td>3.20%</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>nyama vreme</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>danny milev</td>\n      <td>2.39%</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>one lifetime is not enough</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>poli genova</td>\n      <td>11.74%</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>it 's not right</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>nora</td>\n      <td>5.75%</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>razstoyaniya</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>moto</td>\n      <td>0.37%</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n4. Comparing the lengths of the song titles before and after the longest one:\n   - The longest song title is \"illusion\" with a length of 9.\n   - The second longest song title is \"crazy\" with a length of 5.\n5. Since the winner indeed has the longest song title (\"illusion\"), I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was sorted by the 'song' column to find the longest song title. The lengths of the song titles before and after the longest one were compared to verify that the winner indeed has the longest song title.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Song Titles\n\nFirst, we need to identify which song titles are in English. We can do this by examining each row in the \"song\" column of the table.\n\n### Step 2: Check Each Row's \"song\" Column\n\nWe will check each row's \"song\" column and determine if it is an English title or not. If it is, we add that to our list of English titles.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of English Titles Found\n\nAfter checking all rows, we count how many English song titles were found in the table.\n\n### Step 4: Check if There are at Least Two English Song Titles\n\nAccording to the claim, \"2 song title be in english\". This implies that there must be at least two songs with English titles. We will check if this condition is met by counting the number of English titles we found in step 3.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Answer Based on the Count\n\nBased on the count from step 4, we can determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n]\n```\n\nNow that we have explained the reasoning steps, let's proceed to execute them.\n\n### Chain of Thought:\n\n1. Check each row in the table for English song titles.\n2. The song title \"get up\" is found at row 0 and it's an English title.\n3. The song title \"razstoyaniya\" is found at row 1 and it's not an English title.\n4. The song title \"one lifetime is not enough\" is found at row 2 and it's an English title.\n5. We continue checking rows until we have checked all of them.\n6. After checking all rows, we count how many English titles were found. In this case, only two English titles are found (\"get up\" and \"one lifetime is not enough\").\n7. Based on the count, we determine that there are at least two English song titles.\n\n### Answer:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Check each row in the table for English song titles; the song title get up is an English title; after checking all rows, only 2 English titles are found which meets the condition of having at least 2 songs with English titles\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n    ]\n}",
