    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the year range specified in the claim (1990 to 2009) and focus on the table data for that period.\n2. Look at the winning team column for each row within this year range:\n   - Row with \"1990\" contains \"united states\".\n   - Row with \"1992\" contains \"europe\".\n   - Rows with \"1994\", \"1996\", and \"1998\" contain \"united states\".\n   - Row with \"2000\" contains \"europe\".\n   - Rows with \"2002\", \"2003\", \"2005\", \"2007\", and \"2009\" contain \"united states\".\n\n3. Count the number of times \"united states\" appears as the winning team within this range:\n   - The count is 8.\n\n4. Since the claim states that the united state team won 8 of the solheim cup starts in 1990 and the last be in 2009, verify if all the winning years fall within the specified date range (1990-2009).\n   - All the winning years (1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009) are indeed within this date range.\n\n5. However, since the claim specifies exactly 8 winning years but we've counted 11, we must conclude that the claim is incorrect.\n\n6. Now list all relevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\":\n   ```\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"}\n]\n```\n\nHere's the JSON output based on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Focus table data for year range specified in claim (1990 to 2009).

From the table, we can see that in the year 1998, the Solheim Cup was hosted at Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA which is within the United States. So we exclude this instance from our count.\n\n3. We then look for instances where the venue is outside of the United States: \n    - In 2007, the venue is Halmstad GK in Sweden.\n    - In 1992, the venue is Dalmahoy Country Club in Scotland.\n    - In 1994, the venue is The Greenbrier in West Virginia, USA (wait, this one is a tie) but we will keep it because is was outside of US at first.\n    - In 2005, the venue is Crooked Stick Golf Club in Indiana, USA (again, wait, same situation) so, exclude this instance from our count\n    - In 1996, the venue is St. Pierre Golf & Country Club in Wales.\n    - We must search for at least 4 more instances outside of US \n     - In 2011, the venue is Killeen Castle Golf Resort, Ireland.\n\n4.

Since there are at least 6 instances (5+1) between 1990-2013, where the Solheim Cup was hosted outside of the United States, we need to verify that all of these dates meet this requirement.\n\n6. In our current count, for the year 2007 and 2011 there is only one instance outside US so far (2 total), in 1994 it has one instance outside US so now two instances(3 total), same thing with 1992 which now has three (4 total) and finally, for 1996 which gives us four instances.\n\n7. Now we need to verify if the year 2000 meets this requirement too.\n- In the year 2000 the venue is Loch Lomond Golf Club in Scotland so it does meet the requirements.\n\n\n\nStep 8: If all instances were correctly accounted for, our final answer would be:\n\n{\n\"chain_of_thought\": \"Verify that there are at least 6 instances of the Solheim Cup being hosted outside of the United States between 1990-2013, excluding those in the United States.

We need to find their respective years of winning the Solheim Cup.\n\n#### Step 2: Find Patty Sheehan's year of winning the Solheim Cup\nWe will look for the row with Patty Sheehan in the \"winning team\" column and check if she was the captain by looking at the \"usa captain\" or \"europe captain\" columns.

First, let's determine which years between 1990-2013 have a winning team from the United States.\n\nLooking at the table, we see that there are four instances where the winning team is from the United States:\n- 2007 (year = 2009, row_index = 2)\n- 2005 (year = 2006, row_index = 4, but it's not in our range. We should ignore it)\n- 2002 (year = 2003, row_index = 5, but it's not in our range. We should ignore it)\n- 1998 (year = 1999, row_index = 7, but it's not in our range. We should ignore it)\n- 1990 was given as a start and thus we add the years 2011 (year = 2012, row_index = 3) and 2009 to the list.\n \nThe relevant winning cells are:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"winning team\"\n}, {\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"winning team\"}\n, {\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"winning team\"}\n\n\n\n2.
