    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**: We need to find the margin of victory for each district and compare them with David Thomas's victory over Andrew McCord.\n\n2. **Find largest margin of victory**:\n   - In the table, we see that there are two instances where the margin of victory is given (as a percentage).\n     - The first instance is for Joshua Sands (F) vs John Broome (DR), where Sands won with 51.3% and Broome lost with 48.7%.\n     - The second instance is for David Thomas (DR) vs John Williams (R), where Thomas won with 64.1% and Williams lost with 35.9%.\n\n3. **Compare margins**:\n   - For Joshua Sands, the margin of victory is 51.3% - 48.7% = 2.6%.\n   - For David Thomas, the margin of victory is 64.1% - 35.9% = 28.2%.\n\n4. **Determine which claim is TRUE**:\n   - Since 28.2% (David Thomas's margin of victory) is greater than 2.6% (Joshua Sands' margin of victory), the claim \"the largest margin of victory be by David Thomas over Andrew McCord\" is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells**:\n   - For this problem, we need to identify the rows and columns that contain the relevant data.\n     - The relevant cells are:\n       * Row 12, Column 4: contains David Thomas's year of first election\n       * Row 6, Column 4: contains Andrew McCord's year of first election (not necessary for this problem)\n       * Row 12, Column 5: contains the result of David Thomas's election against John Williams\n       * Rows 2 and 3, Columns 6: contain the results of Joshua Sands' and Andrew McCord's elections respectively\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify relevant data.
