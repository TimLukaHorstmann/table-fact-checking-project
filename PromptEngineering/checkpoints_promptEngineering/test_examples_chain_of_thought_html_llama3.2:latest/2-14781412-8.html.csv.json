    "resp": "Here are the steps for determining whether the claim about equestrian events at the Asian Games happens every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990:\n\n1. First, we need to check if the claim mentions any specific years or intervals of time when equestrian events occur.\n   - Relevant row index: 1\n   - Column name: year\n\n2. Next, let's verify that there are indeed equestrian events at the Asian Games from 1982 to 2010. This can be done by checking if the location 'new delhi' is present in any of these years.\n   - Relevant row index: [2, 4]\n   - Column name: location\n\n3. Now, we should check which equestrian events occur every 4 years from 1982 to 2010. We can do this by calculating the year difference between consecutive rows with equestrian events and checking if it's always equal to 4.\n   - Relevant row indices: [1, 3], [2, 6], [3, 7], [4, 8], [5, 9]\n   - Column name: year\n\n4. After that, we need to check the claim that there is an exception for the year 1990.\n   - Relevant row index: \n   - Column name: \n\nNow, let's determine if all equestrian events occur every 4 years and where the exception lies. The calculation of the difference between consecutive rows with equestrian events shows that it varies:\n- [1986 - 1982] = 4\n- [1994 - 1986] = 8\n- [2002 - 1994] = 8\n- [2010 - 2002] = 8\nSince the difference is not always equal to 4, we cannot determine that all equestrian events occur every 4 years. However, the claim also states an exception for the year 1990.\n\n5. To find where the exception lies, let's check if there was a equestrian event in 1990.\n   - There is no row with '1990' as the location or gold/silver/bronze medal winner.\n\n\nAfter verifying that there is indeed an exception and determining its location, we can answer the claim:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The chain of thought involved checking if equestrian events occur every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990.

Check if there is an equestrian athlete or team mentioned in those specific years.\n\nLet's analyze the table based on this step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- First row: This row contains information about Nadia al - Moutawaa from 1982 and doesn't have \"equestrian\" as any of its values. Therefore, the relevant cells for the equestrian event are not found in the first row.\n- Second row: Takashi Tomura is an equestrian athlete and represents a relevant year (1986).\n- Third row: Konoshin Kuwahara and Natya Chantrasmi represent Hiroshima in 1994, but there is no mention of them being equestrians. \n- Fourth row: Jin Kanno represents Bangkok in 1998 and is not mentioned as an equestrian.\n- Fifth row: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski from Busan in 2002 does not represent the equestrian event, she's a figure skater.\n- Sixth row: Ali Yousuf Al - Rumaihi represents Doha in 2006 and is not mentioned as an equestrian either.\n- Seventh row: Ramzy Al Duhami represents Guangzhou in 2010, but there is no mention of him being an equestrian.\n\nNow, we can analyze the claim based on our analysis:\nThe first two years mentioned in the table, (1982 and 1986) do not have any data. The year 1994 does not have equestrian information and neither does 1998 or 2006 or 2010.\n\nHowever, we did find that 1986 corresponds to Takashi Tomura as an equestrian athlete in the table.

This decision is based on the fact that no evidence of South Korea hosting equestrian events at the Asian Games in Incheon could be found.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nGiven our analysis:\n\n- **Seoul** (row 2) and **Doha** (row 6) are both confirmed to host equestrian events for South Korea.\n- There is insufficient information or evidence provided in the table that indicates South Korea hosted equestrian at more than one Asian Games event besides Seoul and Doha.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\", \"value\": \"Seoul\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\", \"value\": \"Doha\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\", \"value\": \"Seoul\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\", \"value\": \"Doha\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Conclusion:\n\n    Since there's no indication of Seoul hosting equestrian for more than one time, we can conclude that South Korea wasn't the only country to host equestrian at the Asian Games more than once, even if they did have multiple instances in Seoul and Busan.\n7.  Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the claim: The claim states that South Korea was the only country to host equestrian at the Asian Games more than one time, specifically in Seoul twice. Next, locate relevant data: We need to find out how many times South Korea hosted equestrian at the Asian Games and verify if it's indeed a record held by Seoul alone. Find relevant information: Let's take a closer look at our table. The location column tells us that South Korea was present twice in Seoul (in years 1986 & 2002), and also once in Busan (2002). Extract relevant data from the table: \\n\\n <tr>   <td>1986</td>   <td>seoul</td>   <td>takashi tomura</td>   <td>shuichi toki</td>   <td>ryuzo okuno</td> </tr> \\n\\n  <tr>   <td>2002</td>   <td>busan</td>   <td>mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski</td>   <td>lee jin - kyung</td>   <td>tadayoshi hayashi</td> </tr> \\n\\n  Finally, verify claim: South Korea was present in Seoul twice, as required by the claim. Conclusion: Since there's no indication of Seoul hosting equestrian for more than one time, we can conclude that South Korea wasn't the only country to host equestrian at the Asian Games more than once, even if they did have multiple instances in Seoul and Busan.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"year\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"location\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
