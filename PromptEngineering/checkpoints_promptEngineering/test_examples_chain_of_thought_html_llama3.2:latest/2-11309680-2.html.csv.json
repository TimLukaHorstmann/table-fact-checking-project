Next, we need to find out how many games were played by the Cowboys at Texas Stadium.\n3. We can do this by looking at each row in the table and checking if the opponent's team name matches with a football team known to play with Dallas Cowboys (like Washington Redskins, Houston Oilers etc.) since Cowboys are part of the NFC East division and play with other teams from the same division.\n\nLet us list some teams that played against Cowboys during that period:\n- Washington Redskins \n- New Orleans Saints\n- Pittsburgh Steelers\n- Philadelphia Eagles\n\nNow we need to check if there is a game where one of these teams are playing against Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium.\n\n4. Check each row in the table for games where team name matches with a football team from the above list and whose match is played at Texas stadium.\n\n5. We will output a final answer after analyzing all rows from step 4.\n\nLet us start checking rows one by one:\n\n- Row 1 (Dallas Cowboys vs Pittsburgh Steelers): The game was not played at Texas Stadium, but rather at Texas Stadium as per the table itself.\n  \n- Row 2: Washington Redskins are playing against Dallas Cowboys at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and it is a win for cowboys.\n\n- Row 5 and row 6: Houston Oilers (Tennessee Titans) play Dallas Cowboys at Astro Dome.\n\n- Row 7: New Orleans Saints play Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium, which matches our criteria.\n\n- There are no other games played between teams like Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Redskins or Pittsburgh Steelers against the Cowboys that took place in Texas stadium. \n\nNow we can conclude based on this analysis:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First identify football team name from claim and check each row to find if any team plays Dallas cowboys at Texas stadium.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The claim states that the Cowboys lost 6 consecutive games from Week 2 through Week 7.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant cells in the table**:\n   - To verify this claim, we need to find the Cowboys' results for Weeks 2-7.\n   - Specifically, we're interested in the \"opponent\" column to identify the teams they played against during these weeks.\n   - Additionally, we'll look at the \"result\" column to see if they lost each of those games.\n\n3. **Check Week 2**:\n   - In Week 2, the Cowboys played St. Louis Cardinals.\n   - According to the table, the result was a win (24-7), not a loss.\n\n4. **Assess the claim**: Since the Cowboys won Week 2's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, there are only 5 weeks between Week 2 and Week 7 that we need to examine for consecutive losses.\n\n5. **Analyze Weeks 3 through 7**:\n   - In Week 3, the Cowboys played Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n   - The result was a win (14-9).\n   - This contradicts our claim of 6 consecutive losses from Week 2 to Week 7.\n\n6. **Further analysis is not needed**: \n     Given that we've found an instance where the Cowboys did not lose, there's no need to continue checking all the remaining weeks since one week refutes the entire claim.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by looking at Week 2 and finding it is a win for the Cowboys against St. Louis Cardinals; this means that after Week 2, we do not need to examine other weeks because even if there were losses afterwards, our claim of six consecutive game losses was already disproven.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",
