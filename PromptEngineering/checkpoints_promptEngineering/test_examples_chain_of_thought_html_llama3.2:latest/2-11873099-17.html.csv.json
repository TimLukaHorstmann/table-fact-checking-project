Looking at the table, we can identify two such instances:\n\n    - Row 3: The match between Am\u00e3rica and an unspecified opponent ended in a tie (4-4).\n    - Row 6: The match between Mamelodi Sundowns and an unspecified opponent also ended in a tie (2-1).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of row 6, we notice that the score is indeed tied, but it's not clear if this counts as a \"tie\" since one side scored two goals while the other scored only one.\n\n3. **Check for any other relevant information**: We also need to verify whether there are multiple tie scores in different matches (i.e., more than one match with the same result).
