Since the problem asks about wins specifically, we should focus only on these matches to avoid counting losses or draws.\n4. Looking at the table again, we see that both of Katerina Maleeva's carpet matches were in quarterfinals (qf) rounds, not qf (first round). This suggests there was a possibility she had more than 8 wins if there are other non-recorded wins for her or in some other part of the tournament.\n5.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the cell where Nathalie Tauziet played\nWe need to identify the row index and column name of the cell that contains information about Nathalie Tauziet's match.\n\n#### Step 2: List all cells with \"nathalie tauziet\" in the row name or description\nAfter searching through the table, we can see that there are two relevant cells:\n- Row index 7, Column name \"row_name\": \"Nathalie Tauziet\"\n- Row index 10, Column name \"description\": \"Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez vs. Nathalie Tauziet\"\n\n#### Step 3: Check if any of these cells have a tie-breaker\nWe need to check if either of these cells contains the word \"tie breaker\" or has a suffix like \"_s\" indicating a tiebreaker.\n\n- Row index 7, Column name \"row_name\": No match.\n- Row index 10, Column name \"description\": \"Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez vs. Nathalie Tauziet\" does not contain \"tie-breaker\".\n\n#### Step 4: Look for cells with the word \"set\" in the row description\nSince tiebreakers are often used to decide sets that end at a tied score, we can check if there is any cell where the row name or description contains the word \"set\" and is followed by the number of sets (e.g. \"set 2-1\").\n\n#### Step 5: Find the relevant cells\nAfter re-examining the table, I did not find any relevant rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the cell where Nathalie Tauziet played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"List all cells with 'nathalie tauziet' in the row name or description\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if any of these cells have a tie-breaker\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look for cells with the word 'set' in the row description\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the relevant cells\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"row_name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"description\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
