However, given that all games mentioned in the table were played at \"Rose Garden\", it seems more relevant to focus on the row index for determining how many times this happened.\n\n#### Step 2: Count occurrences of playing at Energysolutions arena\nSince there's no indication any games involving the Portland Trail Blazers were actually played at \"Energysolutions arena\" instead of \"Rose garden\", we will look into the cell that directly shows where the game was held and see if it matches. However, since all cells state \"Rose Garden\" for the venue, we must deduce the number of times the team played there in December according to their \"record\". In other words, how many times did they win in December?\n\n#### Step 3: Review wins and losses from December\nReviewing the table indicates that the team won all games except one in December. Counting these wins gives us a total of 10.\n\n#### Step 4: Compare count to claim threshold\nThe claim states \"more than 2 times\". Since we found out there were 10 wins, which indeed is more than 2 times.\n\n#### Step 5: List relevant cells (though they all point to the same venue)\nIn this case, every cell that indicates a game was held at Rose Garden in December can be considered.

Verify if both dates meet the condition stated in the claim:\n- December 17: Yes (Roy scored 24 and was second-highest)\n- December 19: Yes (Roy scored 25 and was second-highest)\n\n6. Now, determine which date Roy was the second-highest scorer on that specific game:\n- On December 17th, Roy was third.\n- On December 19th, Roy was second.\n\n7.
