Identify relevant columns for claim analysis:\n   - Relevant column: home\n\n2. Extract relevant data from the table:\n   We are looking for rows where \"home\" is equal to \"Florida\".\n\n3. Count instances where Florida is home:\n   - Row 0 (March 2): Florida is not at home, visitor.\n   - Row 4 (March 6): Florida is at home, but this does not match March 2007-8 condition\n   - Row 5 (March 8): Florida is at home, and so is row 12, 14, 20, 22 & 25 of the same column. Hence, there are 9 instances where \"Florida\" appears as the home team in March of the specified season.\n\n4. Determine if the claim's criteria are met:\n   - According to our count, Florida indeed plays at home 9 times in March for the 2007-2008 season.\n\n5.

Florida played against Atlanta in this game.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are no rows where Florida did not play against Atlanta in the game with the lowest attendance (row 6). Therefore, since it's explicitly stated that they do, we need to look at another relevant cell - namely, the row where Florida plays Atlanta for the first time. The row where this happens can be found by finding the index of the row containing \"atlanta\" in the visitor column and then looking at the row below it.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 6,\n        \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nExplanation: The index of the row containing \"atlanta\" in the visitor column is 5. This means that the game with the lowest attendance where Florida played Atlanta is actually the one at index 6.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 7,\n        \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nExplanation: The claim is TRUE because there are no rows where Florida did not play against Atlanta in the game with the lowest attendance (at row 6). Therefore, since it's explicitly stated that they do, we need to look at another relevant cell - namely, the column decision.
