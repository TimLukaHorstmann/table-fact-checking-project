    "resp": "Step 1: Identify the relevant data for determining the ranking.\nTo determine if Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are indeed tied for fifth place, we need to examine their scores in relation to the other players' scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze scores to find Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson's positions\",\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep 2: Identify the scores of Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson.\nAccording to the table, Bob Gilder's score is 73 + 70 + 67 + 73 = 283, and Steven Richardson's score is also 283 (70 + 72 + 72 + 69).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson both have a score of 283\",\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep 3: Compare Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson's scores to the other players' scores.\nSince we need to find out if they are tied for fifth place, we must look at the overall ranking. We will compare their score of 283 with the rest of the scores in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Compare Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson's score to other players' scores\",\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep 4: Determine the ranking of Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson.\nComparing their score to the other players' scores:\n\n- John Daly's score is 276 (69 + 67 + 69 + 71), which is lower than Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson's score.\n- Bruce Lietzke's score is 279 (68 + 69 + 72 + 70), also lower.\n- Jim Gallagher Jr.'s score is 281 (70 + 72 + 72 + 67), higher.\n- Kenny Knox's score is 282 (67 + 71 + 70 + 74), also higher.\nTherefore, Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are not tied for fifth place.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson do not rank fifth\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep 5: Since Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are not tied for fifth place, no further steps are needed.\nWe have found that the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
