To do this, we will look at the \"total goals\" column in the table.\n\n2. We notice that there are two players who have a value of 27 in the \"total goals\" column: Ian Robins and Brian Stanton. However, to confirm whether they indeed have the highest number of total goals, we need to check if any other player has more than 27 goals.\n\n3. After reviewing the table, we see that there are no other players with a value greater than 27 in the \"total goals\" column. Therefore, both Ian Robins and Brian Stanton have the highest number of total goals.\n\n4. Now, we need to check if there is another player who also has the highest number of total goals. We notice that Chris Topping has a value of 0 in the \"total goals\" column.\n\n5. Since Chris Topping's value is 0 and not greater than 27, he does not have the highest number of total goals.\n\n6. However, we need to check if there are any other players with a higher number of total goals. Upon re-examining the table, we see that Dave Sutton has a value of 7 in the \"total goals\" column.\n\n7. Since Dave Sutton's value is less than 27 and Chris Topping's value is 0, neither of them has a higher number of total goals.\n\n8. Now, we can confirm that Ian Robins and Brian Stanton indeed have the highest number of total goals, which is 27.\n\n9. However, we also need to check if there are any other players who might have been overlooked due to having the same highest number of total goals. After re-checking the table, we see that there are no other players with a value greater than 27 in the \"total goals\" column.\n\n10. Since both Ian Robins and Brian Stanton have the highest number of total goals, which is 27, they do indeed meet the condition specified in the claim.\n\n11. Finally, to confirm whether there are exactly two players who meet this condition, we count the number of unique values in the \"total goals\" column that are greater than or equal to 27. There is only one value: 27. This means that there is only one player with a total goal count of 27.\n\n12.
