Now we can verify if these rounds meet the second criterion: \n- Knockout stage's Round of 16 and quarter-finals and semi-finals' draw dates are in August 2010 and March 2011 respectively\n6. Considering both criteria, since none of knockout stages' rounds have their dates in August, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The knockout stage indeed have more rounds than the group stage, but these rounds don't meet the second criterion: all of them should have draw dates in August and March.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Claim\nThe claim to be verified is: \"none of the leg of the quarter - final or semi- finals be in april 2011\"\n\n### Step 2: Find Relevant Matches\nTo verify the claim, we need to find matches for both the quarter-final and semi-final legs where April 2011 is listed as a date.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Quarter-Final Legs\nLooking at the table under the \"knockout phase\" section:\n- The first leg of the quarter-finals is scheduled on February 15 - 16, 2011.\n- There's no mention of any April 2011 dates for the quarter-final legs.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Semi-Final Legs\nSimilarly, looking at the \"knockout phase\" section under semi-finals:\n- The first leg is scheduled for April 26, 2011.\n- The second leg is also scheduled for May 3, 2011, which confirms that these are indeed April and May matches.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Outcome of the Claim\nGiven that at least one of the legs (the semi-final leg) is in April 2011, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 3 and Step 4 show that at least one leg of a quarter-final match is in April 2011.
