We need to find Tony Horacek's row index and verify if he is indeed a part of the Kelowna Wings.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate Tony Horacek in the table\nFrom the given HTML table, we can see that Tony Horacek's details are located in rows 7. Specifically, his data is in cells:\n- Column: player\n- Row Index: 7\n- Cell Value: tony horacek\n\n#### Step 3: Verify if Tony Horacek plays for Kelowna Wings\nAccording to the table, Tony Horacek's nationality is Canada and his position is left wing.
