The table shows that there are five golfers tied for third place with a score of 68.\n\n#### Step 2: Extract the scores of all players in third place\nWe will extract the scores of the three players who scored 68 and are not Tiger Woods, to determine which one scored exactly two shots better than Tiger Woods.\n\n- Fred Couples (row index 3) - score = 68\n- Luke Donald (row index 4) - score = 68\n- Retief Goosen (row index 5) - score = 68\n\nThese players are tied for third place with a score of 68. We can't determine which one scored exactly two shots better than Tiger Woods based on this information alone.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the scores of all golfers in relation to Tiger woods\nTo find out if Tiger Woods' score is only 2 shot better than the score of third place, we need to compare his score with that of third-place golfers. Since he tied on score (66) for second place and scored a full 4 strokes worse (68) from him at the three tied places below (which had scores 2 strokes higher, 68), he did not beat them by two shots; instead, he lost to them.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if Tiger Woods' score is only 2 shot better than third place\nBased on our previous step, we have already concluded that Tiger Woods scored exactly 2 strokes worse (i.e., a full 4 stroke behind him) than the three golfers who are tied for third place.

Next, let's count the total number of players who tied for third place in the tournament. This is equal to 10 since each player is given a different position as shown in their respective rows.\n\n3. Since there are 8 players who are from the United States and a total of 10 players who tied for third place, it is true that not all players who tie for third place are from the United States.\n\n4. We need to find out if there are at least 3 players from the United States in the tournament or not. From our observation earlier, we know that the number of players from the United States can be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10. However, this information is insufficient for us to determine the answer.\n\n   To get more information about it, let's look at all rows of \"country\" column.\n   Upon examining these values, we see that there are indeed more than two players who tied for third place from the United States.\n\n5.

The table shows the results of the 2005 Open Championship, including the place (position), player's name, country, score, and to par for each round.\n2.

From the table, we can see that there are 10 rounds played, with each round having a place (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) for the player at the top of the leaderboard after that round.\n4. Since the question states \"in the 2005 open championship , 10 people place better than third\", we need to count how many players have a place of 1 or 2 (i.e., places better than 3).\n5. In order to do this, I must first find out who won the tournament and who finished second. The player with the lowest score is listed in row 1 for both place \"1\" and country \"united states\". Since they share same information, it follows that the person who won is in position one and the other player in position two.\n6. Upon finding this, we can determine all players' places from first to tenth, as well as their corresponding scores and to pars. \n7.

Now we need to verify if Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal also scored 4 strokes under par and if he's the only one among them (i.e., no one else from \"United States\" scored exactly 4 under par).\n   According to row 12, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal scored 68, which means his \"to par\" is 64, not 4. He didn't meet this condition.\n\n5. Since Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal did not score 4 under par and also wasn't the only one from \"United States\", the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. Let's list all relevant cells in JSON format:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The player Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal didn't meet the condition of scoring exactly 4 strokes under par.\\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal was not from 'United States' as per the data provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
