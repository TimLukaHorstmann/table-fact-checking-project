Filter games by score:\n   ```javascript\nlet filteredGames = table.rows\n  .filter(row => Math.abs(+row.cells[8].textContent - +row.cells[9].textContent) > 10)\n```\n2. Verify existence of two such rows:\n   Since the filter function already returns a boolean value indicating whether each row meets the condition, we can simplify this step by counting the number of filtered rows.\n   ```javascript\nlet count = table.rows.filter(row => Math.abs(+row.cells[8].textContent - +row.cells[9].textContent) > 10).length;\nif (count >= 2) {\n  // Two games have scores more than 10 points apart.\n}\n```\n3.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the columns and rows of interest\nWe need to focus on the column related to crowd attendance and the row representing the highest attendance. The relevant cells are in the table where the values for each team's attendance are listed.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the smallest and largest crowd attendances\nLooking at the table, we can see that the smallest crowd attendance is found in the row \"rockies\" with a value of 38283, while the largest crowd attendance is found in the same row with the same team but has a higher value (35908). However, this cannot be correct for finding the lowest and highest values since one number should be lower than the other.\n\nRevisiting the table, we see that the \"lowest\" actual number of fans is actually located at row 23 (\"cardinals\") in column \"rockies\" which says \"13 - 4\", however looking further down, the \"lowest\" row for any team (rockies) says \"2 - 1\". Since there are teams with a higher attendance than that we can safely say that the lowest is indeed 38283.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the row with \"13 - 4\", we see it belongs to rockies. So this number is actually one of the highest attendance numbers.\n\nThe actual highest attendance belongs to rockies as well and is found in row 21 (\"rockies\") where the attendance is listed as \"13 - 4\".\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest crowd attendances\nTo find the difference, subtract the smaller attendance from the larger one. In this case, we can use the correct numbers for the lowest (38283) and highest (the number in row 21 of rockies which is \"32915\") since these are indeed the correct values.\n\nDifference = 38283 - 32915\n\nHowever we must check if there is actually a team with an attendance that is lower than 32915. By examining the table, we can see that \"rockies\" has attendance of 38283 but also \"cardinals\" with an attendance of 40029 which is indeed higher than 38283. However examining row 23 (\"cardinals\") again for \"rockies\", it says they have a lower attendance.\n\nBy checking further down the table we can see that there is indeed another team, \"rockies\", with a value less than 32915 in row 21 (32915) which belongs to them however, as stated before this was actually a higher attendance number for rockies so our original choice of row 21 still holds.\n\nWe need to now look further down the table and examine if there is indeed another team that has an attendance lower than 32915. Upon examination we find that \"rockies\" in row 20 says they have 38283 which is actually higher than 38283 - however this also cannot be correct since it belongs to rockies.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier examining further down the table for rockies shows their lowest attendance of 2-1 (which is indeed lower than 32915).\n\nThus we can safely say that our original numbers are indeed accurate and no other team has an attendance lower than 32915.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the difference\nNow, subtract the smallest crowd attendance from the largest crowd attendance.\nDifference = 38283 - 32915\n\nHowever this is not what we want. We actually need to use row 21 (\"rockies\") and row 23 (\"cardinals\") since they have attendances lower than 38283.\n\nLooking further down, however, we find row 28 (\"rockies\") which belongs to them with an attendance of \"2 - 1\".\n\nLet's do the correct calculation now.\nDifference = 38283 (the lowest attendance) - 22616 (the highest attendance)\n\nHowever this is not what we want. We actually need to calculate the difference between the actual largest crowd attendance (row 21 (\"rockies\") which says \"13-4\") and the smallest.\n\nThe correct calculation should use row 28 (\"rockies\") since it has lower attendance than row 21 (\"rockies\").\nDifference = 38283 - 22616\n\nHowever we must calculate the difference between the largest crowd attendance (row 21) (\"13 - 4\") which indeed belongs to rockies and actually does have a higher value when compared with row 28.\n\nLet's do the correct calculation now.\nWe will use the values of row 21 for \"rockies\" as they are actually the largest. And row 23 (\"cardinals\") since it has an attendance lower than that, but also actually \"lowest\" since there is no team below them in terms of attendance.\n\nSo let's calculate the difference between their values.\nDifference = 40029 - 38283\n\n#### Step 5: Output the answer in JSON format\nHere is the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Identify columns and rows related to crowd attendance\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Determine smallest and largest crowd attendances\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Calculate difference between largest and smallest crowd attendances\",\n    \"Step4\": \"Output final answer in JSON format\"\n  },\n  \"result\": {\n    \"smallest_attendance\": 38283,\n    \"largest_attendance\": 40029,\n    \"difference\": 1706\n  }\n}",

In the given table, we can look at each row in the 'September' section to find any instance of a player having a 3x loss.\n3. We notice that there's a cell with Rosales (as the player) and a win-loss record (1-1). This is an interesting point because it could imply that Rosales actually won more games than he lost during September, making his actual record not a 3x loss.\n4. In order to verify if this can be considered as \"3x loss\" we need to check what the team and other players records are for that month, however given the provided data doesn't include such information about team win-loss record or player performance metrics beyond just wins/losses, it's not possible to make an accurate determination without more context.\n5.
