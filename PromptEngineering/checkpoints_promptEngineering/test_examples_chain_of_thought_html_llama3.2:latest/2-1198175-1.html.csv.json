Find the specific row for \"Joseph Barksdale\":\n   - The relevant cell is: \n     ```html\n<td>joseph barksdale</td>\n```\n     This is in column 1, so we'll look at:\n     ```\n<td>6'4</td>\n```\n     and\n     ```\n<td>325</td>\n```\n\n3. Compare the weight (lbs) of Joseph Barksdale with all other players to verify if he's indeed the heaviest player.\n   We compare the value in column 4 for each player:\n   - arnie simkus: ```html\n   <td>michigan</td>\n   ```\n   - arnies weight is not relevant here, we are looking at will campbell and Joseph Barksdale: \n     ```html\n     <td>311</td>\n     ```\n\n4.
