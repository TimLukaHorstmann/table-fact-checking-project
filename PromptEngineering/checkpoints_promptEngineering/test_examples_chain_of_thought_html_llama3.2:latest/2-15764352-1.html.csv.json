    "resp": "#### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. The claim states that there are only two games played on grounds that play at the same time, which is one time per day.\n\n2. To verify this claim, we need to examine each row of the table to see if any ground has more than one game scheduled for the same time.\n\n3. First, let's count the number of times each ground appears in the schedule:\n   - Humber College North: 4 times\n   - Rideau Carleton Raceway: 1 time\n   - Margaret Green Park: 1 time\n\n4. Since there are more than two games played on grounds other than Rideau Carleton Raceway and Margaret Green Park, we need to verify if these additional grounds have only one game scheduled for the same time as the two mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. Examining each of these grounds further:\n   - Humber College North has 4 different times, so it does not meet the criteria of having only one game per time.\n   - Rideau Carleton Raceway and Margaret Green Park both have only one game scheduled for their respective times.\n\n6. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are more than two games played on grounds other than Rideau Carleton Raceway and Margaret Green Park.\n\n7.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find the rows where the game starts at 10:00 and 12:00. We can do this by searching for the values \"10:00\" and \"12:00\" in the table.\n\n2. For the first row, we see that the value \"toronto eagles\" is not present in the second column (time), but rather in the third column (home). However, we are looking for rows where 10:00 is actually a time of a game, which would be found in both columns.\n\n3. Let's correct our approach by examining the row with date \"2008 - 05 - 10\" and values corresponding to times \"10:00\". We can check if there exists another value for this exact date at different time slots. \n\n4. However since we are given that there is no other match of a game starting at 10:00 from the same row, we proceed to our next step.\n\n5. Next, let's consider rows where the game starts at \"12:00\". The row with values corresponding to this date exists, as well as another row for a different team playing at this exact time slot. Thus we have an instance of two games starting at 10:00 and one other instance of it being true.\n\n6. Since both instances were considered for both the 10:00 start times and that they do indeed occur on the same date, our claim is valid.\n\n7.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the rows where the first game starts at 14:00 and the second game also starts at 14:00.\n2. Looking at the table, the row for \"ottawa swans\" has a time of \"14:00\", but it's in the same position as another row with the same time.\n3. Since only one row per value can be present in the table, we need to look for any duplicate values in the columns we're interested in (time and row_index).\n4. However, there are no other rows with \"14:00\" in the time column except for \"ottawa swans\".\n5. The same applies to the row index. There is only one \"10\", \"11\", and \"12\" for 14:00 time.\n6. So we need to verify if there's a first game that starts at 14:00, and a second game also that starts at 14:00\n7. In the given table there are two rows with 14:00 time but in different row indexes (8th row index and 9th row index). This means it is plausible to have two 14:00 games.\n\nNow, let's represent our reasoning process as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to identify the rows where the first game starts at 14:00 and the second game also starts at 14:00.
