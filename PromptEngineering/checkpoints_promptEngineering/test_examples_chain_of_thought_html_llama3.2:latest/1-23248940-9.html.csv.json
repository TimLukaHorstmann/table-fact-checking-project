Since 20 is indeed higher than 10, this means that the second most rebound by a bobcat player in one game can be at least 20.\n\n4. However, we should also check if there are any other rows with a value of 20 or more for high rebounds that belong to different teams, since we need to find the exact second highest value.\n\n\n5.

List all records won and lost by the bobcats from the table.\n\nFrom step 1, we can see that the \"record\" column is located at column index 8.\n\nHere are the relevant rows to consider:\n- row 5: win (27 - 26)\n- row 6: loss (88 - 93) -> incorrect win/loss\n- row 7: win (27 - 27)\n- row 8: loss (94 - 98) -> incorrect win/loss\n- row 9: loss (93 - 102) -> correct win/loss\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"The bobcat have a record of more win than loss. We identify the column for record and list all records won and lost by the bobcats from the table. The records are 27-26, 27-27 and 24-23. Out of these three wins, two were against the same team (new orleans) which is 2 losses and thus more than the two wins.\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",
