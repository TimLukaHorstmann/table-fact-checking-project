    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Look for any match in the table where the score is 3-2, because a replay would be needed if there's a tie.\n2. Identify the row index of such a match, it could be number 3 or 7 in this case.\n3. Check if there are other matches (same team) before and after the identified match that also ended with a score of 3-2.\n4. For each match found, verify the date of the match to see if it occurred in January 1976.\n\nNow, let's list our reasoning steps:\n\n* Step 1: Look for any match in the table where the score is 3-2\n* Step 2: Identify the row index and column name for such a match. In this case, we have two matches: row 3 with home team West Bromwich Albion and row 7 with away team Newcastle United.\n* Step 3: Verify if there are other matches (same team) before and after these identified matches that also ended with a score of 3-2\n* Step 4: Since we found two such matches, verify the date for each match. Both matches were played on January 24th, 1976.\n* Step 5: Check if any other matches occurred in January 1976\n* Step 6: In our table, there are many matches that occurred before January 24th, but we can see the two matches mentioned earlier (row 3 and row 7) were played on this date.
