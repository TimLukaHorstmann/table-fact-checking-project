    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that only Fox and CBS have broadcast the NFL International Series. To verify this, we need to check which teams are listed as having played in the series.\n2. We can do this by checking the \"television\" column for each team. If a team's television network is either \"Fox\" or \"CBS\", it means they have broadcast the series.\n3. Let's look at the first row: 2007 NFL International Series - The television network listed is \"Fox\". This means Fox has broadcast the series for this game.\n4. Next, let's check the second row: 2008 NFL International Series - The television network listed is \"CBS\". This means CBS has broadcast the series for this game.\n5. We can continue checking each subsequent row to see which teams have broadcast the series. However, we notice that there are many rows with \"tba\" (to be announced) in the date column. This suggests that some of these games may not have been played or that the information is incomplete.\n6. For now, let's focus on the rows where the date is not \"tba\". We see that Fox and CBS are both listed as having broadcast the series for certain games (rows 1-3). However, we also notice that there are other teams listed in the \"designated home\" or \"designated visitors\" columns.\n7. One team, in particular, stands out: Jacksonville Jaguars. They appear in multiple rows with a non-\"tba\" date and have both Fox and CBS as their television networks for different games (rows 1-3). This suggests that they may not have broadcast the series exclusively through either Fox or CBS.\n8. After re-examining the table, I realize that my previous assumption was incorrect - Fox and CBS are indeed listed as having broadcast the NFL International Series more times than just once. However, it appears to be true at least for rows 1-3.\n9. Now let's examine other teams like Jacksonville Jaguars. There is an exception where Jacksonville did have games with a fox telecast but the other games had cbs or tba.\n10. Another thing we should look into is if Fox and CBS are the only ones to broadcast the series for all of their respective games.\n11. The claim that \"only\" Fox and CBS have broadcast the NFL International Series seems true for rows 1-3 at least.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified that Fox and CBS are listed as having broadcast the series more than once, but Jacksonville Jaguars had one fox game.

There are two rows for 2014 and three rows for 2015-2016.\n\n### Step 3: Count the occurrences in 2014\nFor 2014, there are three rows with \"Jacksonville Jaguars\" in the 'designated visitors' column.\n\n### Step 4: Count the occurrences in 2015-2016\nFor 2015 and 2016, all rows have \"Jacksonville Jaguars\" in the 'designated visitors' column.\n\n### Step 5: Sum up the counts for each year\nTotal count = 3 (from 2014) + 3 (from 2015) + 3 (from 2016) = 9\n\n### Step 6: Compare the total count to the greatest number of times any team was designated as 'designated home'\nWe need to look at other teams' counts in the table and find which is greater than 9.\n\n### Step 7: Check if there's a tie\nAfter reviewing the table, we see that no other team has been designated more than 9 times as \"designated visitors\", but some teams like San Francisco 49ers were designated home only once.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, let's identify which rows can be both home teams and visiting teams.\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there are two instances where a team appears as both the home team and the visiting team:\n   - 2014 (September): Chicago Jaguars vs Pittsburgh Steelers \n     * row_index: 1, column_name: 'designated visitors' = Pittsburgh Steel\n   * row_index: 2, column_name: 'designated home' = Minnesota Vikings\n   - However, given that in the table \"Jacksonville\" is written as \"Jaguars\", the above case actually refers to Chicago Jaguars vs. Pitts-burg Steelers.\n3. Next, let's count how many times a team appears as both the home and visiting teams:\n   - 1 time (Chicago Jaguars vs Pittsburgh Steelers).\n4. Now let's determine if only one team has been both the home team and the visiting team:\n   - Since there is only one instance where this happened (Chicago Jaguars vs Pittsburgh Steelers), we can say that this claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final JSON answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified one case where a team appeared as both home and visitinng teams, therefore the claim of 'only one team have be both the home team and the visiting team' is true because only this specific instance was found.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the column for year**: The table has a column named \"year\". This column will be used to determine the time period of the events.\n\n2. **Find the months with late September dates**: Late September is the 9th or 10th month of the year. We need to find rows in the table that correspond to these months. The column for dates is \"date\".\n\n3. **Analyze the claim's wording**: The claim states that the NFL International Series most often take place in late September. This means we are looking for rows where either October 28, October 26, or October 25 occurs, as these dates correspond to late September.\n\n4. **Count the occurrences of late September dates**:\n   - In row 1: The date is \"october 28\", which does not match.\n   - In row 2: The date is \"october 26\", which matches.\n   - In row 3: The date is \"october 25\", which matches.\n   - In rows 4 to 6: Dates do not exist or are TBA (To Be Announced), thus they cannot be considered.\n\n5. **Determine if the claim's statement is true**: Based on step 4, there are two instances of late September dates (\"october 26\" and \"october 25\"). We need at least three occurrences to meet the claim that it most often happens in late September.\n\n6. **Check for any other possible occurrences**:\n   - Looking through rows 7-12, all but row 8 have either no date or a TBA (TBA is not a valid date and does not match our desired criteria). Row 8's date does exist (\"tba\") but it has the same problem as row 4-6 (the only month available is October), thus we can ignore this. \n\n7. **Evaluate if two instances were sufficient**: Since there are only two confirmed cases in late September, this was not enough to make a claim that the NFL International Series most often takes place in late September.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The number of confirmed occurrences does not meet or exceed three.\n   - Therefore, we conclude that the statement is FALSE.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the column for year.
