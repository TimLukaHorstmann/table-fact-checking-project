Check if the recording period corresponds with the claim's start and end dates: According to the table, at least some tracks were recorded in 1980, which is within the time frame mentioned in the claim (1979-1980), but there are also other tracks recorded in 1987 or 1989.\n\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that INXS was released a total of 4 times by Mercury Records, an American record label owned by Universal Music Group.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: To verify this claim, we need to find instances in the table where:\n   - The format is \"lp\", \"mc\", or \"cd\" (all formats mentioned in the claim).\n   - The country is either \"aus\" (Australian), \"eur\" (European), or \"usa\" (American).\n   - Mercury Records is listed as the label.\n   - Universal Music Group is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that since Mercury Records is owned by Universal Music Group, this condition is likely met.\n\n3. **Find Relevant Rows**: We need to find rows in the table where these conditions are met:\n   - Format: \"lp\", \"mc\", or \"cd\".\n   - Country: \"aus\" (for cd), \"eur\" (for lp and mc).\n   - Label: Mercury Records.\n   - Owner of record label: Universal Music Group.\n\n4. **Count Instances**: Count the number of rows that meet these conditions to verify if INXS was released a total of 4 times by Mercury Records.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued\n\nUpon reviewing the table, we can see that:\n\n- There are two instances where \"lp\" is released in Europe (\"eur\"), both from Mercury Records.\n- There is one instance where \"mc\" is also released in Europe (\"eur\") and America (\"usa\").\n- There are three instances of different formats (\"cd\") being released, but these are all from different countries (Australian, European) and thus do not include an American release by Mercury Records.\n\nTherefore, adding the two European releases to the one American release gives us a total count of 3, not 4. Hence, our claim that INXS was released a total of 4 times by Mercury Records is **FALSE**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant data and conditions in table to verify claim about INXS releases by Mercury Records; counted instances to find if total count matches claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"label\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, another option to verify this part would be checking if there's a mention or indication that Atco Records was founded in 1955 as a division of Atlantic Record.\n\n6. **Find related information about the parent company**: Upon closer inspection, we find a row for \"mc\" (mixed cassette) format with \"eur\" country and \"mercury records\" label. Then there's another \"cd\" format row for both \"aus\", \"eur\", and \"usa\" countries all associated with \"mercury records\". There isn't any direct mention of Atco Records in relation to the founding year 1955 as a division or parent company directly associated with Atlantic Corporation, though.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The only part of the claim that we can verify is that \"Atco record be an american record company\", which can be confirmed from the 'country' column.
