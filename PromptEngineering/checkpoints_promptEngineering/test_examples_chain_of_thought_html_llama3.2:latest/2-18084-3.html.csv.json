First, we need to understand the claim being made: \"4 athlete have a mark of 28 foot\".\n   - This implies that we need to find how many athletes from the table have a mark that is equivalent to or less than 28 feet.\n\n2. We notice that the marks are given in meters and inches.\n   - For easier comparison, we'll convert all marks into a consistent unit (in this case, inches).\n\n3. We look at each athlete's mark:\n   - Mike Powell: 29ft4\u00bcin\n   - Bob Beamon: 29ft2\u00bcin\n   - Carl Lewis: 29ft1in\n   - Robert Emmiyan: 29ft0\u00bein\n   - Larry Myricks, Erick Walder, and Dwight Phillips all have a mark of 28ft8in\n   - Irving Saladino: 28ft7\u00bdin\n   - Iv\u00e1n Pedroso: 28ft6\u00bein\n   - Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas: 28ft4\u00bein\n\n4. Now, we count the athletes with marks less than or equal to 28 feet:\n   - Bob Beamon (29ft2\u00bcin) does not qualify.\n   - Carl Lewis (29ft1in), Robert Emmiyan (29ft0\u00bein), and Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas (28ft4\u00bein) do qualify.\n\n5. However, we must also include athletes with marks exactly equal to 28 feet:\n   - Larry Myricks, Erick Walder, Dwight Phillips, Irving Saladino, and Iv\u00e1n Pedroso all have a mark of 28ft8in or 28ft6\u00bein respectively.\n   - So the correct total count of athletes is more than just those mentioned above.\n\n### Complete List of Athletes with Mark Less Than or Equal to 28 feet\n\nAfter re-examining the table, it appears that there are actually 9 athletes with a mark less than or equal to 28 feet (including some athletes who have exactly 28ft8in):\n\n- Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas: 28ft4\u00bein\n- Larry Myricks: 28ft8in\n- Erick Walder: 28ft8in\n- Dwight Phillips: 28ft8in\n- Irving Saladino: 28ft7\u00bdin\n- Iv\u00e1n Pedroso: 28ft6\u00bein\n- Robert Emmiyan: 29ft0\u00bein (does not meet the criteria, but was mistakenly counted)\n- Carl Lewis: 29ft1in (does not meet the criteria, and was also mistakenly counted)\n\nCorrecting for the errors above, only athletes with a mark of exactly 28 feet or less qualify.

To do this, I will look at the values in the table for athletes who have achieved long jump records.\n\n2. Upon examining the table, I see that there is an athlete named Dwight Phillips with the following information: \n   - mark: 8.71 m (28ft6\u00bein)\n   - wind: 1.9\n   - athlete: dwight phillips\n   - nationality: united states\n   - venue: eugene\n   - date: june 7 , 2009\n\n3. Now, I need to verify that Dwight Phillips' mark of 8.71 m is indeed a record. For this, I will look for other athletes with the same or better marks in the table.\n\n4. However, upon examining the table again, I see that there are several athletes with the same mark as Dwight Phillips (8.74m and 8.86m). Therefore, to be considered the first person to set a long jump record, it would have been necessary for Dwight Phillips' mark of 8.71 m to be better than all other marks.\n\n5. However, that's not the case since 8.66 m was achieved by lo\u00fais ts\u00e1toumas before dwight phillips (June 2 , 2007). This is a valid long jump record achievement and more long records existed prior to Dwight Phillips' mark.\n\n6. Therefore, Dwight Phillips did set a long jump record but not the first one according to our criteria.",
