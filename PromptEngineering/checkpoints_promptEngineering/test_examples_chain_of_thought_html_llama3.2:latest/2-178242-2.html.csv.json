However, if no other season has a higher value, it would be considered the highest.\n\n4. **Verify if the claim holds true**:\n   - Check each cell in the table to ensure there are no seasons with a higher total prize money than Season 1 ($115,000).\n   - If all comparisons result in Season 1 having the highest total prize money, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. **List relevant cells for verification**:\n   - All cells that contribute to verifying if Season 1 has the highest total prize money are relevant.\n   ``` \n   {\n     \"row_index\": [\n       [0, \"total prize money\"],\n       [1, \"total prize money\"],\n       [2, \"total prize money\"],\n       [3, \"total prize money\"],\n       [4, \"total prize money\"],\n       [5, \"total prize money\"]\n     ],\n     \"column_name\": [\"season\", \"year\", \"mole\", \"winner\", \"runner - up\", \"total prize money\", \"potential prize money\", \"destination\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified the highest total prize money among all seasons by comparing each season's value to $115,000.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n      \"column_name\": [\"season\", \"year\", \"mole\", \"winner\", \"runner - up\", \"total prize money\", \"potential prize money\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this claim, we need to find the row in the table corresponding to season 4.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that the row for season 4 is the fourth row from the top (zero-indexed).\n4. The relevant cells for this row are:\n    - `mole`: petrina edge\n    - `total prize money`: 104000\n    - `potential prize money`: 531000\n5. We calculate the difference between `potential prize money` and `total prize money` by subtracting the former from the latter: 531000 - 104000 = 427000.\n6. Since the calculated difference (427000) matches the claimed difference, we need to verify that season 4 indeed has the largest gap in terms of total prize money and potential prize money among all seasons.\n\nTo confirm this, we can compare the differences between total prize money and potential prize money for each row:\n\n7. For row 1: 200000 - 115000 = 85000\n8. For row 2: 255000 - 100000 = 155000\n9. For row 3: 416000 - 108000 = 308000\n10.

So, the gap is 531000 - 104000 = 427000.\n   - For season 5: The total prize money is 203000, and the potential prize money is 539000. So, the gap is 539000 - 203000 = 336000.\n3. Since these two gaps are not equal (427000 != 336000), we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nHere's a JSON output of our reasoning:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"We need to check if the gap between total prize money and potential prize money for season 4 and 5 is equal.\",\n      \"cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total prize money\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"potential prize money\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"First, let's calculate the gap between total prize money and potential prize money for each of these seasons:\",\n      \"cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total prize money\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"potential prize money\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"For season 4: The total prize money is 104000, and the potential prize money is 531000.
