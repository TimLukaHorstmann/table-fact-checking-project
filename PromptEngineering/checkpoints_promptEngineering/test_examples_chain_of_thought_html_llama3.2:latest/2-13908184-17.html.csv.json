We can do this by examining the table and looking for rows where the 'nationality' column contains 'Canada'.\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <!-- table data -->\n</table>\n```\n\nStep 2: Count the number of players from the United States\nNext, we need to count the number of players from the United States.

The table shows us their respective nationalities (both are Canada), colleges/junior/club teams, and other information.\n3.

Looking at the table for Dennis Sobchuk's row:\n   - His position is also \"center\".\n   - His college/junior/club team is \"regina pats(wchl)\".\n5. Now, let's check if Randy Andreachuk was drafted directly before Dennis Sobchuk by comparing their row indices in the table. If Randy's index is immediately preceding Dennis', then it would be true that Randy was drafted right after Dennis'. In this case though, Randy's row_index (8) comes after Dennis' row_index (5). This means, according to our information, Andreachuk and Sobchuk were not directly before each other in their respective drafting sequences.\n6.

Determine the nationality of both players.\n   - Scott Jessee's nationality: United States\n   - Craig Arvidson's nationality: United States\n\n2. Since both players have the same nationality, we can proceed to determine their respective positions in the draft order.\n\n3. Look for Scott Jessee's information about being a right wing and Craig Arvidson's information about being a left wing.\n   - Scott Jessee is indeed listed as a right wing player\n   - Craig Arvidson is indeed listed as a left wing player\n\n4. Determine whether Craig Arvidson was drafted before Scott Jessee based on their draft order.\n   - According to the table, Craig Arvidson's row index (14) is greater than Scott Jessee's row index (11)\n\n5. Since Craig Arvidson's row index is greater than Scott Jessee's row index, it means Craig Arvidson was not drafted before Scott Jessee.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify the column related to nationality**: The column named `nationality` contains information about each player's nationality.\n\n2. **Locate the centers in the table**: To determine if all center players are from the United States, we need to identify the rows where the position is \"center\". These rows are:\n\n    - Row 4: Randy Andreachuk\n    - Row 5: Dennis Sobchuk\n    - Row 6: Willie Friesen\n    - Row 9: Peter McKenzie\n    - Row 10: Marcel Labrosse\n    - Row 12: Richard Guay\n    - Row 14: Craig Arvidson\n\n3. **Check the nationality of center players**: Now, let's check the nationality of these center players:\n\n    * Randy Andreachuk (Canada)\n    * Dennis Sobchuk (Canada)\n    * Willie Friesen (Canada)\n    * Peter McKenzie (Canada)\n    * Marcel Labrosse (Canada)\n    * Richard Guay (Canada)\n    * Craig Arvidson (United States)\n\n4. **Analyze the nationality of center players**: We can see that all center players except one are from Canada. However, this alone does not prove or disprove the claim since we still need to check if there are any center players from the United States.\n\n5. **Identify a counterexample**: A counterexample is needed to disprove the claim. Since Craig Arvidson's nationality is listed as \"United States\", he serves as a counterexample to the claim that all center players are from Canada.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on our analysis, we can conclude that not all center players in the table are from the United States. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
