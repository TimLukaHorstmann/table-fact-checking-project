    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to check if there is a column named 'school / club team' in the table. Since it exists, we can proceed.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify which rows have values in the 'school / club team' column that contain the word 'Boston'. We are looking for Boston Celtics draft picks from 1985. \n\n3. From the given html table data:\n   - The Boston Celtic's draft pick in 1985 is likely a reference to Michael Jordan, and he attended Liberty Baptist School, which matches part of our criteria.\n   - There is no direct mention of 'Boston' as part of the school name that would indicate it being a direct match for our claim. However, we must note there might be other drafts or picks not listed here that had Boston in their team name.\n\n4. Since Michael Jordan is likely the draft pick from 1985 and he's from United States but his college was Liberty Baptist which does contain 'Boston', this suggests that part of the claim might be TRUE (the draft pick being from the US), however we need to verify if all picks came from the US.\n\n5. Let\u2019s look at other columns for more info: The column \"nationality\" always says United States, so it seems like the rest of the team is from the US as well. However, without knowing the nationality of Michael Jordan's team, this does not necessarily prove that all Boston Celtics draft picks in 1985 came from the US.\n\n6. Since we cannot verify if Michael Jordan's college was the only pick to be from the US or if other picks were from another country, we can\u2019t definitively say our claim is TRUE without more information.\n\n7. However, looking back at the relevant cells: \n   - The relevant cell for the row of Michael Jordan would be [row_index=2, column_name='school / club team'], which contains 'liberty baptist'.\n   - This does not confirm that all Boston Celtics draft picks from 1985 are from the US. But it is consistent with some part of the claim being TRUE.\n\n8. Thus we can conclude our chain of thought: Since there is only one known pick (Michael Jordan) and not enough information to say for certain if other picks came from countries other than the United States, our reasoning process suggests that some part of the claim is likely TRUE but NOT ALL PICKS FROM 1985 WERE FROM THE US.\n\n9. However, since we can\u2019t verify this without more data and there are no indications otherwise on the table: \n    - [row_index=0, column_name='nationality'] would be consistent with all picks being from the United States.\n    - However we cannot confirm that without further information.\n\n10. Finally, to answer the question accurately:\n    Given our current limitations, a definitive answer can\u2019t be made solely on this data but our reasoning process can say some part of the claim (the nationality for sure) is TRUE, and the whole statement might be partially true.\n\nGiven the format requested, here's the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to check if there is a column named 'school / club team' in the table.

However, since Cliff Webber is draft 93 pick and there are 22 picks before him, we can assume that Cliff Webber was indeed picked before the 23rd overall pick.\n\n   To confirm this, let's look at the 'school / club team' column for both players:\n   ```\n   <td>michigan state</td>\n   ```\n\n   Unfortunately, the table doesn't provide any information about Albert Butts' school or club team. However, we can assume that he was drafted by his university or club team, as is common practice in basketball drafts.\n\nBased on these steps and available data from the table, I couldn't verify whether \"Albert Butt be draft 23 pick after cliff webber in 1985\" is true or not because of missing specific information.

Now, let's look at the table:\n\n   | round | pick | player      | nationality | school / club team  |\n   |-------|------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|\n   | 1     | 20   | sam vincent | United States| Michigan State     |\n   | 3     | 70   | andre battle| United States| Loyola (IL)        |\n   | 4     | 93   | cliff webber | United States| Liberty Baptist    |\n   | 5     | 116  | albert butts| United States| La Salle           |\n   | 6     | 139  | ralph lewis  | United States| La Salle           |\n   | 7     | 162  | chris remly  | United States| Rutgers             |\n\n   From the table, we see that there is a row where \"round\" equals 1 and \"pick\" equals 20.\n\n6. Since this matches our initial findings (there's no row with \"round\" equaling 2), the claim is false.\n\n7. Finally, let's identify the relevant cells to support our reasoning:\n\n   ```\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"There should be a row where round equals 2 and pick equals 20\",\n       \"No such row found in the table\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nThe final answer is: \n {\n   \"chain_of_thought\": [\n     \"There should be a row where round equals 2 and pick equals 20\",\n     \"No such row found in the table\"\n   ],\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}",
