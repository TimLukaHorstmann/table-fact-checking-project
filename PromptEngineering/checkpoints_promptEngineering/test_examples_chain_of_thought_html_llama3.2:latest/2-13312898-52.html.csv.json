    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the rows in the table where the \"round\" column is 3, 4, or 6.\n2. Then, for each of these rows, we will check if there is at least one draft pick (i.e., a value that is not empty).\n3. Next, if there is a draft pick, we need to count the number of draft picks in this row.\n4. If the number of draft picks is greater than 1 for any row, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n\n- For the 3rd round: The \"round\" column has values [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. So there are 2 instances of rows where \"round\" equals 3. Relevant cells for the 3rd round are:\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n  }\n- For the 4th round: The \"round\" column has values [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. So there is only 1 instance of rows where \"round\" equals 4. Relevant cell for the 4th round is:\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n  }\n- For the 6th round: The \"round\" column has values [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. So there is only 1 instance of rows where \"round\" equals 6. Relevant cell for the 6th round is:\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n  }\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n  }\n\nNow, let's analyze the data:\n\nFor the 3rd round: There are at least two draft picks (9 and 5) in row 1 and row 2.\nFor the 4th round: There is only one draft pick (11) in row 4. There is no second draft pick here.\nFor the 6th round: There are two draft picks (8 and 28) in row 5 and 6.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim \"the colt have multiple draft pick in the 3rd , 4th and 6th round\" is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzing table data to determine if Colts had multiple draft picks in 3rd, 4th, and 6th rounds.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim being made about the table. The claim states that the Colt draft a total of 5 defensive players.\n\n2. To verify this claim, we should look for cells in the table where the position is 'defensive player' or any other relevant category (e.g., 'safety', 'linebacker', etc.).\n\n3. We will scan each row of the table to find these specific positions.\n\n4. Once we have identified all rows with defensive players, we will count how many there are.\n\n5. If the total number of defensive players found equals 5, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n6. For accurate reference and verification purposes, note down the row index and position column name for each relevant cell that supports our finding.\n\n7. Now, let's count the number of defensive players from the table:\n\n- The 'safety' position is present in one row.\n- The 'linebacker' position appears twice.\n\n8. Therefore, we have identified 3 instances of defensive positions: 1 'safety', and 2 'linebacks'.\n\n9. Since our count (3) does not match the claim's number (5), we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n10. However, since there are indeed some defense-related positions in the table, we must acknowledge these when making our final answer.\n\n11. The relevant cells for verification purposes will be noted below:\n\n    ```\n    [\n      {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n    ]\n    ```\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Scanned table for defensive positions, identified 3 instances (safety and 2 linebackers), found a total of 5 players, hence claim is false because we have less than the stated number.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is stating that 9 players total were drafted by the Indianapolis Colts.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check the table for the number of players drafted by the Indianapolis Colts. We can do this by looking at the \"college\" column and counting the number of rows where the college is \"indiana\".\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are 1 row where the college is indeed \"indiana\" (the player \"ben hartsock\").\n4. However, we notice that the claim mentions the total number of players drafted by the Indianapolis Colts, not just those from Indiana.\n5. To count the total number of players drafted by the Indianapolis Colts, we need to check if there are any other rows where the college is \"indiana\" or if there are multiple columns with values that correspond to the same team name (e.g., \"colt\" instead of \"colts\").\n6. Upon closer inspection, we see that there is another row where the college is \"indiana\" but it's actually \"indianapolis\" and not the correct spelling for the Colts.\n7. However, looking at columns like overall and position such as tight end we can see multiple instances of players having a value associated with the name 'colts'.\n8. There are 3 values that correspond to the name Colts (2 rows in the pick column) meaning there were indeed more than one draft pick for the team.\n9. However, looking at the pick column we find only two columns containing an actual number corresponding to being drafted by Colts which is not enough to support the claim of 9 player total being drafted by Colts\n10.

Looking at the table, Bob sander has a row where pick number 12 , Ben Hartsock has a row with pick number 5, Gilbert gardner has a row with pick number 6 and so on\n6. However if we compare them to Jason David who was picked as the 29th round and Kendall Pope who was 11th round , those guys would have been picked much earlier than Bob sander given that he is in the 12th position.\n7. Considering these points, I can conclude that the claim \"the first player select by the colt in this draft be bob sander\" is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze table row-by-row to find out who was the first player selected by the colt.\\nLooking at the column 'pick' represents order of players selection\\nSince we are only given information about this draft and not any other for the colt, I can look at who is number one that will be the first player selected by the colt.\\nCompare with Jason David who was picked as 29th round and Kendall Pope who were both in earlier rounds than Bob sander \\nConclusion: The claim 'the first player select by the colt in this draft be bob sander' is FALSE\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}",
