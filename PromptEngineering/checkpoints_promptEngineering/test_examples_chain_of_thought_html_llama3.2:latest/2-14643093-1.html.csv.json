To compare the number of LQ finishes and 2R finishes between Tian and He, we need to count the occurrences of each type of finish for both players.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that \"LQ\" stands for \"Lost on Qualification\", which means the player lost in the qualification rounds but still managed to qualify for the main event. On the other hand, \"2R\" stands for \"Second Round exit\", which means the player was eliminated after the second round of the competition.\n\n3. To count the LQ finishes and 2R finishes, we can identify the rows where the column name is either \"LQ\" or \"2R\". For Tian and He, these columns are located in rows 18-31 and 17-30 respectively, but not all cells in these ranges have a value.\n\n4. First, let's count the LQ finishes for both players. Looking at row 19 of column \"Tian\", we see that it says \"dnq\" (did not qualify), which means Tian did not finish as an LQ. Moving to other rows, we can see that He has more LQ finishes than Tian.\n\n5. Next, let's count the 2R finishes for both players. Looking at row 20 of column \"Tian\", we see that it says \"nr\" (next round), which means Tian had a better performance than just losing in the second round.

Conversely, we will also look for instances where \"unranked\" is present but \"rank\" is not, indicating no ranking.\n4. To compare these two counts, we need to ensure that the same year is being considered in both cases.\n5. Since the table does not provide specific years, we can assume that each row represents a different tournament or event, and we will count the number of times \"rank\" appears when \"unranked\" does not appear, and vice versa.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Relevant_cells:\n  [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"unranked\"\n    }\n  ]\n\n6.

The value for 2012/13 is 0.\n\n3. Find the LQ values for other years:\n   - In the table, \"lq\" is also found in columns 4 and 11 (index 3 and 10), depending on whether you count from the top or bottom row.\n   - For example, for 2011/12, the value is 2. For 2010/11, the value is 1.\n   - We can continue this process to find LQ values for all other years.\n\n4. Count the number of LQ points for each year:\n   - Since we are only interested in \"in 2012 / 13 he have more lq than any other year\", we need to check if there is a year with fewer LQ points.\n   - We will compare the number of LQ points for 2012/13 with the ones from other years.\n\n5. Compare the values:\n   - To determine if 2012/13 has more LQ points than any other year, we need to find out which year has the lowest number of LQ points and see if it's less than or equal to 0.\n   - The only year with a lower number of LQ points is \"not held\" (in index 15), but this value is not an actual number.\n\n6. Find the year with the least number of LQ points:\n   - After comparing all values, we see that there are several years with zero or very low LQ scores.\n   - It seems impossible to find a year with more LQ than 2012/13 since some years have the same amount as others and \"not held\" is not a valid data.\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Based on our calculations, it appears that 2012/13 has no lower LQ points than any other year (including \"not held\").
