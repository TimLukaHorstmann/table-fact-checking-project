    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the table structure and claim analysis\nThe given table contains information about Muhsin Corbbrey's fights, including date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. The claim states that Muhsin Corbbrey fought two fights in Florida in 2005.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the relevant cells for the claim\nTo analyze the claim, we need to find the rows where Muhsin Corbbrey fought in Florida in 2005. We will start by searching for the date, location, and venue columns to identify potential matches.\n\n#### Step 3: Search for matches in the table\nWe will search for the year 2005 and the state \"Florida\" in the location column. If a match is found, we will then check if the opponent's name is Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the first row\nThe first row does not match the claim because the location is Upper Marlboro, Maryland, USA, not Florida.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the second row\nThe second row does not match the claim because the opponent's name is Ricardo Planter, and the venue is Club Med Sandpiper in Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA.\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze the third row\nThe third row does not match the claim because the location is Miami, Florida, USA, but the opponent's name is Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez, and the year is 2005.\n\n#### Step 7: Analyze the fourth row\nThe fourth row does not match the claim because the location is Miami, Florida, USA, and the opponent's name is Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez, but it was a draw in 2005. However, we notice that another fight in Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA had occurred earlier in 2005.\n\n#### Step 8: Analyze the fifth row\nThe fifth row matches the claim because the location is Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA, and the opponent's name is Ricardo Planter, but it was a draw.\n\n#### Step 9: Conclusion\nAfter analyzing the table, we conclude that Muhsin Corbbrey fought one fight in Florida in 2005, but another fight took place earlier that year in Port St. Lucie, which also matches the claim. We need to find another match to confirm two fights.\n\n#### Step 10: Re-evaluate the location column for another match\nWe will re-examine the table to see if there is another row with a Florida location in 2005.\n\n#### Step 11: Analyze additional rows\nThe search yields no other matches in 2005. However, we notice that two fights took place earlier than 2005.\n\n#### Step 12: Re-evaluate the previous matches for an alternative explanation\nUpon reviewing the previous steps, we realize that our initial analysis focused on finding a second match with Muhsin Corbbrey fighting in Florida in 2005.\n\n#### Step 13: Alternative solution - looking for two separate fights in 2005 and one in 2006\nConsidering our misunderstanding, we will re-analyze the table to see if there are multiple fights of Muhsin Corbbrey taking place in different years that still satisfy the claim.\n\n#### Step 14: Re-identify relevant cells with correct analysis\nAfter recalculating the year when two separate fights took place, we can identify more rows where Muhsin Corbbrey fought.\n\n#### Step 15: Locate an additional match for the second fight\nAfter re-searching the table, we find another match in Florida in 2005. The location is Port St. Lucie, and the opponent's name is Ricardo Planter.\n\n#### Step 16: Re-calculate the answer based on the corrected analysis\nBased on our findings, we conclude that Muhsin Corbbrey fought two fights in Florida, one of which took place in 2005.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start with the original claim and search for matches in the table. Analyze rows 1-10 without finding a match. Re-evaluate row 5 and find that it does not satisfy the claim but hints at another possible fight in Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA, for Muhsin Corbbrey.\\n\\nRe-examine row 6 with the correct analysis: Find an additional match in Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA, for Muhsin Corbbrey fighting against Ricardo Planter on a draw. This leads to the realization that another fight occurred earlier than expected and doesn't exactly fit the original claim. However, we identify two separate fights taking place in different years, one of which indeed satisfies the claim.\\n\\nConsider an alternative explanation where two fights take place outside of 2005 and find that one match was in Florida in 2006.\", \n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}",

We will look specifically for rows where the \"location\" contains \"south carolina\".\n\nStep 4: Search for instances of Muhsin Corbbrey losing a fight in South Carolina.\nWe need to check if there are any instances where the \"result\" is \"loss\" and the \"location\" contains \"south carolina\". If such instances exist, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nStep 5: Perform the actual search.\nAfter examining the table, we find that Muhsin Corbbrey fought in South Carolina at least once. The relevant cell is:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 0,\n  \"column_name\": \"location\"\n}\n\nThis indicates that while there are instances of a fight being held in South Carolina, the specific instance where Muhsin Corbbrey lost will be found in one of his fights' rows.\n\nStep 6: Check for any loss in South Carolina.\nInspecting each row with \"south carolina\", we see that at least one of the entries contains information regarding the win or draw, but none directly states a loss. However, looking closer:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}, \n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}, \n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}\n\nIn row 2:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 0,\n  \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}\n\nand similarly for the others.\n\nActually, there is no information in the table that directly shows that Muhsin Corbbrey lost a fight in South Carolina. However we need to verify if his record shows any loss at all regardless of location.\n\nStep 7: Verify if Muhsin Corbbrey has ever lost a fight.\nFor this purpose we can go back to our original \"result\" check:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}, \n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}, \n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}\n\nIn all the cases his result is either win or draw. Thus, we can safely say that he has not lost any fight.\n\nStep 8: Provide a final answer in the requested format.\nGiven our findings, we conclude that Muhsin Corbbrey has never lost a fight in South Carolina.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We searched for instances of Muhsin Corbbrey losing a fight in South Carolina but couldn't find any. However to verify if he had ever lost a fight at all we looked up the results and found that he only won or drew his fights which makes our initial guess right, thus proving the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

After verifying the fights where Muhsin Corbbrey won, we need to verify that he indeed won exactly three of these fights.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>2006 - 04 - 21</td>\n  <td>win</td>\n  <td>shelton barnes</td>\n  <td>omar shrine temple</td>\n  <td>mount pleasant , south carolina , usa</td>\n  <td>tko</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>2:43</td>\n  <td>4 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2005 - 11 - 26</td>\n  <td>win</td>\n  <td>ben lock</td>\n  <td>show place arena</td>\n  <td>upper marlboro , maryland , usa</td>\n  <td>decision (unanimous)</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>3:00</td>\n  <td>1 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2005 - 04 - 26</td>\n  <td>loss</td>\n  <td>emanuel gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez</td>\n  <td>radisson hotel</td>\n  <td>miami , florida , usa</td>\n  <td>decision (unanimous)</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>3:00</td>\n  <td>0 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2005 - 04 - 08</td>\n  <td>draw</td>\n  <td>ricardo planter</td>\n  <td>club med sandpiper</td>\n  <td>port st lucie , florida , usa</td>\n  <td>draw (majority)</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>3:00</td>\n  <td>0 - 0 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\nThere are three wins for Muhsin Corbbrey. \n```\n\n6. After verifying that there were indeed three fights won by TKO, we need to determine whether the specified date range (2005-2009) was met.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>2006 - 04 - 21</td>\n  <td>win</td>\n  <td>shelton barnes</td>\n  <td>omar shrine temple</td>\n  <td>mount pleasant , south carolina , usa</td>\n  <td>tko</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>2:43</td>\n  <td>4 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2005 - 11 - 26</td>\n  <td>win</td>\n  <td>ben lock</td>\n  <td>show place arena</td>\n  <td>upper marlboro , maryland , usa</td>\n  <td>decision (unanimous)</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>3:00</td>\n  <td>1 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2005 - 04 - 26</td>\n  <td>loss</td>\n  <td>emanuel gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez</td>\n  <td>radisson hotel</td>\n  <td>miami , florida , usa</td>\n  <td>decision (unanimous)</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>3:00</td>\n  <td>0 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2005 - 04 - 08</td>\n  <td>draw</td>\n  <td>ricardo planter</td>\n  <td>club med sandpiper</td>\n  <td>port st lucie , florida , usa</td>\n  <td>draw (majority)</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>3:00</td>\n  <td>0 - 0 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n\n2005 is before the year 2009. \n```\n\n7. After determining that there were indeed exactly three fights won by Muhsin Corbbrey and that both the date range (2005-2009) was met, we can conclude our answer.\n\n```html\nYes\n```\n\n8. Finally, we need to confirm that there are no other conditions not covered in this solution.\n\n```html\nAll conditions have been verified.\n```\n\n9. After verifying all conditions and concluding that Muhsin Corbbrey won exactly three fights with the date range 2005-2009, our answer can be provided.\n\n```python\nYes, he did win.\n```",

Then search for Muhsin Corbbrey's fights in those conditions and ensure that the results indicate a win or decision (unanimous) outcome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, // year not available directly; assuming from date string\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"} // opponent unknown or unspecified; matches claim criteria\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe relevant cells were identified to support the chain of thought. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that:\n- There is a row (row_index=6) where `location` and year are ambiguous but match the criteria based on date string analysis.\n- In row 6, Muhsin Corbbrey's opponent is indeed unknown/unspecified, which aligns with the claim of \"fight 2\".\n- The method in this case is a draw (majority), not a decision or win, thus contradicting our initial interpretation that we are only looking for wins.\n- Given the ambiguity and misunderstanding of row 6\u2019s data, it does not support the claim as stated.\n\nTherefore, reevaluating based on these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant row (row_index=6) has an ambiguous location but matches the year. However, upon closer inspection, Muhsin Corbbrey fought a draw in Florida in 2006, which does not support the claim of him winning or losing specifically.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, // year not available directly; assuming from date string\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"} // opponent unknown or unspecified; matches claim criteria\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is FALSE.",

To do this, we'll examine each row of the table to find information about Muhsin Corbbrey's opponents and locations.\n\n3. Since the claim only specifies fights happening in Maryand, we can focus on rows with relevant cells containing either \"Maryland\" or a location that includes \"Maryland\".\n\n4. Looking at the table, there are several rows of interest:\n   - The 2005-04-08 row contains Port St Lucie , Florida , USA and Ricardo Planter in a draw fight.\n   - No rows about Muhsin Corbbrey's fights in Maryland can be identified from these rows.\n\n5. We'll continue to look for relevant rows:\n   - In the table, there are no other rows that specifically mention \"Maryland\" as the location of a fight involving Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\n\n6.
