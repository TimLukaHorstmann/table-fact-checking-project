If it is, we take note of the value in the 'record' column to see how many wins there were for that year.\n\n4. We then verify if any of those years also match the location 'itapeua , brazil'.\n\n5.

We can see the date for that row as \"1995\". So, the first win is indeed in 1995.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the last win year in the table. Since we already found the first win in 1995, we can look at the next rows until we find another win or until we reach the bottom of the table. In this case, we see that there are more wins after 1995.\n\n3. Looking at the dates for each row starting from 1996, we see that all of these rows have a \"win\" result except for one. The date for that row is \"2007\", which corresponds to the cell \"5 - 3 - 0\". However, this does not mean it was his last win in that year.\n\n4. Since the claim says \"and have his last win in the year 1999\", we need to find a \"win\" result with a date of \"1999\" or see if there is any other indication that he had no further wins after 1999.\n\n5. We can see that there are indeed two more rows below the row for \"2007\". These rows have dates of \"4 November 2003\" and another year, presumably not relevant to this chain of thought.\n\n6. In these additional rows we find a win in the year 2003. So, while it is true he has had a first win in '95 and there are wins after that year, specifically for the claim statement \"the fighter have his last win in the year 1999\", there is not enough data to confirm this as fact.\n\n7. Looking at other data such as the loss row \"loss\" with date 2003 in combination with another cell stating '5-1-0'. This actually means that the loss occurred after all of those wins, which also indicates he had a last win before his first lose.\n\n8. After reevaluating our steps and looking at every possible clue we see that there is indeed enough evidence to make the statement true: \"the fighter have a first win in the year 1995 and have his last win in the year 1999\".

Next, let's look at all the losses of the fighter with the same date and location:\n\n   ```\n    <tr>\n      <td>loss</td>\n      <td>5 - 3 - 0</td>\n      <td>osvaldo castuera</td>\n      <td>submission (armbar)</td>\n      <td>2007</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>itapeua , brazil</td>\n      <td>vale tudo</td>\n    </tr>\n    ```\n\n   The fighter has only one loss in 2007 with the location itapeua, brazil.\n\n3.

Given the constraint of the problem statement, it seems unlikely to find a record of \"last\" win from 2001, as it cannot be verified if this was indeed the last win since the information about consecutive wins/losses is not present in the table.\n\n\n#### Step 5: Verify if any loss occurs in 2003\nAccording to step 3, there are two losses recorded on 2003. This verifies that the fighter had his first loss in that year.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine the validity of the claim\nSince we could not verify the existence of a win in 2001 due to lack of records and no other information about consecutive wins/losses, the claim cannot be verified completely as false.\n\n\n#### Step 7: Conclude\nGiven the verification process, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"the relevant cells are not available to verify if there was a win in year 2001. There are records of loss in year 2003.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": 'record'\n    }\n  ]\n}",
