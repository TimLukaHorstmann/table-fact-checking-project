The relevant cells are those where the data is present, excluding the \"total\" header cell.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Find the 5th Ranked Country's Total Medal Count\nWe will find the row index of the 5th ranked country by iterating over each row in the table, incrementing the `rank` until we reach 5. Then, we can extract its total medal count.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Compare Total Medal Count of Saudi Arabia with That of the 5th Ranked Country\nWe will compare the total medal counts by looking up their values in the table.
