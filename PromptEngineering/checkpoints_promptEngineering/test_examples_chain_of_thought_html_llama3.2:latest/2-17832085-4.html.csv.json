The row index of h\u00e9rcules cf is 1, while the row index of levante ud is 5. \n\n3. Next, we need to extract the 'goals for' and 'goals against' values from both rows.

However, CD Constancia has also only won 10 games.\n\nThe last team that wins more than half his games is indeed Real Murcia with 12 wins but the other teams have more than half won only one.
