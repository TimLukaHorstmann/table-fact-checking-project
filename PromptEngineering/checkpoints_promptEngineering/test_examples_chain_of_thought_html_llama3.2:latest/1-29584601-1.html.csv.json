    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find the latest release date among all the titles.\n   To do this, we can look at the \"original air date\" column and sort it in descending order. This will give us the title with the latest release date.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if there is a title that has Bob Bralver as its director.\n\n3. Then, we can compare the result from step 1 (the title with the latest release date) with our search for Bob Bralver in step 2 (if such a title exists).\n\n4. After determining the relevance of both conditions in steps 1 and 2, we will find out if the rotten apple matches our two criteria.\n\nHere are the steps clearly described:\n\n- First we look at the original air date column to determine which show has aired most recently:\n  - The relevant cell is: [\"january 6 , 1985\", \"april 5 , 1985\"] -> [1, 7]\n- Then we find out who directed that particular episode.\n  - For row index 1 (\"custom made killer\") the director was Harvey Laidman:\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"director\",\"value\":\"harvey laidman\"}\n  - For row index 7 (\"knight strike\") the director was Georg Fenady:\n    {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"director\",\"value\":\"georg fenady\"}\n- Now we compare these two rows to find out if either of them has \"the rotten apple\" as its title.\n  - The relevant cell for \"custom made killer\" is: [\"custom made killer\", null]\n  - The relevant cell for \"knight strike\" is: [null, \"knight strike\"]\n- Since \"knight strike\" does not match our condition for the title and since Bob Bralver directed it,\n  we conclude that the rotten apple was not the show that aired most recently.\n\nHere are all the steps in a single chain of thought:\n\n1. Find out which show has the latest air date (\"the rotten apple be the title with the latest release date that be direct by bob bralver\")\n2. The relevant cell is: [\"january 6 , 1985\", \"april 5 , 1985\"] -> [1, 7]\n3. Find out who directed both of these shows:\n   - Harvey Laidman directed a show (\"custom made killer\") that aired at row index 1 on the latest date in our list,\n     but it was not titled \"the rotten apple\".\n   - Georg Fenady directed another show (\"knight strike\"), which, although also airing last, does indeed have the title \"the rotten apple\". The relevant cell is:\n    {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"title\",\"value\":\"knight strike\"}\n4. Since we now know that the relevant shows with titles that are named as \"the rotten apple\" are both at the top of our list and the show \"knight strike\" has a director (georg fenady) which is different from the required director bob bralver,\n  it can be concluded that not all conditions were met.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Find out which show has the latest air date ('the rotten apple be the title with the latest release date that be direct by bob bralver')\\\\n\\\\nThe relevant cell is: \\[\\\"january 6 , 1985\\\", \\\"april 5 , 1985\\\"\\\\] -> \\[1, 7\\\\]\\\\nFind out who directed both of these shows:\\\\n\\\\n- Harvey Laidman directed a show ('custom made killer') that aired at row index 1 on the latest date in our list,\\\\nbut it was not titled 'the rotten apple'.\\\\n\\\\n- Georg Fenady directed another show ('knight strike'), which, although also airing last, does indeed have the title 'the rotten apple'.
