Specifically, we're interested in the years they finished in second place and whether that was in their \"final\" two listed conferences (which seem to refer to the Southwest Conference before it split into West and South divisions).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze data for the Southwest Conference\nGiven the Grizzlies' history with the Southwest Conference, which lasted from 2005 to 2012, we must look at these years carefully. They finished in second place multiple times during this period.\n\n### Step 4: Check for first-place finishes outside of conference finals\nWe also need to confirm there were no instances where they finished first within any of their conferences that are not their \"final\" listed division (which seems to pertain to the Southwest Division's transition and final years under its old format).\n\n### Step 5: Confirm the relevance of the \"final two conferences\"\nGiven the Grizzlies' history, it appears their performance in these \"final two conferences\" (Southwest Conference before its split) is being scrutinized. However, without explicit mention of conference finals within those years, this step might be less about exact wording and more about understanding the context.\n\n### Step 6: Compile findings into a clear conclusion\nFrom our analysis, we can see that there were indeed instances where the Grizzlies finished in second place, notably within the Southwest Conference for several years. If they have never won their division but did finish second, then the claim seems to be accurate.\n\n### Step 7: Output final answer and relevant data\nGiven the steps above, our analysis shows the Grizzlies did not win any division titles that we can find in this dataset but did frequently come up short in those attempts.
