These are for the United States.\n   - The relevant cells for these rows are:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Find all other dates with the same label**:\n   - We also need to check if there are any other dates that share the same label \"Warner Bros Records\".\n   - For both rows found in step 2, the date is September 15, 1992.\n   - The relevant cells for these rows are the same as in step 2.\n\n4. **Check if September 14, 1992 and July 6, 1998 also have \"Warner Bros Records\"**:\n   - We see that there are indeed other dates where the label is \"Warner Bros Records\", which are September 15, 1992 (twice) and July 6, 1998.\n   - The relevant cells for these rows are:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there is more than one date with the same label (\"Warner Bros Records\"), the claim that September 15, 1992 be the only date with this label is false.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Read claim, Find all dates with label 'Warner Bros Records', Find all other dates with the same label, Check if September 14, 1992 and July 6, 1998 also have 'Warner Bros Records'\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Looking at the second row, we see that \"country\" is indeed \"united kingdom\", but \"label\" is not equal to \"4ad\". So, this row does not match our criteria.\n\n4. In the third row, we have \"date\" as \"July 6 , 1998\" and \"format\" as \"cd (reissue)\".

The fourth row also has \"date\" equal to \"July 6 , 1998\", but its \"format\" is actually \"cd (reissue)\". This means that July 6, 1998 does have more than one format associated with it - CD (reissue) and CD.\n\n6.

Check if September 14, 1992 is indeed an early date by comparing it to other dates in the table.\n   - Looking at the relevant rows:\n     * The first row for \"united kingdom\" also has a release date of September 14, 1992, which indicates that this date is not unique.\n     * However, we should look for any other earlier dates that might be missing.\n\n2. Verify if there are any earlier dates by examining the table again:\n   - Upon closer inspection, we see that another country (\"united states\") has a release date of September 15, 1992. Since this is later than September 14, 1992, it confirms that September 14, 1992 is an early date.\n\n3. Confirm if the catalogue CAD 2014 CD exists on September 14, 1992:\n   - Looking at the relevant columns for this row in the table:\n     * We see that the format of the release is \"cd (first pressings came in a digipak sleeve)\" which suggests it was released on the 14th.\n     * The catalogue number CAD 2014 CD also corresponds with the date and country.\n\n4. Check if September 14, 1992 has an earlier or identical catalogue than other dates:\n   - Looking at relevant rows for different countries on this specific date:\n     * We confirm that this is indeed an early release by looking at the following catalogue numbers corresponding to September 14, 1992.\n       * CAD 2014 CD is present in both \"united kingdom\" and \"united states\", but since there are no earlier dates we can conclude it's not the earliest. However, we cannot verify if there are any other catalogue numbers that would make this date even more early than \"CAD 2014 CD\".\n\n5. Confirm the presence of a catalogue on September 14, 1992:\n   - Upon reviewing all relevant data we find no reason to doubt that \"CAD 2014 CD\" exists for these two countries.\n\n6.

First, we will look for rows in the table where \"date\" contains 'sep' and '1992'. There are two such rows.\n   \n   ```\n   <tr>\n     <td>united kingdom</td>\n     <td>september 14 , 1992</td>\n     <td>4ad</td>\n     <td>cd (first pressings came in a digipak sleeve)</td>\n     <td>cad 2014 cd</td>\n   </tr>\n   \n   <tr>\n     <td>united states</td>\n     <td>september 15 , 1992</td>\n     <td>warner bros records</td>\n     <td>cd</td>\n     <td>9 45062 - 2</td>\n   </tr>\n   ```\n\n2. Next, we will determine the earliest date among 'september 14 , 1992' and 'september 15 , 1992'. Since September has 30 days, 'september 14 , 1992' is earlier than 'september 15 , 1992'.\n\n3. Now we identify which country has 'september 14 , 1992' as its earliest date. It's the United Kingdom.\n\n4. We will check if the claim that \"sep , 1992 be the earliest date\" holds true for this identified date in the UK. The provided data supports the claim because 'september 14 , 1992' is indeed earlier than other dates with the same month and year in different countries.\n\n5. Finally, we need to verify if there are no other dates before 'september 14 , 1992'.
