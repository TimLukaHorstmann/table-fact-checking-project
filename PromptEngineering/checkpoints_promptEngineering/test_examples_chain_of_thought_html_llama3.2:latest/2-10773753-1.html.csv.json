Looking at the table, we can see that there are 12 teams with their respective names in the \"home team\" column.\n\n3. However, a team playing against itself (i.e., a draw or a no-score game) should not be counted as a separate match. There is only one row for each matchday, so if there was an additional team present that was part of another matchday, it would show up again in the list of teams.\n\n4. So we can simply take the number of rows (teams) without double counting the 'home' and 'away' columns because they will contain only 12 matches per row.\n\n5. This leads us to conclude that there are indeed 12 teams competing against each other in the 1955 Victorian Football League season.\n\n6.
