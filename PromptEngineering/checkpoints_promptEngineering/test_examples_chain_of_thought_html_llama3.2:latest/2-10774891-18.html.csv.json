    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. We need to determine if there are exactly two games where the crowd size is 10000.\n\n2. To do this, we'll go through each row of the table and extract the values from the \"crowd\" column.\n\n3. For each value, we'll compare it with 10000.\n\n4. If we find a value that matches exactly 10000, we'll keep track of it in a list.\n\n5. After going through all rows, if our list contains exactly two elements, then our claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n6. Now, let's go through the table and extract the relevant values:\n\n| row_index | column_name | crowd |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | crowd | 10000 |\n| 3 | crowd | 10000 |\n\nWe see that there are exactly two games with a crowd size of 10000.\n\n7.
