    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To evaluate the claim, we need to check if the Wildcats kept the opponent's scoreless in 4 games.\n\n2. Let's first look at column 'opponents' which shows the total points scored by each team during that game, and then we will find out the row index of the table where opponents have zero points.\n\n3. Column 'result' shows whether it was a win (W) or loss (L). We only need to check for wins since a win means Wildcats kept the opponent's scoreless.\n\n4. Now let's analyze each row in column 'date', and check if 'opponent's points' is zero, and 'result' is W:\n\n    - Sept 20: Wildcats lost with 7 points for opponents\n    - Sept 27: Opponent Cincinnati had no points and won \n    - Oct 4: Wildcats kept Xavier scoreless with 20 points for Wildcats\n    - Oct 11: Wildcats kept 9 Georgia scoreless with 26 points for Wildcats\n    - Oct 18: Wildcats lost to Vanderbilt with 0 points for opponent, but it was a loss not a win.\n    - Oct 25: Opponent Michigan State had no points and Wildcats won \n    - Nov 1: Wildcats lost to Alabama with 13 points for opponents\n    - Nov 8: Wildcats kept West Virginia scoreless with 15 points for Wildcats\n    - Nov 15: Wildcats kept Evansville scoreless with 36 points for Wildcats\n    - Nov 22: Wildcats lost to Tennessee with 13 points for opponents\n\n5. After checking all rows, we find that there are only 4 games where Wildcats kept the opponent's scoreless and won (sept 27, oct 11, oct 25, nov 8)\n\n6.

Therefore, on September 20th there was indeed a Wildcat game.\n\n2. Next, we need to verify if the Wildcats played 4 games in October.\n   - Looking at the table, rows 3-6 correspond to games played in October (row index 3 is game date 'oct 4' and row index 5 is game date 'oct 18'). Therefore, there were indeed 4 Wildcat games in October.\n\n3.

Specifically, we are interested in identifying rows where this difference is exactly 36.\n\n### Step 3: Examine row 9 for maximum scoring difference\nThe final row with data (row index 10) has a score difference of 30 (36 - 6), not 36. Therefore, the claim's validity hinges on finding an instance where the Wildcats outscored their opponent by exactly 36 points.\n\n### Step 4: Look for rows indicating the maximum scoring difference\nUpon reviewing row 9 again, it is noticed that there was a mistake in the initial interpretation of the data within that cell. The correct reading indicates '20' as Wildcats points and '0' as opponents points. This results in a score difference of 20.\n\n### Step 5: Re-evaluate rows for maximum scoring difference\nUpon re-examination, no row shows exactly 36 point lead; some show larger leads (e.g., 36 from row 9) than the stated maximum.",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for determining whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the column that contains the information about the number of points scored by Wildcats (opponents).\n2. Next, we need to find the row with the highest value in the \"wildcats points\" column.\n3. Then, we need to check if there are any rows where the difference between the Wildcats' score and the opponent's score is greater than 26 points.\n4. If such a row exists, then the claim is false; otherwise, it is true.\n\nHere is the code that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_html('table.html')[0]\n\n# Find the column with the highest value in the \"wildcats points\" column\nmax_points_column = df.loc[df['wildcats points'].idxmax()]\n\n# Check if there are any rows where the difference between the Wildcats' score and the opponent's score is greater than 26 points\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    if abs(int(row['wildcats points']) - int(row['opponents'])) > 26:\n        print(\"Claim is false\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"No such row exists. Claim is true.\")\n```\n\nThis script first reads the table into a Pandas DataFrame. Then it finds the column with the highest value in the \"wildcats points\" column and checks each row to see if there is a difference between the Wildcats' score and the opponent's score greater than 26 points.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Read table into DataFrame, find column with max wildcats points, check for rows where diff > 26, exit early on false found\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON output contains the steps taken to evaluate the claim, a final answer of `TRUE`, and the row index and column name of the relevant cell in the table.",
