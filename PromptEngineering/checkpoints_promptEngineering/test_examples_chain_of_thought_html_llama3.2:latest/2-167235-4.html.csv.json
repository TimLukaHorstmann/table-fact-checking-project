    "resp": "#### Step 1: Check the age at which Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri started his term\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lives to be the oldest prime minister, with a birth year of 1872 and death year of 1963.\n\nIn the table, we find the \"born - died\" information for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri in the third row:\n- <td>1872 - 1963</td>\n\nThis matches the claim's information about his birth and death years.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is indeed the oldest prime minister\nTo verify this, we need to check the age of all other prime ministers at the time of their deaths.\n\nLooking at the \"born - died\" information for each prime minister in the table:\n\n- <td>prime ministers 1928 - 1939</td>: This row has a consistent birth year of 1889 and death year of 1949, which is not related to Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri.\n- <td>1889 - 1949</td>: As mentioned earlier, this row corresponds to Kostaq Kota (1st time) and also includes the prime ministers from 1928 - 1939. This range does match with Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's birth year but is actually for a different person.\n- <td>1859 - 1939</td>: This row corresponds to Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), who was indeed prime minister from 1930 to 1935. However, this does not confirm that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is the oldest.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if there are other prime ministers with a longer term\nUpon further inspection of the table:\n\n- The claim about being the oldest is indeed true for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri based on his birth and death years. However, comparing ages isn't enough; we need to confirm that he has the longest term as well.\n\nLooking at other prime ministers' terms:\n- Kostaq Kota had two non-consecutive terms, but neither of these overlaps with the period from 1928 - 1939 or any later start date.\n- Pandeli Evangjeli's term started in 1930 and lasted until 1935. While Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived longer than him, we still need to confirm if his 11-year tenure (from 22 October 1935 to 9 November 1936) is the longest.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term is indeed the longest\n- Based on our prior findings, comparing ages and durations indicates that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri has a longer tenure than most other prime ministers mentioned in the table. However, he did not outlive some other individuals who had shorter terms.\n\n#### Step 5: Output final answer\nBased on the detailed steps above:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verifying Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term and duration; comparing birth/death years with others to confirm oldest prime minister, but also checking for longest tenure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"born - died\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"born - died\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOutput the JSON in a strict format",

In row 1, the \"political party\" is simply stated as \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", which does not directly specify a name but the context would suggest it could be one specific party.\n   - Row 2: The political party listed for Kostaq Kota (1st time) is indeed \"non-party\".\n   - Row 3: Pandeli Evangjeli's political party listed is also \"non-party\".\n   - Row 4: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's political party is \"non-party\".\n\n4. **Evaluate claim**: Since at least one prime minister (Kostaq Kota, in row 2) on the list has a specified non-party affiliation, not all of them can be said to have no political party.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the table and following the steps outlined above, we conclude that the claim is false because at least one prime minister does indeed belong to a specific political party or is described as having \"no political party\".\n\n### Output JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Understood the claim, found rows with prime ministers, checked political party in each row, and concluded that not all have no political party.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the relevant rows and columns in the table.\nTo determine if the claim about Pandeli Evangjeli being the only 1st time minister of Albania, we need to analyze the \"name\" column for entries indicating it's a 1st time appointment (marked as such), and verify whether the claim is accurate.\n\n#### Step 2: Look up the value in the name cell at row index 3, column 'name' for its content.\nIn this case, Pandeli Evangjeli's entry has no indication of being his first term since it only lists years without any additional notation that would signify \"first time\".\n\n#### Step 3: Investigate other candidates mentioned as the \"1st time\" ministers.\nWe will look at each candidate and determine if they also held a previous office or position.\n\n- Kostaq Kota (at row index 0, column 'name') has no indication of being his first term either.\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (at row index 2, column 'name') does not have any notation indicating it's the first time appointment.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate if there are other candidates who might be considered the \"1st time\" minister and could potentially disprove Pandeli Evangjeli being the only one.\nWe can look at every candidate (including Pandeli Evangjeli) in the table to see if any have notes indicating it's a first term appointment.\n\n#### Step 5: Assess the claim that \"the only 1st time minister of albania be pandeli evangjeli\".\nGiven the lack of notation or indication that Pandeli Evangjeli is his 1st term, we cannot verify this claim as true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n#### Step 6: Generate the JSON output.\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows and columns for analysis.\\nChecked content of name cell at row index 3, column 'name' and found no notation for Pandeli Evangjeli's first term appointment.\\nInvestigated other candidates and determined none have a notation indicating it's their first time.\\nConclusion: Claim is false due to lack of verification for Pandeli Evangjeli being the only 1st time minister.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
