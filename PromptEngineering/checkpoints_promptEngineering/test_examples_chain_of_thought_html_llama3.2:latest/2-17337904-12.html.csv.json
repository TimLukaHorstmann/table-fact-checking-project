We need to focus on the \"name\", \"title\", and \"royal house\" columns.\n\n2. Analyze the rows related to Song and Wey:\n   - For Song (song, sovereign, li, duke), the value in the \"title\" column is \"duke\".\n   - For Wey (wey, sovereign, li, marquis), the value in the \"title\" column is \"marquis\".\n\n3. Analyze the claim: The claim states that \"Li be the name for both the duke of Song and the marquis of Wey\". In this context, \"be\" implies equality.\n\n4. Check if Li appears as a title:\n   - The table does not explicitly list a title called \"Li\" with any state or royal house.\n   - However, there is an entry where \"Li\" appears in the \"name\" column (song, sovereign, li) and it has the value of duke. Then there's another Li entry which holds for marquis of Wey (wey, sovereign, li), but again not as a title.\n\n5. Determine the claim's validity: Given that the table does list two entries with \"Li\" in the name column, where one is associated with a duke (Song) and the other with a marquis (Wey), it appears that Li indeed holds for both roles based on its appearance in those rows.\n \n6.
