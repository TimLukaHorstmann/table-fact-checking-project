Check if any of these schools are located in the \"Norsewood\" area:\n   - After examining each location, we find that Norsewood and Districts School is indeed located within the Norsewood area.\n   - However, since only one school (Norsewood and Districts) directly meets the criteria given by the claim and not all of them are found to be in the \"norsewood\" area, we need to further refine the statement. The school with a number '5' has been found to have Norsewood as its location which could meet the requirement if interpreted strictly.\n\n4. Determine the relevance of each cell:\n   - The following cells are relevant: \n     {\n       \"row_index\": 14,\n       \"column_name\": \"Norsewood and districts school\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 26,\n       \"column_name\": \"St Joseph's School\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 15,\n       \"column_name\": \"Norsewood and Districts school\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 23,\n       \"column_name\": \"St Anthony's School\"\n     },\n\n5. Evaluate the claim:\n   - Since there are schools with their locations that contain a number '5' and one of them is indeed located in the Norsewood area, the given statement can be considered true.\n\n6. Conclude that since there is an instance where 5 is found to be associated with school being located in \"Norsewood\" region, it fulfills the claim.\n \n7. Output:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"The table has two schools named with '5' followed by a space and their location starts with number that includes a digit '5'\", \"Among those schools only Norsewood and Districts School is found to be in the norsewood area\", \"However, this can be argued as meeting the criteria when considering if any other school numbers are included\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 14,\n         \"column_name\": \"Norsewood and districts school\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 26,\n         \"column_name\": \"St Joseph's School\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 15,\n         \"column_name\": \"Norsewood and Districts school\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 23,\n         \"column_name\": \"St Anthony's School\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",
