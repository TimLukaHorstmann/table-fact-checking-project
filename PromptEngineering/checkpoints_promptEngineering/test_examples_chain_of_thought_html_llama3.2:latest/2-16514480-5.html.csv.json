This means that Frank Nobilo is actually 8 strokes behind par, not within 2 of the leader.\n\n3. **Locate Davis Love III's Score**: Look at the table to find Davis Love III's score, which is listed as `72 + 71 + 74 + 68 = 285` under the \"score\" column.\n\n4. **Calculate Distance from Par for Davis Love III**: Calculate Davis Love III's distance from par by subtracting his total score (285) and his to-par value (-3).

To verify if South Africa has a player tied for 3rd, 5th, or 7th place, we need to examine the scores of other players tied for these positions.\n\n5.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim: \"frank nobilo and davis love iii be within 3 stroke of each other\". This means we need to check if the scores of Frank Nobilo and Davis Love III are close enough to have at least one of them leading by 3 strokes or trailing by 3 strokes.\n\n2. We can start by looking at the score columns for both players in the table.\n\n3. For Frank Nobilo, his total score is listed as \"71 + 71 + 72 + 69 = 283\". This means he scored a total of 283 strokes.\n\n4. Similarly, for Davis Love III, his total score is also \"72 + 71 + 74 + 68 = 285\". However, since this is the same row with different players listed below it in the table (due to 't7'), we need to look at the other 't7' row which lists Davis's score as \"75 + 66 + 73 + 71 = 285\", but a later row for the same player has score of \"72+70+72+74=288\". This is not 3 stroke difference.\n\n5. Now, we can use the scores to calculate their position in relation to each other. We will compare their total strokes with the par (in this case -12). The one who had lower total strokes will be ahead by that amount of strokes and the one who scored more strokes will be behind by that same amount.\n\n6. Frank Nobilo's score is 283 and his par is -12. Therefore, he needs to have a stroke count below or equal to 283-(-12)=295. Since he did not meet this requirement, we must look at the other player who was also in 't7', which has total strokes of \"288\". But since that is more than what Frank Nobilo scored, he cannot be behind by 3 strokes either.\n\n7. Next we can compare each players stroke count to determine if they are within a difference of 3 strokes. This will involve going back through all rows for both players in the table.\n\n8. After re-examining the table, I noticed that there is another 't7' row with player Jeff Maggert listed above the one with Davis Love III and below the \"t7\" row for Corey Pavin. Jeff's total strokes were 71+73+72+69=285 which we already verified to not be a difference of 3.\n\n9. Next, I re-examine Frank Nobilo's row (4th), the column corresponding to \"score\" shows that his score is indeed 283.\n\n10. Now let us see if there are any other rows for either player in 't7' which may provide more data on whether or not they were within a stroke of one another. After re-examining all rows in this section, we still cannot verify the claim stated.\n\n11. Given that no other information exists about these players and their positions relative to Frank Nobilo's position (which is also the same row as Davis Love III), it can be concluded that there is insufficient data for a definitive answer.\n\n12. However, based on step 6, we were able to verify that neither of them are at least 3 stroke behind each other but one player was only 2 strokes behind the other by the end of their rounds.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check Frank Nobilo and Davis Love III scores\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Compare each players stroke count to determine if they are within a difference of 3 strokes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Look at other rows for both players in the table\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
