    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the earliest round date\nThe table has a column for 'date', which indicates dates in various formats (e.g., month year). We will focus on the month-year representation to compare between rounds. The first row provides us with the 'earliest round' date as \"31 January 1885\". \n\n### Step 2: Identify the latest round date\nFrom the same table, looking at the next rows for dates after and including the one in the earliest round:\n- \"14 February 1885\" (the second row) is later than \"31 January 1885\".\n- \"7 March 1885\" (the third row) follows.\n- \"18 April 1885\" (the fourth row), \"25 April 1885\" (the fifth row), and others are also later than the earliest round.\n\nSo, the latest round date is indeed after \"31 January 1885\".\n\n### Step 3: Convert dates into a comparable format\nTo compare between these different month-year formats, we can convert them to standard formats. However, since we're only concerned with months (to determine if there's at least one month difference), converting isn't strictly necessary. The dates are already in a format that makes comparison straightforward.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the number of months between the earliest and latest round\nGiven the sequence:\n- January to February represents 1 month,\n- February to March also represents 1 month,\n- March to April represents 2 months, as there's an \"April\" after a continuous \"March\".\n\nThus, from \"January 1885\" to \"April 1885\", adding up these intervals gives us at least 4 months (one for January, one for February, and two more for the gap between those months until April).\n\n### Step 5: Conclude based on comparison\nSince there are at least 3 months of difference between the earliest round date (\"31 January 1885\") and the latest round date (\"18 April 1885\"), with additional intervals beyond that point, we can safely say there are indeed more than 3 months between these rounds.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the dates for both earliest and latest rounds, converted them if necessary to ensure correct comparison, counted the intervals between these rounds, concluded based on this count\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we need to determine the number of months between these two dates.\n   - To do this, let's first convert both dates into a format that can be easily compared. We'll use a standard date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency.\n\n3. Converting January 31st, 1885, to YYYY-MM-DD:\n   - Year: 1885\n   - Month: January = 01\n   - Day: 31\n\n4. Converting April 25th, 1885, to YYYY-MM-DD:\n   - Year: 1885\n   - Month: April = 04\n   - Day: 25\n\n5. Now we can find the number of months between these two dates by counting forward.\n   - January (01) is the first month after December of 1884.\n   - February (02) comes next, followed by March (03).\n   - So, if we start from January and move forward until we reach April, we have 3 months in total.\n\n6.
