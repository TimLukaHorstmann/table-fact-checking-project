This means we should consider all rows starting from this point.\n\n2. Next, for each relevant row (i.e., rows where the \"class\" equals \"250cc\"), we need to find the year with the highest number of points.\n   - We look at the \"points\" column in the relevant rows:\n     - Row index: 0\n       Column name: \"points\"\n     - Row index: 1\n       Column name: \"points\"\n     - Row index: 2\n       Column name: \"points\"\n     - ...\n   - The row(s) with the highest number of points should be our target.
