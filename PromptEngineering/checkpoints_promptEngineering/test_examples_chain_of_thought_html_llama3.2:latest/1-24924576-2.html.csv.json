We will count only knockout losses as \"lacking defense\".\n4. **Calculate the percentage of times Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense**:\n\t* Count the total number of fights (wins + losses + draws).\n\t* Count the number of fights where Manny Pacquiao lacked defense (knockout losses + draws).\n\t* Calculate the percentage of fights where Manny Pacquiao lacked defense by dividing the count from step 4 by the total count from step 3, and multiplying by 100.\n5. **Evaluate the claim**: Compare the calculated percentage with the claim's assertion that Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense 50% of the time.\n\n#### Code to calculate the relevant data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the HTML table into a pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_html('table.html')[0]\n\n# Extract the relevant columns\nwins = df['result'].str.extract('(\\d+)/\\d+').astype(int)\nlosses = df[df['result'].str.contains('ko')]  # Knockout losses\ndraws = df[df['result'].str.contains('sd')]  # Draws\n\n# Calculate the total number of fights, wins, and draws\ntotal_fights = len(df) + len(draws)\nwins = sum(wins)\nlosses = len(losses)\n\n# Calculate the percentage of times Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense\ndefense_percentage = (losses / total_fights) * 100\n\nprint(\"Defense percentage:\", defense_percentage)\n```\n\n#### Step-by-Step Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted relevant data from the table, counted fights with knockout losses and draws, calculated the percentage of times Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense, and compared it to the claim's assertion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the actual output may vary depending on the content of the table and the code used to extract the data.",

In this case, we're interested in finding winning bouts with a TKO result.\n\n3. Analyze each row to determine if it meets the criteria:\n   - For the first condition: The row must have Manny Pacquiao's name and a date that is greater than 1998-12-04.\n   - For the second condition: The row must have a \"TKO\" in the result column.\n\n4. Check for winning bouts by verifying if Manny Pacquiao has won (i.e., he did not lose) according to the result:\n   - Winning bout means the opponent's name is listed as Chatchai Sasakul or Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, but also since both were knocked out it can be considered a win.\n\n\n\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that Manny Pacquiao has the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\n2. **Locate relevant data**: We need to find the bouts between Manny Pacquiao and Marco Antonio Barrera in the table. \n\n   - For the first match (WBC Featherweight), we see that:\n     - Opponent: Juan Manuel Marquez (not Marco Antonio Barrera, but this seems to be a typo)\n     - Result: SD 12/12\n     - Defenses: 0\n\n    - However, another bout exists in 2003 where:\n       - Manny Pacquiao fights Marco Antonio Barrera for the WBC Featherweight title.\n       - Result: TKO 11/12\n       - Defenses: 2\n\n\n   - We should also look at other relevant bouts of Manny Pacquiao but it seems like he had more successful defenses against Juan Manuel Marquez.\n\n\n\n3. **Compare defenses**: Now we need to compare the number of defenses for these two matches.\n   - The match with Marco Antonio Barrera has a defense count of 2.\n   - The match with Juan Manuel Marquez has a defense count of 0.\n\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Comparing the number of defenses in both matches, Manny Pacquiao had more successful defenses against Juan Manuel Marquez than against Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the claim that Manny Pacquiao has the biggest difference in score point during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera. Locate the relevant data from the table and compare the number of defenses in both matches. The match between Juan Manuel Marquez was not a direct opponent to Barrera but another contender.  Conclude that since Barrera had less defense than Pacquiao, and given how many opponents he faced in his career who have beaten him, the difference is more significant. Therefore, the statement about Barrera having fewer defenses than Pacqiuao could be considered false in comparison to other bouts with similar opponents but still holds true for these two matches.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"}\n  ]\n}",
