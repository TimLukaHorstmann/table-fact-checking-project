Since there are multiple instances of players with the same name (e.g., LeBron James), we will consider all instances as part of a single entity.\n3. We should identify which rows belong to different players with the same name by checking their corresponding values in other columns that can be used to distinguish between them, such as the team name or game date.\n4. After identifying unique instances of players, we need to calculate the total number of steals and blocks for each player across all relevant cells.\n\n#### Code:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = [...]; // assume data is the table data\n\n// Function to count steals and blocks per row\nfunction countStealsBlocks(row) {\n  const steals = parseInt(row[10]);\n  const blocks = parseInt(row[11]);\n  return { steals, blocks };\n}\n\n// Group by player name (only consider relevant rows)\nconst players = [];\ndata.forEach((row, index) => {\n  if (\n    !players.find(\n      (player) =>\n        player.name === row[8] || player.teamName === row[6]\n    )\n  ) {\n    players.push({ name: row[8], teamName: row[6] });\n  }\n});\n\n// Count steals and blocks for each player\nconst playerStats = {};\nplayers.forEach((player) => {\n  const stats = data.reduce((acc, row) => {\n    if (row.name === player.name && row.teamName === player.teamName) {\n      acc[0].steals += parseInt(row[10]);\n      acc[0].blocks += parseInt(row[11]);\n    }\n    return acc;\n  }, [{ steals: 0, blocks: 0 }, { steals: 0, blocks: 0 }]);\n\n  // Update player stats\n  const averageStats = {\n    steals: Math.round(stats[0].steals / data.length),\n    blocks: Math.round(stats[1].blocks / data.length),\n  };\n  playerStats[player.name] = averageStats;\n});\n\n// Find the player with the highest number of steals and blocks\nconst maxStealsBlocksPlayer =\n  Object.keys(playerStats).reduce((max, current) => {\n    const stats = playerStats[current];\n    if (stats.steals > playerStats[max].steals && stats.blocks > playerStats[max].blocks) {\n      return current;\n    }\n    return max;\n  }, \"John\");\n\n// Check the statement\nconst answer =\n  playerStats[maxStealsBlocksPlayer].steals >\n  playerStats[\n    Object.keys(playerStats).find(\n      (player) => player !== maxStealsBlocksPlayer,\n    )\n  ].steals &&\n  playerStats[maxStealsBlocksPlayer].blocks >\n  playerStats[\n    Object.keys(playerStats).find(\n      (player) => player !== maxStealsBlocksPlayer,\n    )\n  ].blocks\n    ? \"TRUE\"\n    : \"FALSE\";\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify({\n  chain_of_thought:\n    \"Group by player name and count steals and blocks per row. Group by team to identify unique players with the same name. Find the player with the highest number of steals and blocks.\",\n  answer,\n  relevant_cells: [\n    {\n      row_index: data.findIndex(\n        (row) =>\n          (row[8] === maxStealsBlocksPlayer && row[6] ===\n            Object.keys(playerStats).find((player) => player !== maxStealsBlocksPlayer))\n      ),\n      column_name: \"Name\",\n    },\n    {\n      row_index: data.findIndex(\n        (row) =>\n          (row[8] === maxStealsBlocksPlayer &&\n            row[6] ===\n              Object.keys(playerStats).find((player) => player !== maxStealsBlocksPlayer))\n      ),\n      column_name: \"Blocks\",\n    },\n  ],\n}));\n```\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Group by player name and count steals and blocks per row. Group by team to identify unique players with the same name. Find the player with the highest number of steals and blocks.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      row_index: 34,\n      column_name: \"Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      row_index: 44,\n      column_name: \"Blocks\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
