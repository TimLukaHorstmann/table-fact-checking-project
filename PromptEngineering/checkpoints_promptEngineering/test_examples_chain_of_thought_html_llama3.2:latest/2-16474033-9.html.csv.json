We need to look for rows where:\n- The opponent matches Tobias Kamke.\n- The surface is hard.\n- The score matches 2 - 6 , 5 - 7.\n\n#### Step 3: Check Each Row Against Claim's Criteria\n\n- For the first condition (opponent), we see that in row 13, the opponent is indeed Tobias Kamke.\n- For the second condition (surface), in row 13, the surface is hard, which matches our claim.\n- For the third condition (score), row 13 shows a score of 2 - 6 , 5 - 7.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince all conditions match row 13 in the table, we can conclude that the claim about Cipolla losing to Tobias Kamke with this specific score on hard surface is true.\n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified key information of the claim (opponent, surface, score) and found match in the table where all conditions are met.

Search for the cell with \"Czech Republic\" in the column \"tournament\". The first row that matches this condition is the fourth row (index 3) where \"Prost\u011bjov , czech republic\" appears in the column \"tournament\". However, we also need to check if Cipolla lost a match in Prost\u011bjov. Looking at the same row for the cell \"score\", it contains \"6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 0\". Since this is not a loss, it does not fulfill our requirement.\n\n### Step 3: Check if Cipolla lost a match in the UK\nSearch for the cell with \"UK\" in the column \"tournament\". The first row that matches this condition is the sixth row (index 5) where \"Loughborough , uk\" appears in the column \"tournament\". Now, check the same row for the cell \"score\", which contains \"2 - 6 , 5 - 7\". This indicates a loss.\n\n### Step 4: Check if Cipolla lost a match in France\nSearch for the cell with \"France\" in the column \"tournament\". The first row that matches this condition is the eighth row (index 7) where \"Saint - r\u00e9my - de - provence , france\" appears in the column \"tournament\". Now, check the same row for the cell \"score\", which contains \"4 - 6 , 5 - 7\".
