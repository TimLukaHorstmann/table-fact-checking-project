Now we need to check the claim about it being one of two such games.\n\n#### Step 5: Examine Hawthorn's and Fitzroy's data for additional matches with a crowd of 11000\n- Hawthorn vs. North Melbourne does not have 11000 in the \"crowd\" column (4000).\nWe've found another match that has a crowd of 11000.

Now that we have both scores, we can compare them to see if there's a difference of at least 5.4 points between Footscray and Collingwood's away team scores.\n   - Calculation: footscray_away_team_score = 3.5 (lower than) vs collingwood_away_team_score = 8.9 (higher)\n   - Difference: 8.9 - 3.5 = 5.4\n\n4.

For Fitzroy: 58 is lower than 10.0. So we do nothing (not incrementing).\n4. For Richmond: 66 is higher than 10.0. So we increment the counter by 1.\n5. For Geelong: 52 is lower than 10.0. So we do nothing (not incrementing).\n6. For Essendon: 81 is higher than 10.0. So we increment the counter by 1.\n7. For South Melbourne: 72 is higher than 10.0. So we increment the counter by 1.\n\nSo, there are three teams with a score higher than 10.0.\n\nNow let's calculate half of the total number of teams:\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nSince the count of teams with scores higher than 10.0 (3) is equal to half of the total number of teams (3), we can conclude that the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"First, we need to count how many teams have a score higher than 10.0.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"We will go through each row of the table to check if the home team's score is higher than 10.0.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"If the condition in step 2 is met for any team, we will increment a counter.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"After checking all rows, we will count how many teams have a score higher than 10.0 and compare it with half of the total number of teams.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}",
