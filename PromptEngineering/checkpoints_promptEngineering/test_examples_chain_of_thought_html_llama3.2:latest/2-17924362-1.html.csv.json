Since San Diego Stadium hosts the Chargers and not the Broncos, this might be an error or misinterpretation based on the provided information.\n   \n5. **Correct Interpretation Based on Table Structure**:\n   - The actual relevant games for Denver Broncos are those listed in rows 1 through 8 of the table, as these correspond to their schedule.\n\n6. **Find Lowest Attendance**:\n   - Check each row (1-8) for the lowest attendance value.\n   - In row #9, we notice a game also played by the Chargers at San Diego Stadium but this is not our focus. Row #9 does provide us with an attendance figure of 26048.\n\n7. **Conclusion on Lowest Attendance**:\n   - Upon inspecting the table, it's clear that there isn't a specific row for Denver Broncos in the provided data. However, since we have to find the lowest attendance value, let's consider what could be the most plausible conclusion based on given data.\n   \n8. **Correct Identification of Lowest Attendance Game**:\n   - Since the Broncos' games are not explicitly listed within rows 1-8 that directly include their opponent as well (like row #9 for Chargers), we must infer based solely on provided attendance data.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not directly list Denver Broncos' game details, but attendance figures are given.

However, since there's no season explicitly mentioned besides \"october,\" we have to look at each column and see if any other clues help us deduce the answer.\n\n5. **Check attendance columns**: There is a lack of time data (only month/day) provided but one row does show an event year that can be inferred (e.g., `november 9`). Thus, finding which games were played in what season requires careful analysis of each game's details and potential correlation with events outside the table.\n\n6. **Determine if Denver Broncos ever scored 21 points or more**: We must review all columns to figure out when Denver Bronco scored highest amount of points against other team while losing.",
