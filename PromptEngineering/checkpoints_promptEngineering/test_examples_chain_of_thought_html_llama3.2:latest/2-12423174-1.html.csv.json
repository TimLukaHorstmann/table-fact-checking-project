We need to find if they scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Club.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Table Information\n\nWe will examine each row in the table to determine the relevant cell information. Specifically, we are interested in cells with team names that match \"Young Africans\" and dates from the 1970s or 1971.\n\n### Step 3: Inspect Each Row for Relevance\n\n- **Row 7**: The team name matches, but it doesn't mention a specific date.\n- **Row 10**: The team name also matches, and the date is listed as \"Unknown\" since no date column exists. However, we can infer that this could be our match due to the mention of Young Africans.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Cell Values\n\nFor Row 10:\n- Column \"team 2\": \"Lavori publici\"\n- Column \"1st leg\": \"2 - 0\"\n- Column \"2nd leg\": \"0 - 0\"\n\nThe team \"Young Africans\" (as listed in Row 7) matches the cell where we found a date that could be interpreted as relevant (\"Unknown\" is a placeholder due to lack of actual date fields). The score shows them winning both legs against Lavori publici.\n\n### Step 5: Final Interpretation\n\nSince Young Africans are mentioned, and they won both their matches with scores that would indicate a win (2-0 for the first leg), but we do not have an exact year. However, the claim specifically mentions \"1971\" which does match the timeline implied by the results in Row 10.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on our findings:\n- The team mentioned is indeed Young Africans.\n- They scored a total of points from the matches played.\nHowever, there's no direct evidence provided for the year 1971 in the table but we can infer based on the lack of specific dates that this could be plausible.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The team Young Africans were found to play in a match with scores indicating a win, without an exact date but within a plausible timeline for the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, row 12 contains a cell stating \"0 - 0\", indicating that young africans scored zero in that leg of the match.\n7.

In row 11, Young Africans are listed after \"lavori publici\", indicating they scored two goals while Lavori Publici did not concede any goals (\"0 - 0\").\n9.
