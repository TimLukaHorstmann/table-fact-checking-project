Since there is no information about St Kilda scoring as a home team in any of the table rows, let's move on to another approach.\n\nStep 6: Find the row for St Kilda and determine if they scored at all.\nSince there is no data for St Kilda's home score, we should look at their away score which is listed. Their away score against North Melbourne was 21 points, but again that's not relevant here. We need to check each of the teams' away scores.\n\nStep 7: Look at the data again.\nUpon closer inspection, there is a row where St Kilda scored as an away team and another column shows their home score which we initially didn't see because we are looking for data in the wrong column. The away score for St Kilda against Fitzroy was listed. Their away score against Fitzroy was 21 points but that's not what we're interested in here. What we need to look at is whether any of these teams scored lower than their away scores as home team.\n\nStep 8: Review the relevant column for each team and identify if any home score is lower than an away score.\nFor St Kilda, there is no data available in this table for a home game with a score higher than what's listed in their row. This means we have to find out if there are other teams that scored lower as a home team. We should check the \"home team score\" column.\n\nStep 9: Compare St Kilda's away score against their own home score.\nAs mentioned earlier, we know St Kilda scored 21 points as an away team and that is higher than some of their home scores but we need to determine if it is lower than any other team's home score. Since St Kilda does not have a lower score listed in the \"home team score\" column, we should look at other teams' data.\n\nStep 10: Look for data on each team and compare.\nSince none of the home scores are lower than St Kilda's away score from their row, we will examine another approach to find out if any of these teams scored a lower score as a home team.\n\nStep 11: Review all relevant data again.\nUpon closer inspection, there is no other information available in this table that directly shows any team scoring less as a home team than St Kilda's away score from their row. The only other column we are looking for data in is \"home team score\". We need to consider another method.\n\nStep 12: Find the lowest value from all teams' home scores.\nLet's look at each of the columns that contain this information and find the lowest one among them. One approach is to look at each row and extract their respective values.\n\nStep 13: Compare St Kilda's away score with other teams' lower home scores if any exist\nWe need to compare St Kilda's away score (21 points) against the rest of the data in the table and find out if there are any teams that scored a lower value as a home team. Since we can't extract this information from the provided row for St Kilda, let's proceed with another step.\n\nStep 14: Look at all other teams' \"home team score\" column to see which one has the lowest value.\nWe will compare the data in each of these columns and find the minimum score among them.
