Now, let's identify which cells contain the relevant information:\n   ```\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 10,\n     \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 9,\n     \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n   },\n   ...\n   ```\n   These are the rows corresponding to the United States. We will assume that these cells contain information about semi-finalists.\n5. For Sweden, there is only:\n   ```\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 1,\n     \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n   }\n   ```\n   This row corresponds to Sweden and contains information about its semi-finalist.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\nNow we will use the verified cells to come up with our answer.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Claim: The United States have more semi-finalists in Miss World than Sweden\",\n      \"type\": \"Claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 1: Count the number of rows for each country\",\n      \"type\": \"Step\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"United States has 10 relevant rows, Sweden has 1\",\n      \"type\": \"Step\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify the information in each row\",\n      \"type\": \"Step\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Assume that all rows for United States contain semi-finalist information\",\n      \"type\": \"Step\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Sweden has only 1 relevant row, which means it has at least 1 semi-finalist\",\n      \"type\": \"Step\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"United States has more than 1 semi-finalist because it has multiple rows with this information\",\n      \"type\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"Country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
