Find all championship scores: We need to look at each row in the table and extract the values of column 'd' since it represents the championship score.\n\n2. Compare each score to find the highest one: After extracting all the scores, we compare them to find the highest value. According to the data, the highest championship score is indeed 284 by Steve Brady in 1993.\n\n3. Check if there is a champion with a score of 284: Since we found that the highest championship score is 284, we need to verify that there is an entry with this value. The cell (32, 'd') has the value '284', confirming that there is indeed a champion with this score.\n\nTherefore, our answer is TRUE since there is a championship score of 284 by Steve Brady in 1993.",
