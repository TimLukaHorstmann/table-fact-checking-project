Compare the calculated difference with the given claim that \"england have 2 more individual win than south africa at the world golf championship\":\n   - Since the calculated difference matches the claim, we need to determine if this is a correct relationship.\n\n4. Re-evaluate the table data for England and South Africa:\n   - England has 1 team wins.\n   - South Africa has 2 team wins.\n\n5. Compare the number of team wins between England and South Africa:\n   - Since South Africa has more team wins than England, it contradicts the claim that \"england have 2 more individual win than south africa at the world golf championship\". However, we initially found a difference in individual wins, which doesn't necessarily contradict this. We need to reconcile this.\n\n6. Re-evaluate the claim:\n   - The claim is referring to individual wins, not team wins. Thus, England having \"2 more individual wins\" than South Africa does align with our initial calculation of individual wins (4 for England and 2 for South Africa).\n\n7.
