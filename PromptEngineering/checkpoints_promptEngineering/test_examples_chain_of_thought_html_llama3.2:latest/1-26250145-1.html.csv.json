We need to check if Didid Benami sang the song 'Angel' before singing 'Lean On Me'.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the correct sequence of songs\nWe look for rows where 'Angel' is in the 'song choice' column. The relevant row with 'angel' in the song choice column is:\n```\n<tr>\n    <td>hollywood</td>\n    <td>second solo</td>\n    <td>angel</td>\n    <td>sarah mclachlan</td>\n    <td>n / a</td>\n    <td>advanced</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the correct sequence of songs\nWe look for rows where 'Lean On Me' is in the 'song choice' column. The relevant row with 'lean on me' in the song choice column is:\n```\n<tr>\n    <td>top 20 (10 women)</td>\n    <td>billboard hot 100 hits</td>\n    <td>lean on me</td>\n    <td>bill withers</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>safe</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Compare song sequences\n'Angel' is in the second row, while 'Lean On Me' is in the fourth row.
