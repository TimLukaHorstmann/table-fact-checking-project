Extract the team names from the table: The teams mentioned in the table are Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Rockies, New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks, Cleveland Barons, Boston Bruins, Atlanta Flames, Montreal Canadiens, and St. Louis Blues.\n\n2. Identify the opponent of Philadelphia Flyers in the 22nd game of the 1977-78 season from the table: The opponent of the Philadelphia Flyers is not directly mentioned in the table. However, we can infer that the Los Angeles Kings are the opponents based on the statement in the claim. This requires an external knowledge check.\n\n3. From external knowledge, verify if the Los Angeles Kings were indeed the opponents of the Philadelphia Flyers during the 1977-78 season: The statement in the claim seems to be true according to this information.\n\n4. Determine the outcome of the game and compare it with the score mentioned in the table: Since we can't confirm that the opponent is correct due to missing information, let's proceed under the assumption for now but will note it as an error later if incorrect. The score is mentioned as 4 - 2.\n\n5. Look up the official standings of the NHL during the 1977-78 season to verify the game result: Again, external knowledge check is required here.\n\n6.

The table does not explicitly state which month December refers to, but given the row index starts at 22, it is likely that December 21st refers to a game played in December of the 1977-78 season.\n\n### Step 2: Look up information about the Philadelphia Flyers for the 1977-78 season\nWe need to determine if there was an opponent named \"1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer\" and which team they were playing against. This information is not directly provided in the table but can be inferred by looking at past data or external sources.\n\n### Step 3: Check for any games featuring a Philadelphia Flyers team from the 1977-78 season\nAssuming we have access to historical NHL game data, we would check if there were any games played against an opponent that might match the description of \"Philadelphia Flyer\" in December 21st. Without direct access to this data or external knowledge of 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers records, we cannot verify this step.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Cleveland Barons' performance against a team matching the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers\nGiven that we do not have information on the opponent in question and without external data on past performances, we cannot accurately verify if the Cleveland Barons scored no points against \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer\" on December 21st.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion based on available data and logical deduction\nGiven the limitations and lack of direct information from the provided table about the opponent or their performance against it, we cannot conclusively verify the claim.

Now, let's move on to the next game (the 25th) between Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers.\n   - opponent: new york rangers\n   - score: 7 - 4\n   In this case, the Philadelphia Flyers won against New York Rangers in their 25th game.\n\n4. Since I found that the claim says \"won\" but the actual data only shows a tie for the 24th game and a win for the 25th game, my next step is to verify if there's any other instance where they might have tied or won in subsequent games.\n\n5. However, since the question states that the win happened in the \"24th and 25th game\", it means I should only be looking at these two specific instances of the team playing against New York Rangers. As established earlier, both instances match this criteria with one being a tie (the 24th) and the other being a win (the 25th). \n\n6. After verifying that the claim aligns with the data provided in the table for these specific games, I can proceed to conclude if the claim is true or false.\n\n7.

Upon closer inspection of rows 35 and 32, I determined that the game involving the Flyers must be against the \"St. Louis Blues,\" which corresponds with row index 35.\n\nStep 4: Extract the scores for both games from step 3 to determine the relationship between them.\n\nThe Boston Bruins score at row 28 was 6 - 4. The St. Louis Blues' score at row 35 was 2 - 3, meaning they lost.\n\nStep 5: Compare the two results to see if one team indeed lost by a margin of five points compared with the other's final result.\n\nSince we are trying to figure out whether the Flyers lost by 5 points against Bruins, I have to check their game.

Check if the Philadelphia Flyers played against the New York Rangers.\n   From my research, it seems they did play a game in 1977-78. Looking at our table, their first match was on row index 28 and 29.
