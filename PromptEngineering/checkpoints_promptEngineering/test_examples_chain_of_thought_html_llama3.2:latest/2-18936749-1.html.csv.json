The table shows that Culver Community's IHSAA class is also \"a\".\n\n### Step 3: Determine if Bremen and Culver Community are in Different Classes\nSince both Bremen and Culver Community have different IHSAA classes (\"aa\" vs \"a\"), it appears they might be in different classes. However, we must examine the table more closely to ensure there isn't any overlap.\n\n### Step 4: Examine IHSAA Class Details for Potential Overlap or Error\nA closer look at the table reveals that both Bremen and Culver Community are classified under IHSAA class \"a\", not different classes as initially inferred. This is crucial in determining the accuracy of the claim made about their respective IHSAA classifications.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion Based on Analysis\nGiven the analysis, it's clear that Bremen and Culver Community do not fall into different IHSAA classes; they share the same classification (\"a\").
