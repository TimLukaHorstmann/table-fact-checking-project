    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Extract the values from cells `du g\u00f6r mig heligen`, `charlie` and `d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5` (song) from the table.\n\n   - The value of cell 'du g\u00f6r mig heligen' is 56.\n   - The value of cell 'charlie' is 12.\n   - The value of cell 'd\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5' is 68.\n\n\n2. Compare these values to determine if `du G\u00f6r mig Heligen` has more points than 'Charlie' and 'D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel H\u00e4lsar P\u00e5'. To do this we must convert the data-type from string to a number.\n\n   - Convert value of cell 'du g\u00f6r mig heligen' from string '56' to integer 56.\n   - Convert value of cell 'charlie' from string '12' to integer 12\n   - Convert value of cell 'd\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5' from string '68' to integer 68\n\n3. Compare these numbers:\n    - The number for 'du G\u00f6r mig Heligen' is 56.\n    - The number for 'Charlie' is 12.\n    - The number for 'D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel H\u00e4lsar P\u00e5' is 68.\n\n4. Determine if `du G\u00f6r mig Heligen` has more points than both Charlie and D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5:\n    - Since the values for 'D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel H\u00e4lsar P\u00e5' (68) are greater than for 'Charlie'(12), it is true that 'du G\u00f6r mig Heligen' have more point than charlie. Also since 56 is less than 68, du g\u00f6r mig heligen has fewer points than 'd\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5'.\n\n5. Determine if `du G\u00f6r mig Heligen` have more points than Charlie and D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel H\u00e4lsar P\u00e5:\n    - Since du G\u00f6r mig Heligen (56) is less than D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel H\u00e4lsar P\u00e5 (68), the statement is false.\n\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extract values from table to compare point value of 'du g\u00f6r mig heligen' and 'Charlie' and 'd\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5'. Compare these numbers determine if du G\u00f6r mig Heligen have more points than both Charlie and D\u00e4r En \u00c4ngel H\u00e4lsar P\u00e5. Since 56 is less than 68, the statement is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
