Check the value of the column \"margin of victory\" for Liselotte Neumann's winning score. If it is not \"playoff\", then the claim is false.\n4. Verify if there are any other rows where Liselotte Neumann won without a playoff.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- Step 1: Go to the table and find the row where Liselotte Neumann won the tournament.\nThe relevant row index of this row is 6.\nThe relevant column names of this row are [\"date\", \"tournament\", \"winning score\", \"margin of victory\", \"runner (s) - up\"].\n\n- Step 2: Check the value of the column \"winning score\" for Liselotte Neumann. The winning score should be \"- 9 (67 + 73 + 67 = 207)\" or \"- 14 (67 + 65 + 70 = 202)\". In the table, the relevant row with this info is at index 6.\nThe values of \"winning score\" and \"margin of victory\" are given as \"- 9 (67 + 73 + 67 = 207)\" and \"playoff\", respectively.\n\n- Step 3: Check the value of the column \"margin of victory\" for Liselotte Neumann's winning score. If it is not \"playoff\", then the claim is false.\nThe values of \"margin of victory\" are given as \"- 9 (67 + 73 + 67 = 207)\" and \"playoff\". Since one of them is \"playoff\", this indicates that Liselotte Neumann won with a playoff.\n\n- Step 4: Verify if there are any other rows where Liselotte Neumann won without a playoff.\nLiselotte Neumann's only another win was in Jun 1996, which indeed had a playoff; however, no other wins of hers were listed as winning without a playoff.\n\nNow we can conclude our reasoning process:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked the value of the column 'winning score' for Liselotte Neumann's win in Jun 1996 and found that it was indeed the result of a playoff.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will check if Liselotte Neumann won the 1994 LPGA Classic tournament.\n\n   - From the table, I see that there are two entries for 1994: Minnesota LPGA Classic (won by Hiromi Kobayashi) and Wweetabix Women's British Open (won by Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam). However, I also see an entry for Ghp Heartland Classic which won by Elaine Crosby. \n\n   - Therefore, there is no evidence of Liselotte Neumann winning the 1994 LPGA Classic.\n\n2. Next, I will check if Liselotte Neumann won the 1996 LPGA Classic tournament.\n\n   - From the table, I see that there is an entry for Edina Realty LPGA Classic (won by Brandie Burton and others) which was in 1996 but it does not mention Liselotte Neumann.\n\n   - However, from another column of the table, there is a row with date \"14 jan 1996\" indicating a tournament won by Liselotte Neumann. This implies that she may have won at least one LPGA Classic in 1996.\n\n3. Finally, I will check if Liselotte Neumann won the 1998 LPGA Classic tournament.\n\n   - From the table, I see that there is an entry for Chick-fil-A Charity Championship (won by Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper) which was in 1998 but it does not mention Liselotte Neumann. However, from another column of the table, there is a row with date \"22 mar 1998\" indicating a tournament won by Rosie Jones.\n\n   - However, I also see an entry for Standard Register Ping (won by Rosie Jones) which was in 1998 but it does not mention Liselotte Neumann. However, from another column of the table, there is no row that directly indicates that Liselotte Neumann won a LPGA classic in 1998.\n\n4. After analyzing all three years I can confirm only one of them: the year 1996.\n\n   Since she did win one tournament this implies the following chain of thought: \"Liselotte Neumann won 1 lpga classic tournament in 1996.\"\n\n#### Final JSON Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, check if Liselotte Neumann won the 1994 LPGA Classic tournament (FALSE). Then check if she won the 1998 LPGA Classic tournament (FALSE). However, only one year from 1994, 1996 and 1998 is found to be true: 1996. Therefore , 1 lpga classic tournament was won by Liselotte Neumann in 1996.\", \n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"tournament\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
