Moving on to the relevant rows that contain information about Paul Chan Chi-Yuen and Jeremy Young Chit-On:\n   - Row 1: This row contains information about \"chan chi - yuen , paul\". However, we are looking for a portfolio attachment related to Home Affairs. The given portfolio attachment is 'food and health'.\n   - Row 7: This row contains information about \"ng kit - shuen , katherine\", which does not match our target names.\n4. Now let's look at the column that contains information about foreign nationality:\n   - Column 5 (portfolio attachment): \n     - Row 1: 'food and health'\n     - Row 3: 'environment'\n     - Row 6: 'security'\n     - Row 8: 'financial secretary'\n   - Row 4: This row does not match our target names.\n   - Row 7: This row contains an information about Canadian nationality for individual (tsui ying - wai , caspar), which is not related to Home Affairs portfolio attachment. However, it's still in the same column, and we can see a British name in Column 5 of Row 2 and also Column 5 has a Singaporean national who works in 'financial services and the treasury'\n   - We have seen that Column 5 (portfolio attachment) contains information about individuals working in different portfolios. In particular, \n     * Row 2: Portfolio attachment is education\n     * Row 6: Portfolio attachment is security\n     * Row 9: We are now going to look at Row 9\n   - Row 9 does contain the name \"young chit - on\" for which we have found our first piece of information. Now let's check the foreign nationality and the portfolio attachment of this individual:\n     - Foreign Nationality in column 4 is British.\n     - Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is 'food &amp; health'. But wait! This seems like more than one piece of information at a time, which isn't possible according to our rules. It could be that two different rows contain both this person and the required information. \n   - Row 2:  This row contains information about \"cheung , raymond man - to\" for which we have found another piece of information\n     - Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is education.\n     - Foreign Nationality in column 4 is British.\n   - Now let's check if these are the correct pieces of information according to our rules:\n     * The claim states that Paul Chan Chi-Yuen and Jeremy Young Chit-On are both in Home Affairs. However, we don't see any information about Home Affairs portfolio attachment for Paul Chan Chi-Yuen.\n     * However, Row 9 contains \"young chit - on\" with the portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health' but also \"yip kan - chuen , frankie\" with the portfolio attachment 'financial secretary'. The claim is saying that both are in Home Affairs which is not true. There's no information about Paul Chan Chi-Yuen being in Home Affairs either.\n     * However, we can see another piece of relevant information for Row 2. We need to check if there is any other row where \"young chit - on\" and Paul Chan Chi-Yuen appear together with portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health'. If such a row exists, then we will have our answer.\n5. Looking at the column that contains information about foreign nationality again:\n   * Row 2: Portfolio attachment is education\n     * Foreign Nationality in column 4 is British.\n   - Now let's look at other columns for this individual to see if there is any other relevant piece of information.\n6. Column 5 (portfolio attachment) again:\n   - Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is education for Row 2 which does not match our target name.\n   - Now we are going to look at Row 4, 5 and 6 where portfolio attachments do not contain the required information either.\n   * However, there is one piece of relevant information that exists: \n     + Portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health' appears for another individual (row number = 3). The column with foreign nationality does contain information about British name in row 2. But we cannot conclude anything from this as it's not home affairs.\n   - We are still looking for information where portfolio attachment is 'food &amp; health'. Let's check Row 6\n     + Portfolio attachment 'security' (Row number = 6) does not match our target name but it appears in the same column. And there is another individual with foreign nationality which is Canadian\n   - We are still looking for information where portfolio attachment is 'food &amp; health'. Let's check Row 5 \n     + Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is financial services and the treasury (Row number = 5) does not match our target name. However, there is a British national named  \"yip kan - chuen , frankie\" who appears in column 4 but also has the portfolio attachment 'financial secretary'. And Row 2 contains another British national with foreign nationality but with education as portfolio attachment.\n   * Now let's check Row 1\n     + Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is food and health for Row number = 1 which does not match our target name. But it appears in column 4 too.\n7. After checking the relevant rows that contain information about foreign nationality, we found two individuals who are both British national.\n   * However, there's a condition: Portfolio attachment should be 'food &amp; health'.\n8. Unfortunately, we could not find any other row where Paul Chan Chi-Yuen and Jeremy Young Chit-On appear together with portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health'. We also found no information about Home Affairs for Row 9 either.\n   * However, Row 2 does contain \"young chit - on\" with the portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health' but it is not correct because the required portfolio attachment is actually in Row number = 3 which contains another individual. Therefore our final answer could be:\n     + Column 4 (foreign nationality): British name appears in two individuals \n       * For \"young chit - on\" with foreign nationality as Canadian\n       * And for \"yip kan - chuen , frankie\" with portfolio attachment 'financial secretary' and foreign nationality as British. However, it is actually a different person.\n     + Column 5 (portfolio attachment) Portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health' appears in another individual (row number = 3)\n9. We are still looking for information where portfolio attachment is 'food &amp; health'. Let's check Row 4 \n   * Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is financial services and the treasury (Row number = 4) does not match our target name. However, it appears in column 4 too.\n10. Finally, we need to answer if Paul Chan Chi-Yuen and Jeremy Young Chit-On are both working in Home Affairs or not:\n    * Unfortunately, we could not find any information that directly confirms this statement for either of the individuals.\n11. However, there is one more thing we can try: Check if Row 3 has been correctly interpreted according to our rules:\n    * For Row number = 3\n      + Foreign Nationality in Column 4 is British\n      + Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is environment\n    * If we assume that portfolio attachment 'environment' exists for home affairs as per the question then this could be a potential answer.\n12. Now let's go back and re-read the rules:\n    * Row (number = x) should contain information about either of the individuals (Paul Chan Chi-Yuen or Jeremy Young Chit-On).\n    * The row should contain information about portfolio attachment for Home Affairs which is 'food &amp; health'.\n13. Upon re-reading the rules again, we noticed a potential mistake:\n   * Row 3 does not have the required portfolio attachment but it has the British nationality and the same name. \n14. Finally, after reviewing all possible options according to our rules, we conclude that:\n    * There is no information about Home Affairs for Jeremy Young Chit-On. However, there's a row with \"young chit - on\" in Row 9.\n   * However, this is not the required information as per our rules because portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health' does not exist for that individual.\n15. Now let's review again all the possible options according to our rules:\n    * We did find a row (Row number = 3) where foreign nationality exists and also another name with British nationality. However, it does not have the required portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health'.\n   * However, there is one potential answer left in the form of Row 2 which has \"young chit - on\" for which we found our first piece of information about the correct portfolio attachment as per our rules.\n    * But what if another individual has the same portfolio attachment? \n16. After re-checking all possible options according to our rules, we noticed a different name with British nationality in Row 2:\n    * Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is education for Row number = 2\n     + Foreign Nationality in column 4 is British.\n17. We are still looking for information where portfolio attachment is 'food &amp; health'. Let's check Row 4 \n   * Portfolio Attachment in Column 5 is financial services and the treasury (Row number = 4) does not match our target name. However, it appears in column 4 too.\n\n**The final answer is:** British national appears in two individuals with foreign nationality as British but portfolio attachment 'food &amp; health' does not exist for any individual according to the rules.",

Find the age at appointment for Victor Lo Yik - Kee: Look up the table and find the row where the romanised name contains \"Lo Yik - Kee\". The relevant cell is at row 5, column \"age at appointment\" with value 55.\n2. Compare the age with other individuals' ages at appointment: Since there are two people who have an age of 31 (Tsui Ying - Wai and Young Chit - On), they could be younger than Lo Yik - Kee.\n3. Determine if Victor Lo Yik - Kee is indeed younger: However, looking back at the table, we can see that for someone to be appointed with a younger age, there must be other appointees who were older. And indeed, Raymond Man Cheung has an age of 46 which is older than Lo Yik-Kee.\n4. Verify if \"victor lo yik - kee\" being the youngest when he was appointed makes sense: However, \"victor lo yik-ke\" (note lack of '-kee') have a higher salary of HK134150. The salary of hk134150 is lower than that of ng kit-shuen who has an age 34 which also be younger.\n5. Final Evaluation: Thus Victor Lo Yik - Kee being appointed with the youngest age at 55 does not necessarily make him \"youngest\" if someone was appointed and had a higher age but lower salary (as there's no indication that such person exists).\n6.
