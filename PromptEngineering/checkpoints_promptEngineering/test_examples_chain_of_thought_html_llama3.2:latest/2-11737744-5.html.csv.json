This means we should look for the Australian Open tournament in the table and then check if she lost all her matches (i.e., every single row in the 2007 column).\n3. **Find the Australian Open cell**: Look for the row where \"tournament\" is \"australian open\". The first row meets this condition.\n4. **Check if Tatjana Maria won at least one match at the Australian Open**: In the row we found, check if there's any indication that she won at least one match (i.e., any entry other than \"a\" in the 2007 column).\n5. **Conclusion based on findings**:\n- If Tatjana Maria won at least one match at the Australian Open, then it is false that she lost all her games.\n- Otherwise, if there's an indication that she didn't win any matches (i.e., every single entry in the 2007 column is \"a\"), then it is true that she lost all her games.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\nIn this step-by-step process, I identified Tatjana Maria won at least one match at the Australian Open because the cell \"1r\" appears for a match in 2010. This means she didn't lose all her games; therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim that Tatjana Maria lost all of her games at the Australian Open is false because there is evidence (1r) that she won a match in 2010.\\n\\nRelevant cells:\\n[{\\\"row_index\\\": 2, \\\"column_name\\\": \\\"2007\\\"}]\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2007\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
