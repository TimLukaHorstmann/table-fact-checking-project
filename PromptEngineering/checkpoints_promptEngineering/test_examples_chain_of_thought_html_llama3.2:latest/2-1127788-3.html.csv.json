    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the relevance of the claim\nThe claim states that 2000 be the only year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition. To verify this, we need to find out how many goals marquez scored in each year.\n\n#### Step 2: Extract relevant data from table\nWe will extract the date and score columns from the table for each match involving Rafael Marquez.\n\n| Date       | Score    |\n|------------|----------|\n| 5 February 1999 | 1-0     |\n| 13 February 2000 | 1-0     |\n| 3 September 2000 | 5-1     |\n| 12 May 2002   | 2-1     |\n| 24 July 2003   | 1-0     |\n| 19 June 2004  | 3-0     |\n| 7 September 2005 | 2-0     |\n| 24 June 2006  | 1-0     |\n| 28 March 2007  | 2-2     |\n| 10 September 2008  | 2-0     |\n| 11 June 2010   | 1-1     |\n| 12 June 2011  | 1-0     |\n\n#### Step 3: Identify relevant years\nWe will identify the year in which Rafael Marquez scored more than one goal.\n\n- 1999 and 2000 have scores of 1 goal each.\n- 2002 has a score of 2 goals.\n- 2003 and 2004 have scores of 1 goal each.\n- 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 have scores of more than one goal.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the truth value\nFrom step 3, we know that Rafael Marquez scored more than 1 goal in years other than 1999, 2000.

    "resp": "#### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. Identify the column of interest: The goal of finding out whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups requires identifying the column containing the player's name or any other relevant identifier. In this case, there is no explicit column for the player's name. Therefore, we must rely on the assumption that the table contains information about each game played by Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n\n2. Locate the year in the \"date\" column: To determine if Rafael M\u00e1rquez participated in the 2006 or 2010 FIFA World Cups, we need to identify rows corresponding to these years from the \"date\" column. The \"date\" column seems to be formatted as a date string with the format \"day month year\".\n\n3. Search for Rafael M\u00e1rquez's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup: Looking at the table, we find that there is a row matching June 24, 2006, which falls within the timeframe of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The score for this game is listed as \"1 - 0\", which means Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored the winning goal in this match.\n\n4. Search for Rafael M\u00e1rquez's participation in the 2010 FIFA World Cup: Similarly, looking at the table, we find that there is a row matching June 11, 2010, which falls within the timeframe of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, we need to verify if this match was played by Rafael M\u00e1rquez. Upon reviewing the score (\"1 - 1\"), it appears that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did participate in this match.\n\n5. Check for any other information about Rafael M\u00e1rquez's participation: A close examination of the table reveals no additional relevant information about Rafael M\u00e1rquez's performance in either tournament, such as goals scored or team affiliation.\n\n6. Conclusion based on data analysis: The presence of rows corresponding to both 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups with Rafael M\u00e1rquez participating indicates that he indeed participated in these tournaments.\n\n7.

Potential loss rows include:\n- Row 8 (scored 0, lost 2)\n- Rows 11 and 13 (scored 1, lost)\n\n### Step 4: Identify rows where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal\nRafael M\u00e1rquez is mentioned in the \"goal\" column for the following rows:\n- Row 3\n- Rows 5 and 6\n\n### Step 5: Compare losses with Rafael M\u00e1rquez' goals\nRow 8 (loss) has a score of 1 - 2, which does not correspond to Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring. However, we need to verify if any other loss rows have M\u00e1rquez' goal recorded.\n\n### Step 6: Verify potential errors in previous steps\nReview each potential loss and Rafael M\u00e1rquez' goal instances for accuracy and consistency.\n\n### Step 7: Draw conclusions based on verified data\nUpon reviewing, we see that:\n- Row 8 is indeed a loss but does not involve Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n- Row 11 is a draw; therefore, it's not counted as a loss due to the score difference being zero.\n- Row 13 is also a draw for the same reason.\n\nHowever, none of these losses directly correlate with Rafael M\u00e1rquez' goal. To fulfill the claim accurately, we need more information about losses occurring after or simultaneously with Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal in international competitions.

Check the \"result\" column for losses: Look for rows where the result is 0-1, meaning Mexico has lost 1-0.\n\n4. Identify relevant games: For each loss found in step 3, check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal by looking at the \"score\" column and seeing if it ends with \" - 1\".\n\n5. Evaluate the claim: Check how many times Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal in these losses.\n\n6. Count the number of relevant occurrences: Count the total number of times Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal when Mexico loses 1-0.\n\n7. Compare the count to 2: The claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez lose 1 of 2 time, so we need to check if there is exactly one occurrence of this event or more than one.\n\n8. Draw conclusion: Based on steps 6 and 7, determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\n\nHere's my step-by-step reasoning in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Identify relevant data\nStep 2: Analyze the table\nStep 3: Check the result column for losses\nStep 4: Identify relevant games\nStep 5: Evaluate the claim\nStep 6: Count the number of occurrences\nStep 7: Compare to 2 times\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to check if Rafael Marquez was involved in any international competition in 2001.\n   We look at the table for the year 2001. There's no row with a date in 2001.\n\n2. Next, we verify whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored or not in any of the competitions in 2009.\n   We look at the table for 2009. The only relevant row is the 10th one: \"10/09/08\". There's no row with a date in 2009.\n\n3. Lastly, we examine if Rafael M\u00e1rquez remained scoreless in any international competition in 2012.\n   We check the table for 2012. The 12th row says 'rafael maarquez' was involved, and he scored against Panama on June 12, 2011, so it is highly unlikely that this would be an accurate assertion of a goalless match.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our analysis, Rafael Marquez did not remain scoreless in international competition in any of the specified years (2001, 2009, and 2012).\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"We looked at the table for 2001 but no row was found with a date in that year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Similarly, we searched for 2009, but there were no relevant rows found.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Lastly, Rafael Marquez scored against Panama on June 12, 2011.
