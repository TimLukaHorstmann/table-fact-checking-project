To verify this claim, we need to check if both conditions are true for both teams.\n\n3. For North Melbourne, we can confirm that their home team score is indeed 28.17 (185) by looking at the corresponding cells in the table. We also need to ensure that there is no other row with a higher or equal score for North Melbourne's home team.\n\n4. Similarly, for Melbourne, we need to verify if their home team score is indeed 11.13 (79). We will check if there are any rows with a higher or equal score for Melbourne's home team.\n\n5.
