In other words, the record of both fighters ends with the same number of \"X-Wins\" followed by the same number of \"X-Losses\" and \"X-Draws\".\n\n#### Step 2: Examine each row in the table for potential draws\nWe need to check each row to see if there's a situation where both fighters have an equal record, meaning they have the same number of wins, losses, and draws.\n\n#### Step 3: Check row 6 (draw)\nFor row 6, we see that both \"res\" is \"draw\" and the records are \"4 - 1 - 1\". Since there's only one draw result in the table, this could be our match.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify that no other rows have a matching record\nWe must verify whether any other row has a matching record. By looking through all rows, we can confirm that there are no other instances of equal records.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion based on findings\nAfter checking the entire table and verifying our initial assumption about row 6, we can confidently say that only one match result in the result of a draw is indeed true.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First examined each row in the table for potential draws.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: List all the match times from the table.\nWe will start by listing all the time values for each match:\n- Match 1: 1:55\n- Match 2: 1:34\n- Match 3: 5:00\n- Match 4: 3:23\n- Match 5: 5:00\n- Match 6: 4:38\n- Match 7: 0:18\n- Match 8: 2:23\n- Match 9: 5:00\n- Match 10: 6:58\n- Match 11: 9:49\n- Match 12: 5:36\n- Match 13: 1:20\n\n#### Step 2: Identify the match with the longest time.\nNow we will identify which match had the longest time:\nThe match with the longest time is Match 10, with a time of 6:58.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if this match was a win against David Ross\nWe need to verify that the match with the longest time was indeed a win for Mark Tullius (not David Ross) against David Ross:\n- Match 10 has a record of \"4 - 0\", which means it was a win.\n- Match 10 had David Ross as the opponent, and Mark Tullius as the winner.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if David Ross's record is indeed \"2 - 0\".\nSince we are looking for the match with the longest time, let's verify that the record of David Ross is indeed \"2 - 0\":\n- David Ross's record in Match 11 is \"1 - 0\", not \"2 - 0\".\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion.\nThe previous step indicates that the assumption made in step 3 was incorrect.\n\n#### Chain of thought:\n\"List all time values and identify longest match (6:58), verify it was a win against David Ross, check if his record is indeed '2-0', which turns out to be incorrect.\"\n\n#### Final answer JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"List all time values and identify longest match (6:58), verify it was a win against David Ross, check if his record is indeed \\u20132\\u2010\\u0028\\u201d, which turns out to be incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}",
