To verify this, we need to check if each of these players has a total of 2 goals in the table.\n\n2. Let's start by checking cooper. In the table, we can see that there is a cell for \"cooper\" under the column \"name\" with value \"2\" in the third row. This suggests that Cooper scored 2 goals. However, since the claim says all four players have 2 total goals, we need to check the rest of them.\n\n3. Next, let's check marinelli. In the table, we can see that there is a cell for \"marinelli\" under the column \"name\" with value \"2\" in the fourth row. This suggests that Marinelli scored 2 goals.\n\n4. Now, let's check mustoe. In the table, we can see that there is a cell for \"mustoe\" under the column \"name\" with value \"2\" in the fifth row. This suggests that Mustoe scored 2 goals.\n\n5. Finally, let's check queudrue. In the table, we can see that there is a cell for \"queudrue\" under the column \"name\" with value \"2\" in the sixth row. This suggests that Queudrue scored 2 goals.\n\n6. We have found evidence to support all four players scoring 2 total goals. Therefore, the claim appears to be true.\n\n7. However, we can further verify this by checking if there are any other cells with value \"2\" in the table that do not belong to these four players. Since the only other cell with a value of 2 is under the column \"total\" and it belongs to all players, our previous assumption seems correct.\n\n8. To be thorough, we should also check if there are any other cells with a value of 1 in the table that do not belong to these four players.

According to the table, the row for player \"marinelli\" has values 0, 0, 0, 0, and 2 in columns \"fa cup\", \"league cup\", \"total\", respectively.\n4. The row for player \"johnston\" has values 0, 0, 1, 0, and 1 in columns \"fa cup\", \"league cup\", \"total\", respectively.\n5. Since the value in cell \"fa cup\" for player \"marinelli\" (0) is not equal to the value in cell \"fa cup\" for player \"johnston\" (0), but their total goals are different, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Compare values in cells 'fa cup' and 'league cup' for rows corresponding to players 'marinelli' and 'johnston'. Marinelli's row has values 0, 0, 2; Johnston's row has values 0, 1, 1. Since their total goals are different, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"league cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim to be evaluated is \"cambell and ehiogu score the same number of goals in the league\". This means we need to compare the values in cells corresponding to cambell and ehiogu in the 'league' column.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the cells for cambell and ehiogu\nFrom the table, we can see that cambell is located in row 13 and ehiogu is located in row 23. Their respective league values are 0 and 1.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare the league values of cambell and ehiogu\nSince cambells' league value (0) is equal to ehiogus' league value (1), it appears that this claim could be TRUE.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the comparison result\nHowever, we must ensure that there are no other cells in the table with the same values as cambells and ehiogus in the 'league' column. If such a cell exists for either player, the comparison would not be valid.\n\n#### Step 5: Check for any duplicate league values\nUpon reviewing the table again, we can see that only one value of 1 is present in the 'league' column (for ehiogu). This means there are no other cells with a league value of 1. However, there is another cell with a league value of 0 for cambells which is not present for any other player.\n\n\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze results and draw conclusions\nBased on our analysis, it appears that the initial comparison between cambell's and ehiogus' league values might have been misleading because they share different values in 'league' column. However, since the claim specifically mentions \"the same number of goals\" we need to consider if there is a cell with 1 in 'league' for either player.\n\n\n\n#### Step 7: Re-examine comparison result\nWe can confirm that while both have league value of different numbers (0 and 1) and no other league value in the table matches ehiogu's or cambells. However, we need a cell with same number of goals as ehiogus which is only found for ehiogu.\n\n\n\n#### Step 8: Draw final conclusions\nThe claim cannot be verified because there are no two players who score the exact \"same\" number of league goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We compared cambells and ehiogus' league values to see if they scored the same, but found that their values were different.
