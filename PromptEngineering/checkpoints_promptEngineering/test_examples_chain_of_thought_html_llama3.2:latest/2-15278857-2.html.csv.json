To evaluate this claim, we need to find David Jackson's goals from the table.\n\n2. **Locate David Jackson's Record in the Table**: We will scan through each row of the table to locate the record for David Jackson.

This gives us the number of goals scored by David Jackson, which is 61.\n\n4. **Determine the Least Number of Goals**: To determine if David Jackson has the least goal, we need to compare his number of goals (61) with all other players' goals in the table. However, since we don't have information about the exact number of goals for each player, we can only assume that he indeed has one of the lowest numbers of goals based on the data provided.\n\n5. **Identify Players with Lower Goals**: Since we do not know all players' scores, let's focus on those whose actual goal count is also below 61 and ensure David Jackson indeed scored less than any other player in the table.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Provided Data**: Upon reviewing the table, it appears that many players have fewer goals than David Jackson (e.g., John Hallows with 74 goals). Since we do not have information to determine if he truly has the least number of goals among all players or not based solely on our inspection of this data set, this step requires an assumption.
