So, it is necessary to check if there's any other instance of him scoring goal 4.\n4. **Find Goal Number 5**: Similarly, for goal number 5, we need to identify this specific match that Guillermo Franco scored the mentioned goal number 5.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (Continued)\n\n5. **Find Venue and Date of 2009 Concacaf Gold Cup Competition**:\n\t* Look at each row with a competition date that matches \"2009\" for the gold cup to identify which one is actually the same competition Guillermo Franco scored goals 4 and 5.\n6. **Compare Implied Scores in Goal Number 1 Matches vs. Claimed Goal Numbers**: Verify if Guillermo Franco indeed scored goal number 4 and 5 as stated in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (Conclusion)\n\n7. **Verify the Score of Each Relevant Match**:\n\t* After locating all relevant matches, confirm whether each match's score aligns with what the claim states for goals 4 and 5.\n8. **Determine Truth Value**: Based on verification from step 7, determine if Guillermo Franco indeed scored both goals number 4 and 5 at the same 2009 Concacaf Gold Cup competition.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (Conclusion)\n\nBased on all steps completed above, we can now state that the process was as follows: \nAfter locating the relevant information in the table for Guillermo Franco's matches during the 2009 Concacaf Gold Cup and verifying each match's score against what is stated in the claim, it appears there isn't any direct mention of him scoring both goals number 4 and 5 at exactly the same competition. This suggests that the claim cannot be verified based on the information found.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We analyzed every row for Guillermo Franco's goal numbers, verified which matches corresponded to the mentioned goal numbers (4 and 5), looked up the competition dates to find a match that could be relevant.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim mentions \"Guillermo Franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2009 concacaf gold cup\".\n2. We need to find out if Guillermo Franco scored the same number of goals in both a friendly match and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n3. To do this, we'll look for cells with Guillermo Franco's name in them, then check the number of goals he scored in each competition mentioned (friendly and 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup).\n4. We can find Guillermo Franco's goal count in a friendly match in the \"result\" column under the row where his goal is mentioned.\n5. For the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, we'll look at the cell with the same row index as his goal but under the \"score\" column.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"result\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"score\"\n  }\n]\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n6. Now we need to compare the number of goals Guillermo Franco scored in a friendly match and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n7. In the friendly match, he scored 1 goal according to the cell with row index 2 and column name \"result\".\n8. In the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, his score was listed as '0 - 5', but this is likely an incorrect format for scoring; instead we should look at another score in that competition where Guillermo Franco's goal count might be found.\n9. Looking at the table again, there are two cells with a row index of 4: \"score\" and \"result\". We've already looked at the result cell in step 6. Let's examine the score cell to see if his goals are listed there.\n10. In the cell with row index 4 and column name \"score\", we find that Guillermo Franco scored '1 - 0'. This is likely not what we want, so let's move on to another competition where he might have scored in a different format or more explicitly stated number of goals. \n11. We're going back to the friendly match result cell with row index 2 to re-examine our results because there wasn't enough information about his score at the CONCACAF gold cup; however we did know how many times he was substituted out (pso), and it said '5 - 3' in that same row of scores. Therefore we can use this substitution info, which matches one of the friendly result formats, to get the number of goals Guillermo Franco scored. If a player is listed as pso that means they were substituted out with no further details (e.g., time left), in this match it says '5 - 3', so he was substituted out and scored 5 goals total at this competition.\n12. So we know that Guillermo Franco scored the same amount of goals in a friendly match as in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1\",\n      \"text\": \"The claim mentions \\\"Guillermo Franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2009 concacaf gold cup\\\".\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2\",\n      \"text\": \"We need to find out if Guillermo Franco scored the same number of goals in both a friendly match and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3\",\n      \"text\": \"To do this, we'll look for cells with Guillermo Franco's name in them, then check the number of goals he scored in each competition mentioned (friendly and 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4\",\n      \"text\": \"We can find Guillermo Franco's goal count in a friendly match in the \\u201crresult\\u201d column under the row where his goal is mentioned.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5\",\n      \"text\": \"For the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, we'll look at the cell with the same row index as his goal but under the \\u201cscore\\u201d column.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"6\",\n      \"text\": \"Now we need to compare the number of goals Guillermo Franco scored in a friendly match and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"7\",\n      \"text\": \"In the friendly match, he scored 1 goal according to the cell with row index 2 and column name \\u201crresult\\u201d.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"8\",\n      \"text\": \"In the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, his score was listed as \\u20170 - 5\\(\\u2016), but this is likely an incorrect format for scoring; instead we should look at another score in that competition where Guillermo Franco\\u2019s goal count might be found.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"9\",\n      \"text\": \"Looking at the table again, there are two cells with a row index of 4: \\u201cscore\\u201d and \\u201crresult\\u201d.

Find Guillermo Franco's scores in both types of competitions:\n   - In friendly competition, find the score where Guillermo Franco scored a goal.\n   - In 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, find the score where Guillermo Franco also scored a goal.\n\n3. Calculate if Guillermo Franco scored the same amount of goals in both types of competitions:\n   - Compare the scores from step 2 to determine if they are equal.\n\n4. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison in step 3.\n\n5. List all relevant cells for the JSON output.\n\nHere is the detailed reasoning process:\n\n- Step 1: Identifying the relevant rows\n   - For part 1 (friendly competition): Row with 'goal' equal to 2 and 'result' equal to \"5 - 2\" in column 'score'. \n     This means Guillermo Franco scored a goal. The row also has 'competition' equal to \"friendly\". Relevant cells:\n       - row_index: 2\n       - column_name: score\n\n   - For part 2 (2010 FIFA World Cup qualification): Row with 'goal' equal to 3 and 'result' equal to \"2 - 1\" in column 'score'. \n     This means Guillermo Franco also scored a goal. The row also has 'competition' equal to \"2010 fifa world cup qualification\". Relevant cells:\n       - row_index: 3\n       - column_name: score\n\n- Step 2: Finding Guillermo Franco's scores\n   - In friendly competition, the relevant cell is:\n     - row_index: 2\n     - column_name: score\n     - value: \"5 - 2\"\n\n   - In 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, the relevant cell is:\n     - row_index: 3\n     - column_name: score\n     - value: \"2 - 1\"\n\n- Step 3: Calculating if Guillermo Franco scored the same amount of goals in both competitions\n   - The scores are different. The claim that he scored the same amount of goals is FALSE.\n\n- Step 4: Finalizing the answer\n   - Since the claim is FALSE, the answer is FALSE.\n\n- Step 5: Listing relevant cells for JSON output\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - row_index: 2\n     - column_name: score\n     - value: \"5 - 2\"\n     - row_index: 3\n     - column_name: score\n     - value: \"2 - 1\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step 1\": \"Identify relevant rows for each part of the claim\",\n    \"Step 2\": \"Find Guillermo Franco's scores in both types of competitions\",\n    \"Step 3\": \"Calculate if Guillermo Franco scored the same amount of goals in both competitions\",\n    \"Step 4\": \"Finalizing the answer based on calculation\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\", \"value\": \"5 - 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\", \"value\": \"2 - 1\"}\n  ]\n}",
