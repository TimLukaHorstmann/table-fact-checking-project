Since 2 occurs but not alone and is not consistent across all rows, this leads us to conclude that the claim cannot be accurate.\n\n#### Final answer:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"We are looking for a value equal to 2 in the ERP W column. Instead we found other values (10 and 19). This means the claim is false.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ERP W\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ERP W\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ERP W\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ERP W\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ERP W\"}\n    ]\n}",
