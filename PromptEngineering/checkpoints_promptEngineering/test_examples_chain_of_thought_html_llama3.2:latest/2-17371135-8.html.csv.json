Let's look for the row with the highest \"score\" value and verify that it is indeed a game between Detroit and Edmonton.\n\n### Step 3: Find the game with the highest score against Edmonton\nLooking at the table, we see that the game on February 7 has a score of 3 - 8. However, this score belongs to Edmonton, not Detroit. So, we need to find another row with a higher score for Detroit.\n\n### Step 4: Continue searching for the relevant game\nAfter further inspection, we see that the game on February 10 has a score of 5 - 3, which is higher than the score on February 7.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the claim\nNow that we have found the game with the highest score for Detroit (5 - 3), we need to verify that it was against Edmonton on February 7. However, this game was actually played on February 10, not February 7. Still, according to the table, the home team was Detroit and the opponent was Edmonton.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the final answer\nBased on our findings, the claim is partially true.

However, this is not consecutive since it's two days later than February 15.\n\n4. **Check for other games between February 12 and February 15**:\n    - Detroit lost on February 13 (`td>37 - 12 - 7</td>`): This confirms that there are losses in a row starting from this date.\n    - Then, we check the subsequent loss to confirm three consecutive losses: `td>39 - 13 - 8</td>` for February 18 and `td>40 - 13 - 8</td>` for February 25 indicate Detroit lost on these dates.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The team did not lose exactly 3 games in a row between February 12 and February 15, but they were losing at least two of the three days given: from february 13 to february 18 .",

We need to analyze these columns to determine if the claim about a game in the 2008-09 season is true.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the 'home' column\nWe are looking for games played at home in Detroit. The 'home' column indicates which team is playing at home in each game. We need to check if there are any entries in this column that match 'Detroit'.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for games played in the 2008-09 season\nThe table does not provide explicit dates for each game, so we need to find a way to identify which row corresponds to the 2008-09 season. We can try to infer the season based on the attendance numbers.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the attendance numbers\nAttendance numbers are typically high at home games due to fan interest. By examining the attendance numbers, we may be able to find a pattern that indicates which row corresponds to the 2008-09 season.\n\n#### Step 5: Check for 9-game seasons\nIf we can identify the corresponding rows for the 2008-09 season, we need to check if there are 9 games played at home in Detroit during that season.\n\n#### Step 6: Evaluate the claim\nBased on our analysis, we will determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze 'home' column for Detroit games, identify corresponding rows for 2008-09 season based on attendance numbers, and check if there are 9 games played at home.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the scoreless game among all games played on February 28.\n2. Look for a row in the table where the value of \"score\" is either empty or \"scoreless\" (there might not be an actual word like that but if it exists then this would be our answer).\n3. Check whether any team won the game by looking at other columns such as \"home\",  \"visitor\" etc.\n4. If we find a row where score is scoreless and teams exist, verify the date mentioned to see if indeed the season was in February 2009.\n\n#### Step-by-step reasoning with actual table data:\n\n1. Since no score exists in the 8th column of the last row of the table and Detroit played against Nashville on that day, we can assume that the game was indeed scoreless.\n2. Next, check the home and visitor columns to see if there were any teams playing against each other. In this case, Detroit was at home, while Nashville was visiting.\n3. Now, check the date mentioned in step 1. The season is mentioned to be February 2009 but we need to verify that it's correct. According to the table, the relevant dates are February 2, February 4, February 7, February 8, February 10, February 12, February 13, February 15, February 18, February 20, February 21, February 25, February 27, and February 28.\n4.
