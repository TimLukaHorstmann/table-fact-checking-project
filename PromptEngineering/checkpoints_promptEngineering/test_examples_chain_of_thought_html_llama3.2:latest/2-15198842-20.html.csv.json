We'll look for cells with \"guard\" and \"center\" labels in columns \"position\".\n\n#### Step 3: Check Draft Positions of Guards and Centers\nFrom the table, we see that:\n- A guard named Bill Fralic was drafted at round 2.\n- A center named Brent Martin was drafted at round 10.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Relationship Between Guard and Center Drafted Rounds\nSince a guard (Bill Fralic) was drafted before a center (Brent Martin) by multiple rounds, the claim that \"a guard be draft 9 round before a center be draft\" can be considered true in some contexts because it is generally understood that centers are often drafted later than guards. However, this claim does not apply universally and might depend on specific circumstances or drafts.\n\n#### Step 5: Finalize Answer\nGiven the general understanding of football draft practices (centers are indeed typically drafted after guards), the claim seems to be TRUE but with a note that its truth value may vary based on specific contexts or drafts.\n\n#### Final JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1-5 reasoning process described above\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components**: The claim states \"a linebacker be draft 9 round before a center be draft\". This implies we need to compare the position of linebackers with that of centers.\n\n2. **Locate Linebackers and Centers in the Table**:\n   - In the table, the positions are: guard, defensive end, wide receiver, defensive back, linebacker, tight end, and center.\n   - Looking at each row for these positions, we find 'linebacker' in the following rows:\n     * Row 9 (position = \"linebacker\")\n     * Row 11 (position = \"defensive back\") is not a linebacker but we also see another linebacker position \n      * Row 12 (position = \"tight end\" is not a linebacker) and also another one\n       * Row 8 (position = \"defensive back\") is not a linebacker\n        * Row 9 (position = \"linebacker\")\n   - The center positions are found in the following rows:\n     * Row 10 (position = \"center\")\n     * Row 12 (position = \"tight end\" is not a center) and also another one \n       * Row 8 (position = \"defensive back\") is not a center\n        * Row 9 (position = \"linebacker\") is not a center\n         * Row 11 (position = \"defensive back\") is not a center but we see another one in \n          * Row 12 (position = \"tight end\" is not a center) and also another one\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Rows for Comparison**: We need to find which round each of the linebackers and centers were drafted at.\n   - For Linebackers: 9, 11, 8\n   - For Centers: 10, 12 \n\n4. **Compare Rounds of Linebackers and Centers**:\n   - Linebacker Round: [9, 11, 8]\n   - Center Round: [10, 12]   \n   - Checking if there is a linebacker draft before the center's round \n     * There are indeed three linebackers drafted at rounds < 10.",
