To verify this, we need to find rows where the number of laps is less than 50 and the driver's retirement reason is either \"transmission\" or \"clutch\".\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are indeed two drivers who completed fewer than 50 laps: Jean-Pierre Jarier (33 laps) and Emerson Fittipaldi (6 laps).\n4. For Jean-Pierre Jarier, the retirement reason is listed as \"transmission\", which matches one of the conditions in the claim.\n5.

Now we need to verify that these two drivers are the only ones who meet both conditions (less than 50 laps and transmission or clutch retirement reason).\n7.
