    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the rows in the table where the license is proprietary.\n   - The relevant cells for this step are:\n     ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"license\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"license\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"license\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 6,\n        \"column_name\": \"license\"\n      }\n     ```\n2. Check if the claim states that there are 3 emulators with a proprietary license.\n   - The claim does state this, so we can proceed to the next step.\n\n3. Identify the rows in the table where the emulator runs on Windows.\n   - The relevant cells for this step are:\n     ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 6,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      }\n     ```\n   - However, we need to make sure that the claim specifically mentions \"window\" (with a capital W), not just \"windows\". In this case, both of these cells have \"windows\", so they are relevant.\n\n4. Check if any of the proprietary emulators run on Windows.\n   - According to steps 1 and 3, there is one row where the emulator runs on Windows:\n     ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      }\n     ```\n   - However, we still need to check if there are exactly two other emulators with proprietary licenses that run on Windows.\n\n5. Check the row for \"corn\" again.\n   - The relevant cells for this step are:\n     ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      }\n     ```\n   - According to steps 1 and 3, there is one row where the emulator runs on Windows. This step does not add new information.\n\n6. Check the rows for \"mupen64plus\" again.\n   - The relevant cells for this step are:\n     ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 7,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 8,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      }\n     ```\n   - According to steps 1 and 3, there is one row where the emulator runs on Windows. This step does not add new information.\n\n7. Check the rows for \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" again.\n   - The relevant cells for this step are:\n     ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 9,\n        \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n      }\n     ```\n   - According to steps 1 and 3, there is one row where the emulator runs on Android. This step does not add new information.\n\n8. Check if any of the other proprietary emulators run on Windows.\n   - According to steps 1 and 3, there are no other rows that have a proprietary license and run on Windows.\n\n9. Determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on our findings.\n   - Since there is exactly one row where \"corn\" runs on Windows and two rows with proprietary licenses that run on Windows, but only one of those is mentioned in the table as running on \"window\" (with a capital W), we need to look closer.\n\n10. Look for any other rows with proprietary licenses.\n    - The relevant cells for this step are:\n      ```\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"license\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"license\"\n        }\n      ```\n    - According to steps 1 and 9, there is one row where the emulator runs on Windows. However, neither of these rows match the claim.\n\n11. Check for any other information in the table that could help us determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n    - There is no additional information that would change our conclusion.\n\n12. Finalize our answer based on all previous steps.\n    - Since we have found two proprietary emulators with licenses running on Windows, but only one of those matches the specific wording \"window\" (with a capital W), and there is at least one other row where \"corn\" runs on Windows, we can conclude that the claim is not entirely accurate.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify rows with proprietary licenses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if claim states there are 3 emulators with proprietary license\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify rows where emulator runs on Windows\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check for additional information\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": false\n}",

We need to break this down into separate conditions:\n- Condition A: Corn is one of three emulators with a proprietary license.\n- Condition B: Corn is one of two emulators that run on Windows.\n- Condition C: Corn is compatible with JavaScript.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the truth value of each condition\nBased on the table, we can evaluate each condition:\n- **Condition A**: Looking at rows related to \"corn\", the only relevant row has a proprietary license. However, there's no indication that \"corn\" is one of three emulators with this characteristic; only that it has a proprietary license.\n- **Condition B**: There are two instances where Windows is mentioned as an operating system for emulators: \"windows\" and \"windows , os x , gnu / linux\". While it does run on Windows, we cannot confirm if it's among the top 2 without further information about which ones specifically match this criterion.\n- **Condition C**: There are rows stating that certain emulators run on JavaScript. However, none directly say \"corn\" runs on JavaScript.\n\n### Step 3: Determine how these conditions apply to 'corn'\nGiven the lack of direct information linking \"corn\" to all three conditions specified in a clear manner (especially regarding Condition B and C), we must look for any possible overlap:\n- There is no indication that \"corn\" has one of three proprietary licenses. This makes Condition A false.\n- For Condition B, there isn't enough information to determine if \"corn\" is among the top two emulators specifically mentioned as running on Windows (\"windows , xbox\"). Thus, Condition B cannot be definitively said true or false based solely on the table.\n- For Condition C, since there's no direct mention of \"corn\" being compatible with JavaScript and given that \"javascript\" is listed under a different entry (\"1964js\"), we cannot conclude this condition is true.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the information provided in the table:\n- Corn does have a proprietary license (Condition A, albeit not clearly one of three as specified).\n- There's insufficient direct evidence to claim it's among two that run on Windows.\n- No mention is made of \"corn\" being compatible with JavaScript.\n\nConsidering these points, we conclude the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Conditions regarding proprietary license (A) and compatibility with JavaScript cannot be directly confirmed from the table.

For example:\n- n64js runs only on JavaScript\n- project64 runs on Windows and Xbox\n- daedalusx64 runs on Windows and PSP\n- ultrahle runs on Windows and Xbox\n- mupen64plus runs on Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, Free BSD\n\n#### Step 3: Count the number of platforms where mupen64 runs compared to other emulators that include JavaScript\nSince JavaScript is one platform for n64js, we will not count it as a separate platform.\n\nThe unique platforms where mupen64 runs are Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, Free BSD, and QNX Beos. This makes 5 platforms.\nn64js has only 1 platform (JavaScript).\nSo the other emulators with JavaScript that run on more than 1 platform will be excluded from our count.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if there are any other emulators that include JavaScript and run on more than one platform\nNo, based on the table we see that no other emulator besides mupen64plus/aes (with android edition) runs on multiple platforms including JavaScript. However, it has only one platform.\nWe should also exclude project64 since its other platforms (Xbox) are not included in our count.\n\n#### Step 5: Count the number of unique platforms where all the emulators with JavaScript run\nn64js runs on JavaScript and we will consider JavaScript as a single platform. However, for our purpose mupen64plus/aes has only one valid platform for our counting (Android) and another one is not considered since it does not have multiple ones.\nWe should exclude n64js since it only runs on 1 platform.\nSince project64 and daedalusx64 are excluded from the count, we can see that all the other emulators with JavaScript run on only one platform.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if mupen64 runs on more platforms than any other emulator including JavaScript\nWe know mupen64 runs on 5 unique platforms (Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, Free BSD, QNX Beos), while n64js runs on only 1 (JavaScript) and no other emulators besides mupen64plus/aes run on more than one platform including JavaScript.\n\n#### Step 7: Finalize the answer\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that mupen64 indeed runs on more platforms than any other emulator including JavaScript.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"current version\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the row with GPL v3 license and confirm that it is not sixtyforce.\n3. Compare the counts from step 1 and 2, and conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\nHere's the explanation in detail:\n\nStep 1: Sorting by license and counting\n\n| name    | current version | system   | platform          | license |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|---------|\n| cen64   | git - 7e3258ce50 | nintendo 64 | windows , os x , gnu / linux | bsd 3 - clause |\n| corn    | 0.3             | nintendo 64 | windows          | proprietary |\n| daedalusx64 | r1878           | nintendo 64 | windows , psp      | gpl v2   |\n| mupen64  | 0.5.1           | nintendo 64 | windows , os x , gnu / linux , freebsd , qnx beos | gpl v2   |\n| mupen64plus | 2.0            | nintendo 64 | windows , os x , gnu / linux , freebsd | gpl v2   |\n| project64 | 2.1.0.1         | nintendo 64 | windows , xbox      | gpl v2   |\n| ultrahle | 1.0.0           | nintendo 64 | windows , xbox      | proprietary |\n\nThere are 5 emulator releases under the GPL v2 license.\n\nStep 2: Counting GPL v3 licenses\n\nThe only row with a GPL v3 license is \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" with version 2.3.5, which matches with sixtyforce having a proprietary license.\n\nHowever we need to confirm that there are no other emulator releases under the GPL v3 license. The claim states only one case where it happens: 60force . So we can make sure the claim is true only if we confirm that sixtyforce is indeed an exception from a general rule , but for this particular question, since it happens so we will count it.\n\nThere are actually no more rows under the GPL v3 license. Therefore:\n\nStep 3: Comparing counts\n\nSince there are 5 emulator releases under the GPL v2 license and only one release under the GPL v3 license (sixtyforce), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n  ]\n}",

To verify this, I need to check which rows in the table have \"Windows\" in their row for the \"platform\" column and also have \"Xbox\" in the same row.\n\n3. Starting from top to bottom:\n   - Row 1: Windows (\"windows , xbox\") but also includes \"xbox\", so true.\n   - Row 2: JavaScript, does not include both windows & xBox.\n   - Row 3: Windows, Os X, GNU/Linux and BSD (includes both), so this counts as one of the required emulators.\n\n4. Continuing:\n   - Row 5: Windows only (does not count), so false.\n   - Row 6: Windows (\"windows , xbox\") but also includes \"xbox\", so true.\n   - Row 7: GNU/Linux, BSD & QNX Beos does include both Windows & XBox, so this counts as one of the required emulators.\n\n5. Continuing:\n   - Row 8: Windows, Os X and GNU/Linux (\"gnu / linux\") (includes both), so this counts as one of the required emulators.\n   - Row 9: Windows (\"windows , xbox\") but also includes \"xbox\", so true.\n   - Row 10: Does not include both windows & Xbox.\n   - Row 11: OS X only, does not count.  \n   - Row 12: Windows (\"windows , xbox\"), so counts as one of the required emulators.\n\n6. Now that we have checked all rows for our conditions:\n   - Only three emulator run on both window and xbox: corn, daedalusx64 & mupen64plus android edition (ae) does not count because it is Android Edition which makes it different.\n   - So only the following 3 do run on Windows and Xbox: corn , daedalusx64 , mupen64.\n\n7.
