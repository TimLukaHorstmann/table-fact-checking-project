The relevant rows for checking are those with dates in October: Row 9 (November 9, 2003), is not in October but indicates a win and was listed to show relevance; Row 11 (November 16, 2003) - Loss.\n2.

Find the row with the lowest attendance value: The row with the lowest attendance value will correspond to the game with the lowest attendence.\n\n3. Locate the cell containing the attendance value for this row: Since there are multiple cells that contain attendance values (cells at row_index 14, column_name \"attendance\" and cell at row_index 16, column_name \"attendance\"), we need to find out which one is relevant for our claim. The attendance value in cell at row_index 14, column_name \"attendance\" is 43363.0, while the attendance value in cell at row_index 16, column_name \"attendance\" is 70758.0.\n\n4. Compare these two values: Since 43363.0 is less than 70758.0, the game with the lowest attendence will be played at Alltel Stadium.\n\n5.
