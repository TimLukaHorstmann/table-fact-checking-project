    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim\nThe claim is about two specific games (September 5 and September 2) where either team holds zero points.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the given table structure\nThe table has a \"Date\" column, which is not provided in the given text. However, we can see that each row represents a single game with various statistics such as goals scored, shutouts, and more.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the relevance of September 5 and September 2\nSeptember 2 does not appear in the table at all, so it's unlikely to be relevant to the claim. We'll focus on September 5 only.\n\n#### Step 4: Examine the statistics for September 5\nFor September 5, the relevant statistic is \"Goals Against\". If this value is 0, it means that neither team scored any goals, implying a shutout or zero points.\n\n#### Step 5: Find the row corresponding to September 5\nUpon inspecting the table, we find that there are no rows with a date matching exactly to September 5. However, since the game was played on \"September 5\" (day 5 of the month), it's possible that the day number is what matters.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify the row with day 5\nWe can see that the first game in the table corresponds to day 1 and has a date later than September 5. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that there are no rows with day numbers directly corresponding to the dates of the games. We'll have to rely on other statistics.\n\n#### Step 7: Check if any team had zero points for both games\nLooking at the table again, we can see that for September 5, neither the home nor away team scored any goals against each other. However, there is another row with a date later than September 5 where this happens as well.\n\n#### Step 8: Identify the rows corresponding to the claim\nThe two relevant cells are:\n- Row_index = 4 (September 2)\n- Column_name = \"Goals Against\" and \"Game Date\"\nHowever, since September 2 does not appear in the table, we can't include it. Instead, we'll look for another row with day numbers matching a later date.\n\n#### Step 9: Determine if there are other games on or after September 5 that meet the claim\nAfter re-examining the table, we find:\n- Row_index = 2 (September 6 is missing but September 5 corresponds to row index 4, however row index 4 does not exist)\nActually there is a game that was played between two teams on \"september 5\" and other team also was played with another team on the same day. \n\nLet's verify if September 5 has any games where either team scored zero points against each other.\n\n- Row_index = 7 (no row index exists for this date)\nThere is a game corresponding to \"September 2\" but there isn't one for  September 5.",

A double header game is a game where two games are played on the same day, with each game being a separate match.\n\n2.

In this case, the table contains information about the 2008 season, but only for one team, the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n3. From the given data, we can see that there are two games played on September 19th (double header) and another pair of games played on September 23rd (another double header). \n\n4.

We are told that only two games were postponed, and we need to check if the claims about these games match.\n\n4. Looking at the game rows for September 21:\n   - The row has a \"Postponed\" status.\n   - The column \"Game Result\" shows the final result of the game which is not specified but can be considered as won by Marlins.\n   - However, we need to find out if the claim about only two games being postponed due to weather holds true.\n\n5.

Since only two games were postponed (September 21 and September 26) but the claim about only these games being postponed does not hold because one of them has another reason for postponement, we can conclude:\n   - The chain of thought is: \n      Check if the game on september 21 was postponed due to weather.\n      Check if the game on september 26 was postponed due to weather.\n      If both conditions are met then only two games be postpone due to weather.
