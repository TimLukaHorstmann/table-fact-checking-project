To do this, we'll extract the release date from each song entry in the table.\n\n3. For the 2000 entries:\n   - \"the cedar room\" (20 march 2000)\n   - \"catch the sun\" (29 may 2000)\n   - \"the man who told everything\" (30 october 2000)\n   - \"there goes the fear\" (15 april 2002) is not in 2000, so ignore it.\n   - There are at least 3 songs released in 2000.\n\n4. For the 1999 entry:\n   - \"here it comes\" (2 august 1999)\n\n5. Now we'll compare our counts: there are at least 3 songs released in 2000 and only 1 song released in 1999.\n\n6. The claim states that there should be 3 songs released in 2000 and only 1 song released in 1999, which matches our findings.\n\n7.

So, there are a total of 7 different release years.\n\n2. **Count the number of song releases per year**: We need to count how many song releases happened in each of these years.\n   - In 1999, there is 1 song release.\n   - In 2000, there are 3 song releases.\n   - In 2002, there are 3 song releases.\n   - In 2005, there are 3 song releases.\n   - In 2009, there are 2 song releases.\n\n3. **Find the year with the most number of song releases**: From the previous step, we can see that the year 2000 has the most number of song releases with a count of 3.\n\n4. **Check if this is indeed the year with the most number of song releases in any of the other years**: Since there are only two more years (1999 and 2002) with less than 3 song releases, we can see that indeed, 2000 has the highest count.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on our steps above, we conclude that the claim \"the most song release in a year be 3 , which happen in 3 different year\" is FALSE because there are only two years where this condition holds (2000 and none of the other years) instead of three.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"null\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"null\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

For this calculation, we can see that there are the following songs: \n   * hvn95\n   * hvn96\n   * hvn98\n   * hvn111\n   * hvn116\n   * hvn126\n   * hvn145\n   * hvn150\n   * hvn152\n   * hvn189\n   * hvn192\n   * hvn201\n\n    12 in total.\n\n4.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Extract relevant data from the table**:\n   - We need to count the number of songs released by Doves in 2009.\n\n2. **Identify all releases in 2009**:\n   - Looking at the table, we find two rows with release dates in 2009: \"kingdom of rust\" and \"winter hill\".\n\n3. **Count the songs released in 2009**:\n   - Both \"kingdom of rust\" and \"winter hill\" are mentioned as being from the same album (\"kingdom of rust\"), indicating that they were both released in 2009.\n\n4. **Check if there are more than 5 songs released in 2009**:\n   - Since we have only two distinct songs released in 2009, we can conclude that this condition is not met.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued\n\n5. **Formulate the final answer based on the count and condition**:\n   - Given that there are fewer than 5 song releases in 2009, the claim \"in 2009 , doves release more than 5 song\" is false.\n\n6. **List relevant cells for reference**:\n   - For this conclusion, we refer to the table rows corresponding to the songs released in 2009.\n   - Specifically, these are:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 13,\n       \"column_name\": \"song\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 14,\n       \"column_name\": \"song\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted relevant data from the table, identified two song releases in 2009, counted them, and checked if more than 5 songs were released, concluding that fewer than 5 songs were released in 2009.
