We can see that Hani Said's row is listed as:\n   - Egyptian Premier League: 3\n   - Egyptian Cup: 0\n   - Caf Champions League: 0\n   - Total: 3\n4. This confirms that Hani Said scored 3 goals total, so the first part of the claim is TRUE.\n5. Next, we need to check Sabry Raheel's information.

Determine if Amr el-Safty's score in the Egyptian Premier League means he didn't score:\n   - Since a 0 in the Egyptian Premier League column indicates no goals scored, this means Amr el-Safty did not score any goals.\n\n3. Check other players' scores in the Egyptian Premier League to see if there are any that do not have a number greater than zero.\n   - Looking at the table again, we can observe other cells with 'egyptian premier league' values greater than 0, meaning those players did score goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\n4. Determine the relevance of the claim and the cells involved:\n   - The claim is that Amr el-Safty is the only player to not score in the Egyptian Premier League.\n   - Given our findings so far, we know this claim is false because we found no other player with 0 goals in the 'egyptian premier league' column.\n\n5. Determine if there are cells for totals that could provide further insight into the validity of the claim:\n   - We see that 'totals' has a value of 38, and Amr el-Safty's row also has a 'total' value.\n   - Both values in the 'total' column indicate goals scored by these players.\n\n6. Analyze other rows for any player not scoring in Egyptian Premier League:\n    - Looking at row #1 where Sherif Ashraf is listed with 6 in 'egyptian premier league', we can see that he did score.\n    - Similarly, looking through the rest of the list, there are players who scored but were not Amr el-Safty.\n\n\n7.

First, we need to find out how many players scored in the Egyptian Premier League. We can do this by looking at the \"egyptian premier league\" column for each player.\n\n2. Upon examining the table, we see that there are 19 different players listed with a non-zero score in the \"egyptian premier league\" column.\n\n3. Next, we need to find out how many of those 19 players scored at least one goal in the Egyptian Premier League. We can do this by counting the number of non-zero scores in that column.\n\n4. In the table, we see that there are 15 different players listed with a non-zero score in the \"egyptian premier league\" column, indicating that they have scored at least one goal in the league.\n\n5. Now, to determine whether Amr el Safty is indeed only one of two players on the list to not score in the Egyptian Premier League, we need to verify if there are exactly two such players or more than two.\n\n6. Looking back at the table, we see that Amr el Safty has a score of 0 in the \"egyptian premier league\" column, indicating that he did not score any goals in the league.\n\n7.
