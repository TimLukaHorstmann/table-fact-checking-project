    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Start by examining the table for rows related to London, England.\n\n2. Look at each row in the London-related columns (columns 5) to count the number of stadiums.\n   - Row 10 has London/England Monarchs with stadium \"stamford bridge\"\n   - Row 11 has London/England Monarchs with stadium \"white hart lane\"\n   - Row 12 has London/England Monarchs with stadium \"wembley stadium\"\n\n3. Counting these three rows reveals that there are indeed 3 stadiums related to London, England.\n\n4. Compare this count with the number of stadiums required by the claim (4).\n   - Since 3 is not equal to 4, we need to re-examine our assumptions or look for more data in the table.\n\n\n5. Reviewing further rows related to London/England Monarchs doesn't change the conclusion.\n\n6. Looking again at column 1 for team names with \"London\" indicates that London/England Monarchs is a unique case because they appear multiple times in different stadiums, while teams named London aren't present at all (only London / England Monarchs).\n\n7. Since no other stadium besides wembley stadium belongs to the name 'London' and we know there are 3 stadium related to London/England Monarchs:\n   - We have only one additional stadium from London/England Monarchs, which is Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n8. So, if we assume that each appearance of a team in column 1 with \"London\" represents a different stadium (which isn't true), then we should find another row for London to fulfill the requirement of four stadiums.\n   - This assumption was incorrect.\n\n9. Re-evaluate our count and conclude: Since there is only one stadium named after 'Wembley' that belongs to London/England Monarchs, but 3 different columns in \"London / England Monarchs\" have a stadium related, this means we still need another row for London.\n   - Reviewing column 5 of the table again shows us:\n     - Row 11 is indeed for London/England Monarchs with stadium name white hart lane.\n\n\n\n10. Check that there's no other team in the \"team\" column that contains 'London'.\n    - Checking the teams table (column 1) does not show any 'London' names.\n\n\n11. Now, checking rows of different teams to see if they have 'London':\n   - After reviewing more than a dozen more row we can't find another row with team name containing \"London\".\n\n12. Given this conclusion, there must be at least one stadium without London/England Monarchs but having the city name in it (column 5). Otherwise, the total count would not reach four.\n\n\n\n13. Reviewing rows that contain 'London' again and re-counting we realize:\n    - There are indeed more than three columns with stadiums belonging to \"London\" named.\n    - In column 3 of table for team names containing London/England Monarchs there is another stadium called Wembley Stadium ( row 12).\n   - However, looking at other teams like Rhein Fire (row 15), and checking how many have a stadium in them that contains the word \"London\":\n     - Rhein Fire has no 'London' but another city D\u00fcsseldorf\n    - Upon re-examining table column 5 for London/England Monarchs we found two more stadiums.\n   - Checking other row shows there are 3 other teams with one stadium each named after a city containing the word \"London\".

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that the oldest stadium is the LTU Arena, which opened in 1877.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to find the row with the smallest value for the \"opened\" column, as it represents the opening year of each stadium.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are multiple rows with the same city and team name repeated across different stadiums.\n4. We need to focus on finding a row where the \"team\", \"city\", and \"capacity\" information does not overlap between two or more rows.\n5. However since this is not possible given the data, our best strategy will be to find a stadium that has all three values (team, city, capacity) unique across different cells in its row but with the smallest year recorded under the 'opened' column.\n6. Looking at the table, we can see that the London / England Monarchs have multiple entries for different stadiums, making it easier to compare and contrast their stadium information.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n7. From the table, we can see that the oldest stadium among the London/England Monarchs is the one located at Stamford Bridge with a \"opened\" year of 1877.\n8. Similarly for Rhein Fire, their oldest stadium is located at Rheinstadion, but it opened in 1926 which is newer than the one opening in 1877\n9. Also for Scottish Claymores their oldest stadium Hampden Park opened in 1903 \n10.
