Next, we will count the number of games where the Mavericks were the home team.\n3. Finally, if the number of games where the Mavericks were the visitor is greater than the number of games where they were the home team by more than 7, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet's look at relevant cells:\n\n* `cell_1`: date - 3 february 2008\n* `cell_2`: visitor - Mavericks\n* `cell_5`: leading scorer - Two-way tie (15)\n* `cell_7`: record - 31 - 15\n\nIn this game, the Mavericks were the visitor.\n\n* `cell_4`: home - Pistons\n* `cell_3`: score - 67 - 90\n* `cell_6`: attendance - 22076\n* `cell_8`: record - 31 - 15\n\nThe Mavericks are listed as the visitor here, so we will count this one.\n\nLet's repeat this process for all games:\n\n* The following three games had Mavericks as visitors (same cell_2):\n\t+ Game 2: Mavericks vs. Magic\n\t+ Game 6: Mavericks vs. Bucks\n\t+ Game 8: Mavericks vs. Grizzlies\n\nThis makes a total of four games where the Mavericks were visitors.\n\nNext, we will count how many times Mavericks are listed as home teams:\n\n* Games 1 and 10 have this:\n\t+ cell_4: home - Pistons\n\t+ cell_3: score - 67 - 90\n\t+ cell_6: attendance - 22076\n\t+ cell_8: record - 31 - 15\n\nMavericks are listed as the home team in these two games.\n\n* In game 9 Mavericks are listed as home:\n + cell_4: home - Nets\n\nSo, there is a total of three times that the Mavericks were home teams. \n\nNow, we need to see if four times more than that is greater than seven:\n\n7 + (4-1) = 10 > 7\n\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the maverick be the visitor in over 7 of the list game\" is true.\n\nHere's our JSON response:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We have found four games where Mavericks were the visitors.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Step 1: Determine the number of games where Dirk Nowitzki was not the leading scorer.\n\nTo do this, we need to examine each row in the table for values under the column 'leading scorer' that are not equal to Dirk Nowitzki's name (or some indicator of a tie). The names of other scorers should be checked and verified if they are actually tied with Dirk. This verification would involve checking other columns like 'score', 'attendance', and 'record'.\n\nStep 2: Count the number of such rows.\n\nAfter examining each row in the table, we will count how many rows have a leading scorer that is not Dirk Nowitzki. If this number is less than one, then the claim must be false because all games had Dirk as the leading scorer. However, if there are no such rows, then there might still be ambiguity about whether the condition was met or not.\n\nStep 3: Compare the count to the total number of games.\n\nWe will compare the count of rows where Dirk Nowitzki is not the leading scorer to the total number of rows in the table. If the count equals one and that is from row index 3 (the only row under 'leading scorer' which does say two-way tie), then it's likely true that Dirk was the lead scorer in all but that single instance. Otherwise, if there are no such rows, we'll need to check further.\n\nStep 4: Determine relevance of specific cells.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis will include:\n- For every row where 'leading scorer' = \"dirk nowitzki\"\n  - The value in the 'score' column\n  - The value in the 'attendance' column\n  - The value in the 'record' column\n\nThese are necessary to confirm that the score is indeed led by Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nStep 5: Analyze specific cells if ambiguity arises.\n\nIf there's ambiguity about whether a game was won or lost based on the values of 'score', 'attendance', and 'record', we may need to examine those columns further to clarify. Specifically, the values in these columns would be analyzed under each row where Dirk Nowitzki is leading scorer (the relevant cells mentioned in Step 4).\n\nStep 6: Determine final answer.\n\nAfter determining how many rows had a different leading scorer than Dirk Nowitzki and verifying our count against total games played, we can conclude whether the claim that \"dirk nowitzki be the lead scorer in every game list but 3\" is true or false.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Examine table for rows where Dirk Nowitzki isn\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Count number of such rows and check if equal to one\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Compare count with total games played in the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify specific cells under every row where leading scorer = Dirk Nowitzki\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}",
