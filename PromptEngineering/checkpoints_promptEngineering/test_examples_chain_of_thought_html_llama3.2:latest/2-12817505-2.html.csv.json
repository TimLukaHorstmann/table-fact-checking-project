To do this, we should first look for the row in the table where the date column matches \"11 february 2006\".\n3. Once we have found that row, we can then compare its attendance value with all other rows to determine if it indeed has the lowest attendance.\n\nNow let's write the reasoning steps in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"find row with date column equal to '11 february 2006'\",\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"compare attendance value of the found row with all other rows\",\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 109,\n            \"column_name\": \"date\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 108,\n            \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 108,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above output is not correct because our step number goes from 1 to 2. This is also a result of the steps being in reverse order. So we will change that. \n\nHere's the corrected JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"find row with date column equal to '11 february 2006'\",\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"compare attendance value of the found row with all other rows\",\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 108,\n            \"column_name\": \"date\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 108,\n            \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 108,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nBut this is still not in the correct format.

Check the result of each match for Manchester United against Blackburn Rovers.\n   - On 29 April 2006, Manchester United lost to Blackburn Rovers with a score of 0-3. This contradicts the claim that they drew all matches against Blackburn Rovers.\n   - Since the claim cannot be true because at least one result does not match the stated condition, there is no need to check further results.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is false because Manchester United lost one of their matches against Blackburn Rovers. The relevant cells are [16, Opponent], [25, Opponent], ..., [88, Opponent].\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 88,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the attendance at Arsenal's game on April 9, 2006**:\n   - The attendance for Arsenal's game on April 9, 2006 was 70908.\n\n2. **Find all games since August 13, 2005 with an attendance equal to that of Arsenal's April 9, 2006 match**:\n   - To find these matches, we'll need to look at the table provided and identify rows where the \"attendance\" column equals 70908.\n\n3. **List relevant cell references**:\n   - We will list each relevant row from the table with its row index and the column name \"attendance\".\n\n4. **Compare identified games with Arsenal's April 9, 2006 attendance**:\n   - Verify that all identified matches indeed had an attendance of 70908.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on findings**:\n   - If we find at least one match with this exact attendance, then the statement is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the attendance at Arsenal's game on April 9, 2006\",\n      \"information\": \"The attendance for Arsenal's game on April 9, 2006 was 70908.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find all games since August 13, 2005 with an attendance equal to that of Arsenal's April 9, 2006 match\",\n      \"information\": \"This step involves a manual review or algorithmic approach to find rows in the table where 'attendance' equals 70908.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"List relevant cell references\",\n      \"information\": \"Relevant cells: [row_index, column_name]\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": false,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nAfter reviewing the table provided, there is no row with an attendance of exactly 70908, which means there are no games since August 13, 2005, that had an attendance equal to that of Arsenal's April 9, 2006 match. Hence, the statement \"there have been 19 games since 13 August 2005 which have an attendance exactly equal to that of arsenal in 9 april 2006\" is false.",
