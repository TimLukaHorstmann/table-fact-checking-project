However we can see that Manchester City did play at home and won with a score of 4 - 2\n3. Now, let's look for matches where the away team scored three goals against the home team. In match 5, West Ham United played at home and tied in the replay but Fulham won the first game.\n   * In match 6, Manchester City played at home but lost with a score of 4 - 2. \n4.

According to the data, there are two games with the same highest attendance (67228), so we should also check those ties.\n3. Now that we know the tie with the second-highest attendance, we can look at its values: \n    - Liverpool vs Portsmouth has an attendance of 34669.\n    - Sunderland vs Birmingham City has an attendance of 24966.\n    - Manchester United vs Manchester City has an attendance of 67228.\n    - Sheffield United vs Colchester United has an attendance of 17074.\n    - Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City has an attendance of 12215.\n    - Fulham vs West Ham United has an attendance of 14705.\n    - Millwall vs Burnley has an attendance of 10420.\n    - Arsenal vs Chelsea has an attendance of 38136.\n4. Since Manchester United has the highest attendance, and Sunderland has the second-highest attendance, we know that tie no 2 is not the game with the second-highest attendance. \n5. We then check the other games: Liverpool vs Portsmouth (34669) is less than Sunderland's (24966), so it also doesn't fit.\n6.
