To do this, we will count the number of 'w' (win) and 'l' (loss) in the 'record' column of each row that contains 'raptors'.\n3. The relevant cells are the ones in the 'record' column.\n\nHere's how we can determine if the Raptors record remains above 500 for the month:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"\"\"\n        To determine if the Raptors record remains above 500 for the month,\n        count the number of wins and losses during this time.\n        Start by extracting the relevant cells from the 'record' column.\n    \"\"\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the 'chain_of_thought' field I included a description of what is being done to determine if the Raptors record remains above 500. In this case we only had one relevant win and many relevant losses which means that the record remains below 500.",
