    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The problem asks for the least attended game of the Cleveland Indians in June 2000, which was against the Brewers.\n2. To find the least attended game, we need to compare the attendance figures across all games played by the Indians in June 2000.\n3. Since the table only provides the attendance data for one game (June 7), we can directly compare it with other games of the same date.\n4. However, we also need to verify if there are any other games on June 7 that were played by the Indians against different teams.\n5. A quick glance at the table reveals that there is another game on June 7: a tie between two pitchers.\n6. Now, let's focus on the original game mentioned in the problem statement - the one against the Brewers.\n7. We can directly compare its attendance figure with other games played by the Indians on June 7 to confirm if it was indeed the least attended.\n\n**Chain of Thought:**\n\n- The claim mentions a specific game, and we need to verify its accuracy.\n- To do so, we compare the attendance data of this game against others on the same date.\n- Since there's another game on June 7 that involves different pitchers, we also check those numbers for comparison.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First verified if any other games were played by Cleveland Indians in June 2000 that had lower attendance.
