However, we can infer it by looking at the scores of each game within that tie.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate the total score for tie number 8\nTie number 8 consists of the following games:\n- Game A: Chelsea won 4 - 2 on penalties\n- Game B: Huddersfield town vs blackpool (Huddersfield town won)\n- Game C: Charlton athletic vs sheffield wednesday (Charlton athletic won)\n\nThe total score for tie number 8 is the sum of these games, but we only need to consider the win/loss information for our analysis.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify the scores for tie number 9\nWe repeat the process from step 1 for tie number 9:\n- Game A: Arsenal vs sheffield united (sheffield united won)\n- Game B: Newcastle united vs chelsea (newcastle united drew)\n- Game C: Chelsea won 4 - 2 on penalties\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the total score for tie number 9\nThe relevant information for tie number 9 is the draw result of the third game, since only one game's outcome directly affects the tie winner.\n\n#### Step 5: Compare the scores of both ties\nWe now compare the total wins (or significant outcomes) for both ties. \n\nFor tie number 8, there are two draws and one win for each team involved in games A and C. \nFor tie number 9, we only know about a draw.\n\nSince a \"tie\" implies an outcome where neither side can claim victory without some form of penalty or further competition, it's possible to argue that the score comparison is not straightforward based solely on wins. However, in many contexts, particularly competitive tournaments like the FA Cup, ties often have to be resolved by replaying the match due to a tied score after 90 minutes.\n\nWe are tasked with determining whether tie number 8 has a significantly higher score than tie number 9, which can only be done accurately if we know more about how \"score\" is defined for these competitions. However, in standard sports, a tie typically implies two or more teams are still in the running after an initial competition.\n\nGiven that both ties have drawn games and the question seems to imply a comparison of competitive positions rather than actual numerical scores (in some contexts, such as football, \"score\" refers to the net difference between goals scored and goals conceded), we can argue:\n\n- Tie number 8 has a higher competitive position because it has not been resolved yet (i.e., both teams are still in competition), whereas\n- Tie number 9 is already at an end since one of its games resulted in a draw.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on the information provided and standard sports terminology, tie number 8 has a higher \"score\" because it represents ongoing competitions rather than concluded outcomes.\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Tie number 8 is not resolved yet (games A and C have ties), whereas Tie number 9 is already ended due to the draw result of its third game.
