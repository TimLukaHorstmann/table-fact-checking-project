    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which rows correspond to playoff games. We can do this by looking at the values in the \"reg gp\" column. According to the table, a row corresponds to a playoff game if its value in \"pl gp\" is greater than 0.\n\n2. Let's check each row one by one:\n   - Row 3: pl gp = 3, so it's not a playoff game.\n   - Row 4: pl gp = 0, so it's not a playoff game.\n   - Row 5: pl gp = 0, so it's not a playoff game.\n   - Row 6: pl gp = 42, which is greater than 0, so it's a playoff game.\n   - Row 7: pl gp = 0, so it's not a playoff game.\n   - Row 8: pl gp = 0, so it's not a playoff game.\n\n3. We can see that only Row 6 corresponds to a playoff game.\n\n4. Now, we need to check which players played in this playoff game. The values for \"player\" and \"team (league)\" of the row are \"brent sopel\" and \"swift current broncos ( whl )\", respectively.\n\n5. We can also see from the original table that there is another player who played in a playoff game, with the values \"peter schaefer\" for both \"player\" and \"team (league)\" in Row 3: \"peter schaefer\" and \"swift current broncos ( whl )\".\n\n6. However, we can notice that only one of these players plays in the exact same team as another row with pl gp > 0, namely, Brent Sopel.\n\n7. It's also observed that both Brent Sopel and Peter Schaefer are part of playoff games but there is no player listed on a row with pl gp > 0 in which they play together for a different column value. Since we know there are two players on the chart that played in playoff game, it means only one other player besides Brent and Peter played in the game.\n\n8. We can see this from Row 6: The values for \"player\" and \"team (league)\" of the row are indeed \"brent sopel\" and \"swift current broncos ( whl )\".\n\n9. We also notice that there is no player listed on a row with pl gp > 0 in which Peter Schaefer plays, however, we do know he played in a playoff game.\n\n10. Since Brent Sopel and Peter Schaefer are the only two players who played in playoff games, this means both must be part of the statement that they are the \"only 2 player on the chart that play in playoff game\".

We can do this by checking the \"reg gp\" (regular season games) and \"pl gp\" (playoff games) columns.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Lloyd Shaw has played a game\nLooking at the table, we see that Lloyd Shaw's row contains a non-zero value for both \"reg gp\" and \"pl gp\". This means that Lloyd Shaw must have played a game or more, so his claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step 3: Check if Todd Norman has played a game\nSimilarly, Todd Norman's row also contains a non-zero value for both \"reg gp\" and \"pl gp\", indicating he has played at least one game. Therefore, Todd Norman's claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step 4: Check if Stu Bodtker has played a game\nStu Bodtker's row shows a non-zero value for both \"reg gp\" and \"pl gp\". This means that Stu Bodtker must have also played at least one game. So, his claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step 5: Check if Tyler Willis has played a game\nTyler Willis' row contains a non-zero value for both \"reg gp\" and \"pl gp\", which indicates he has played at least one game. Hence, Tyler Willis' claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step 6: Check if Jason Cugnet has played a game\nJason Cugnet's row shows that he has played games (both regular season and playoff) as indicated by non-zero values for \"reg gp\" and \"pl gp\". This means his claim is also FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince all the players mentioned have played at least one game, the original claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Check if Lloyd Shaw has played a game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Lloyd Shaw's row contains non-zero values for reg gp and pl gp, so his claim is FALSE.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Repeat the same process for Todd Norman\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Todd Norman's row also contains non-zero values for reg gp and pl gp, indicating he has played at least one game.

First, we need to identify which rows in the table correspond to players who played in a playoff game.\n   - A player plays in a playoff game if they have at least 1 entry in the \"pl gp\" column that is not 0.\n\n2. From the given data, only two rows do not contain any non-zero values in the \"pl gp\" column:\n    ```\n{\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"reg gp\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"reg gp\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Every row except for those two must have at least one non-zero entry in the \"pl gp\" column.\n   - For example, in the case of Peter Schaefer:\n     ```\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>63</td>\n      <td>peter schaefer</td>\n      <td>brandon wheat kings ( whl )</td>\n      <td>178</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    ```\n\n4.

From our table, Larry Courville has 33 regular season games.\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>61</td>\n    <td>larry courville</td>\n    <td>oshawa generals ( ohl )</td>\n    <td>33</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 6: Compare to other values in the \"rd\" column\nWe must find which value is less than this but more than another. In this case, Peter Schaefer has 178 regular season games.\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>63</td>\n    <td>peter schaefer</td>\n    <td>brandon wheat kings ( whl )</td>\n    <td>178</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nLarry Courville played the second most regular season games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we looked for rows with data in the table. Next, we found that Larry Courville had 33 games. Then, we compared this to Peter Schaefer who had 178. Because 33 is less than 178 and greater than another value (which we must assume was the highest since no other value in our range of interest exceeded it), we can conclude that Larry Courville played the second most regular season game.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
