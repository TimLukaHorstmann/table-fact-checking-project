However, before we can conclude that the claim is false, let's check if there is any other information that might provide evidence for or against this claim.\n   - Examining our data from step 1, we can see that there are actually two rows where \"year\" column contains a value of \"1970\" and both have an entry in the \"entrant\" column with the name \"yardley team brm\", which also has a value of \"brm p153\".\n   - Both of these entries have a value of 2 for \"pts\" and a value of \"brm v12\" for the engine.\n\n4.
