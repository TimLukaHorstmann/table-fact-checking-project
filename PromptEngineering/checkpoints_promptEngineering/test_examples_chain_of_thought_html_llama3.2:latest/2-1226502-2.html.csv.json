    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the team name for 1992 from the table.\n\t* Looking at the table, we see that the \"entrant\" column for 1992 contains the value \"sasol jordan yamaha\".\n2. Next, we check if this team name was present in a row before or on the same row as 1992.\n3. The rows for 1988 and 1990 both contain the phrase \"leyton house\", so it is not true that \"sasol jordan yamaha\" took over from Leyton House Racing in those years.\n4. We need to examine whether there was a change in team name from Leyton House Racing or its associated chassis/engine configurations for the 1992 season.\n5. However, we can see that for 1991, \"sasol jordan yamaha\" did indeed use the same chassis (\"leyton house cg911\") and engine configuration (\"ilmor v10\") as \"leyton house racing\". But more importantly, we need to confirm if there was a significant team name change before this row.\n6. Since there is no indication of the team name changing from Leyton House Racing in the preceding rows (1988, 1989, or even 1990), but rather some changes happening within that entity (\"leyton house cg901\" and \"leyton house cg911\"), we must look closer at the actual claim.\n7. Looking more closely, the final cell in the table for row 1991 mentions \"0 points\" after mentioning \"ilmor v10 engine\". \n8. However, in our consideration of \"sasol jordan yamaha\", we should check if there is a change of team name for that row.\n\n9. Finally, given that Leyton House Racing had used the same chassis and engine configuration before the 1991 season but switched to the same chassis and engine after 1991 with (illegible abbreviation), our final consideration must be whether there was an actual name change from Leyton House Racing in 1992.\n10. Given all this information, we can see that there is no indication of a team name change in the table data for row 1992. Thus, our answer is that the claim \"sasol jordan yamaha take over for leyton house racing in 1992\" must be FALSE.\n\nHere's our final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Find team name for 1992\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if this team was present before 1992\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Confirm no change in entity from row 1988/1990 to 1992\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check for significant name change within the same entity between 1991 and 1992\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Re-examine claim in light of new information about engine configurations and chassis\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Confirm no indication of team name change before row 1992\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Consider final implications for the 'take over' claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Verify conclusion based on available data\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify Gugelmin's auto**: The claim mentions \"gugelmin's auto\". We need to find the row that corresponds to Gugelmin. In the table, there is no direct information about who owns the auto, but we can look for a mention of a company or team name that might be associated with Gugelmin.\n\n2. **Find relevant chassis**: Since the claim states \"stay with the march 881\", we need to check if any row in the table has a chassis named as March 881. Looking at the table, there are two rows that mention \"march 881\".\n\n3. **Check if chassis changes**: We know that over the years, the same auto should stay with the same chassis (March 881). However, looking at the table, we see that in one of the years (1991), Gugelmin's auto has a different chassis (leyton house cg911).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there is a change in chassis for Gugelmin's auto over the year, the claim \"over the year the chassis on gugelmin's auto stay the same , stay with the march 881\" is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells**: We need to identify the specific rows and columns that we analyzed.\n\t* Relevant cells:\n\t\t+ Row index: 1\n\t\t+ Column name: \"chassis\"\n\t\t- Value: March 881 (in row 1)\n\t\t+ Row index: 4\n\t\t+ Column name: \"entrant\"\n\t\t- Value: leyton house (in row 4)\n\t\t+ Row index: 5\n\t\t+ Column name: \"chassis\"\n\t\t- Value: leyton house cg911 (in row 5)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Gugelmin's auto by looking for a company or team name that might be associated with Gugelmin.\",\n    \"Find relevant chassis that matches March 881 in the table.\",\n    \"Check if chassis changes over the years.\",\n    \"Conclusion: since there is a change in chassis for Gugelmin's auto over the year, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n  ]\n}",
