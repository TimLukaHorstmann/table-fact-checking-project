According to the table, he fought against Otis Grant and lost, but also against Ruben Perez and won.\n2. Next, we need to look for fights where Librado Andrade was not involved at all. We can find these by looking for rows with \"Librado Andrade\" in the \"Opponent\" column that do not have any corresponding row for him in the \"Winner\" column.\n3. Since Mikkel Kessler is mentioned as an opponent, we need to check if Librado Andrade was involved in this fight. We can do this by looking at rows where the Opponent's name starts with \"Mikkel\".\n4. If we find a row that matches our criteria from step 2 and the opponent starts with Mikkel, it means that Librado Andrade lost against him.\n5. Now we have found two fights where Librado Andrade was not involved as a winner or loser: one loss to Otis Grant and another loss (not found) to Mikkel Kessler.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Librado Andrade's involvement in two fights, checked for his involvement in a fight against Mikkel Kessler.

However, his loss against Lucian Bute is mentioned as part of another fighter's win record.\n\n### Step 4: Identify relevant cells for analysis\nTo verify the claim, we need to find the rows in the table where Librado Andrade is involved (either as a loser or possibly as someone else who lost against him), and specifically look for Lucian Bute as an opponent.\n\n- Relevance criteria: The row(s) must involve Librado Andrade being on either side of the fight (as the winner, loser, or not listed directly).\n- Relevant cells could include rows where:\n  - **\"Loser\":** 'Librado Andrade'\n  - **'Winner\":** 'Lucian Bute'\n\n### Step 5: Verify the claim\nIf we find a match where Librado Andrade lost and Lucian Bute was the winner, that confirms part of the chain of thought.\n\nHowever, upon careful review, it becomes clear that the direct information about Librado Andrade losing to Lucian Bute is not explicitly listed. The table does mention Lucian Bute's fight against another boxer (Librado Andrade being the loser in that fight).\n\n### Step 6: Analyze relevant data\nSince we are tasked with verifying if the loss against Lucian Bute was one of the five losses for Librado Andrade, without a direct entry stating Librado lost to Lucian, this claim may not be verifiably true based on provided data.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the given table and task analysis:\n- The statement about Librando Andrade losing to Lucian Bute being one of his five losses cannot be confirmed as directly stated because we don't have a direct win/loss record for Librando against Lucian Bute.\n- However, it is implied through the structure that this loss did happen since the table mentions Lucian Bute's win in one of these scenarios.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about Librado Andrade losing to Lucian Bute being one of his five losses cannot be directly confirmed because we lack a direct record in the table.
