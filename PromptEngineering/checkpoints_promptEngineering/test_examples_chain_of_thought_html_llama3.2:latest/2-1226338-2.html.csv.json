This means we need to compare Marc Surer's points scored in both years.\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant data from the table\nWe will extract the data for Marc Surer from the table. Looking at the table, we see that there are no rows with \"marc surer\" as the entrant name. However, looking closer, we can identify rows where a driver with a similar name (e.g., \"theodore racing team\" or \"arrows bmw\") might have scored points.\n\n### Step 3: Identify possible matches\nThe closest match is the row for \"1981\" under \"entrant\" as \"ensign racing\", which has a \"marc surer\" in the description. However, this does not seem to be directly related to Marc Surer's scores.\n\nUpon closer inspection of other rows, we find that there are no clear matches for the exact name \"Marc Surer\".\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the claim\nGiven the lack of direct information about Marc Surer's scores in the table, it is difficult to evaluate this claim accurately without making assumptions.\n\nHowever, looking at the years where a team with a similar name does appear (e.g., \"arrows bmw\"), we can see that those rows also have points.
