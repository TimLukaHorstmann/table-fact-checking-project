Next, let's look at the table data: The team playing is listed in column A (\"home team\"), while the opponent is listed in column B (\"away team\"). In this case, Essendon (column B) is playing North Melbourne (column A).\n\n3. Now, we need to find out where the game was played: According to the table data, the match was played at Windy Hill Oval.\n\n4. Additionally, we have to confirm if the crowd was 10,000 people.\n\n5.

Therefore, no one team can be considered a home team for all three as per the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
