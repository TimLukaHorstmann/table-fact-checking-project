We can find this by looking at his row in the table.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>140</td>\n    <td>thomas hussey</td>\n    <td>left wing</td>\n    <td>canada</td>\n    <td>new york rangers</td>\n    <td>st andrew's college (canadian hs - on)</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nHis pick number is 140.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare Pick Numbers\nWe need to compare the two pick numbers.

Now we compare the pick numbers:\n   - Thomas Hussey was picked first (at row index 100)\n   - Kevan Melrose was picked second (at row index 98)\n\n5. Based on this comparison, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE because Kevan Melrose's pick number is indeed later than Thomas Hussey's.\n\n6. Next, we determine the relevant cells for our answer:\n   - For Thomas Hussey: { \"row_index\": 100, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }\n   - For Kevan Melrose: { \"row_index\": 98, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }\n\n7. Since both players have been identified as having pick numbers at row indices less than the total number of rows, we consider all of them relevant.\n\nHere is our final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Extracted values for Thomas Hussey and Kevan Melrose from the table. Step 2: Found their positions relative to each other. Step 3: Compared pick numbers. Step 4: Determined that the claim was TRUE because Kevan Melrose's pick number is indeed later than Thomas Hussey's.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 100, \"column_name\": \"pick\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 98, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }\n  ]\n}",
