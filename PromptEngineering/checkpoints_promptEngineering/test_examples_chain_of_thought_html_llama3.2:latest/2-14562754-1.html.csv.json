    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to check if the claim mentions remixes made by Laurent Boutonnat throughout 1995.\n\n2. We can do this by checking if the \"remixed by\" column contains any entries with a value of \"-\".\n\n3. Next, since the song title is not provided in the table, we cannot confirm that these remixes are indeed of the same song.\n\n4. The relevant cells for this claim would be those in the \"remixed by\", \"year\" columns where there's a \"-\". We should identify which remixes were remixed by Laurent Boutonnat and whether they happened throughout 1995.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. Looking at the table, we see that there are multiple entries with \"-\" in the \"remixed by\" column for different years.\n\n2. For the year 1995, specifically checking remixes remixed by Laurent Boutonnat will be essential to verifying if all 8 remixes indeed were made during this time frame.\n\n3. The relevant cells in 1995 include those with Laurent Boutonnat as \"remixed by\" and a corresponding release year of 1995.\n\n4. Finally, we must verify that there are indeed 8 such entries for the year 1995.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. Upon reviewing the data in more detail, the table shows multiple remixes in 1995 made by Laurent Boutonnat but verifying if they all amount to exactly 8 is necessary.\n\n2. For accurate counting, we'll need to ensure each entry is individually verified for both \"remixed by\" value and year, noting any overlap or discrepancies which could affect claim validity.\n\n3. After reviewing the entries, it appears that while there are multiple remixes done by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995, accurately tallying these will be essential to confirm if indeed all were made throughout this period.\n\n#### Final Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Finally, we must tally up all relevant cells within \"remixed by\" and \"year\" columns for any entry that contains Laurent Boutonnat as the remixer in 1995 to see if there are exactly 8 remixes as claimed.\n\n2. Given the provided data, it's apparent that multiple entries match our criteria, but counting them accurately is key to confirming the claim.\n\n3. Upon reviewing each row from the table again for accurate count and year alignment with the given statement, we must ensure all of these align properly before drawing a conclusion.\n\n4. The task now shifts towards quantifying these remixes made by Laurent Boutonnat during 1995.\n\n#### Final Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. We should look at each row where \"remixed by\" contains \"-\", and we verify that year is indeed 1995, then assess if all are accounted for in our tally as a necessary step to conclude the claim's validity.\n\n2. Upon thorough review, the task involves verifying if there are precisely 8 of these instances where Laurent Boutonnat remixed something in 1995.\n\n3. This can be achieved by counting all relevant cells that fit this criteria to provide an accurate figure against which we compare the given statement.\n\n#### Final Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. Finally, after tallying up all entries made by Laurent Boutonnat during 1995 and comparing this count with the claim of 8 remixes, we can then confidently state our answer.\n\n2. Upon detailed examination, it is evident that multiple cells in both columns fit the criteria outlined in step one. These must be carefully tallied to see if indeed there are exactly eight entries matching the criteria for a final assessment.\n\n3. By ensuring all instances align properly with claim specifications and verifying count accuracy, we can then accurately conclude whether the given statement about 8 remixes is true or false based on provided data in table format.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verifying if 'laurent boutonnat' is in the remixed by column of some entries.\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Ensuring that year for these entries is 1995 and tallying up all relevant cells.\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Counting each row where 'remixed by' contains '-'\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim mentions that Bertrand Chtenet Laurent Boutonnat produced 7 remixes in the year 1995. To verify this, we need to identify which rows in the table contain information about the year 1995 and the collaborators for each remix.\n\n2. We will start by looking at the row that contains the album name \"anamorphos\u00e9e , les mots\" along with the version label \"album version\". According to the table, this was released in 1995 and does not have a collaborator listed.\n\n3. Next, we'll examine each remix's entry and find out who collaborated with Laurent Boutonnat on that particular remix. If they collaborated with only one person, then their count should be 1; if there are multiple people collaborating, then the number of collaborations is more than 1. Also, we need to check if their collaboration happened in the year 1995.\n\n4. From row 2 (single version), Laurent Boutonnat collaborated on this remix alone.\n \n5. Then from row 3 (no voice remix edit) and row 4 (extra large remix) and row 5 (distorded dance mix), we can see that Bertrand Chtenet was indeed collaborating with Laurent Boutnnat.\n\n6. Finally, checking all columns of the table to see if there are any other entries where they collaborated in the year 1995:\n\n7. From row 6 (jxl remix) and rows 9, 10, and 11 (live version), we can determine that there is indeed one more collaboration by Bertrand Chtenet Laurent Boutonnat.\n\n8.

First, we need to identify the relevant columns and rows that will help us determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n   - The column \"year\" contains information about when each remix was released.\n   - The column \"remixed by\" identifies who created each remix.\n\n2. Next, let's analyze the column \"remixed by\" to confirm if there are indeed two remixes of the song be released in 1996 and 2003, by Richard Dekard and Junkie XL respectively:\n   - In row 11, we see that there is a remix titled \"uk remix\" with the remixer as Richard Dekard and release year 1996.\n   - However, this is not a direct match to our claim since the table title for this entry says \"uk remix\". We also see another entry in row 7 where Junkie XL is credited as the remixer with a release year of 2003.\n\n3. Let's now verify if there are two distinct entries that fulfill both conditions (release in 1996 and 2003, by Richard Dekard and Junkie XL respectively):\n   - Since our table has multiple entries for each of these years but only one entry for Richard Dekard and one for Junkie XL, we can conclude that there is indeed at least one remix that meets the criteria.\n\n4. Finally, verify if both remixes in 1996 and 2003 meet all conditions:\n   - For row 11 (uk remix), it has a release year of 1996 which matches part of our claim but is titled \"uk remix\" instead of just \"released in 1996\". Thus, this does not fully match our claim.\n   - For row 7 (jxl remix), it meets both conditions: released in 2003 and credited to Junkie XL.\n\n5.

Check if there are any remixes released by Richard Dekkard after 2003.\n   - Look up the year for \"uk remix\" (richard dekkard)\n   - Compare with 2003\n2.
