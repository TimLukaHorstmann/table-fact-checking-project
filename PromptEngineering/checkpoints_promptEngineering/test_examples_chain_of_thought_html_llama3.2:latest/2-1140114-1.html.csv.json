First, we need to check the claim about Juan Manuel Fangio being the winning driver for both the Argentine Grand Prix on January 17th and the Belgian Grand Prix on June 20th.\n\n2. To verify this information, we should look at the table in the \"winning driver\" column for these two specific dates.\n\n3. For the Argentine Grand Prix on January 17th, the winning driver is indeed Juan Manuel Fangio (Fangio).\n\n4. For the Belgian Grand Prix on June 20th, the winning driver is also Juan Manuel Fangio (Fangio).\n\n5. Therefore, based on this information, it appears that the claim about Juan Manuel Fangio being the winning driver for both of these races is TRUE.\n\n6.
