    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. We need to verify if the Boston Celtics played against the Cleveland Cavaliers on consecutive days in December.\n\n2. First, we'll check if they played on two consecutive days at the same location (Boston Garden).\n\n3. For this, we need to find both rows that contain \"Boston Garden\" and \"Cleveland Cavaliers\".\n\n4. We can do this by checking each row individually for these conditions:\n\n    a. Row 16 has Boston Garden but also has Cleveland Cavaliers.\n    \n    b. Row 18 has Boston Garden but also has Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n5. Next, we need to verify if these two rows are consecutive in terms of day (game number).\n\n6. Row 16's game is on December 2nd and row 18's game is on December 5th; they are not consecutive days.\n\n7. Since the games are not on consecutive days, the claim cannot be verified as true based solely on being at Boston Garden and facing Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n8. However, we need to confirm that there were no other instances where this could have happened but didn't:\n\n    a. After re-examining the table, we see there is another instance of Boston Garden but Cleveland Cavaliers:\n       - Row 5 has \"Boston Garden\" and also has \"Cleveland Cavaliers\".\n\n9. Now that we know there was indeed an additional instance of these two teams facing off at the same location on the same day:\n\n10. To verify if this could be considered consecutive days, we can check for any other games with Boston Celtics vs Cleveland Cavaliers where the next game is at the same time but not immediately after:\n    - Looking through the table again, we find no such consecutive matches between these two teams.\n\n11. Therefore, since our original premise of having two consecutive days in December with both \"Boston Garden\" and \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" was met (in row 5), but they were not on consecutive game days (from 2nd to 5th is 3 days apart):\n\n    The claim that Boston Celtics played Cleveland Cavaliers on consecutive days at the same location (Boston Garden) in December does indeed appear true based on our search, as there are games that fit both criteria (row 16 and row 18), but it was also noted that they were not consecutive days.\n\n12. Therefore, after verifying all conditions of the claim:\n\n    The Boston Celtics played Cleveland Cavaliers on consecutive days at the same location (Boston Garden) in December. The days weren't exactly what we'd consider 'consecutive' given our dates span from 2nd to 5th December with a three-day gap.\n\n13. Revisiting the original claim's requirement for \"on consecutive day\" in the context of row numbers or dates, it turns out there actually are two instances that meet both criteria - having Boston Garden and playing Cleveland Cavaliers (row 16 and row 18) but only one set of these meets the consecutive requirement.\n\n14. In short, we verify our initial finding that there indeed were matches meeting \"both at Boston Garden\", then further refine understanding to ensure those matches occurred on 'consecutive days'.\n\n15. However, since the games are not actually on consecutive dates (December 2nd & 5th), but rather a three-day gap in between:\n\n    The answer is more nuanced than initially thought.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We found two instances of Boston Garden and Cleveland Cavaliers but realized they weren't consecutive days; reverified that no other instance fits the criteria for being on consecutive days.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Now that we've verified the win records, let's check if they all won:\n    The only losing record is row 13 where the Boston Celtics lose to Philadelphia 76ers with a score of 107-110.\n\nHere are the cell references:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Played at Boston Garden in December: Rows 2,5,9,11,13,15,18,20,22,24,26,29,30\\nWin records verified for all opponents: Row 13 loses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find all the Thursday games played in December. Looking at the table, there are two Thursday games:\n   - Game 30: Los Angeles Clippers vs San Antonio Spurs\n   - Game 26: Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers\n   - Additionally, I notice that there is also a \"wed dec 19\" which could be interpreted as wednesday (the day before thursday) but since the game was played on wednesday in the \"december\" timeframe and not actually on a thursday in the month of december, it doesn't count.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if the Celtics lost any of these Thursday games. Looking at the table, I find that:\n   - Game 30: Los Angeles Clippers vs San Antonio Spurs, score 118-103 (win)\n   - Game 26: Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers, score 92-107 (loss)\n\n3. Since we found a loss on one of these Thursday games, and there is only one game played on a thursday in december for the celtics (game 30), I will look to see if they play any other games on that day or if this is indeed their sole thursday matchup.\n\n4. Looking at all the thursday games in the table again, we find that they have indeed only one game on that day of the week - game 30: Los Angeles Clippers vs San Antonio Spurs.\n\n5. Since there is indeed only one Thursday game played and it was a loss for the celtics, our chain_of_thought looks something like this:\n   \"the celtic only play 1 game on a thursday in december and lose\" is true because of the existence of game 30 where los angeles clippers vs san antonio spurs took place.\n\n\nHere's the output as per your request:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"the celtic only play 1 game on a thursday in december and lose is true because of the existence of game 30 where los angeles clippers vs san antonio spurs took place\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
