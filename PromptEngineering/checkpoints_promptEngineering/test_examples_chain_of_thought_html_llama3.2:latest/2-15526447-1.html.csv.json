    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the Champion for Each Year**: To verify the claim, we need to check if Austria won 3 championships from 1990 to 1998. First, let's look at the champion for each year:\n\t* 1990: Portugal ( Pedro Lamy , Diogo Castro Santos )\n\t* 1991: Portugal ( Pedro Lamy , Diogo Castro Santos )\n\t* 1992: Netherlands ( Martin Koene , Jos Verstappen )\n\t* 1993: Austria ( Martin Albrecht , Hubert Stromberger )\n\t* 1994: Netherlands ( Tom Coronel , Donny Crevels )\n\t* 1995: Portugal ( Manuel Gi\u00e3o , Andr\u00e9 Couto )\n\t* 1996: Germany ( Pierre Kaffer , Norman Simon )\n\t* 1997: Italy ( Giovanni Montanari , Giovanni Anapoli )\n\t* 1998: Great Britain ( Darren Malkin , Justin Sherwood )\n\n2. **Count the Number of Championships Won by Austria**: Now, let's count the number of championships won by Austria:\n\t* 1993: Yes\n\t* 1995 is not an Austrian championship but a Portuguese one for Portugal. However, we have another year where Austria was in second place - 1990 where Pedro Lamy and Diogo Castro Santos were champions from Portugal.\n    * So the Austrian champion was Martin Albrecht (in the team with Hubert Stromberger) only on 1993.\n    * We should verify if there's any other championship for Austria.\n\n3. **Verify If There Are Any Other Championships Won by Austria**: Upon re-examining the table, we find that:\n\t* Austria also won in 1997 ( Giovanni Montanari and Giovanni Anapoli )\n\t\n4. **Conclusion**: After verifying the champions for each year, we can conclude that Austria has only one championship win from 1990 to 1998.\n\n#### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the Champion for Each Year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the Number of Championships Won by Austria\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify If There Are Any Other Championships Won by Austria\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion: After verifying the champions for each year, we can conclude that Austria has only one championship win from 1990 to 1998.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
