The game number given is \"5\", which means we need to look at the fifth row of the table.\n\n#### Step 3: Extract the value for points scored by Dell Curry from his corresponding row.\nLooking at row 5:\n- Column name: high_points\n- Value in that column: dell curry (17)\n\n#### Step 4: Check if there's any information about Dell Curry rebounding more than anyone else on May 2.\nLooking at row 5 again, there is a mention of Dell Curry sharing the lead in rebounds with Alvin Williams. The value for high rebounds is \"chris childs , alvin williams (6)\".\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if Dell Curry led in both categories based on steps 3 and 4.\nDell Curry scored more points than anyone else mentioned that day, and since there's no mention of him leading in rebounds outright but rather sharing the lead with Alvin Williams, we have to assess if this means he didn't lead. However, given Dell Curry led in points and was part of a tie for rebounds, we can say he indeed led in one category (points).\n\n#### Step 6: Since the claim is that Dell Curry led in both point and rebound categories, determine if his performance fits this description.\nGiven Dell Curry shared the high rebounding record with Alvin Williams but clearly outscored everyone mentioned, it does not fit perfectly. However, given the structure of how the table presents information (with multiple values sometimes being part of a single entry for \"high\" category), it's possible the share in rebounds indicates he was one of the leaders, even if not exclusively so. This ambiguity makes a clear-cut determination challenging without explicit statement of who led rebounding.\n\n#### Step 7: Final assessment based on steps 5 and 6.\nConsidering Dell Curry outscored everyone mentioned but shared the high rebound lead with Alvin Williams, while there's no outright \"led\" in rebounds to match points performance due to sharing, his standout in points does meet the claim. However, without explicit indication of leading rebounds outright (which was not stated), it suggests an issue in the claim as presented.\n\n#### Step 8: Determine if Dell Curry indeed led the Raptors in both categories based on the ambiguity found.\nGiven the table's format and the information provided, it can be argued that Dell Curry did lead in points. However, regarding rebounds, sharing with Alvin Williams means he didn't exclusively lead. This suggests a nuance in interpreting \"led\" for rebounds.\n\n#### Step 9: Output the final JSON answer based on steps 7 and 8.\nBased on the ambiguity and lack of explicit statement about Dell Curry leading in both categories (especially rebounding, which was shared), the claim might not be fully accurate as presented. However, since Dell Curry did lead in points clearly:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows Dell Curry outscored everyone but shares the high rebounds with Alvin Williams; thus, he led in one category (points) but there's ambiguity about leading in rebounds due to sharing.

Identify the table and the claim: The table contains information about basketball games, including attendance figures at various locations. The claim states that the April 29 game was the highest attended at the Air Canada Centre.\n\n2. Find the relevant cells in the table: To verify the claim, we need to check if the attendance figure on April 29 for the Air Canada Centre is indeed the highest.\n\n3. Locate the relevant data:\n   - The column \"location attendance\" indicates the attendance figures.\n   - We are interested in finding out which row corresponds to April 29 and its location (Air Canada Centre).\n   - Looking at the table, we can see that the row corresponding to April 29 has a cell in the \"location attendance\" column with the value \"20112\".\n\n4. Check if this attendance figure is indeed higher than other games at the same venue: We also need to check if the attendance on April 29 was higher than any other game played at Air Canada Centre.\n\n5. Verify that no other game had a higher attendance at Air Canada Centre: By comparing the attendance figures for all games, we can confirm whether the claim is true or false.\n\n6.

Final Analysis:\n   - Looking through all games for April 29 at Air Canada Centre:\n     - The attendance figure on this date was indeed higher than any other game played at the same location in this series.\n\n8. Output final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: identified the table and claim, found relevant data in columns 'location attendance', compared to other games at Air Canada Centre for April 29.\\nStep 2: verified April 29 had the highest attendance at Air Canada Centre.\\nConclusion: since there was indeed a higher attendance on that date than any others before or after it at the same location, claim is TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
