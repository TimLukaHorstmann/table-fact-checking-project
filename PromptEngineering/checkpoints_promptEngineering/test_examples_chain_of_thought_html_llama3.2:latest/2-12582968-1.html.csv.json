We need to verify if this information can be found in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Competitions\nWe are looking for the last two competitions of Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich, which means we need to identify all his recent events and sort them by year. From the table, we see that he competed in the years 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013.\n\n#### Step 3: Extract Distance Data\nWe need to extract the distance data for these recent competitions from the table.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. To evaluate the claim, we need to identify if there are exactly 4 competitions among the listed World Championships.\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that all the events except for one (European U23 Championships in 2001) have the word \"World\" or \"Championships\" in their names.\n3. Among these, the years corresponding to \"World Championships\" are: 1999, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2013\n4. From this we can see that indeed there are six events but only five of them have the word \"world championships\".\n5. Hence the statement is false because it incorrectly states four out of the six listed competitions as being senior World Championship.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table has six world championship events and only one European U23 Championships event which does not have the word 'world championships' in its name. Therefore, there are five senior World Championship events, not four. The statement is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}",
