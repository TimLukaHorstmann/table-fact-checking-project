This means we need to find games where:\n   - The opponent is Philadelphia Flyers.\n   - The game number (in this case, \"game\" column) is greater than the Chicago Black Hawks' game number.\n\n2. **Locate relevant data**:\n   - Chicago Black Hawks' game numbers are in rows 1 and 12.\n   - Philadelphia Flyer's opponents and their respective games can be found by looking at columns 'opponent' and 'game'.\n   \n3. **Filter the table for matching criteria**:\n   - Filter out any row where \"opponent\" is not \"Philadelphia Flyers\".\n   - Ensure that the \"game\" number in these rows is greater than 11 (the Chicago Black Hawks' first game).\n\n4. **Find matches**: We are looking for games with a higher number than the first game of the Chicago Black Hawks.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Count how many such instances meet our criteria.\n\n\n### Relevant Cells as JSON Objects:\n\n[\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n]\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by filtering the table based on whether 'opponent' equals Philadelphia Flyers and if game number is greater than 11.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the games where the score is 3 - 1.\n\n   To do this, we will look at the table and identify the columns of interest: \"game\", \"score\", \"opponent\".\n\n2. Next, we will examine each row in the table for a match with the score of 3 - 1.\n    * For game 18, the opponent is St. Louis Blues and the score is indeed 3-1.\n    * For game 20, the opponent is Atlanta Flames and the score is indeed 3-1.\n\n3. Now that we have identified two games with a score of 3 - 1, let's verify if there are any other games in which the score also matches this value.\n\n   Upon closer inspection, it appears there are no additional matches for this score.\n   \n4. After reviewing all rows in the table, our reasoning can be summarized as follows:\n    * For game 18, St Louis Blues vs a score of 3 - 1\n    * For game 20, Atlanta Flames vs a score of 3 - 1\n\n5. Given these findings, we will move to determining the validity of the claim.\n\n6. The claim states that both games against St. Louis Blue and Atlanta Flames result in a score of 3 - 1.\n    Based on our analysis above, this appears to be true for both teams.\n\n7.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that \"the atlanta flame be the opponent in a game sooner than the los angeles king be\". However, there seems to be a typo in the table - it should be \"atlanta flames\" instead of \"atlanta flame\".\n\n2. **Find Relevant Cells for Atlanta Flames:** We need to find the games where Atlanta Flames are the opponents.\n\n   ```\n   <tr>\n     <td>20</td>\n     <td>21</td>\n     <td>atlanta flames</td>\n     <td>3 - 1</td>\n     <td>14 - 5 - 1</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>23</td>\n     <td>26</td>\n     <td>toronto maple leafs</td>\n     <td>7 - 4</td>\n     <td>15 - 6 - 1</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>21</td>\n     <td>23</td>\n     <td>buffalo sabres</td>\n     <td>5 - 3</td>\n     <td>14 - 6 - 1</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>23</td>\n     <td>28</td>\n     <td>vancouver canucks</td>\n     <td>2 - 1</td>\n     <td>15 - 7 - 1</td>\n   </tr>\n   ```\n\n3. **Find Relevant Cells for Los Angeles Kings:** We need to find the games where Los Angeles Kings are the opponents.\n\n   ```\n   <tr>\n     <td>16</td>\n     <td>12</td>\n     <td>los angeles kings</td>\n     <td>5 - 1</td>\n     <td>11 - 4 - 1</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>24</td>\n     <td>29</td>\n     <td>los angeles kings</td>\n     <td>2 - 2</td>\n     <td>15 - 7 - 2</td>\n   </tr>\n   ```\n\n4. **Compare the Game Numbers of Atlanta Flames and Los Angeles Kings:** Now, we need to compare the game numbers where Atlanta Flames are opponents with the game numbers where Los Angeles Kings are opponents.\n\n   The games for Atlanta Flames in ascending order: `20`, `21`, `23`, `26`, `28`\n   \n   The games for Los Angeles Kings in ascending order: `16`, `24`\n\n5. **Determine if Atlanta Flames be the opponent sooner than Los Angeles Kings:** Since `20` is less than both `16` and `24`, we can conclude that \"the atlanta flames be the opponent in a game sooner than the los angeles king be\" is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find relevant cells for Atlanta Flames\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find relevant cells for Los Angeles Kings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Compare the game numbers of Atlanta Flames and Los Angeles Kings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Determine if Atlanta Flames be the opponent sooner than Los Angeles Kings\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
