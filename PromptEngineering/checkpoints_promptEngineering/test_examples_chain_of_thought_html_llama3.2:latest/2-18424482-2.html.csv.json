Identify the column(s) that contain the length of the song.\n   - In the table, we can see that the length of each song is listed in the sixth column.\n\n3. Extract the values from the relevant cells for the song \"why baby why\".\n   - The row_index of the relevant cell is 1 and the column_name is \"length\". The value is 2:18.\n\n4. Compare the length of the song to find the shortest one.\n   - We need to compare the lengths of all songs in the table to determine which one has the shortest length.\n\n5. Go through each row in the table and extract the relevant cells that contain the length information for each song.\n   - For example, we would look at the sixth column of rows 2-16 to find the lengths of the other songs.\n\n6. Compare each extracted length to 2:18 to determine if it's shorter.\n   - We can stop once we've checked all the relevant cells because we're looking for the shortest one.\n\n7. From the table, check which song has a length that is less than or equal to 2:18.\n   - Upon examining the lengths in the \"length\" column of rows 15 and 16, we see that 2:38 (row 16) is greater than 2:18, but row 16 has a shorter length.\n\n8. Make the final determination based on whether any song's length matches or is less than 2:18.\n   - Since only one cell's value was shorter than 2:18, we can safely say that the claim \"why baby why be the song with the shortest length\" is false.\n\n\n\nHere is the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Find row for 'why baby why', extract lengths from table, compare to find shortest. 16 has a shorter length than 1.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"length\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"length\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
