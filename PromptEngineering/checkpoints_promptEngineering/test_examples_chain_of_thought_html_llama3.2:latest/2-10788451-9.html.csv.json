Therefore, there is no way to calculate an average for multiple games.\n6. **Calculate total away score and count for Collingwood**: Add Collingwood's single away score: 12.14 (86) + 0 = 12.14\n7. **Count the number of Collingwood's away games**: There is only one away game for Collingwood, which we counted as part of our total.\n8. **Calculate total away score and count for St Kilda**: Add St Kilda's single away score: 18.14 (122) + 0 = 18.14\n9. **Count the number of St Kilda's away games**: There is only one away game for St Kilda, which we counted as part of our total.\n10. **Calculate average away scores for Collingwood and St Kilda**: Calculate the average by dividing each team's total away score by their count of away games.\n\n### Average Away Scores Calculations:\n\n- Collingwood: 12.14 / 1 = 12.14\n- St Kilda: 18.14 / 1 = 18.14\n\n11. **Compare calculated averages to the claim**: Compare these average values to the stated claim of 15.14.\n\n### Final Comparison:\n\nBoth teams' calculated averages (12.14 for Collingwood, and 18.14 for St Kilda) are not equal to 15.14.\n\n12. **Conclusion on Claim's Validity**:\nSince we have not found any team meeting the specified claim of having an average away team score of 15.14, we need to state this as TRUE or FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim: The claim states that Collingwood and St Kilda have an average away team score of 15.14.\",\n    \"Identify relevant data: We need to find the total away scores for Collingwood and St Kilda, as well as the number of games each team played away from home in order to calculate their averages.\",\n    \"Locate Collingwood's away scores: Looking at the table, we see that Collingwood's away score is listed as 12.14 (86) for a specific game on Windy Hill.\",\n    \"Locate St Kilda's away scores: Similarly, we find St Kilda's away score listed as 18.14 (122) for their specific game at MCg.\",\n    \"Check if Collingwood played more than one away game: Looking through the table again, we see that Collingwood played only one away game in June 1965.\",\n    \"Calculate total away score and count for Collingwood: Add Collingwood's single away score: 12.14 (86) + 0 = 12.14\",\n    \"Count the number of Collingwood's away games: There is only one away game for Collingwood, which we counted as part of our total.\",\n    \"Calculate total away score and count for St Kilda: Add St Kilda's single away score: 18.14 (122) + 0 = 18.14\",\n    \"Count the number of St Kilda's away games: There is only one away game for St Kilda, which we counted as part of our total.\",\n    \"Calculate average away scores for Collingwood and St Kilda: Calculate the average by dividing each team's total away score by their count of away games.\",\n    \"Compare calculated averages to the claim: Compare these average values to the stated claim of 15.14.\",\n    \"Conclusion on Claim's Validity: Since we have not found any team meeting the specified claim of having an average away team score of 15.14, we need to state this as TRUE or FALSE.\",\n    \"Final Answer in JSON Format: As both teams' averages do not match the claim of 15.14, we can now accurately conclude that this claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, we are interested in finding the row with the second largest crowd, so we need to find the cell corresponding to 72114.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on our analysis.\nSince there is a row with a crowd of 72114 and it is the highest value in the 'crowd' column, it means that this game at mcg does not have the second largest crowd but has the largest. However, we're trying to determine if it's the second largest crowd. \n\nLooking again at the sorted list from Step 2, the row with a crowd of 72114 is the one we need to look for so let's compare this value to the next highest.\n\nStep 5: Compare the value in the 'crowd' column corresponding to the game at mcg (72114) to the next highest value (32260).\nThe next highest value is 32260. Since 72114 is greater than 32260, we can conclude that it's not the second largest crowd.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion.\nBased on our analysis, we found that the claim \"the game at mcg be the game that have the second largest crowd\" is FALSE because the value in the 'crowd' column corresponding to the game at mcg (72114) is actually greater than the next highest value (32260).\n\nHere is the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze table structure and identify relevant columns.

We can see that Melbourne plays away from home against St Kilda, but not on June 14th and not in '65 either. So we continue searching for Melbourne.\n3. Next, let's look for a match where Melbourne is the away team.\n4. The relevant row of interest contains \"melbourne\" as the away team (in column \"away team\") and it does indeed play at home on June 12th according to the column \"date\".\n5. We see that the home team column also contains \"mcg\", which is the Melbourne Cricket Ground, so we can conclude this was a match played by Melbourne.\n6. Therefore, based on our analysis, we find the row of interest: (row_index, column_name) = (2, 'away team') and (2, 'date').\n7. Since both conditions are satisfied, our answer is that the claim is true.\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"First, let's examine the table to find the row related to Melbourne playing at home on June 12, 1965.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"We can see that Melbourne plays away from home against St Kilda, but not on June 14th and not in '65 either.
