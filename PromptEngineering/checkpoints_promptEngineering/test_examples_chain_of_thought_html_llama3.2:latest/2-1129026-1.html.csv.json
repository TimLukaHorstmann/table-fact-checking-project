However, there are rows with the lambda particle and the makeup \"d d s\", which satisfies part of the claim.\n4. **Verify the other specified makeup**: The makeups \"u u s u d s\" are not found in any row with the lambda particle.\n5. **Draw a conclusion based on findings**: Since only one type of makeup is verified for lambda, and it does not include the claimed makeups, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Determine if lambda has u u s u d s or d d s makeup\\nFind relevant cells in table to verify this claim\\nVerify makeup for lambda and compare with specified claims\\nDraw conclusion based on findings\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"makeup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"makeup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"makeup\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
