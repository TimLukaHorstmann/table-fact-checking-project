We will look at the table to see if \"Gadsden, Alabama\" matches in the column \"city of license\".\n\n#### Step 2: Check the city of license for w269ax\nNext, we will check the city of license for the call sign w269ax to verify that it indeed corresponds to Anniston, Alabama.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare values with claim\nAfter verifying both cities, we need to compare these results with the claim. The claim states two different cities (Gadsden and Anniston) associated with two different call signs (w230av and w269ax). If they match our findings from step 1 and 2, then the claim is false; otherwise, it might be true.\n\n#### Step 4: Output the final result\nBased on whether our findings in steps 1 through 3 support or contradict the claim, we will determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE.

The claim states that the city of license for w282ae is Macon, Georgia, and the city of license for w290ag is Griffin, Georgia.\n2. Next, we will examine the relevant cells in the table that contain this information.

Since both values match what is stated in the claim and no discrepancies were found between these claimed city of license values and actual table data, we can determine that the claim about the table's content aligns with our findings.\n6.
