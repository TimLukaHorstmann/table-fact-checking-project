    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The claim states that 4 different teams fail to score a single point in regulation in their round of 16 match.\n2. **Identify relevant information**:\n\t* Team 1 and Team 2 are the two teams playing each other in the first column (`team 1` and `team 2`) and second column (`score`).\n\t* The third, fourth, and fifth columns represent the team's performance during the rounds.\n3. **Analyze table data**:\n\t* We need to find rows where neither Team 1 nor Team 2 scores in their round of 16 match (i.e., both teams have a score of \"0 - 0\" or no points).\n4. **Find relevant cells**:\n\t* For each row, check if the `score` column contains any value other than `\"0 - 0\"`.\n5. **Count the number of failed teams**: If there are more than 4 rows where neither team scores in their round of 16 match, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (continued)\n\n6. **Analyze each row**:\n\t* Row 1: Team 1 has a score of \"2 - 2\", so it does not fail to score.\n\t* Row 2: Team 1 also has a score of \"2 - 2\". We need to check Team 2's score. Team 2 scores less than the expected value, but we can't say it fails without checking all other rows with this logic.\n\t* Row 3: Team 1 scores a higher amount (not zero), so it does not fail to score.\n\t* Row 4: Team 1 has a score of \"2 - 1\", which means it doesn't meet the criteria of failing to score. We cannot immediately conclude that this team fails since we are looking for total team failure across all teams, but for now we see one failure (Team 2).\n\t* Row 5: Team 1 scores more than zero, so it does not fail.\n\t* Row 6: Team 1 has no points (\"0 - 1\"), which means it fails to score in its match against Team 2.\n7. **Count total failures**: Counting the failure of only one team from our analysis doesn't indicate 4 teams failed. So we continue analyzing.\n\n8. **Analyze remaining rows**:\n\t* Row 7: Team 1 scores more than zero, so it does not fail.\n\t* Row 8: Team 1 has a score of \"2 - 0\", which means it fails to meet the criteria because Team 2 also failed in its match against this team (Team 1 and Team 2 both have scores of \"0 - 1\" but are on different sides). This is our second failure, so far we've seen two.\n\t* Row 9: Team 1 has a score of more than zero (\"3 - 5\"), which means it does not meet the criteria. We're looking for total team failures, and this matches another requirement.\n\t* Row 10: Team 1 scores no points (\"0 - 0\") against Team 2, meaning that one more team fails to score in their match (this is our third).\n\t* Row 11: Since both teams have a \"0-0\" result, neither of them failed. Thus this row does not help us in our count.\n\t* Row 12: This row provides yet another failure, as Team 1 has no points (\"0 - 0\") against Team 2, meaning that we now have four different teams failing to score a single point in their round of 16 match.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim: The claim states that 4 different teams fail to score a single point in regulation in their round of 16 match.\",\n    \"Analyze table data and look for rows where neither Team 1 nor Team 2 scores in their round of 16 match (i.e., both teams have a score of '0 - 0' or no points).\",\n    \"For each row, check if the 'score' column contains any value other than '0 - 0'.\",\n    \"Count the number of failed teams: If there are more than 4 rows where neither team scores in their round of 16 match, then the claim is FALSE.\",\n    \"Analyze each row individually and count failures as they occur.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

If \"us cr\u00e9teil (d3)\" is found among these teams, it could potentially support the claim.\n\n3. **Verify if us cr\u00e9teil (d3) played in the round of 16**: Look for rows where \"us cr\u00e9teil (d3)\" appears as the value of any column other than its team name (i.e., columns indicating scores, or rounds). If there are no such rows, this would suggest that the claim is false.\n\n4. **Confirm if us cr\u00e9teil (d3) was the only d3 team to compete in the round of 16**: Look for other teams labeled as \"d3\" and verify if any of them also played in the round of 16.

Check if any other matches in round 16 have a higher total point count than the match between aep bourg sous la roche and stade quimp\u00e9rois.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, let's analyze each row of the table:\n   - Each row represents a game between two teams.\n   - The \"score\" column shows the score of the game.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if all games saw at least 1 goal scored. To do this, we'll examine each cell in the \"score\" column:\n   - If any cell contains a value other than an integer (i.e., a non-numeric value), it indicates that there was no goal scored in that game.\n   - We can start by scanning each row's \"score\" column to find such cells.\n\n3. Analyze the scores for the first row: toulouse fc (d1) vs ogc nice (d1)\n   - The score is 2-2, which means there were goals scored in this game.\n\n4. Continue analyzing all rows of the table:\n   - Lille osc (d1) vs aj auxerre (d1): score = 2-2\n   - Montpellier hsc (d1) vs fc sochaux - montb\u00e9liard (d2): score = 2-3\n   - Stade de reims (d2) vs le havre ac (d1): score = 2-1\n   - FC metz (d1) vs fc mulhouse (d2): score = 3-0\n   - FC s\u00e8te (d2) vs rc lens (d1): score = 0-1\n   - Aep bourg sous la roche (d2) vs stade quimp\u00e9rois (d2): score = 3-5\n   - So chtellerault (d2) vs us cr\u00e9teil (d3): score = 0-0\n\n5. We found one row where there was no goal scored: FC s\u00e8te (d2) vs rc lens (d1), with a score of 0-1.\n\n6. Since we found at least one game where there were no goals scored, the claim that all games saw at least 1 goal scored is FALSE.\n\n7. However, let's look for rows with scores other than integers to confirm this result:\n   - None of the remaining rows have non-numeric score values.\n   \n8. Therefore, we can conclude that the claim about all games having at least one goal scored is TRUE.\n\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze each row of the table\",\n    \"Scan each row's 'score' column to find non-numeric values indicating no goals were scored\",\n    \"Check scores for all rows without finding any non-numeric values\",\n    \"Confirm that only one game had a score with 0\",\n    \"Determine that claim is FALSE due to presence of game with no goal scored\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
