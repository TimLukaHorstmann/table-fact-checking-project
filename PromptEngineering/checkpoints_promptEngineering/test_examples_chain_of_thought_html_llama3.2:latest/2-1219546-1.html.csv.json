To verify this, we need to find the row index of the first game in the table.\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that the row index of the first game is 1.\n3. Next, we need to determine if this row corresponds to a game played during the 1977 World Series.\n4. Since the table only shows dates from October 11th to October 18th, and there is no indication that these games were part of the 1977 World Series (the actual World Series took place in October 1977), we can assume that the first game was not played during the 1977 World Series.\n5. However, based on historical records, Game 1 of the 1977 World Series was indeed played on October 11th and was a long game, lasting 3 hours and 24 minutes (as shown in cell \"time\" with value \"3:24\").\n6.
