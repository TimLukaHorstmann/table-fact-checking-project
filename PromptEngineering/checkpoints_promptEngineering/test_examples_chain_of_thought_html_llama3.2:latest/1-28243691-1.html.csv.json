Check if there are any other universities with lower or equal enrollment numbers to Rice University.\n\n4. Verify that none of the other listed universities have a smaller number of enrolled students than Rice University.\n\n5. Since we confirmed that Rice University has fewer enrolled students and did not find any other university with a similar small enrollment, we can conclude that Rice University indeed has the least number of enrolled students.\n\n6. Confirm that the University of Texas at Austin has more enrolled students than Rice University by comparing their numbers (50995 > 6799).\n\n7.

Next, we compare the number of enrolled students between Rice University and University of Texas at Austin.\n   - Since 6799 is less than 50995, University of Texas at Austin has the least number of enrolled student.\n\n3. Then, we need to check if Rice University have the most number of enrolled student.\n   - We already know that it has 6799 enrolled students.\n\n4.

Check if there are at least three school entries with an enrollment between 20000 and 40000.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps:\n\nSorting the table by enrollment:\n```\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe table table-striped\">\n  <thead>\n    ...\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14769</td>\n      <td>baylor university</td>\n      <td>1845</td>\n      <td>private , baptist</td>\n      <td>14769</td>\n      <td>bears</td>\n      <td>big 12 ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16361</td>\n      <td>university of louisiana at lafayette</td>\n      <td>1898</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>16361</td>\n      <td>ragin' cajuns</td>\n      <td>sunbelt ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16596</td>\n      <td>university of north texas</td>\n      <td>1890</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>16596</td>\n      <td>mean green</td>\n      <td>c - usa ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16933</td>\n      <td>university of oklahoma</td>\n      <td>1890</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>16933</td>\n      <td>sooners</td>\n      <td>big 12 ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16798</td>\n      <td>rice university</td>\n      <td>1891</td>\n      <td>private / non - sectarian</td>\n      <td>16798</td>\n      <td>owls</td>\n      <td>c - usa ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10693</td>\n      <td>southern methodist university</td>\n      <td>1911</td>\n      <td>private / methodist</td>\n      <td>10693</td>\n      <td>mustangs</td>\n      <td>american ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>48702</td>\n      <td>texas a&amp;m university</td>\n      <td>1871</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>48702</td>\n      <td>aggies</td>\n      <td>sec ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8696</td>\n      <td>texas christian university</td>\n      <td>1873</td>\n      <td>private / disciples of christ</td>\n      <td>8696</td>\n      <td>horned frogs</td>\n      <td>big 12 ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>32586</td>\n      <td>texas state universitysan marcos</td>\n      <td>1899</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>32586</td>\n      <td>red raiders</td>\n      <td>big 12 ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>30049</td>\n      <td>texas tech university</td>\n      <td>1883</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>30049</td>\n      <td>red raiders</td>\n      <td>big 12 ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>50995</td>\n      <td>university of texas at austin</td>\n      <td>1883</td>\n      <td>public</td>\n      <td>50995</td>\n      <td>longhorns</td>\n      <td>big 12 ( division i )</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nNow, checking if there are at least three school entries with an enrollment between 20000 and 40000:\n\n1. Baylor University has an enrollment of 14769 which is below the lower bound.\n2. Louisiana State University does not have an entry in this table (it's not present).\n3. University of North Texas has an enrollment of 16596 which is within the range.\n4. University of Oklahoma has an enrollment of 16933 which is within the range.\n5. Rice University has an enrollment of 16798 which is below the lower bound.\n\nSo, only two school entries have an enrollment between 20000 and 40000. Therefore:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Sort the table by enrollment in ascending order\",\n    \"Check if there are at least three school entries with an enrollment between 20000 and 40000\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
