This implies that we are looking for a row in the table where the value in the 'political party' column is 'Conservative' and the value in the 'rank in military' column is 'Lieutenant'.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify which rows meet this condition.\n\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that there are several rows where the value in the 'political party' column is 'Conservative'. \n\n4. We then check if the rank for these rows is indeed 'Lieutenant'. For example, row 33 has 'Conservative' in the political party column and '2nd lieutenant' in the rank in military column. Row 31 also meets this condition.\n\n5. Now that we have identified several rows that meet our condition, we need to check if all of these rows are indeed lieutenants or if there is a row with conservative as the party but not lieutenant as the rank.\n\n6. Upon reviewing the table again, we see that in fact, all the values for ranks that correspond to 'Conservative' do have 'Lieutenant', '2nd Lieutenant', etc.\n\n7. Since there are no rows with 'Conservative' and a different value than 'Lieutenant', our initial analysis is correct.\n\n8. We now know that at least one row has 'Lieutenant' as the rank in military for Conservative members, thus the claim that \"conservative member be all lieutenant\" should be false because it is not true for all conservative members.\n\n9.
