However, some call signs appear with different frequencies across multiple rows (e.g., w228by appears at 93.5 MHz and 107.5 MHz). This means that while individual call signs may have unique frequencies associated with them, it's not universally true that each call sign is unique to the frequency it's broadcast on.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After examining the table, we found multiple instances where a single call sign appears at different frequencies across multiple rows.

    "resp": "Step 1: Read the table and understand what data it contains.\nThe table contains information about radio stations, including their call sign, frequency, city of license, ERP (Effective Radiated Power) value for W, class, and FCC (Federal Communications Commission) info.\n\nStep 2: Identify the claim to be evaluated and its components.\nThe claim is \"the ERp W have more value over 100 than under 100\". The relevant component here are the values of ERp W in different frequency ranges.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the table data for ERp W values above and below 100.\nLooking at the table, we can see that there are only a few cells with ERPW values below 100, while most cells have ERPW values above 100.\n\nStep 4: Compare ERP W values above and below 100 to determine if they generally increase or decrease in value as frequency increases.\nUpon closer inspection of the data, it appears that there is no clear trend showing that ERp W decreases when the frequency goes down. However, this table seems to indicate some variation among the listed radio stations with frequencies under and over 100 MHz.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the claim is true or false based on the analysis.\nGiven the limited data and the apparent lack of a clear trend in ERPW values across different frequency ranges, it's difficult to make a general statement about the value of ERp W above versus below 100. However, we can observe that generally speaking, some radio stations listed under 100 MHz have relatively lower ERp W compared to those over 100 MHz.\n\nStep 6: Identify relevant cells from the table data.\nThe cells relevant for this analysis are:\n- w228by (93.5 Mhz): 120\n- w298ak (107.5 Mhz): 27\n- w280du (103.9 Mhz): 10\n- w263bb (100.5 Mhz): 50\n\nSince the statement seems to be partially correct, with some variation among individual radio stations that might fit into either category of higher value over or lower value under 100 MHz, we will need a more precise claim evaluation.\n\nStep 7: Refine the analysis based on actual data trends and observations.\nLooking at the trend in the table, it can be noted that w298ak (107.5 Mhz) has the lowest ERP W value with a power of 27. On the other hand, there is no clear indication that all radio stations below 100 MHz have higher ERp W compared to those above. This appears to contradict the claim. However, since there are not enough examples in both categories to support such a broad statement, the initial analysis might need re-evaluation.\n\nStep 8: Make the final judgment.\nGiven the lack of clear trend or evidence supporting either side, and with only few radio stations listed on each side of 100 Mhz having varying ERp W values, it seems there's not enough data to conclusively support the claim as stated. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After examining the table data for call signs like w298ak (107.5 mhz) with a lower ERp W value and w263bb (100.5 mhz) also having an ERPW of 50; while others listed under 100 Mhz have varying ERp W, a clear trend is not established.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the table for FM broadcasts in each state. \n\nStep 1: Analyze the table data.\nThe table contains information about various radio stations with their call signs, frequencies, cities of license, ERP (Effective Radiated Power), and FCC info.\n\nStep 2: Identify states mentioned in the claim\nThe claim mentions that \"maryland be the only state\" - implying we should look for FM broadcasts only in Maryland. However, based on the table structure, there is no clear indication of a separate column or row exclusively for states. So our main focus will revolve around identifying which stations are broadcasting on an FM frequency and which state each station belongs to.\n\nStep 3: Determine if any other states have FM broadcasts\nBased on the table data provided, we see that multiple stations across different cities in Florida (w228by, w298ak, w280du, w263bb, w294 am, w227bt, w244bd) are broadcasting. None of these have information indicating they belong to Maryland.\n\nStep 4: Analyze claims for relevance\nThe claim states \"maryland be the only state that way - fm broadcast in.\" However, it seems there was a typo or misunderstanding since we can't verify any FM broadcasts occurring exclusively in Maryland from the table provided. We know that Maryland is missing from the table but can't confirm if there are any FM broadcasts only happening in this specific state.\n\nStep 5: Analyze relevant data\nSince none of the stations with information available belong to Maryland, and based on our observation from step 4 about potential typo, we'll proceed by assuming there were no FM broadcast in Maryland. Given that claim's unclear structure and how it is phrased, one can argue its accuracy based solely on the given table - as it does not include any stations from \"maryland\". Thus determining the truth of the entire statement is impossible without more context.\n\nTherefore, our analysis shows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We cannot verify if Maryland is the only state for FM broadcasts because there are no radio stations with call signs belonging to this specific state. The table doesn't contain information on states; it contains general info about radio stations in Florida.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the relevance cells listed above are based on our need to verify if there were any calls belonging to Maryland.",
