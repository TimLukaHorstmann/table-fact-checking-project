On December 11, 1988, they were also the opponent ( Dallas Cowboys , but this doesn't fit our claim).\n\n   However, looking at the dates given in the claim and comparing with the table data, there is no other match where the green bay packers be the opponent 2 times.\n\n4. We found that only one occurrence was verified by the original condition of the claim (the first game on September 4 , 1988 ) .\n\n5. However since the second date mentioned in the claim is for December 11, 1988 which doesn't have green bay packers as an opponent according to our data.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The Green Bay Packers were indeed the opponents on two dates, but the second date given by the claim (December 11 , 1988) is incorrect according to the table data. Only one match was verified: September 4, 1988\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
