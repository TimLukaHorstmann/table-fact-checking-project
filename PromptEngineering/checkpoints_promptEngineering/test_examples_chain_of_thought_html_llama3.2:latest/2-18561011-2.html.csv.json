    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant rows for each country\nFirst, we need to identify which countries have at least two rugby stadiums with a capacity of over 10,000 that closed.\n\nFor England:\n- We can see there are several stadiums listed in England, so let's check if any of them fit the criteria.\n- Loftus Road has a capacity of 18500 and closed in 2001. Edgeley Park also had a capacity of 10900 but we need to verify its status as it did close.\n\nFor Scotland:\n- We can see there are several stadiums listed in Scotland, so let's check if any of them fit the criteria.\n- Meadowbank Stadium has a capacity of 16500 and closed in 2006. Firhill has a capacity of 10887 and also closed in 2012.\n\nFor Wales:\n- We can see there are several stadiums listed in Wales, so let's check if any of them fit the criteria.\n- Racecourse Ground has a capacity of 15500 and closed in 2009. Loftus Road was in this category but we just found another one from wales that matches\n\nFor United States:\n- We can see there are several stadiums listed in United States, so let's check if any of them fit the criteria.\n- Petco Park has a capacity of 42445 and closed in 2010. Stubhub Center also had a capacity of 27000 and closed in 2007.\n\nFor New Zealand:\n- We can see there are several stadiums listed in New Zealand, so let's check if any of them fit the criteria.\n- Athletic Park has a capacity of 39000 and closed in 1999. Carisbrook has a capacity of 29000 and closed in 2011.\n\n### Step 2: Check if each stadium actually meets the capacity condition\nSince we need to verify that stadiums have capacities over 10,000:\n\n- For England, only Edgeley Park has a capacity over 10,000 but it was in use until 2012 so it does meet the criteria.\n- For Scotland, both Meadowbank Stadium and Firhill Stadium have a capacity over 10,000 and closed in 2006 and 2012 respectively.\n- For Wales, Racecourse Ground has a capacity of 15500 which is over 10,000 but Loftus Road was also in this category so that does meet the criteria.\n- For United States, both Petco Park and Stubhub Center have capacities over 10,000 and closed in 2010 and 2007 respectively.\n- For New Zealand, neither Athletic Park nor Carisbrook has a capacity of exactly over 10000 but they do meet the other criteria so that does meet the criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if each country meets the condition\nSince there are stadiums from each country which closed with capacities of more than 10,000 we need to verify how many each country actually have:\n\n- For England, only Edgeley Park has a capacity over 10000 and it did close so that counts.\n\n- For Scotland, both Meadowbank Stadium and Firhill Stadium had a capacity over 10000 but they closed, so there are two stadiums from Scotland in this category.\n \n- For Wales, we found Racecourse Ground to have a capacity of more than 10,000 which was still in use. The criteria does not specify whether the stadium must be currently active but since it is, that counts.\n\n- For United States, both Petco Park and Stubhub Center had capacities over 10000 and closed so there are two stadiums from United States in this category.\n \n- For New Zealand, neither Athletic Park nor Carisbrook have a capacity of more than 10,000 however they do meet the other criteria that their stadium closed.\n\n### Step 4: Final assessment\nSince all countries have at least one rugby stadium with a capacity of over 10,000 and it was still in use when it closed so that counts as meeting the criteria we can now conclude:\n\n### Chain of Thought\n\" England has Edgeley Park Stadium which is a Rugby Stadium with capacity more than 10000 that closed. Scotland also have two stadiums Meadowbank Stadium and Firhill Stadium both Rugby Stadiums with capacities over 10000, that closed. Wales found Racecourse Ground with capacity more than 10000 that closed. United States have two Rugby Stadiums Petco Park and Stubhub Center both closing with a capacity of more than 10000. New Zealand neither has stadium meeting the criteria\"\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"closed\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"closed\"\n  }\n]\n\n### Conclusion\nEach country has at least one stadium that meets the criteria, so each country does meet the condition.

First, we need to determine if both Edgeley Park and Firhill were large rugby union stadiums. This information can be found in column 'capacity (at time of closure)' where a capacity of over 30000 is considered large.\n\n3. We find that Edgeley Park has a capacity of 10900 which does not meet the criteria for being a large stadium, thus we rule it out from consideration as the first of the two stadiums to close.\n \n4. Next, Firhill is found to have a capacity of 10887 which also does not meet the criteria. Therefore, we also rule it out.\n\n5. However, Edgeley Park and Firhill were both closed in 2012. Hence, the claim \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close , in 2012\" is still TRUE.\n\n6. The final relevant table information for this case can be found at row index 11 (Edgeley Park) with column name 'closed' and row index 12 (Firhill) with column name 'closed'.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"the claim was true because edgeley park and firhill were large rugby union stadiums that closed in 2012. thus we ruled out both of them from consideration.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n  ]\n}",

Next, we need to verify if the athletic park has a total capacity of 39000 seats. We can do this by checking the row where \"athletic park\" is located in the table.

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Filter the table**: We need to filter the table for stadiums in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 2,\n         \"column_name\": \"country\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 2,\n         \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n       }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the capacity**: Now we check if the capacity of Lansdowne Road is indeed over 10,000.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 1,\n         \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n       }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for the second stadium in Ireland**: We also need to check if there is a second rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 1,\n         \"column_name\": \"country\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 2,\n         \"column_name\": \"country\"\n       }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n4. **Compare the capacities**: Now we compare the capacities of Lansdowne Road and the other stadium in Ireland.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 1,\n         \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 2,\n         \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n       }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n5. **Determine the answer**: If Lansdowne Road has a capacity over 10,000 and there is another stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 2,\n         \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n       }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n6. **Check if there is another stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000**: \n   - Lansdowne Road has a capacity of 49000 and the other one has a capacity of 53000.\n   - Since the claim stated that the second one had close, we assume it refers to having closed. So, we are looking for another stadium in Ireland that had closed before or around 2007, after which Lansdowne Road had closed. There is no record of such an event.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Filter the table for stadiums in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000\",\n    \"Check the capacity of Lansdowne Road\",\n    \"Check for the second stadium in Ireland\",\n    \"Compare the capacities\",\n    \"Determine the answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
