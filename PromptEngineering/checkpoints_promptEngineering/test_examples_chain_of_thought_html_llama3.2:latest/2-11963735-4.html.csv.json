The highest score we found was for 'warriors'. We must check that of the Nuggets' games, since their home score is requested.\n\nLet us examine each row:\n\n- Row index:0:\n  - Score value: 89\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: Not in December\n  - Score is not higher than claimed\n\n- Row index:1:\n  - Score value: 111\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: In December, but this row has a score lower than our target (in a home game against the Lakers).\n  \n- Row index:2:\n  - Score value: 122\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: In December\n  - Score is not higher than claimed\n\n- Row index:3:\n  - Score value: 97\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: Not in December\n  - Score is not higher than claimed\n\n- Row index:4:\n  - Score value: 99\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: In December\n  - Score is not higher than claimed\n\n- Row index:5:\n  - Score value: 91\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: In December\n  - Score is not higher than claimed\n\n- Row index:6:\n  - Score value: 116\n  - Team: nuggets\n  - Date of game: In December\n  - Score is equal to or higher than the claimed score.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the answer\nSince we found a row where 'score' column has the highest score for Denver Nuggets in December 2007 at home, and it's greater than or equal to the claimed value, our answer is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 6: Output final JSON object\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, find the rows in table where 'date' column has a date within December 2007.

Then we will check if the value in the \"score\" column matches with 112.\n\n#### Step 3: Find the score of Denver Nuggets against Rockets on December 20, 2007\nFrom the given table, the relevant rows are:\n- Row index: 20\n- Column name: \"score\"\nValue in the \"score\" column for this row is \"111 - 112\"\n\n#### Step 4: Verify if the value matches with the claim\nSince the score is 112 points for Rockets against Nuggets and it's denoted as (111 - 112) which makes sense, let us verify other relevant data like total attendance to ensure that Nuggets had highest home total in December 2007.\n\n#### Step 5: Check the total attendance on December 20, 2007\nTo find the highest home attendance in December 2007 for Nuggets.\n- Row index: 20\n- Column name: \"attendance\"\nValue in the \"attendance\" column for this row is \"16157\"\n\n#### Step 6: Check if Nuggets had highest home total in December 2007\nFrom the given table, all other scores are lower than 112 and the attendance on December 20th is indeed higher than any other games. Hence it can be concluded that Denver Nuggets scored 112 points against Rockets on December 20, 2007, and they had their highest home total in December 2007.\n\n#### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the score of Denver Nuggets against Rockets on December 20, 2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the row index and column name of relevant cells\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the score of Denver Nuggets against Rockets on December 20, 2007\",\n      \"value\": \"111 - 112\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify if the value matches with the claim\",\n      \"result\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the total attendance on December 20, 2007\",\n      \"value\": \"16157\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if Nuggets had highest home total in December 2007\",\n      \"result\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this claim, I need to find the relevant rows in the table where both teams are playing back-to-back games against each other.\n\n3. Looking at the table, I see two back-to-back games between Nuggets and Warriors: \n   - December 28, 2007 (Warriors' home) vs December 30, 2007 (Nuggets' home)\n   - December 30, 2007 is actually a road game for the Nuggets.\n\n4. Next, I need to verify if the Nuggets won on their home court on this date.\n   \n5. Looking at the table again, I see that the Nuggets won on December 28, 2007 (Nuggets' home) vs Warriors (Warriors are away).\n\n6. However, for the second back-to-back game between Nuggets and Warriors:\n   - December 30, 2007 is actually a road game for the Nuggets.\n   \n7.
