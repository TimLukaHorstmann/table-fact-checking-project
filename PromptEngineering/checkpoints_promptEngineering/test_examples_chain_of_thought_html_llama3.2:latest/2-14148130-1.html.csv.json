    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that when the points difference is 0, the drawn game will be 3 and the lost game will be 5.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Cells in the Table**:\n   - We need to find all instances where the `points difference` column is 0.\n   - Then, we'll look at the corresponding values in the `drawn` and `lost` columns for these rows.\n\n3. **Identify Rows with Points Difference of 0**: Reviewing each row:\n   - For the first row (`row_index = 1`), `points difference` is `41 - 07`, which equals 34, not 0.\n   - We continue this process to find any row where `points difference` is actually 0.\n\n4. **Examine Relevant Rows**:\n   - After going through the rows systematically, we can identify that there are no instances of `points difference` being exactly 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there's at least one instance of `points difference` not equal to 0 in any row, it contradicts the claim directly.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each cell in the table where points difference equals 0 but did not find a match.

    "resp": "#### Reasoning Steps:\n1. The claim states that there should be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7. \n2. Looking at the table, we see the following draws: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.\n3. We can observe that all draws are indeed less than or equal to 3. So, this condition is satisfied.\n4. Next, looking at the losses in the table: 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7.\n5. As we see, there is only one loss greater than 7 which is 7 itself. However, since it's a single occurrence and not all occurrences of loss are more than 7, this condition is also satisfied.\n6. Hence, based on the observations in steps 3 and 4, our reasoning process concludes that the claim is true.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Looking at the table we see draws less than or equal to 3, and losses of single occurrence of 7 thus satisfying both conditions.
