    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "#### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that \"the chicago bull only play the boston celtic at the boston garden during the 1984 - 85 season\". This means we need to check if there are any instances where Chicago Bulls played Boston Celtics at Boston Garden outside of the 1984-85 season.\n\n#### Step 2: Check for games between Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden\nWe need to look for rows in the table where 'game' is a number greater than 43 (since all games before that are from the 1984-85 season), 'opponent' is \"Boston Celtics\", and 'location' is \"Boston Garden\".\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the seasons of the games\nWe also need to verify if these games were actually played during the 1984-85 season or not. We can do this by checking the 'date' column for dates within that specific time period.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze relevant rows\nAnalyzing the table, there are several instances where Chicago Bulls play Boston Celtics at Boston Garden. For example:\n- Row 36: \"chicago bulls\" plays \"boston celtic\" at \"Boston garden\"\n- Row 41: \"philadelphia 76ers\" is not relevant here but row 42 has a duplicate game of \"chicago bulls\" playing \"seattle supersonics\", however another instance of Chicago Bulls vs Boston Celtics in row 37 and 43 and the dates in those rows fall outside of the 1984 - 85 season. And row 45: \"chicago bulls\" plays \"detroit pistons\" which has a date that is also not within the specified time frame, but another instance exists in row 44 where \"chicago bulls\" plays \"portland trail blazers\", however row 40's game falls outside of our desired season. And finally, there's row 39 and 42 & 46 do not meet conditions since their dates fall after the 1984 - 85 season and are thus irrelevant to our investigation. However row 38 has a date that falls into our timeframe as does row 35.\nBut what if \"chicago bulls\" playing \"boston celtic\" at Boston Garden was during the 1984-85 season? We need to look at those rows more closely.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify games in the 1984-85 season\nNow, we verify that the Chicago Bulls-Boston Celtics games at Boston Garden were indeed during the 1984-85 season.\nLooking at row 37 and 38, both have dates \"wed jan 11\" and \"sat jan 12\", which fall after our target time period. Also checking row 36 has date \"wed jan 9\". Which falls into our desired timeframe for the 1984 - 85 season\nRow 39's game on \"wed jan 16\", also meets this criteria.\nThus, we have found that there are indeed games between Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden during the 1984-85 season.\n\n#### Step 6: Draw conclusions\nBased on our analysis, it appears that the claim is not entirely accurate. There were games between Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden outside of the 1984-85 season.\n\n#### Output\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify if there are any instances where Chicago Bulls played Boston Celtics at Boston Garden outside of the 1984-85 season.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Check for games between Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify the seasons of the games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Analyzing relevant rows\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"But what if Chicago Bulls playing Boston Celtics at Boston Garden was during the 1984-85 season?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify games in the 1984-85 season\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Row 37 and 38 have dates that fall after our target time period.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Also checking row 36 has date wed jan 9, which falls into our desired timeframe for the 1984 - 85 season \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Row 39's game on wed jan 16 also meets this criteria\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Thus we have found that there are indeed games between Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden during the 1984-85 season.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 37,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 38,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 36,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 39,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To do this, we can sum up the 'record' column values for rows with 'Boston Celtics' as the opponent or team playing against them.

To do this, we can sort the rows based on the \"score\" column and look for the first occurrence where the team is the Boston Celtics.\n\n3. **Compare scores between Philadelphia 76ers games against Boston Celtics**: After finding both rows, we need to compare their scores. If the score in the row corresponding to the lowest score game played by the Boston Celtics is lower than the score in the row for the Philadelphia 76ers game against the Boston Celtics, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. **List relevant cells**:\nThe relevant cells are:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 41,\n  \"column_name\": \"score\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 42,\n  \"column_name\": \"score\"\n}\n}\n\n5. **Compare scores**: The score in row 42 is 97 and the score in row 41 is 113. Since 97 is lower than 113, the claim that the Boston Celtics achieved their lowest score against the Philadelphia 76ers is TRUE.\n\n6. **Output final answer**:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row for the Philadelphia 76ers game\",\n    \"Find the row for the lowest score of the Boston Celtics\",\n    \"Compare scores between Philadelphia 76ers games against Boston Celtics\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 41,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 42,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find out which team played against the Boston Celtics in Boston Garden. We can do this by looking at the table for the opponent column (column 3) and finding rows that contain \"Boston Celtics\" or a similar name.\n2. Next, we will look for rows where the opponent is indeed \"Boston Celtics\" or a similar name, then check which team won the game in Boston Garden. We can do this by looking at the score column (column 4).\n3. After determining which teams played against the Boston Celtics in Boston Garden and which of those teams actually won, we will then look for a row where both conditions from steps 1 & 2 are met for Chicago Bulls.\n4. Compare to other team wins.\n\nNow let's list out the relevant cells:\n\n- Cell 6 (row_index: 3, column_name: \"opponent\") contains \"BOSTON CELTICS\"\n- Cell 9 (row_index: 5, column_name: \"record\") shows Chicago Bulls as team with a win against Boston Celtics in Boston Garden.\n- There is no other row that meets the conditions for the same game.\n\nHere's the complete reasoning step:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: search for rows with opponent Boston Celtics or similar name; Step 2: check score column to confirm win; Step 3: verify Chicago Bulls are team in question; Step 4: compare to other wins \",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: search for rows with opponent Boston Celtics or similar name; Step 2: check score column to confirm win; Step 3: verify Chicago Bulls are team in question; Step 4: compare to other wins \",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}",
