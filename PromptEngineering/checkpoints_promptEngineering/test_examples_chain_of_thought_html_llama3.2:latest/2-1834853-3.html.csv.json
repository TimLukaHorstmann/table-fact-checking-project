If it's not 4, we look at other rows with a score of 4 for any international goal in 2002 and verify if Carsten Jancker scored that many goals. Since there are multiple rows where Carsten Jancker scored 4 goals but only one corresponds to the claim \"carsten jancker score 4 international goal in 2002\", we can confirm this was indeed his score.\n5. To make sure it is an international goal, we need to check if this row corresponds to a qualifying match or not (according to the table) because Carsten Jancker scored many goals for Germany that year but did so during qualifiers rather than the finals tournament.\n\nHere are the relevant rows:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"score\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 6,\n  \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n}\n\nNow, let's output a JSON object with our final answer:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Check Carsten Jancker's score in the 2002 World Cup.

To verify the claim, we need to look for rows where 'score' contains '1 - 0', which is indicative of an international goal by Carsten Jancker.\n\n3. Check rows from table that contain '1 - 0':\n   - The first row mentions a score of \"1 - 0\" but in the result column it's stated as \"3 - 2\", not directly related to Carsten Jancker.\n   - The fifth row mentions another instance, this time the score is indeed \"1 - 0\". But again, the match was part of the world cup qualifier.\n\n4. Check rows from table that contain 'score' equal to '1 - 0', for a possible correct match:\n    - Row 15 in the table contains '3 june 2000' with score \"1 - 0\", and 'result' is also \"3 - 2\" which does not indicate an international goal by Carsten Jancker.\n   - We are now looking for rows where both 'score' equals '1-0' and match was a world cup qualifier or world cup game.\n\n5. After analyzing, the only row that meets our conditions (both match details in score column equal \"1 - 0\" AND matches were either World Cup Qualifier or World Cup) is Row 15 with date \"3 june 2000\".\n\n6. The claim now seems to be verified because it is true that Carsten Jancker scored in a world cup game and 2 more world cup qualifier games.\n\n7.
