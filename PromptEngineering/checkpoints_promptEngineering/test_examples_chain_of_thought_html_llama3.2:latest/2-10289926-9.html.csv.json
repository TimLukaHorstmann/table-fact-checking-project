Therefore, there are 8 swimmers in total.\n\n2. Next, we need to count how many of these swimmers have an overall rank lower than 100.\n\n   Looking at the table, we can see that the following swimmers have an overall rank lower than 100:\n   * yassir abalalla (overall rank: 98)\n   * jonathan calderon (overall rank: 101) is not below 100\n   * leonel dos santos matonse (overall rank: 104) is not below 100\n   * luke hall (overall rank: 105) is not below 100\n   * naji askia ferguson (overall rank: 107) is not below 100\n   * marco camargo gonzalez (overall rank: 108) is not below 100\n   Therefore, only yassir abalalla has an overall rank lower than 100.\n\n3.
