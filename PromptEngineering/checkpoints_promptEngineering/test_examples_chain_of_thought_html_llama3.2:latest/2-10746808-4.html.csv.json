We start by examining the row where Collingwood played Melbourne. The crowd for this match is listed as 15000. Since 15000 is indeed less than 19000, we can continue with this row.\n\n3. Next, we examine the row where Carlton played South Melbourne. The crowd for this match is listed as 25000. Since 25000 exceeds 19000, this row does not support the claim.\n\n4. We proceed to examine the rows for Richmond vs Hawthorn and North Melbourne vs Geelong. Both of these crowds are also less than or equal to 19000 (14000 and 14000 respectively), so we continue with these rows as well.\n\n5. Lastly, we check the row where St Kilda played Fitzroy. The crowd for this match is listed as 22000. Since 22000 exceeds 19000, this row also does not support the claim.\n\n6. We then move on to the row where Footscray played Essendon. The crowd for this match is listed as 20000. Since 20000 exceeds 19000, it does not support the claim either.\n\n7. Now that we have examined all rows, we can determine if any of these matches had a crowd that exceeded 19000 for exactly 3 out of the 6 matches on 22 May 1926.\n\n8. We see that there are only two matches where the crowd was less than or equal to 19000 (Collingwood vs Melbourne and North Melbourne vs Geelong), not three, so we must conclude that at least four teams did have a crowd exceeding this threshold.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Verify date**: Check if St Kilda played against Fitzroy on 22 March 1926. Since the table only provides a single match for both teams, we'll have to compare their \"date\" columns.\n\n   - The table shows that Fitzroy and St Kilda's matches both occurred on 22 May 1926.\n   \n2. **Venue check**: Confirm that St Kilda indeed played against Fitzroy at Junction Oval.\n\n   - The table confirms this: \"junction oval\" is listed as the venue for St Kilda vs Fitzroy.\n\n3. **Scores and margin of victory**: Calculate if St Kilda won by exactly 11 points from Fitzroy.\n\n   - St Kilda's score is 9.8 (62) and Fitzroy's score is 7.9 (51).\n   \n   - To calculate the margin, subtract Fitzroy's score from St Kilda's: 62 - 51 = 11.\n   \n   - The difference in scores supports that St Kilda won by exactly 11 points.\n\n4. **Final determination**: Based on steps 1-3, determine if the claim about Fitzroy losing to St Kilda is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nSince all conditions (date, venue, margin of victory) are met, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
