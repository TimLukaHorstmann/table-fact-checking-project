In fact, there are some globular clusters with lower apparent magnitudes than the irregular galaxy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nStep 5: Identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5466, Apparent Magnitude (10.5)\n- Row 5474, Apparent Magnitude (11.9)\n- Row 5477, Apparent Magnitude (14.5)\n- Row 1, Object Type (irregular galaxy)\n\nThese cells show that the globular clusters have lower apparent magnitudes than the irregular galaxy.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim and break it down into its components.
