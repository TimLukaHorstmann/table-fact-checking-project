Check if Kyle Beckerman's country is not the USA.\n   Since his country is indeed USA, we move on to the next step.\n\n3.

Now check for Nat Borchers' situation:\n   - His country is not the USA (since it's listed as \"USA\" but we are considering whether he is from the USA or not), \n     so we consider him as not being from the USA.\n   - He has only 9 goals, which is less than 21.\n\n5.

Conclusion: \n    The claim states that a player who isn't from the USA have more than 21 goal but player nat borchers who also isn't from the usa have only 4 goal, so this statement is FALSE because both Kyle Beckerman and Nat Borchers are indeed from the USA for comparison purposes.\n\n\n\nHere's how it can be represented as a JSON:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Check if player kyle beckerman has more than 21 goals.
