However, given that the table has a \"final\" entry at row index 23 (or so implied by \"final\" being in the final column), it's likely there isn't a row with an index equal to or greater than 21.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the relevance of cells in the specified rows.\nSince we are asked for information about the 22nd stage and the final, we would look for cells that have details on these stages. However, without explicit cell values provided in the table data structure, we must infer based on the instruction to output a JSON object with relevant cells.\n\n#### Step 4: Consider the \"final\" row as part of the answer.\nGiven that there is an explicitly labeled \"final\" row at index 23, it's reasonable to conclude this includes details about both the final stage and potentially information about why stages were detailed up to the final, including if stage 22 had such detail.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the relevance of specific columns in the table.\nThe question specifies outputting the relevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". Since the claim involves the 22nd stage and the final stage details, we're specifically interested in these rows and any column that might contain detailed information about stages beyond the initial stages.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclude based on the steps above.\nThe table does indeed provide detail up to the final stage, including potentially stage 22, if it exists in a form that's been represented.

The question asks for the date of event on stage 22 plus the final. This means we should look at the \"stage\" column for these two stages and their corresponding dates.\n3. Next, I need to find out which cells in the table contain this information. Given that stage names don't necessarily match exactly with row indices or column names provided, I will identify the relevant columns and rows based on the context clues given (e.g., \"stage\" column).\n4. Since we're interested in stage 22 and the final, these stages are presumably part of a larger sequence where each entry includes both the date of the event and the winner.\n5. Now that I've identified my steps and the relevant columns (stage for dates), I need to find the exact cell locations.\n6. According to the table structure given, we can directly infer the row indices based on the stage numbers since each \"stage\" entry in the table corresponds to a specific number of rows down from the initial stages that have been mentioned.\n7.
