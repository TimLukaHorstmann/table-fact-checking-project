However, it seems that this analysis was mistaken because in week 12 Minnesota loses to Tampa bay Buccaneers.\n\n### Step 5: Re-evaluating\nIn week 16 'green bay packers (milw)' is the relevant match-up since Minnesota lost but Green Bay Packers had zero points conceded by them.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on this analysis, there are two weeks where the Minnesota Vikings did not hold their opponent to zero points.

Each row contains information about an opponent team, including their score and the Vikings' result. The columns for these values are 'opponent', 'result', and 'attendance'.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relevant cells to analyze\nTo check if there is any week in which the Minnesota Vikings hold their opponent to more than zero points, we need to examine the 'result' column of each row where the Vikings are playing. This will involve checking the score mentioned against the Vikings' result.\n\nStep 3: Iterate through the table rows and apply conditions\nWe should iterate over each row in the table to determine if there's any instance where the Vikings' opponent scored more than zero points. We can achieve this by checking if 'opponent' is not blank (since a score cannot be empty for an opponent), then compare it with the result provided, ensuring that the Vikings won or tied.\n\nStep 4: Identify instances violating the claim\nIf we find at least one instance where the Vikings scored more than zero points against their opponents, the claim is false. Otherwise, if no such instance exists, the claim holds true.\n\nStep 5: Determine the final answer based on conditions met\nWe should verify all the weeks to ensure that there are no instances of the Minnesota Vikings allowing an opponent's score greater than zero. If this condition is satisfied across all the table rows, then the statement in question is considered true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nStep 6: Extract relevant information for JSON format output\nOnce we've verified the claim, extract the specific row numbers and column names that helped make our determination.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Minnesota Vikings' season in 1993 is true or false, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the number of wins**: Count the number of rows where \"result\" contains a \"w\", indicating a win.\n\n2. **Count the number of losses**: Count the number of rows where \"result\" contains an \"l\", indicating a loss.\n\n3. **Compare the counts**: Compare the count of wins with the count of losses to determine if the team won 8 games and lost 6 games.\n\n4. **List relevant cells**: List all the specific cells in the table that are related to this process, specifically rows where the \"result\" contains a win or loss.\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\n1. **Count the number of wins**:\n   - Looking at the table, I see that there are 8 rows where \"result\" starts with \"w\", indicating a win.\n   - Relevant cells: \n     ```javascript\n       [\n         {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":16,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":17,\"column_name\":\"result\"}\n       ]\n     ```\n   - This confirms that there are 8 wins.\n\n2. **Count the number of losses**:\n   - Looking at the table, I see that there are 6 rows where \"result\" starts with \"l\", indicating a loss.\n   - Relevant cells: \n     ```javascript\n       [\n         {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":12,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"result\"}\n       ]\n     ```\n   - This confirms that there are 6 losses.\n\n3. **Compare the counts**: Since both the number of wins (8) and the number of losses (6) match the claim, I can conclude that the team won 8 games and lost 6 games during their 1993 season.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   ```javascript\n     {\n       \"chain_of_thought\": \"counted 8 wins and 6 losses in the table\",\n       \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n       \"relevant_cells\": [\n         {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":16,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":17,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":12,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n         {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"result\"}\n       ]\n     }\n   ```\n   The answer is TRUE.",
