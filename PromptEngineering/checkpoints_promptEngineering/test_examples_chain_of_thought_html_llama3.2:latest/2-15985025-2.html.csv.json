    "resp": "#### Step 1: Review the Claim\nThe claim states that David Bielkheden won a majority of his match by unanimous decision. We need to verify if this is true based on the provided table.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Information\nTo check the claim, we need to identify which matches David Bielkheden participated in and how many fights he won.\n\n#### Step 3: Search for David Bielkheden's Matches\nLooking at the table, we find that David Bielkheden participated in match #4 (with Charles McCarthy) and match #7 was not listed but match #5 was with Kimmo Nurkse. However, to fulfill the claim, we need more information on match #6 or other matches that would indicate he won by a majority of decisions.\n\n#### Step 4: Interpret Match Outcomes\nUnfortunately, without explicit details on how David Bielkheden won (e.g., decision, unanimous), we can't directly confirm if he won by a \"majority\" of his matches. However, we can infer that the claim implies at least one unanimous victory.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze Claim's Ambiguity\nGiven the lack of specific information on match outcomes and only finding details for two fights, it's challenging to definitively say if David Bielkheden won a majority of his matches by unanimous decision without more context.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclude Based on Available Data\nSince we cannot accurately verify the claim with the provided data due to its ambiguity (e.g., lack of specific win conditions and no clear number of fights won), the answer must be based on the assumption that such a claim could not be fully substantiated with the given details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about David Bielkheden winning a majority of his matches by unanimous decision cannot be fully verified or confirmed with the provided table due to insufficient information and ambiguity in the data.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output indicates that the claim cannot be confirmed based on the provided data.",

Since we don't know which opponent, we'll look for rows with an empty value in the \"Lost to\" column.\n\n**Step 3: List the fighters that David Bielkheden has lost to**\nLooking at the table, we see that there is no row explicitly stating a loss by David Bielkheden. However, since he does have losses mentioned (e.g., Tommy De Pretre), we need to look for rows where the column values are names or empty strings and the row index matches a potential opponent of David's.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the fighter of interest is among those listed**\nSince we're looking for \"Tommy De Pretre\" as one of the fighters that David Bielkheden has lost to, we need to verify that this specific name appears in the table. If it does, then David Bielkheden has indeed lost to at least one of his opponents.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that Tommy De Pretre is among those listed**\nWe see that there is a row with \"Tommy De Pretre\" as the value for the fighter column, which means David Bielkheden has lost to this opponent. This indicates that at least one of the fighters who David Bielkheden has lost to is indeed Tommy De Pretre.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the outcome**\nSince we have identified a row where David Bielkheden has lost to Tommy De Pretre, it can be concluded that \"Tommy De Pretre\" is indeed among those 12 fighters whom David Bielkheden has lost to in his career.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the relevant column for \\\"Lost to\\\"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Determine the row index for the fighter of interest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: List the fighters that David Bielkheden has lost to\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Check if the fighter of interest is among those listed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 5: Verify that Tommy De Pretre is among those listed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 6: Determine the outcome\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
