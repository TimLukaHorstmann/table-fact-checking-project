To do this, let's sort the table by 'time / retired' column first, since it's likely that the fastest times would be recorded last, and thus those who didn't complete all the laps would have a time recorded that is earlier than those who did finish the race.\n3. After sorting the table, we'll need to find rows where 'time / retired' is greater than 0 hours, since a time of 0 means they completed all laps and did not retire from the race.\n4.

Identify the column headers and the rows corresponding to the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix.\n    The table shows that there were two races, one at each lap count (71 and 70 laps). The first race (the one at 71 laps) is likely to be the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix since it occurred before the other race. So, we will focus on this race.\n\n2.  Determine the relevant rows for the claim \"8 racer complete less than sixty lap in the 1993 portuguese grand prix\".\n    We need to find all instances where a driver completed 60 or fewer laps. This would include drivers who finished before the 71-lap race started, those who retired early due to various reasons like accidents or gear issues, and those who did not complete any laps (DNF). In this case, we're looking for drivers with \"less than sixty lap\" which likely means drivers that completed fewer than 60 laps.\n\n3.  Find rows where a driver has less than 60 laps.\n    From the table, the following cells indicate that 8 racers completed less than 60 laps:\n\n*   Derek Warwick (63 laps) - Not less than 60\n*   Riccardo Patrese (63 laps) - Not less than 60\n*   Pedro Lamy (61 laps) - Less than 60 but not the one in question as it says 'spun off' and was a race.\n*   Johnny Herbert (60 laps) - This is our first driver who completed fewer than 60 laps, so this row fits the condition of the claim.\n\n4.  Verify that these drivers indeed participated in the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix by looking at their corresponding \"race\" column or \"event\" column if available.\n    Based on the table provided, only Ayrton Senna has a reason stated for him not completing more than 60 laps - it says \"engine\". The other mentioned races had drivers with less than 60 laps but they're not in question as they either didn't complete the race or spun off.\n\n5.  Determine if the statement is true based on our findings.\n    We found two drivers who completed fewer than 60 laps: Pedro Lamy and Johnny Herbert, so we need to check that no other drivers did too. However, upon reviewing the rest of the table again, there isn't another driver whose race was marked as less than 60 laps.
