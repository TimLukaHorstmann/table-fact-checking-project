First, we need to identify the team \"epsilon euskadi\" and their corresponding positions from the table.\n   - Looking at the table, we see that epsilon euskadi have a position of 6th in 2009 and 3rd in 2009.\n\n2. Next, we compare these positions with all other teams' positions to find the lowest one.\n   - Looking at the table, we can see the following team's positions:\n     - Boutsen Energy Racing: 18th\n     - International Dracoracing: 7th\n     - Art Grand Prix: nc (no completion)\n     - ISR Racing: 13th\n     - Racing Engineering: 23rd and 11th\n     - M2 Competition: 7th\n\n3. Now, we can determine the lowest position among all these teams.\n   - The lowest position is 18th, which belongs to Boutsen Energy Racing.\n\n4. Therefore, the claim \"epsilon euskadi have the lowest position out of all the team\" is FALSE because epsilon euskadi actually had one of the higher positions (6th and 3rd), not the lowest.\n\n5.

First, let's identify the rows for the 2008 season: \n   The first row corresponds to \"formula renault 2.0 west european cup\" and the second row corresponds to \"eurocup formula renault 2.0\".\n\n2. Next, let's extract the values from these rows:\n   - For the first row, wins = 0, races = 15.\n   - For the second row, wins = 0, races = 14.\n\n3. Then, we need to calculate if Boutsen Energy Racing gained 9 points in under 15 races:\n   - Since the first row (15 races) doesn't have any wins, it's impossible for them to gain 9 points.\n   - The second row (14 races) has no wins as well.\n\n4. Now let's check for another possibility: \n   Maybe Boutsen Energy Racing gained some points in the first 15-14 races combined, then had a worse race?\n   However, there is only one other race that has a value greater than zero:\n   - \"formula renault 2.0 west european cup\" (9th place) with a value of 9 points.\n\n5. Finally, we need to determine if Boutsen Energy Racing gained 9 points in the first 15 races.
