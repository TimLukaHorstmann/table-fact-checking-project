    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Read the table structure: The table has columns for 'name', 'height', 'weight', 'spike', and '2008 club'. We need to find the relevant cells for 'sa\u0161a starovi\u0107' in both the '2008 club' column and the 'm rom volley' cell.\n\n2. Identify the row index of 'sa\u0161a starovi\u0107': By examining the table, we see that 'sa\u0161a starovi\u0107' is in the 10th row (since the first row starts with Nikola Kova\u010devi\u0107).\n\n3. Check if 'sa\u0161a starovi\u0107' is indeed in the '2008 club' column: We verify that the value in the cell at row index 9 and column name '2008 club' is 'budu\u0107nost podgorica'.\n\n4. Check if 'm rom volley' is not the value for '2008 club' of 'sa\u0161a starovi\u0107': Since 'budu\u0107nost podgorica' does not match with any other name, we conclude that there is no row where 'm rom volley' has a different value.\n\n5. Confirm the result: After evaluating all steps, it appears that the claim \"sa\u0161a starovi\u0107 be not in the m rom volley 2008 club\" is indeed TRUE because 'budu\u0107nost podgorica' does not match with any other name and also does not contain 'm rom volley'.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the Claim's Focus**: The claim mentions \"tour vb 2008 club\". We need to find which player(s) are part of this team.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**: Looking at the table, we can see that columns related to clubs and teams (like `spike`, `2008 club`) are in the last column (`td> cm (in)</td>`). However, for our purpose, we need the data from the `2008 club` column.\n\n3. **Find Player Information**: Starting with the first row, we see that each player has a club or team listed in their respective cell: nikola kova\u010devi\u0107 ('rpa perugia'), dejan bojovi\u0107 ('gabeca montichiari'), etc.\n\n4. **Look for Tours Vb Club Participants**: We need to find players who are part of the 'tours vb' 2008 club. Upon inspecting the table, we see that marko samard\u017ei\u0107 is listed as 'tours vb', and also Nikola Grbi\u0107 is listed as 'trentino volley', but looking closer at Nikola grbi\u0107's row in the table, it says 'trentino volley' instead of 'tours vb'. This indicates the claim might be partially true for only one player: marko samard\u017ei\u0107.\n\n5. **Consider Additional Clues**: We need to verify if there are any other players besides marko samard\u017ei\u0107 who are also part of the 'tours vb 2008 club'. Since our table data only lists two relevant entries and we've determined marko samard\u017ei\u0107 is indeed listed as a participant, it seems unlikely that another player is mentioned in the table. However, for the sake of completeness, one could double-check other columns like height or weight to see if any pattern emerges.\n\n6. **Review the Claim**: Since only one player, Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107, was found to be part of 'tours vb 2008 club' based on our inspection of the table, we should now determine if there are indeed twelve players in total to verify that only one is a member of this particular team.\n\n7. **Count Total Players**: The claim states \"only 1 of the 12 player\". Counting rows from the first row (with name) to the last shows us that there are indeed twelve players listed. This aligns with our initial understanding and supports the notion that if only one is a member of 'tours vb', it's true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim was verified to be true by locating the data for the specific team, Tours Vb, in the table. Only Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107 fits this description. Counting the total number of players validated that there are indeed twelve entries.
