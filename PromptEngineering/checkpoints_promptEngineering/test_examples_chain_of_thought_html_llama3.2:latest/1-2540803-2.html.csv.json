    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that suet is the only material to have a smoke point.\n2. To verify this, we need to examine each row of the table to see if any other material has a smoke point listed.\n3. In the first row (sunflower oil), the value in the \"smoke point\" column is listed as \"(degree)\" without a numerical value provided. This suggests that sunflower oil does not have a specified smoke point, or at least not one that can be compared to suet's.\n\n4. We also need to look for rows with non-numerical values in the smoke point column or no mention of it at all.\n5. Looking through each row from top to bottom:\n   - Sunflower oil has \"(degree)\" as its value, indicating uncertainty about a numeric value; however, this is not useful for comparison against suet.\n   - Soybean oil also has \"(degree)\" which leaves us without a numerical value.\n   - Canola oil similarly shows a lack of numeric clarity in the column with \"(degree)\"\n   - Olive oil's entry does have a \"degree\" but again lacks specific numbers, leaving the claim uncertain\n   - Corn oil and peanut oil both display uncertainty or no specified smoke points like sunflower oil.\n\n6. Moving down further to rice bran oil and vegetable shortening:\n   - Rice bran oil displays \"(degree)\" like many others without an actual value.\n   - Vegetable shortening is a special case here because it explicitly lists \"degree\" but still lacks the value, mirroring its fellow non-specific entries.\n\n7. After examining all rows except for suet, we see that while some oils (like sunflower oil) might have smoke points with certain degrees, none have them listed exactly as specified without any degree sign.\n8. Moving to the last row where lard is mentioned:\n   - Lard's \"smoke point\" entry provides a numerical value of \"degree\", which is an integer.\n\n9. We now know that all materials (except suet) either lack specific smoke point values or present their information with degrees, leaving them ambiguous without knowing if they were indeed supposed to be entered as specific integers.\n10. However, lard does provide its own smoke point value.\n11. After careful review of every single row, we've determined that the only material listed with a clear integer for \"smoke point\" in this table is indeed suet.\n12. Therefore, it can be inferred that this statement is false since not all materials provided have their smoke points clearly stated as integers.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
