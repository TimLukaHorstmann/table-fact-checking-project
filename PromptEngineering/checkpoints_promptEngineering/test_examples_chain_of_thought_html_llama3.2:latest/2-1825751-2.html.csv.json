    "resp": "### Claim Analysis: Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\n\n#### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim mentions \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" which implies that only tourism-related winners are not part of BBP (Binibining Pilipinas Pageant) from 1973 to 1986.\n   \n2. **Check Eligibility Criteria**: Each year's Binibining Pilipinas winner is eligible for further pageant participation, including the national pageant leading up to Binibining Pilipinas International and Binibining Pilipinas World.\n\n3. **Review Historical Data**: Review historical data from 1973 to 1986 to identify any tourism-related winners who were not part of BBP during that period.\n\n4. **Identify Tourism Winners Excluded From BBP Participation**: Identify the specific winners from this period who, for some reason, were excluded or did not participate in Binibining Pilipinas pageant events (e.g., due to being tourism representatives but not officially participating).\n\n5. **Verify Exclusion Reasoning**:\n    - If such winners exist, verify their exclusion reason and confirm that they indeed represent tourism.\n    - Review how these exclusions were documented and confirmed.\n\n6. **Conclude on Claim Validity**:\n    - Based on the evidence found, conclude if there are indeed tourism-related Binibining Pilipinas winners from 1973 to 1986 who did not participate in the national pageant events (BBP).\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nGiven the information provided, it's a complex task without direct data access. However, we can attempt to reason based on available data.\n\n1. Review available cells: \n    - Without specific details or cells directly referencing \"Binibining Pilipinas Tourism Winners Not Participating in BBP,\" one cannot directly verify the claim through given data.\n\n2. Analyze Claim Logic:\n    - The logic behind claiming certain winners are not part of Binibining Pilipinas events seems flawed since all participants have a chance to compete, including eventual tourism representatives.\n    - The term \"still not part\" is ambiguous without further context on why they wouldn't be part, as every winner typically competes.\n\n3. Determine Relevant Information:\n    - Without explicit data or statements from Binibining Pilipinas regarding their participation policies and any tourism-specific winners excluded due to reasons other than being tourism representatives, one cannot conclusively state the truth of the claim based solely on the provided table.\n\n4. Conclusion Based on Available Data:\n    - Given the absence of direct evidence within the provided data set that specifically mentions \"Binibining Pilipinas Tourism Winners Not Participating in BBP,\" and considering standard pageant procedures typically allow all participants to compete, we cannot definitively assert the truth of this claim based solely on the given information.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n    - Due to the lack of specific evidence within the provided table, we cannot determine if there are winners specifically mentioned as tourism representatives who were excluded from participating in Binibining Pilipinas events during 1973-1986. Hence, without direct data supporting this claim:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Lack of evidence within the provided table regarding specific winners or exclusions related to 'Binibining Pilipinas Tourism Winners Not Participating in BBP' from 1973-1986 prevents definitive assertion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

Since her name appears in two rows on the same column (40), this indicates that she may have been the winner.\n\nStep 4: Now we need to confirm whether Maria Lourdes Jimenez won in 1987, but since there is no other information about her winning or not, and another contestant was named as a finalist/runner-up, it is likely that Maria Muriel Moral was the actual winner of Miss Maja Pilipinas 1988.",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The problem statement asks us to claim that \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start not until the year 1987\".\n2. To verify this, we need to find if there is a cell in the table where the row index is greater than 0 (i.e., the year 1987 or later) and the column name is 'tourism'.\n3. Let's examine each relevant cell in the table:\n\t* The first few rows do not have any cells with the column name 'tourism' or a row index greater than 1.\n\t* In row 5 (the 1990s), there are cells with the column name 'tourism', but the year is before 1987. So, we can exclude these rows.\n4. Moving on to row 9 (the 1991s), we see that there are cells with the column name 'tourism'. However, the cell in column index 3 has a value of \"not awarded\", which suggests that tourism might not have been introduced or considered as an option yet.\n5. But wait! In row 7 (also the 1980s but further down), we see that the year is indeed 1987 or later and there's a cell with the column name 'tourism'. However, I rechecked this row and noticed that one of the values in \"column_name\" is actually \"tourism do not start\". This seems to be related to the claim. \n6. Upon closer inspection of cells where year > 0 and 'tourism' , we can confirm our answer.\n7. Therefore, after analyzing the relevant cells in the table, we find that tourism was indeed considered as an option for Binibining Pilipinas starting from the year 1987.\n\nHere's the output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Problem statement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Find relevant cells in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Examine each cell in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Move on to row 9 (1991s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Verify if 'tourism' is present for Binibining Pilipinas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Further verify relevant rows of Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Confirm our answer with table\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"tourism do not start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"tourism\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote: This answer and steps assume that the table provided is accurate.",
