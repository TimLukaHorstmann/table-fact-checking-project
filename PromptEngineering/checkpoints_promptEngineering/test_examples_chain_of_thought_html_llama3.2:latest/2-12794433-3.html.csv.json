Next, we need to find the company with more than 40000 employees and check if it is true that there are over 40000 more employees than Sandvik.\n5. To do this, we will compare each company's number of employees (column 5) in the table with 50030:\n   - Compares with \"iss\" with 534500: This has more employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"securitas\" with 272425: This has fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"nokia\" with 130050: This has fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"ap m\u00e3ller - maersk\" with 117080: This has fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"ericsson\" with 104525: This has fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"volvo\" with 98162: This has significantly fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"h&amp;m\" with 64874: This has fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"electrolux\" with 52916: This has significantly fewer employees than Sandvik\n   - Compares with \"skanska\" with 52557: This has significantly fewer employees than Sandvik\n6. Based on these comparisons, the only company that has more employees than Sandvik and is relevant to the claim is \"iss\".\n7. However, since we want to determine if there are over 40000 more employees at \"iss\" than Sandvik, we need to calculate this difference:\n   - Difference = Number of employees at \"iss\" - Number of employees at Sandvik\n     = 534500 - 50030\n     = 484170\n8.
