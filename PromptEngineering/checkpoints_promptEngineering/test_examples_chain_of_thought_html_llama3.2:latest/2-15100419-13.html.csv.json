We need to find their overall value from the table.\n\n   * Relevant cells for Andrew Carnahan: \n     ```json\n      [\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n      ]\n    ```\n2. Since we have multiple rows with \"Andrew Carnahan\" in the name column, we need to check if there are any other players with higher overall values.\n\n   * Relevant cells for comparison:\n     ```json\n      [\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n      ]\n    ```\n3.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the table to determine if Justin Durant was indeed drafted for the linebacker position.\n2. We start by looking at the \"round\" column to see which round each player was drafted in. The claim states that Justin Durant was draft for only 1 line backer position.\n\n3. Looking at row 2, we can see that Justin Durant's pick is listed as 16 and his position is listed as Linebacker.\n4. Since the claim states that Justin Durant be the only 1 draft for the linebacker position, this means there should not be any other player in a different round with position listed as line backer.\n\n5. Looking at row 7, we can see that Chad Nkang's pick is listed as 41 and his position is listed as defensive back.\n6. Since Chad Nkang's pick is in round 7 and it is not for the linebacker position, he does not affect our analysis.\n7. Now, let us check all other rounds to ensure no other player was draft for only line backer.\n\n8. Looking at row 1, we can see that there is a column named \"pick\" but its value is not present in the table data which means this cell has been hidden and will be ignored.\n9. Now, looking at rows 3-6, all players were draft for round 5 with position listed as Guard or Wide receiver.\n\n10. From step 8 we know there was no player drafted for line backer position in round 1 (because the value of the \"pick\" cell is hidden) and from step 9 we have confirmed that Justin Durant was the only one to be draft in round 2 with position listed as linebacker.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by looking at the table for line backer positions. Check if there is another player in a different round with position listed as line backer. Since we already know Justin Durant was drafted for only one round and that is row 2, now checking other rounds to ensure no other players were draft for only line backer in round 3-6 are not possible because their pick values are hidden so they can be ignored. So after the above analysis it can be concluded that Justin Durant being draft for only one round makes this chain of thoughts true as there is no other player draft for lineback position in round 2 with same pick value. Therefore, after analyzing all steps the final answer is :\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Extracting relevant information from the table\nTo determine if the claim about Reggie Nelson and Mike Sims - Walker being drafted and both from Florida college, we need to find their respective positions in the draft. The table does not contain the actual draft order, but rather some overall numbers.\n\nHowever, we can infer that for each player, there is a corresponding \"round\" (1-7), \"pick\" (12-42), and a unique identifier (\"name\" or \"position\") associated with them. We also need to check if their colleges are indeed from Florida in order to fulfill the condition mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Step 2: Checking Reggie Nelson's position\nReggie Nelson is listed as safety at row 1, column \"position\". Since he was drafted at pick 21 (row 1, column \"pick\"), we need to confirm that his college is indeed Florida.\n\nIn this case, Nelson's college is shown as \"Florida\" in the table, so his condition seems met based on position alone but not college location.\n\n### Step 3: Checking Mike Sims - Walker's position\nMike Sims - Walker is listed at wide receiver at row 3, column \"position\". His pick number is 15 (row 3, column \"pick\"), and his college is shown as Central Florida in the table. \n\nSince Sims-Walker's college is Central Florida, which is not located in Florida but rather Orlando, it does not fulfill one part of the claim.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion based on conditions\nReggie Nelson fulfills his condition with respect to being drafted as a safety (though from Florida doesn't match for this example) and Mike Sims-Walker's college isn't even in Florida. \n\nTherefore, at least one player doesn't fulfill all parts of the statement so the claim is False.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Extracted Reggie Nelson and Mike Sims - Walker's data from table.\\nStep 2: Reginald Nelson's position in the draft wasn't the issue but rather if he was from Florida\\nStep 3: The problem with Sims-Walker was his college not being from Florida\\nStep 4: At least one player (Sims-Walker) did not meet all criteria of claim so answer is False\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}",

Extract all college names from the table.\n   The college names mentioned in the table are: Florida, Hampton, Central Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Purdue, Wake Forest, Notre Dame, San Jose State, Elon, and Arizona State.\n\n2. Identify the colleges associated with each of Mike Sims-Walker, Reggie Nelson, Chad Nkang, and Andrew Carnahan.\n   - Mike Sims-Walker is from Central Florida.\n   - Reggie Nelson is from Florida.\n   - Chad Nkang is from Elon.\n   - Andrew Carnahan is from Arizona State.\n\n3. Check if both Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson were drafted from the same college (Florida).\n   Since they are from different colleges, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. Check if Chad Nkang and Andrew Carnahan were drafted from the same college (Elon or Arizona State).\n   They were drafted from different colleges, so this part of the claim is also FALSE.\n\n5. Based on steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that at least one of the conditions in the original statement must be false for the entire statement to be considered true. Therefore, since Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson weren't both drafted from Florida, the whole claim isn't necessarily wrong but rather incomplete as it doesn't consider other potential colleges for each player. However, for it to hold TRUE as per the question's demand, there needs to be no college that both Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson were picked from, or else the statement would not be true.\n\n\n6. The claim states \"and\" for both Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson being drafted from the same college, implying if either one is false because they come from different colleges then it's a false condition.\n\n7. The whole claim can only hold as TRUE if none of these conditions are met (none of them having two players picked from the same college). Otherwise, since at least one part of the statement is false, it must be classified as FALSE. In this case, because they come from different colleges we classify as partially true but since there has to be a full condition met for the entire claim to hold TRUE and not just \"partially true\" let us continue with classification.\n\n\n8. Given that Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson weren't both drafted from the same college (Florida) but only one part of the claim about them is false, we now look at Chad Nkang and Andrew Carnahan. They weren't picked from the same college either (Elon vs Arizona State), which makes this other condition in the statement also false.\n\n\n9. Considering all conditions are false because they each describe two players being drafted from different colleges, it's possible to classify the whole statement as FALSE since at least one of its parts must be true for the entire claim to be TRUE.\n\n10.
