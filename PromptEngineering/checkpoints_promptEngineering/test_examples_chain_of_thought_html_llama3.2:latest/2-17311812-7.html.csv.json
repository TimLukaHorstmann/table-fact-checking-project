The relevant cell values are:\n\t* Row Index: 20\n\t* Column Name: \"column_3\" which corresponds to the value in the fourth column (the fifth game).\n5. **Count the total games played**: From the table, we can see that this team played a total of 9 games during the season.\n6. **Evaluate the claim**: Since the New York team played only 9 games, it is unlikely they will play more than one game.

First, let's analyze the claim by breaking it down into two parts: \"the golden state team appear\" and \"less often than the new york team\".\n2. For the first part, \"the golden state team appear\", we need to look at the number of times Golden State wins or loses in the table.\n3. From the given data, Golden State appears 8 times with a win (row indices 40 and 41) and 6 times with a loss (rows 19-22, 24, 44).\n4. Now let's look at \"new york team\". To analyze this claim we need to calculate how many times New York wins or loses.\n5. In the table, New York appears 3 times with a win (row indices 40 and 41 and rows 39-40) and 7 times with a loss (rows 39-42).\n6. Now that we know both teams' appearance counts, we can compare them to determine if Golden State wins less often than New York.\n7.
