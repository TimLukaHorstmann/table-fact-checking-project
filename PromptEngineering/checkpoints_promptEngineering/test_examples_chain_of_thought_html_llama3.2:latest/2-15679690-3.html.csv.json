The table does not have information about the teams finishing as the division leaders (1st place). However, it shows the positions of other teams within each division.\n\n### Step 3: Locate Division Finishes for Houston Rockets\nWe are specifically interested in seasons where the Houston Rockets finished 7th among a group of teams. The table does not provide detailed information about each team's standing in every season; thus, we must infer based on available data.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Data\nFrom the given table, there is no direct instance where \"Houston Rockets\" finishes 7th. However, since the question mentions seasons after which the only division finish of 7th was for the Houston Rockets in season 1969-70 and does not contain a complete record of division standings post-1970s, we might infer that the only recorded or acknowledged instance is indeed in that year.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven the lack of other information on the Rockets' division finishes and acknowledging the specificity of the question (the \"only div finish of 7th\"), it appears that Houston Rockets did not have another season with a 7th place finish as they are noted for only this achievement in 1969-70.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not show the Houston Rockets finishing 7th any other time than season 1969-70. Therefore, we can infer that this is the correct statement.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": ?, \"column_name\": \"Houston Rockets\"} // The exact row index might be needed for confirmation, but based on the format and question, it's assumed this season is the only one meeting the criteria.\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the lack of direct information in the provided table for the Houston Rockets' division standings (especially after the 1969-70 season), we must rely on external knowledge that does not directly state there were no other divisions or seasons where they finished 7th. Given this context and without further details or confirmations from additional data, providing a precise row index for \"relevant_cells\" in the JSON output becomes speculative.\n\nGiven these limitations and to follow instructions precisely:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not show the Houston Rockets finishing 7th any other time than season 1969-70.

We need to check if the Western Conference (Conf) for these seasons is indeed Western, their finish in the conference is 7th, and they belong to the Pacific Division (Div).\n\nStep 2: Check the season data for \"season 1970 - 71\".\nFrom the table, we can see that under this season:\n- The Conf is Western.\n- We need to verify if the Conf finish is 7th and Div is Pacific.\n\nStep 3: Check the season data for \"season 1971 - 72\".\nSimilarly, under this season:\n- The Conf is also Western.\n- Again, we must confirm that the Conf finish is 7th and Div is Pacific.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nAfter verifying the details in both seasons, it appears there might be a discrepancy with the claim regarding the finishing position or division for these two specific seasons.
