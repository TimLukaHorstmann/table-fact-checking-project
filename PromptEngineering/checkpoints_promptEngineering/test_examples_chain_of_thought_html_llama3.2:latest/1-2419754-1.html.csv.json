Determine how many of these institutions joined the conference in 1991.\n\n3. Compare the number of institutions that joined in 1991 with the total count of institutions.\n\n4. Based on this comparison, we can determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nLet's proceed to step by step explanation and find a final answer:\n\n#### Step 1: Counting the Total Number of Institutions Participating in GMU\n\nThere are two colleges that participate in the Great Midwest Conference (Butler University and Xavier University). But there are more than two colleges present in our table. These colleges are University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, DePaul University, Marquette University, University of Memphis, Saint Louis University.\n\n#### Step 2: Counting the Number of Colleges that Joined GMU in 1991\n\nFrom our table, we can see that 3 out of these colleges joined the conference in 1991. They are:\n- University of Cincinnati (joined in 1991)\n- DePaul University (joined in 1991)\n- Marquette University (joined in 1991)\n\n#### Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Colleges\n\nThere are 6 colleges present in our table.\n\n#### Step 4: Comparing and Determining the Final Answer\n\nBased on step 2, we know that only 3 institutions joined the conference in 1991 out of a total of 6.

First, we need to find all the public institutions from the table.\n   - The column for type will be used to identify public institutions since \"public\" is listed as one of the possible values.\n\n2. Next, we need to filter the table to only include rows where the value in the 'type' column is \"public\".\n\n3. Then, we will look at the conference for each of these public institutions.\n   - The column for this information is called 'joined', however the column name may not directly match the current year and might be a bit ambiguous so we need to find it based on actual institution name and date. The relevant column for conference membership would likely be in the same row where type was \"public\" but under a different header such as \"league\" or \"conference\". In this case, we can look at 'location' and see that each of these are part of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\n4. Now that we have identified all public institutions from the table and confirmed they are members of the Great Mid West conference (assuming the name is spelled correctly), we will count how many there are.\n\n5.
