Next, let's verify if each person who played the role of 'prison escapist' leaves the cube alive after their escape.\n   - According to the table data, rennes escapes from the centre p\u00e3nitentiaire de rennes (france) and leaves the cube alive as it is stated in the cell <td>dead</td> that rennes is dead which means he is not alive.\n\n3. Therefore, since there is at least one person who plays the role of prison escapist but does not leave the cube alive after their escape, we can conclude that the statement \"multiple people be prison escapist and each leave the cube alive\" is FALSE\n\n4. Lastly, list the relevant cells:\n   - {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"status\"\n    }\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the rows that correspond to prison escapist; verify if each person who played this role leaves the cube alive after their escape; conclude based on these verifications.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"status\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
