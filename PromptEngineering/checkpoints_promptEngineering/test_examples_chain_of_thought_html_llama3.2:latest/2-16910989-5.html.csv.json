We need to verify both conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Check Nominations for 3 Act Award in 2012\nWe will look at the \"nominated for\" column for any entry where the year is 2012 and the award might be related to \"3 Act Award\".\n\n### Step 3: Verify Winning of German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012\nNext, we'll confirm if there's an entry indicating a win of the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Table Data\nWe will go through each row of the table to match the claim elements with the data provided:\n\n- For the first condition (nominated for \"3 Act Award\" in 2012), there's no matching entry.\n- For the second condition (winning German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012), we find a match.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven that one part of the claim (winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award) is indeed true, but the other part (being nominated for \"3 Act Award\" in 2012) is not supported by any evidence from the table data, the overall claim must be considered false because it incorrectly includes both conditions.\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Claim mentions being nominated for a specific award and winning another.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Awards for Kristofer Martin**: First, we need to identify which awards are related to Kristofer Martin.\n\n2. **Check Nomination Category**: We will check the category of each award that has a nomination for Kristofer Martin, specifically \"Oros\".\n\n3. **Verify Performance in Oros**: Next, we will verify if all nominations for Kristofer Martin were for his performance in \"Oros\".\n\n4. **Compare Categories with Performance in Oros**: We will compare the categories of awards where Kristofer Martin was nominated to see if they match the category for his performance in \"Oros\".\n\n5. **Check Nomination Count**: If we have at least one nomination that matches both the category and the subject, then all nominations are likely related.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (Continued)\n\n1.  **List Relevant Awards**:\n    *   The first two awards for 2013 are related to \"Oros\": 16th Long Island International Film Expo (\"Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor\") and 10th Golden Screen Awards (\"Best Actor in a Supporting Role\").\n2.  **Check Nomination Category**: Both of these nominations are in the acting category.\n    *   They both have Kristofer Martin as the nominated actor.\n3.  **Verify Performance in Oros**:\n    *   The award that won at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo was indeed for his performance in \"Oros\".\n    *   Similarly, the award from the 10th Golden Screen Awards was also for his performance in \"Oros.\"\n4.  **Compare Categories with Performance in Oros**:\n    *   Both nominations have the same category (\"Best Actor in a Supporting Role\").\n5.  **Check Nomination Count**: Since we found two awards where Kristofer Martin's nomination matches both the category and subject, it is likely that all of his nominations are for his performance in \"Oros\".\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Relevant awards include 16th Long Island International Film Expo (Best Actor in a Supporting Role) and 10th Golden Screen Awards (Best Actor in a Supporting Role). Both awards were given for Kristofer Martin's performance in Oros. Since both nominations match the category of Best Actor in a Supporting Role, it is likely that all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations are for his performance in Oros.\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n    ]\n}",
