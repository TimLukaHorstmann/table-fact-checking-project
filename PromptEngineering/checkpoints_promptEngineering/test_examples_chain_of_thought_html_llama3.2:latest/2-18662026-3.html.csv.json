We can do this by counting the number of rows for each country:\n   - Brazil: 1\n   - Romania: 1\n   - Spain: 1\n   - Germany: 1\n   - Japan: 1\n   - China: 1\n   - Russia: 1\n   - Israel: 1\n\n5. Since all countries have exactly one gymnast, we can safely say that the claim \"there be 3 gymnast from the same country\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the output in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Counted the number of gymnasts from each country and checked if any country has more than one gymnast. All countries have exactly one gymnast, so the claim must be false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
