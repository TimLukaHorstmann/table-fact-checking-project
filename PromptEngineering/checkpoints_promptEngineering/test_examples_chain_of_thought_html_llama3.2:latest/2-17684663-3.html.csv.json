    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the task**: We need to verify if Yamaha is indeed the second most manufactured brand used by riders.\n2. **Sort the brands by occurrence**: First, we sort the brands (Yamaha, Honda, Yamaha) in descending order based on how many times they appear in the table.\n3. **Count Honda occurrences**: Count the number of times Honda appears as a manufacturer for rider cars. Honda is 7th with 9 occurrences.\n\n4. **Verify if Yamaha is indeed second most manufactured**: We will check the sorted list and see that the first place (most used) brand is actually Yamaha with 10 occurrences, followed by Honda with 9 occurrences.\n\n5. **List relevant cells for verification**:\n    ```\n[\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 25,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 20,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Sort the brands by occurrence.\",\n    \"Count Honda occurrences. Honda is not second most manufactured brand used by riders.\",\n    \"Verify if Yamaha is indeed second most manufactured: Yamaha has 10 occurrences, Honda has 9 occurrences.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
