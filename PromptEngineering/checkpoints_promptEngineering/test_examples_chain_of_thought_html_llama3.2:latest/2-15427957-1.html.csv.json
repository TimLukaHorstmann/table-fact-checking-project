We need to determine when the team first enters Tier 1.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that the tiers are assigned as follows:\n\t* Tier 2: \n\t\t+ `2` (1997-98, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08)\n\t\t+ `3` (2004-05)\n\t* Tier 1: \n\t\t+ `1` (1999-00, 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13)\n4.
