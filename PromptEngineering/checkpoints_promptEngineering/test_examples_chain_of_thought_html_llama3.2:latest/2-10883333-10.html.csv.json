To do this, we need to find the row that corresponds to North Melbourne in the table and extract its away team score.\n3. The row corresponding to North Melbourne is the third row (index 2) of the table, starting from zero indexing.\n4. In this row, the \"away team\" column contains the value \"north melbourne\".\n5. Next, we need to find the row that corresponds to the highest away team score in the entire table.\n6. To do this, we can iterate over each row in the table and extract the away team score for each row.\n7. We then compare these scores to determine which one is the highest.\n8. The row with the highest away team score will correspond to the team with the highest score.\n\nHere is the reasoning process written in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"We need to determine whether the claim 'north melbourne have the highest score out all the way team' is TRUE or FALSE.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"To do this, we need to find the row that corresponds to North Melbourne in the table and extract its away team score.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"The row corresponding to North Melbourne is the third row (index 2) of the table, starting from zero indexing.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"In this row, the 'away team' column contains the value 'north melbourne'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Next, we need to find the row that corresponds to the highest away team score in the entire table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"To do this, we can iterate over each row in the table and extract the away team score for each row.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"text\": \"We then compare these scores to determine which one is the highest.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"text\": \"The row with the highest away team score will correspond to the team with the highest score.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nTo determine the answer, we need to find the highest away team score in the table.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Find the score for North Melbourne from the table.\n   - Looking at the table, we find that North Melbourne scored 17.19 (121) points against Richmond.\n\n2. Count how many teams have a higher score than North Melbourne's score.\n   - There is only one team, Carlton, with a higher score of 16.10 (106).\n\n3. Determine if any other teams have a higher score than both North Melbourne and Carlton.\n   - Hawthorn scored 19.24 (138) points which is higher than both North Melbourne (17.19) and Carlton (16.10).\n\n4. Since there are more than one team with scores that are not the highest, we need to verify if these teams' scores were actually higher than North Melbourne's.\n   - From our previous step, Hawthorn scored 19.24 which is indeed higher.\n\n5. However, since there are multiple teams with scores that are not the second-highest, we need to identify all teams with scores higher than North Melbourne's and check if any team actually has the highest score (which would make it the \"second\" highest).\n   - Upon reviewing the table again, we see that Hawthorn scored 19.24 which is indeed higher than both Richmond and Carlton.\n\n6. Now we need to verify if Hawthorn has the second-highest score by checking all teams' scores.\n   - Since no other team's score was higher than Hawthorn's (which had a score of 19.24), it seems that Hawthorn indeed would have the second highest score among away teams, and Carlton also scored more points against Fitzroy.\n\n\n\n7. Find if any team actually scores higher than Hawthorn or Carlton.\n   - Upon reviewing all data, there is no other team that can claim to have the same high score as both of these teams (19.24).\n\n8. Since this is not an exclusive score, we cannot say for certain what would be considered the second highest without looking at every score.\n\n\n\n9. Consider if Hawthorn has a higher home team's total than North Melbourne.\n   - Hawthorn has 19.24 against Collingwood, which is higher than North Melbourne.\n\n10. Verify if there are any teams with scores that were not in North Melbourne or Carlton who could potentially claim the second highest score based on their away scores being above North Melbourne's.\n    - However, since we know North Melbourne had a score of 17.19 (121), there isn't any team whose home score can surpass this.\n\n\n\n11. Given all evidence and data, we have concluded that Hawthorn indeed has the second-highest total among the teams' away scores.\n\n\n\n12. Now let's check if Richmond also had a higher home score than North Melbourne.\n    - Since Richmond scored 19.14 (128) which is lower than Hawthorn's, there was no team with an even higher home score that can claim to have the second highest overall.\n\n\n\n13.
