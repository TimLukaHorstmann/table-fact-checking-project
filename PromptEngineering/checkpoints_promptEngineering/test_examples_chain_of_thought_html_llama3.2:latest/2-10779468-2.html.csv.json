    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim mentions showing game vs different team and score on different location.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Information**: We need to look for rows where a different team from 'Texas Longhorns' is mentioned, along with their scores at different locations (venues).\n\n3. **Find Texas Longhorns Rows**: Looking through the table, we find rows for Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State.\n\n4. **Analyze Scores and Venues**: We need to identify which of these scores were at different locations (e.g., home or away) than 'Texas'.\n\n5. **Baylor's Row Analysis**: For Baylor, all the given scores ('ut , 57 - 23', 'ut , 27 - 5', 'ut , 22 - 13', 'ut , 7 - 2') are from 'UT'. This doesn't show a different venue.\n\n6. **Colorado's Row Analysis**: Colorado shows scores at two locations ('ut , 14 - 4' and 'ut , 6 - 1'), but neither is outside of 'Austin'.\n\n7. **Iowa State's Row Analysis**: Similar to Baylor, Iowa State's scores are all from the same location ('ut', meaning Austin).\n\n8. **Kansas' Row Analysis**: Kansas has one score that shows it was played at a different venue than usual ('tied , 4 - 4'), but this doesn't show an away game in Texas.\n\n9. **Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State Rows**: Each of these teams also has scores from the same location (Austin) or no clear indication of playing outside Austin.\n\n10. **Conclusion on Claim**: The table does not provide enough information to support the claim that it shows game vs different team with score on different location in a manner consistent with 'the Texas Longhorns woman's basketball team'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant rows did not show enough information about playing outside of Austin or having scores from different venues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
