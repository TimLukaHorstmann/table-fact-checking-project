    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Find the album name**: We need to find out what the name of the album \"con todo\" is, as it is mentioned in the claim.\n   - Looking at the table, we see that the first column represents row indexes and the second column represents song titles. The title \"unidos permanecemos\" appears twice: once for song 4 and again for song 11. This means that the album name \"con todo\" must be associated with both of these songs.\n\n2. **Identify the composer's information**: We need to verify if Joel Houston is indeed a composer on four of the tracks.\n   - Looking at row indexes 1, 2, and 13 in column 'composer', we see that Joel Houston is credited as a composer for songs 1 ('para exaltarte'), 2 ('correr\u00e9') and 13 ('eres mi fortaleza'). This matches three out of four tracks on the album \"con todo\".\n\n3. **Find additional information about row index 4 in column 'composer'**: In order to verify if Joel Houston is also a composer for song 4, we must see who composed that song.\n   - Looking at row indexes 4 and 11 in column 'composer', we find out that the two songs have different composers. Song number 4 has an entry of 'joel houston' but in row 11, 'brooke fraser'. In row 13 it reads 'reuben morgan'.\n\n4. **Determine if Joel Houston is a composer for four tracks**: Based on our analysis so far we see that he is a composer for songs 1 ('para exaltarte'), 2 ('correr\u00e9') and 13 ('eres mi fortaleza'). However, the song with row index 4 has 'joel houston' as its composer which actually does not happen on this album (his credit appears in row number one). Thus we have four songs.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Joel Houston is a composer for three tracks and there are two more tracks, but those do not match our initial claim, then he must be a co-writer of the track where he is credited.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Looking at row indexes 1,2 and 13 in column 'composer' we see that Joel Houston is credited as a composer for songs 1 (para exaltarte), 2 (correr\u00e9) and 13 (eres mi fortaleza).

Check if there are more than one artists credited as a support vocal on any track: Check each row for duplicate artist names in the column \"supporting vocal\".\n\n4. If we find an instance where someone is both listed as a solo artist (non 'none' ) but also a supporting vocalist, remove that instance from the count.\n\n5. List all unique artists credited as a support vocalist and check if any of them are on more than one track\n\n6. Check how many times each artist appears in our list of support vocalists \n\n7. Count how many songs have at least one other artist credited as a support vocalist: Find all rows where 'supporting vocalist' is not 'none'.\n\n8. Compare the count from step 3 with the total number of artists found in step 6:\n\n    - If there are more than 1 artist, then our claim is FALSE\n    - If there's only one artist, then we must verify how many tracks they appear on to see if it matches or exceeds the count of songs listed in step 7\n\n9.

The relevant cells for this task are those in the \"duration\" column (column 7) where the value includes a colon and has more than 6 characters.\n\n### Step 3: Extract the durations of interest from the table\nLooking at the table, we can see that there are indeed several songs with durations longer than 7 minutes. Specifically:\n- Song #8 has a duration of \"5:34\", which is under 7 minutes.\n- We should look for values like \"4:53\" and others where the number before the colon is greater than 7, but there isn't.\n\nHowever, we notice that some songs have durations with colons indicating minutes beyond 60 (like \"6:08\"). So let's look closer:\n- Song #3 has a duration of \"6:08\", which indeed exceeds 7 minutes.\n- Song #6 has a duration of \"6:20\".\n- Song #9 has a duration of \"3:59\", which is under 7 minutes but the subsequent song does exceed it.\n- Song #10 has a duration of \"4:37\", also under 7 minutes.\n- Song #11 has a duration of \"7:07\", exceeding 7 minutes.\n\n### Step 4: Count how many songs meet the criteria\nFrom our observation, we found at least three songs that are over 7 minutes in length. Let's count them and compare against the total number of songs (13) to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nRelevant cells based on duration exceeding 7 minutes:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"column_name\": \"duration\" // Note the correct row index here\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 11,\n    \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false based on the count\nGiven that we have found at least 4 songs exceeding 7 minutes (actually more than claimed, but not by a significant margin given our initial analysis focus), and comparing this against the total number of songs (13), it appears there are indeed enough songs over 7 minutes in length to support the claim being true.\n\n### Final Evaluation\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant information was extracted from the table, specifically looking for durations longer than 7 minutes.

Each row contains information about the song, such as its title, english translation, original album, composer, worship leader, supporting vocal, and duration.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant columns**: To determine if only one of the songs comes from an original album called \"This Is Our God\", we need to focus on the following columns:\n\t* Original album (column 4)\n\t* Song title (column 2)\n\n3. **Examine each row's data**:\n\t* Row 1: The original album is \"This Is Our God\" and so is not the first song from this album.\n\t* Row 2: The original album is also \"This Is Our God\", which means it is the second song with this album's title.\n\t* Row 3: This row shows a different album, not fitting our requirement.\n\t* Row 4: Again, an album other than the one we are looking for.\n\t* Row 5: Same issue, different album.\n\t* Row 6: Another distinct album, so nope.\n\t* Row 7: Yet another distinct album, fits criteria\n\t* Row 8: Different album from before, but still \"This Is Our God\", which does not meet our condition. So is a mistake. \n\t* Row 9: This time the song comes from an original album called this is our god.\n\t* Row 10: A different one that also comes from the same album - so it is another song.\n\t* Row 11: Same issue as row 9, which is our required condition: only one song on the album called \"this is our god\".\n\t* Row 12: Comes from a distinct album again\n\t* Row 13: The last row, also a different album.\n\n4. **Count the number of songs that come from an original album called \"This Is Our God\"**: From our analysis in step 3, we have identified two songs (row 9 and row 11) that meet this condition.\n\n\n5. **Determine if only one song comes from the required album**: Since there are only two songs out of thirteen that meet the condition, it indicates \"only 1 of the songs on con todo come from an original album call this is our god\" is not true.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step-by-step reasoning above concluded that the claim was FALSE because there are more than one song with the required title.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Original album\"}\n  ]\n}",
