To find the first leg, we look for rows where the score does not show any away goals scored in the round 2 column. In such cases, it is assumed that the game was played at home.\n\n3. Upon inspecting the table, we can see that:\n   - For Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse (D1), there are no away scores for Girondins de Bordeaux.\n   - For Olympique Lyonnais vs FC Nantes (D2), there are no away scores for Olympique Lyonnais.\n   - For AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (D2), there are no away scores for AS Cannes.\n\n4. Since only Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse and Olympique Lyonnais vs FC Nantes had 0-0 in round 1, these two matches must have been the first leg of their respective rounds.\n\n5. Now we can look at the score in the \"score\" column to see if only 2 goals were scored by away teams.\n   - For Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse (D1), FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal against Girondin de Bordeaux's 2-3 home result, meaning that Girondins de Bordeaux actually scored more than one goal away from their home stadium in round 1. This means the initial conclusion was incorrect.\n   - For Olympique Lyonnais vs FC Nantes (D2), Olympique Lyonnais scored a total of 4 goals against FC Nantes's 0-4 home result, meaning that Olympique Lyonnais actually scored more than one goal away from their home stadium in round 1. This means the initial conclusion was incorrect.\n\n6. Next we look at AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (D2). Since it is a first leg match, we check its score against this criteria: only 4 goals were scored by an away team from the home result of this game. \n\n7. Given that there are indeed two teams with 0-0 in round 1 and both had their respective score for round 2 show that they did score at least one goal, we now see that only FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard vs AS Cannes (D2) meet the condition stated on the claim.\n\n\n8. We have found our answer: there is indeed a case where 2 goals were scored by an away team during the first leg of their respective round matches.\n\nHere's the JSON output based on this analysis:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1-7 above\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Find the row containing the match FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC:\n\t* Look at the table structure to identify the columns for team 1, team 2, 1st round, 2nd round.\n\t* Check if there are any cells with the text \"FC Nantes\" in column \"team 1\".\n\t* Find that the first row of the table contains the text \"fc nantes (d1)\" which matches our search term.\n\t* Note down the row index as 3 and the column names: team 1, score, team 2, 1st round, 2nd round.\n\n2. Extract relevant scores from the match FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC:\n\t* Look at the \"score\" column for the row with index 3.\n\t* Note down the values of the score in both legs: 4-4 and 4-4.\n\n3. Calculate the aggregate score for FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC:\n\t* Take the sum of the scores from step 2 to calculate the aggregate score: 4+4=8\n\n4. Check if there's a higher scoring leg (not used in this claim but might be useful in other claims):\n\t* Look at each match row and extract the scores.\n\t* Note that while there are several matches with higher individual leg scores, only FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC has an aggregate score of 8.\n\n5. Check if any other cells contain a total score of 8:\n\t* Iterate through all rows to check if there's another match with an aggregate score of 8.\n\t* No such matches are found.\n\n6. Based on steps 3 and 5, conclude the claim is TRUE because FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC has both the highest scoring leg (4-4) and the highest aggregate score (8).\n\nNow here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Find row with match FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC\": {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"score\"},\n    \"Extract relevant scores from this row\": {0:4,1:4},\n    \"Calculate aggregate score for this match\": 8,\n    \"Check if any other cells contain a total score of 8\": No such matches are found.\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}",
