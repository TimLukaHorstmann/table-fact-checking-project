    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that television programming in Italy should only be in the country italy, and in no other language than italian.\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that many rows have a column named \"language\" or \"lingua\", but this information is not consistently used throughout the table.\n3. However, some rows do mention the language being Italian (e.g. row 1: \"italian\").\n4. Furthermore, we can observe that there are television programs available in Italy that are indeed only in Italian, such as Calcio Storico and Rai Fiction (rows 2-5).\n5. Additionally, some rows state that the program is broadcasted on television in other countries besides Italy, but still with Italian commentary or subtitles (e.g. row 6: \"commentary italian\").\n6. This suggests that even when programs are broadcasted outside of Italy, they may still be primarily in Italian.\n\nChain of thought:\n\n- Claim that TV shows should only be available in the country where they were produced.\n- Look for rows that explicitly state Italian as the language used (e.g. row 1).\n- Identify other instances where Italian is used even when broadcasting to countries outside Italy (e.g. row 6).\n- Reasoning: Just because some programs are broadcasted outside of Italy, it does not mean they need to be available in multiple languages.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim that TV shows should only be available in the country where they were produced is partially supported by rows indicating Italian as the primary language used.
