From the table, we can see that at least 3 regions (united kingdom, australasia, new zealand) offer it.\n2. Next, we need to check if all regions offer the digital download format on CD. Looking at the table again, we can see that not all of these regions have the word \"digital download\" in their row (e.g., poland has only \"cd\").\n3. However, since we are checking for both conditions (\"digital download\" AND \"cd\"), we need to consider if there is any region where \"digital download\" is present but \"cd\" is missing. Looking at the table, none of the regions with digital download on CD also have it listed as a separate format.\n4.
