Therefore, kimandu has a lower elevation than loolmalassin.\n\nHowever, looking at the column again, there are two peaks with elevation in between these two, thus making it not the second lowest col.\n\nLooking at rows after these two we have mount satima with elevation of 4001 which is higher than both and also higher than kilimanjaro's elevation.\n\nMoving to the row below Kilimanjaro we see that \"mount Kenya\" has an elevation of 5199 which is lower than the next one and hence, it is not the second lowest col.\n\nFinally looking at the row above kilimanjaro we can see \"mount satima\" is higher than mount kilimajaros elevation so in order to be the second lowest it would have to be lower than mount kenya's elevation which is 5199.\n\nSo kimandu has a lower elevation and is below loolmalassin. Thus kimandu is the second lowest col and its corresponding value is 2653.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the second highest col\nLooking at the sorted table, we can see that the elevation of \"loolmalassin\" is 3682 and the elevation of \"mount elgon\" is 4321. Therefore, loolmalasin has a lower elevation than mount elgon.\n\nThe value of loolmalassin in the column (col) is 1642 which is higher than all other values except for this one.\n\nHowever there are two rows below it with lower elevations and hence it is not the second highest col.\n\n\nMoving to the row above Kilimanjaro we see that \"mount satima\" has an elevation of 4001, which is higher than the next one. Thus, mount satima is the second highest col.\n\n\n\n### Step 5: Check if the claim is true\nThe claim states that the second lowest col (m) be 10 and the second highest be 1642. We have identified kimandu as the second lowest col with elevation of 2653 which does not match the claim.

If there are more than 3 such rows, then the claim is True. If not, it's False.\n\n3. Next, we will find the row with the highest prominence value and verify if this prominence is equal to 2458. If yes, the claim is True; otherwise, it's False.\n\n4. To identify relevant cells for further analysis, we need to note down their row index (starting from 0) and column name ('prominence (m)').\n\n5. We will verify if Uganda has more than 3 peaks based on our counting in step 2.\n\n6. Finally, we compare the highest prominence found with 2458.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef evaluate_claim(data):\n    # Convert data to DataFrame for easier manipulation\n    df = pd.DataFrame(\n        [\n            [\"mount kilimanjaro\", \"tanzania\", 5895, 5885, 10],\n            [\"mount kenya\", \"kenya\", 5199, 3825, 1374],\n            [\"mount meru\", \"tanzania\", 4565, 3170, 1395],\n            [\"mount elgon\", \"uganda\", 4321, 2458, 1863],\n            [\"mulanje massif\", \"malawi\", 3002, 2319, 683],\n            [\"kimhandu\", \"tanzania\", 2653, 2121, 532],\n            [\"mount satima\", \"kenya\", 4001, 2081, 1920],\n            [\"mount hanang\", \"tanzania\", 3420, 2050, 1370],\n            [\"loolmalassin\", \"tanzania\", 3682, 2040, 1642],\n            [\"gelai peak\", \"tanzania\", 2948, 1930, 1018],\n            [\"mount moroto\", \"uganda\", 3083, 1818, 1265],\n            [\"kitumbeine hill\", \"tanzania\", 2858, 1770, 1088],\n            [\"chepunyal hills\", \"kenya\", 3334, 1759, 1575],\n            [\"mount namuli\", \"mozambique\", 2419, 1757, 662],\n            [\"shengena\", \"tanzania\", 2464, 1750, 714],\n            [\"sungwi\", \"tanzania\", 2300, 1730, 570],\n            [\"mount kadam\", \"uganda\", 3063, 1690, 1373],\n            [\"mtorwi\", \"tanzania\", 2980, 1688, 1292],\n            [\"mount kulal\", \"kenya\", 2285, 1542, 743],\n            [\"karenga\", \"tanzania\", 2279, 1529, 750],\n            [\"mount ng'iro\", \"kenya\", 2848, 1501, 1347],\n        ]\n    )\n\n    # Filter rows where 'country' equals 'Uganda'\n    uganda_peaks = df[df[\"country\"] == \"uganda\"]\n\n    # Count the number of peaks in Uganda\n    num_uganda_peaks = len(uganda_peaks)\n\n    # Find the row with the highest prominence value\n    max_prominence_row = uganda_peaks.loc[uganda_peaks[\"prominence (m)\"].idxmax()]\n\n    # Check if Uganda has more than 3 peaks and highest prominence equals 2458\n    answer = (\n        num_uganda_peaks > 3\n        and max_prominence_row[\"prominence (m)\"] == 2458\n    )\n\n    relevant_cells = [\n        {\"row_index\": i, \"column_name\": \"country\"} for i in range(len(uganda_peaks)) if u\"Uganda\" in uganda_peaks.iloc[i]\n    ] + [{\"row_index\": j, \"column_name\": \"prominence (m)\"} for j in range(max_prominence_row.index)]\n\n    return {\n        \"chain_of_thought\": (\n            f\"Number of peaks in Uganda: {num_uganda_peaks}\\n\"\n            f\"Highest prominence value: {max_prominence_row['prominence (m)']}\"\n        ),\n        \"answer\": \"TRUE\" if answer else \"FALSE\",\n        \"relevant_cells\": relevant_cells,\n    }\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [\n    [\"mount kilimanjaro\", \"tanzania\", 5895, 5885, 10],\n    [\"mount kenya\", \"kenya\", 5199, 3825, 1374],\n    [\"mount meru\", \"tanzania\", 4565, 3170, 1395],\n    [\"mount elgon\", \"uganda\", 4321, 2458, 1863],\n    [\"mulanje massif\", \"malawi\", 3002, 2319, 683],\n    [\"kimhandu\", \"tanzania\", 2653, 2121, 532],\n    [\"mount satima\", \"kenya\", 4001, 2081, 1920],\n    [\"mount hanang\", \"tanzania\", 3420, 2050, 1370],\n    [\"loolmalassin\", \"tanzania\", 3682, 2040, 1642],\n    [\"gelai peak\", \"tanzania\", 2948, 1930, 1018],\n    [\"mount moroto\", \"uganda\", 3083, 1818, 1265],\n    [\"kitumbeine hill\", \"tanzania\", 2858, 1770, 1088],\n    [\"chepunyal hills\", \"kenya\", 3334, 1759, 1575],\n    [\"mount namuli\", \"mozambique\", 2419, 1757, 662],\n    [\"shengena\", \"tanzania\", 2464, 1750, 714],\n    [\"sungwi\", \"tanzania\", 2300, 1730, 570],\n    [\"mount kadam\", \"uganda\", 3063, 1690, 1373],\n    [\"mtorwi\", \"tanzania\", 2980, 1688, 1292],\n    [\"mount kulal\", \"kenya\", 2285, 1542, 743],\n    [\"karenga\", \"tanzania\", 2279, 1529, 750],\n    [\"mount ng'iro\", \"kenya\", 2848, 1501, 1347],\n]\n\nresult = evaluate_claim(data)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance.",
