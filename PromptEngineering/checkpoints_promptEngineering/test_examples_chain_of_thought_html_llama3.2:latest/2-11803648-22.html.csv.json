To do this, we will inspect the \"overall\" column of the table for values greater than 100.\n3. We notice that there are at least two rows with values above 100 in the \"overall\" column: row 4 (with value 102) and row 6 (with values 161 and 168).\n4. However, we also need to verify if both Marcus Hogberg and Curtis Lazar have overall numbers below 100.\n5. According to the table, Marcus Hogberg's overall number is 78 which is indeed below 100.\n6. For Curtis Lazar, his overall number is 17 which is also below 100.\n7. Since both players meet this condition, we can proceed with verifying if there are any other players who have an overall number above 100 but do not meet the conditions.\n\nBased on these steps, it appears that the claim is FALSE because Marcus Hogberg and Curtis Lazar do indeed meet the condition of having an overall number below 100.",

Read the claim: \"marcus hogberg and tobias lindberg be both swedish , and be , respectively , a goalie and a right wing\".\n   - The claim makes two statements:\n     1. Both Marcus Hogberg and Tobias Lindberg are Swedish.\n     2. Marcus Hogberg is a goalie, and Tobias Lindberg is a right wing.\n\n2. Examine the table for relevant information:\n\n   - The table has a row for each player with the following columns: round, overall, player, position, nationality, club team.\n   - We can find relevant information in the \"nationality\" column to determine if both players are Swedish and their respective positions.\n\n3. Locate Marcus Hogberg's row:\n   - In the table, under the \"player\" column, it says \"marcus hogberg\".\n   - Under the \"nationality\" column, it says \"sweden\".\n   - The position listed is \"goalie\".\n\n4. Locate Tobias Lindberg's row:\n   - In the table, under the \"player\" column, it says \"tobias lindberg\".\n   - Under the \"nationality\" column, it says \"sweden\".\n   - The position listed is \"right wing\".\n\n5. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information found:\n   - Since both Marcus Hogberg and Tobias Lindberg are indeed Swedish (as indicated by their nationality), we now need to verify their respective positions.\n   - According to the table, Marcus Hogberg is a goalie and Tobias Lindberg is a right wing.\n\n6. Verify that the claim's second part (\"a goalie and a right wing\") aligns with the found information:\n   - The claim states \"and be , respectively , a goalie and a right wing\". This matches what we found in steps 3 and 4: Marcus Hogberg is indeed a goalie, and Tobias Lindberg is a right wing.\n\n7.

Identify all the Canadian players from the table.\n   - The table contains three Canadian players: curtis lazar, ben harpur, and quentin shore.\n\n2. Look at each of these players' positions and check if they play the same position.\n   - Curtis lazar is a centre / right wing.\n   - Ben harpur is a defense.\n   - Quentin shore is a centre.\n\n3. Since curtis lazar plays both centre and right wing, while ben harpur plays defense and quentin shore plays centre, the positions are not all the same for each player.\n\n4. As there are Canadian players with different positions, we need to check if any of these players have another position that is also played by other Canadian players.\n   - Upon closer inspection of the table, it appears that curtis lazar's position (centre / right wing) can be shared with ben harpur (defense) since defense is one of the descriptions for curtis lazar.\n\n5. Given this new information, we now need to recheck all Canadian players' positions.\n   - Curtis lazar plays centre and/or right wing. Ben harpur plays defense which could also potentially include a position that matches another Canadian player, which has been noted in step 4 but was not further explored here initially.\n\n6. Based on the observations made in steps 3-5, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n   - While curtis lazar and ben harpur are Canadian players with potential overlap in their playing positions (centre/right wing for lazar and defense for harpur), there aren't enough details provided about other unique Canadian players' positions to draw a definitive conclusion that all Canadian players play the same position. However, it can be argued that since curtis lazar and ben harpur share one commonality, there might not be enough evidence to support the claim entirely, but it is not entirely false.\n\n7.
