This will help us find the relevant data about Hayate Usui's fights.\n\n2. **Check if the round number is 3 for the loss**:\n   - Once we have found the row corresponding to Hayate Usui, we need to check if the value in the 'round' column for that row equals 3. This will confirm if the claim about Hayate Usui being only 1 time defeat in round 3 is true.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\nBased on our reasoning steps, let's find the relevant data:\n\n*   We start by finding the row corresponding to 'loss' and 'Hayate Usui'. By inspecting the table, we can see that Hayate Usui has a loss in round 3. He lost against Akitoshi Tamura.\n*   To confirm if this is the only time Hayate Usui was defeated in round 3, let's verify there isn't another instance of 'loss' in round 3.\n\n3. **Verify No Other Losses in Round 3**:\n    - Looking at the table, we need to check for any other instances where 'res' is 'loss', 'opponent' equals Hayate Usui (or contains his name), and 'round' equals 3.\n    - After reviewing the data, it appears that there are no other losses in round 3.\n\n4. **Confirm Claim**:\n    - Since we found one instance of a loss for Hayate Usui in round 3 and did not find any others, our final step is to confirm that this meets the conditions stated in the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find row corresponding to Hayate Usui\",\n      \"text\": \"Inspect table for row where 'res' equals 'loss' and find data about Hayate Usui.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if round number is 3 for the loss\",\n      \"text\": \"Verify that 'round' equals 3 for Hayate Usui's loss.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find all losses in round 3 for Hayate Usui\",\n      \"text\": \"Look for any other instances of 'loss' and 'opponent' (which may include name) with 'round' equaling 3 to confirm the claim.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Hayate Usui was only defeated once in round 3\",\n      \"text\": \"Check if there are no other losses for Hayate Usui in round 3 to ensure the statement is true.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is `FALSE`.",
