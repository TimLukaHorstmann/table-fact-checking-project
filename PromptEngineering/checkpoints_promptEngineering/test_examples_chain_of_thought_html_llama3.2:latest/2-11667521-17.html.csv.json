We must verify if he indeed has the mountain classification in these stages.\n\n### Step 4: Checking Mountain Classification for Each Stage\n- For stage 0 (prologue) of Bradley Wiggins: Sylvain Chavanel is listed as the mountains classification winner.\n- For stage 2 of Christophe Moreau: Sylvain Chavanel is also listed as the mountains classification winner, which makes it two stages so far.\n- For stage 6 of Maxim Iglinsky: Again, Sylvain Chavanel holds the mountain classification title.\n- For stage 7 (final) of Alexander Vinokourov: Sylvain Chavanel secured this position.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, it's clear that Sylvain Chavanel won four out of the seven stages involving mountains classification.

We then compare this count with the total number of team classification awards.\n\nLet's start by examining relevant cells:\n- In stage 0 prologue ( bradley wiggins ), we have <td> no award </td> in cell (1,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 1 ( heinrich haussler ), we have <td> discovery channel </td> in cell (2,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 2 ( christophe moreau ), we have <td> astana </td> in cell (3,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 3 ( alexander vinokourov ), we have <td> astana </td> in cell (4,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 4 ( christophe moreau ), we have <td> team csc </td> in cell (5,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 5 ( antonio colom ), we have <td> discovery channel </td> in cell (6,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 6 ( maxim iglinsky ), we have <td> discovery channel </td> in cell (7,6) for Team Classification\n- In stage 0 stage 7 (final) ( alexander vinokourov ), we have <td> astana </td> in cell (8,6) for Team Classification\n\nNow let's count the relevant team classification awards:\n- Astana has been awarded once.\n- Discovery Channel has been awarded twice.\n\nSo, according to the given table, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed 2 of the team classification award that were Discovery Channel awards.",
