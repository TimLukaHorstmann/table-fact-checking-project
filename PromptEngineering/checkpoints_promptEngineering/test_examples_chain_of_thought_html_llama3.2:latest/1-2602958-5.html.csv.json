The cell value is 2,160,000.\n4. Now that we have both viewer counts, we need to calculate how much less viewers episode 67 has compared to episode 69. This can be done by subtracting the viewer count of episode 67 from that of episode 69. So: 2160000 - 1600000 = 560000.\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Count the number of viewers for each episode.\n   - Episode 67: The Lorelais' First Day at Yale has 4.9 million viewers.\n   - Episode 69: Chicken or Beef has 3.8 million viewers.\n\n2. Compare the viewer counts for both episodes to determine which one had more viewers.\n   Since 4.9 > 3.8, episode 67 has more viewers than episode 69.\n\n3. Format the answer as a JSON object according to the given instructions.\n\nHere is the final answer in the specified format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of viewers for each episode.\",\n    \"The Lorelais' First Day at Yale has more viewers than Chicken or Beef.\",\n    \"Therefore, the statement is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 67,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 69,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
