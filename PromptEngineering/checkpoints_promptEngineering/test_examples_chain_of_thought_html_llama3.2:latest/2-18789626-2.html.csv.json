    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find all teams that joined after 1970.\n   We can do this by finding the maximum year left (since a team joins before it leaves) and comparing it with each team's year joined.\n\n2. Next, we will iterate over each row in the table to calculate the year each school joined and compare it with the calculated maximum join year from step 1.\n   If any of these years are greater than the max join year, then that school has joined after 1970.\n\n3. Now, we can check if there is only one team that joined after 1970.\n   We will count how many teams have joined after 1970 and compare it with 1 (the number required by the statement).\n\n4. The final step would be to make sure our result matches the claim that \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970\".\n   Since we're comparing with 'mavericks', if this is true, then our answer will be TRUE; otherwise FALSE.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Find all teams that joined after 1970\",\n    \"Step 2: Iterate over each row in the table to calculate the year each school joined and compare it with the calculated maximum join year from step 1.\",\n    \"Step 3: Count how many teams have joined after 1970\",\n    \"Step 4: Check if there is only one team that joined after 1970.

This means we need to check if there are any other teams from 12 Clinton County.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Information\nTo verify this, we need to find all rows in the table where the county is '12 CLINTON'. \n\n### Step 3: Search for Team Names and Year Joined/Left \nFor each team name found within that county, extract year joined and left values. The claim claims 'hornet' has no counterparts - thus, verification will only be complete if there's at least one team from the same county with a different name than \"Hornets\".\n\n### Step 4: Review Relevant Rows\nReview rows in the table where the county is '12 CLINTON'. For each row:\n\n*   If the team name is 'hornet', then it does not meet criteria.\n*   If the team name is anything else and there are no teams with that name, then claim is TRUE.\n\n### Step 5: Determine Answer\nIf we find at least one other team in '12 CLINTON' county besides \"Hornets\", then the answer will be FALSE.

Specifically, we're looking at:\n\n- For Rossville: The value in the \"year left\" column.\n- For Clinton Prairie: The value in the \"year left\" column.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the data points in the table\nLooking through the table:\n- For Rossville, the relevant cell is in row 4 and column 5.\n- For Clinton Prairie, the relevant cell is in row 6 and column 5.\n\nThe values are:\n- Rossville: 1977\n- Clinton Prairie: 1974\n\n### Step 4: Compare the difference between year left for both schools\nTo verify the claim, we need to see if there's a 3-year difference between these two years. The calculation is:\n\nDifference = Year Left of Rossville - Year Left of Clinton Prairie\n= 1977 - 1974\n= 3\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion based on comparison\nSince the calculated difference matches the claim (3 years apart), we can conclude that the statement about Rossville and Clinton Prairie leaving 3 years apart is TRUE.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the claim to be verified (Step 1).

Specifically:\n- Look for a row with \"rensselaer central\" as the school name.\n- Look for a row where the county is mentioned (since Rossville's county is not explicitly listed but must match the one given in the claim).\n- Verify that the year joined matches 1958 and the year left matches 1966.\n\n### Step 3: Inspect County for Rossville\nSince Rossville's county isn't directly available, we need to find a matching county. According to the table, the county \"12 clinton\" is listed as Rossville's. This means Rossville indeed has the same county mentioned in the claim (\"23 fountain\" seems to be an error, as counties 12 and 23 are different).\n\n### Step 4: Verify Joined Year for Rensselaer Central\nFind if there is a row with \"rensselaer central\", \"1958\", and check that it also has \"1966\".\n\n### Step 5: Match Claim Details with Table Data\nUpon reviewing, we find that the claim's details match the data provided.

The school name is listed in the first column of each row.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>carroll</td>\n    ...\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Extract the year joined for Carroll High School\nNext, we need to extract the value in the \"year joined\" column for Carroll High School. This will tell us when the team from Carroll High School joined.\n\n```html\n<td>1961</td>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Find the row for Harrison (West Lafayette) High School\nNow that we know Carroll High School's year of joining, we can proceed to find the row corresponding to Harrison (West Lafayette) High School. Again, we search by school name in the table.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>Harrison (West Lafayette)</td>\n    ...\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 5: Extract the year joined for Harrison (West Lafayette) High School\nWe then extract the value from the \"year joined\" column for Harrison (West Lafayette) High School. This will tell us when the team from Harrison (West Lafayette) High School joined.\n\n```html\n<td>1970</td>\n```\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate the claim based on the extracted years\nWith these years, we can now evaluate the claim by comparing them directly:\n- The team from Carroll High School joined in 1961.\n- The team from Harrison (West Lafayette) High School joined in 1970.\n\nSince 1961 is before 1970, the claim that \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison (west lafayette) join\" is **FALSE**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Found Carroll and Harrison's joining years as 1961 and 1970 respectively.
