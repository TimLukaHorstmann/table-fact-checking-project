We'll examine each row:\n\n    *   Row 1: She lost with a score of \"6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6\". This means she lost 9 points (3 times 3).\n    *   Row 2: She won with a score of \"6 - 4 , 6 - 2\". There's no loss to verify.\n    *   Row 3: She lost with a score of \"3 - 6 , 4 - 6\". This means she lost 7 points (2 times 3.5).\n    *   Row 4: She lost with a score of \"6 - 7 , 4 - 6\". This means she lost 11 points (2 times 5.5).\n    *   Row 5: She won with a score of \"6 - 1 , 6 - 2\". There's no loss to verify.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of losses**: Galina Voskoboeva lost in 3 matches and lost a total of $9+7+11=27$ points.\n\n5. **Determine if she loses with only 4 points on average**: To determine this, we need the total number of games played for her, which isn't provided directly. However, we can still check if losing 4 points in any given match implies an overall trend consistent with \"on average, Galina Voskoboeva lose with only 4 point\" being true.\n\n6. **Evaluate the claim based on available data**: Since the total number of losses isn't divided by the total games to provide a clear 'average,' we will rely on analyzing her match results for any patterns that would support or contradict this claim. The average points lost in each loss is 9. This does not imply \"on average, Galina Voskoboeva lose with only 4 point.\" rather indicates an inability to consistently win, which can be inferred as a pattern of significant losing performance.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the data provided, it seems unlikely that she loses with only 4 points on average, given her overall trend of losing matches by more than just those 4 points in most instances.\n\n\n\n### Output\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The reasoning process starts by identifying the claim.

The score is 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6. There are a total of 14 games played in this match.\n- Row 2: On June 29, 2003, Galina Voskoboeva won the tournament on hard (i) against Oleksandra Kravets with a score of 6 - 4 , 6 - 2.

We need to verify if Galina Voskoboeva played against Matea Mezak again.\n\n3: Check if there are any other rows where the same opponent appears, excluding June 6, 2006.\n\nWe notice that Roberta Vinci and Lilia Osterloh appear as opponents in two different rows, but we need to verify if this is true for all of Galina Voskoboeva's opponents.\n\n4: Check the score of each row to ensure that it is consistent with the claim.\n\nThe scores are provided in each cell. We can see that some scores have a hyphen separation (e.g., 6-4, 4-6) while others do not (e.g., 3-6).\n\n5: Evaluate whether Galina Voskoboeva played against Matea Mezak more than once.\n\nAccording to the table, Galina Voskoboeva's first match was with Matea Mezak on January 28, 2003. Since there is no other match between them in the table, we can conclude that she did not play against him more than once.\n\n6: Evaluate whether Galina Voskoboeva played against Roberta Vinci and Lilia Osterloh more than one time.\n\nWe see that Roberta Vinci appeared as an opponent for Galina Voskoboeva on October 3, 2003. However, the table does not show any other match between them.\n\nLilia Osterloh also appears twice in the table: November 8, 2005, and there is no indication of another match.\n\n7: Evaluate if the claim is true based on our findings.\n\nSince we have confirmed that Galina Voskoboeva did not play against Matea Mezak more than once and has played against Roberta Vinci and Lilia Osterloh only once (excluding June 6, 2006), where she actually lost to them both, the claim can be considered true.\n\n8: List the relevant cells that supported our conclusion.\n\nRow 1:\n- \"opponent\": Matea Mezak\n- \"outcome\": runner - up\n\nRow 3:\n- \"opponent\": Roberta Vinci\n- \"outcome\": runner - up\n\nRow 4:\n- \"opponent\": Lilia Osterloh\n- \"outcome\": runner - up\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Inspect the table to identify Galina Voskoboeva's opponents.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Extract the scores where Galina Voskoboeva lost to both Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa\n\nTo determine if Galina Voskoboeva loses with only 4 points against these opponents, we need to find the rows in the table where she lost with exactly 4 points. The score format is \"x - y , x - z , x - w\", so we can search for the rows where \"x\" equals 4.\n\n### Step 2: Find the scores where Galina Voskoboeva lost to Oleksandra Kravets\n\nLooking at the table, the row with the score \"6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6\" has a loss against Oleksandra Kravets. Therefore, the relevant cells for this step are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Find the scores where Galina Voskoboeva lost to Alice Canepa\n\nLooking at the table, the row with the score \"6 - 1 , 6 - 2\" has a loss against Alice Canepa. Therefore, the relevant cells for this step are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of times Galina Voskoboeva lost with only 4 points\n\nFrom steps 2 and 3, we know that Galina Voskoboeva lost with exactly 4 points to both Oleksandra Kravets (1 time) and Alice Canepa (1 time). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if there are other rows where Galina Voskoboeva lost with only 4 points\n\nWe can search for any other rows in the table that match this pattern. However, since we've already found two instances where Galina Voskoboeva lost with exactly 4 points, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Step 6: Determine if there are other cells relevant to the answer\n\nWe have already identified all the relevant cells in steps 2 and 3. Therefore, no additional relevant cells need to be considered for this problem.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Extracted scores where Galina Voskoboeva lost with exactly 4 points.\\nStep 2: Found the score where Galina Voskoboeva lost to Oleksandra Kravets.\\nStep 3: Found the score where Galina Voskoboeva lost to Alice Canepa.\\nStep 4: Calculated the number of times Galina Voskoboeva lost with only 4 points.\\nStep 5: Concluded that the claim is TRUE.\\nStep 6: Determined that no additional relevant cells need to be considered.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
