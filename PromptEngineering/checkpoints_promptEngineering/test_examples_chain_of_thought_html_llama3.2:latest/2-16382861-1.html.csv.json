Next, I will look at the nicknames and their corresponding rows in the table to find the nickname \"Fly Dutchmen\".\n\n4. The row with the nickname \"Fightin' Blue Hens\" (column 6) is for University of Delaware, which was not the intended school for this claim. However, since we are looking for a different school with the same nickname (\"Fly Dutchmen\"), I need to find another one that matches.\n\n5. There isn't any other row in the table with \"Fly Dutchmen\", however there is one with \"Flying dutchmen\" which is associated with Lebanon Valley College.\n\n6. Now, I will compare the founding date of Rutgers University (1766) and Lebanon Valley College (1866).
