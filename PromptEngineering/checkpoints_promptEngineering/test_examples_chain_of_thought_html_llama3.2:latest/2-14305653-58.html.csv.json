    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim is about the Yugoslavian national team winning both of its friendly matches by a score of 2:1.\n2. **Find Relevant Matches**: We need to find two rows in the table where the \"city\", \"opponent\", and \"results\" columns match this condition. The first row does not have a city that would be relevant for Yugoslavia (it's Sarajevo, which is unlikely), so we move to the next.\n3. **Check the Second Row**: In the second row (\"march 30\"), the opponent is Romania, but it is not a friendly match and the score is 2:0, not 2:1.\n4. **Move On to Other Rows**: We continue to other rows that meet our criteria. The fourth row does not have a score of 2:1 for any reason (it's about a different game).\n5. **Check the Remaining Rows**: \n   - In the third row (\"april 26\"), the city is Borovo, which doesn't appear to be relevant. It's also a friendly match with a score of 2:1, so this could potentially meet our criteria.\n   - In the fifth row (\"september 10\"), there seems to be no information on whether it was a friendly game or not since Luxembourg is itself an opponent (we assume it means home game), and it also does not contain any other data about Yugoslavia's opponent. However, this result has a score of 5:0 so doesn't match our criteria.\n6. **Check the Last Possible Row**: In the sixth row (\"september 27\"), we can see that there is no friendly match where Yugoslavian team played against Denmark with a score of 2:1, since it was a competitive (WCQ) game.\n7. **Final Check for Other Possible Friendly Matches**: After checking all other rows for similar matches, the only two remaining rows to consider are \"april 26\" and another one that is not there as we have checked every single row with our criteria already.\n\n\n8. **Conclusion Based on Step-by-Step Analysis**: Our analysis confirms that Yugoslavia won its friendly match against Denmark with a score of 2:1, but it lost the other friendly match mentioned (\"april 26\") against Poland with a score of 2:1.\n9. **Final Answer in JSON Format**:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"After carefully checking every single row for matches where the Yugoslavian national team played against another country as 'opponent' and had a friendly match type, only one match (April 26) had both the conditions meet: Yugoslavia won with score 2:1.

This involves finding rows where the team is mentioned as \"Yugoslavia\" or \"Yugoslavians\", and then examining the score details.\n\n### Step 3: Locate Matches Involving the Yugoslavian National Team\nFrom the table, we can see that there are three matches involving Yugoslavia (or possibly another country with a similar name, but based on available data in table it seems to be correct for our case). These match cells are:\n\n- Row index 2 (first row): `march 22`, `sarajevo`, `uruguay`\n- Row index 5: `august 27`, `bucharest , romania`, `romania`\n- Row index 6: `september 10`, `luxembourg`, `luxembourg`\n\n### Step 4: Verify Scores for Each Match\nNow, we need to check if the score matches the claim's requirements:\n\n1.

However, our next step needs more information.\n\n2. **Number of Goals Conceded**: \n   - Row index 6 (september 10): The team conceded `0` goals in one match but again this is not one of the first \"3\" matches mentioned so we will exclude it from further analysis.\n   - We do have enough data for one other game to verify if they allowed `3` goals total.\n\n3. **Qualifying Matches (1982 World Cup)**: \n   - All three identified games match the claim as part of the 1982 World Cup qualifications.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false for the specified conditions regarding scoring and concession in those qualifying matches against Yugoslavia's opponents.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"\"\"\nStep 1 - Review table structure to identify relevant data.\nStep 2 - Determine which rows contain the Yugoslavian national team participating in World Cup qualifying matches from table data.\nStep 3 - Locate and list these matches for thorough inspection against claim requirements.\nStep 4 - Verify if each game results in total goals scored equaling `7`, conceding exactly `3` goals, while being part of the qualifying matches (1982 WC).\nStep 5: Summarize findings to conclude whether claim is true or false based on our analysis of data for these three games.\n  \"\"\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis process confirms that the claim is not accurate for all required conditions.",
