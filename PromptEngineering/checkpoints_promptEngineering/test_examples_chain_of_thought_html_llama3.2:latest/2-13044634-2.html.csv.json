However, we need to find the specific row that matches the claim's criteria of having a 3-game match played in Hammond, Indiana.\n3. Looking at the table, we notice that only two rows mention \"Hammond, Indiana\" as the location: the first row (with a record of 5-0) and the second row (with a record of 4-0).\n4. Since both rows have a match played in Hammond, Indiana, but the claim specifies a specific game with a score of \"3 game be play in hammond , in\", we need to determine which one matches this criteria.\n5. Upon closer inspection, it appears that there is an inconsistency between the claim and the table data. The claim mentions \"be play in\" instead of the usual \"at\" or \"in\" phrase used in MMA match records. This suggests that the claim may be FALSE because it does not accurately describe a match played at Hammond, Indiana.\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Check if there is a game against Cliff Wright**: Check the table to see if there is a row where the value of 'opponent' is 'cliff wright'. We find one.\n\n2. **Check how many rounds the game against cliff wright took**: Look at the value in the 'round' column for this specific opponent. It says 3, so it did take three rounds.\n\n3. **Check if all games against Cliff Wright are in Hammond, Indiana**: Check the table to see where each of these three games took place and verify that they were all in Hammond, Indiana.\n\n4. **Verify if there is another instance for \"all 3 game be in hammon , indiana\"**: Check the rest of the table to ensure that no other games are mentioned as occurring in Hammond, Indiana.\n\n5. **Check if a chain of three occurs for Cliff Wright's fights**: Verify that all three games took place against different opponents since there isn't an opponent listed more than once in this context.\n\n\n6. **Combine the information from previous steps and draw final conclusion**:\nFrom step 3, we verified that one game was indeed held in Hammond Indiana but it does not confirm if every single other relevant data point about Cliff Wright is correct according to the claim statement given. Thus our answer would lean towards false because one fact does not fully support all the claims being true.\n\n7. **Finalize steps into a valid JSON format**:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
