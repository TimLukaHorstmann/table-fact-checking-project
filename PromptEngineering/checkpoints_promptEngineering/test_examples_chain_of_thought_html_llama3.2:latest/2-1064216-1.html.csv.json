Examine each row in the table for the `lecturers` column:\n\n- Row 1: 2, Row 2: 9, Row 3: 12, Row 4: 5, Row 5: 18, Row 6: 6, Row 7: 7, Row 8: 4, Row 9: 2\n6.

Compare these with the specified range (2-18):\n   - The minimum value of 2 is within the range.\n   - The maximum value of 18 is within the range.\n8. **Conclusion**: Since both the minimum and maximum values found in the `lecturers` column fall within the specified range, the claim that \"the number of lecturers in each school range from 2 - 18\" is true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The minimum value (2) and the maximum value (18) found in the lecturers column are both within the specified range (2-18).
