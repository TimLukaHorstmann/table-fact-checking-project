First, let's extract the relevant information from the table:\n   - Jenny Thompson's rank: 1\n   - Martina Moravcov\u00e1's rank: 2\n   - The claim says that Jenny Thompson ranks 1 position better than Martina Moravcov\u00e1.\n\n2. To determine if the claim is true, we need to check if Jenny Thompson's rank is indeed one position higher than Martina Moravcov\u00e1's rank.\n\n3. If Jenny Thompson's rank (1) is less than Martina Moravcov\u00e1's rank (2), then the claim is false.\n4. However, since Jenny Thompson's rank (1) is greater than Martina Moravcov\u00e1's rank (2), it means that Jenny Thompson ranks one position higher than Martina Moravcov\u00e1.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the table data, the claim \"for the woman 's 100 metre butterfly , jenny thompson rank 1 position better than martina moravcov\u00e1\" is TRUE.\n\n6.
