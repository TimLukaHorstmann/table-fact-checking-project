Next, I will find the time gap between each win and loss for Stoke City.\n4. Finally, I will compare this time gap with \"over a year\" (which is equivalent to 365 days) to determine if Stoke City wins and loses over a year apart.\n\nHere's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The claim mentions Stoke City winning once and losing later than a year after that win.\n2. Let's first check how many times Stoke City won: in the table, there are two instances where Stoke City is listed as \"winner\".\n3. Now let's count the number of losses for Stoke City, which appears twice in the table.\n4. In order to determine if this is more than a year between each win and loss, I need to find out how many days separate these events:\n   - The first time Stoke lost (1971-72 FA Cup) happened approximately 365.5 days after their only win (1970-71 FA Cup).\n   - They won again in the 1973-74 season which took place 365 days after they lost in the previous season.\n5. So there is a gap of 365 and then another 365 between two losses, meaning that Stoke City doesn't have a time gap larger than a year.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First count the number of wins and losses for Stoke City, check their win dates in order to calculate the time gaps in days between each event.

Therefore we need to check for another team.\n     - The relevant match is not there, however this was the closest possible match.\n\n5. **Check for Accuracy of Information**:\n   - Upon re-examining our data, it appears that Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers did not both beat their competitors by exactly 3 points as stated in the claim.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The information provided does not support the claim that \"stoke city and wolverhampton wanderer both beat their competition by score 3 point\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After examining the table, we found that Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers did not both beat their competitors by exactly 3 points.

Identify the relevant column for determining wins and losses: The column for finding if a team has won or lost will be based on the 'winner' and 'loser' columns respectively.\n\n2. Count the number of times Stoke City loses: We need to count how many times Stoke City appears in the 'loser' column, which is the second column.\n\n3. Identify all instances where Stoke City wins more than a year after losing: Since dates are given for both losses and wins, we will look at the date difference between each loss and the corresponding win. If the win occurs more than one year after the loss, it satisfies our condition.\n\n4. Count the number of times this happens: We need to identify how many times Stoke City's win is more than a year after losing.\n\n5. Determine if the claim is true or false based on step 4: The claim is true if there are instances where Stoke City wins over one year after losing and false otherwise.\n\n6.

To find the answer, we must now count how many times Stoke City loses. The team lost in rows 1 and 2, so there are two losses.\n\n8. Next, we determine which of these wins happen more than a year after the loss. We compare the dates from row 1 (loss) to row 2 (win), which is an increase of nearly one year since April 10th, 1970 was before May 7th, 1971.\n\n9. Now we see if there are any other instances where Stoke City wins more than a year after losing: We compare the dates from rows 3 and 4, which is July 5th, 1972 to May 9th, 1974 - almost two years apart.\n\n10.
