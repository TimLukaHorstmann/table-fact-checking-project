    "resp": "### Step 1: Extract the rank values from the table\nTo compare the ranks of Dartmouth College and University of T\u00fcbingen, we need to extract their respective rank values from the table.\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>world rank by wur , 2013</td>\n      <td>126th</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>world rank by arwu , 2013</td>\n      <td>151 - 200th</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>world rank by qs , 2013</td>\n      <td>113th</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relevant rank values for Dartmouth College and University of T\u00fcbingen\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n- The world rank by WUR (Wirtschaftliche Universit\u00e4tsrangliste) is not directly available, but the range indicates it falls between 151st and 200th.\n- Dartmouth College's world rank by ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) is between 151st and 200th.\n- Dartmouth College's world rank by QS is 113th.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the relevant rank values for University of T\u00fcbingen\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n- The world rank by WUR (Wirtschaftliche Universit\u00e4tsrangliste) is not directly available, but the range indicates it falls between 201st and 225th.\n- University of T\u00fcbingen's world rank by ARWU is between 151st and 200th.\n- University of T\u00fcbingen's world rank by QS is 144th.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the ranks\nBased on the extracted and identified values:\n- Dartmouth College has a lower rank in all categories relevant to the comparison (QS).\n- University of T\u00fcbingen has a higher rank in one category (QS) but a comparable range in another (ARWU).\n\nHowever, considering that we are comparing which institution ranks \"higher\" across multiple criteria and acknowledging the ranges for ARWU might include Dartmouth College's position, the initial observation is incorrect upon closer inspection. \n\n### Step 5: Re-evaluate based on \"higher\"\nUpon re-evaluation:\n- In QS rankings (113th), Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen (144th).\n- Considering WUR and ARWU rankings are not directly comparable without more specific ranges or exact values, but if we look at the highest rank within each range provided for both institutions:\n  - For University of T\u00fcbingen: The WUR range includes a higher number but is less precise than Dartmouth's QS ranking.\n  - For Dartmouth College: It has a lower overall ARWU range.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven that \"higher\" typically implies the best or top-ranked position, and considering the specific criteria:\n- In the QS rankings, Dartmouth ranks higher (113th) than T\u00fcbingen (144th).\n- The comparison across other criteria isn't straightforward without exact values but generally supports Dartmouth's superior rank in this metric.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"it may come as a surprise, but Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE when considering the QS rankings alone. However, it's essential to acknowledge that other criteria might not provide a clear \"higher\" ranking for Dartmouth over T\u00fcbingen.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Comparison of relevant rank values from table indicates Dartmouth College has a lower rank in most categories but ranks higher than University of T\u00fcbingen in the QS rankings.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that the University of Western Australia (UWA) does better overall than Durham University despite UWA's late date of establishment.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to compare the ranking positions of both universities in different rankings.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that Durham University was established in 1832 and is ranked 80th globally (according to WUR), while UWA was established in 1911 and is ranked 168th globally (according to WUR).\n4. Since Durham University has an earlier date of establishment, it's possible that its early start gave it a head start in terms of growth and development.\n5. However, we also need to check if the difference in ranking positions between UWA and Durham University changes when considering different rankings (ARWU, QS).\n6. Looking at the ARWU table, UWA is ranked 91st globally, while Durham University is not explicitly mentioned as having a rank range (it might be below 200th). This suggests that UWA might do slightly better in terms of academic reputation than Durham University.\n7. Finally, looking at the QS table, we see that UWA is ranked 134th globally, which is higher than Durham University's 90th ranking (according to WUR).\n8.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine if the claim about Durham University's rank is true:\n\n1. List all the world ranks for Durham University from the table:\n   - World rank by WUR, 2013: 80th\n   - World rank by ARWU, 2013: Not explicitly stated but mentioned in a range (201-300), so we can't conclude it's true or false.\n   - World rank by QS, 2013: 90th\n\n2. Since the claim specifically says Durham University has the \"second-best\" rank in the world rank by WUR, 2013 category, and we know that their WUR rank is 80th (the 80th best), this would typically make it the first-best if the ranks were strictly ordered.\n\nHowever, considering a ranking where ties are allowed or even preferred over strict ordering, the statement about being \"second-best\" might not hold true because all positions within the range (e.g., 201-300) could be considered part of that category. Without an explicit ordering provided in the table for ARWU, it's difficult to make a claim about Durham University's ranking.\n\n3. The QS rank of 90th doesn't directly support or contradict the statement since \"second-best\" can apply without needing further comparison.\n\n4. The question specifically asks whether Durham University has the second-best rank according to WUR, 2013 rankings, which seems to be true based on their provided position (80th), assuming typical ranking conventions.\n\n5. Given the ambiguity around ARWU and the fact that a \"second-best\" ranking is somewhat subjective without further context or ordering, we focus primarily on the information about Durham University's WUR, 2013 rank for this claim.\n\n6. However, acknowledging the complexity of interpreting rankings across different organizations with slightly varying methodologies, a strict interpretation might not align perfectly with common English usage (\"second-best\").\n\nTherefore, based on the available data and typical interpretations of such rankings, but also recognizing the nuances involved:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Durham University's WUR rank is 80th, which would typically be considered best in this context. Step 2: The claim says 'second-best', implying a ranking where being at the very top or lowest isn't explicitly ruled out; however, in strict ordering, their position does make them first-best according to most typical interpretations. However, without explicit comparison to any 'best' position within that range, it's somewhat ambiguous.

The claim states that Queen's University (Canada) does better than Dartmouth College in all 3 categories: world rank by WUR, ARWU, and QS.\n2. To verify this, we need to compare the rankings of both universities in each category.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that:\n   - In the WUR ranking, Queen's University is ranked 226-250th, while Dartmouth College is ranked 126th.\n   - Dartmouth College has a better ranking than Queen's University in the WUR category.\n4.
