Look for a row that has a different band (not The Beach Boys) and the same album title (\"The La Express\") with the same year of release (\"1976\"). This is not present in the table. However, there are two other \"La\" albums by 'the beach boys' with the same years: 1979 and 1989.\n\n4. Since both albums are by The Beach Boys, look for a row that contains one of these albums.

According to the table, \"keepin' the summer alive\" by The Beach Boys was released in 1980.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the release year of \"la (light album)\". Looking at the table, \"la (light album)\" by The Beach Boys has two entries with different release years: one in 1979 and another in 1989. Since the claim is about \"keepin' the summer alive\", which was released after 1979, we can ignore the 1979 entry.\n\n3. Therefore, our focus shifts to the 1989 entry for \"la (light album)\". However, it's worth noting that this release year of 1989 doesn't necessarily imply that \"keepin' the summer alive\" was released a year later since it might have been released in the same year as \"la (light album)\".\n\n4. So now, to verify whether \"keepin' the summer alive\" was released a year after \"la\", we need to compare these two release years.

We need to check if the claim about Dennis Wilson's \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" being the latest re-release from Caribou Record, released in 2008, is true or false.\n2. To verify this, we should look at the table and find the relevant rows for both the record information (Dennis Wilson's \"Pacific Ocean Blue\") and the release year, as well as whether it was a re-release.\n\n3. Looking through the table, we can see that there are multiple rows for Dennis Wilson, but none of them have the specific format we're interested in (\"cd / lp\").\n\n4. However, we do find a row where \"dennis wilson\" is present, and there's an entry for '2008' as both a year and part of a product name ('cd : 88697339322 lp : suz5212.1').\n\n5. Looking further at the relevant cell for the record information (\"cd / lp\"), we can see that \"dennis wilson\" is indeed present, but this specific entry seems to be a re-release as it includes additional data (such as the product name).\n\n6. Since there are multiple releases with different years and formats, we need to focus on whether the release in 2008 is indeed from Caribou Record.\n\n7.

We also need to check if there are any album releases with a CD format that do not have a Caribou Record label.\n4. Let's start by finding instances where \"Caribou Record\" is mentioned as the record label:\n\t* Looking at the table, we see that \"Caribou Record\" is indeed the record label for several albums (jz 35752, zk 35752, z2x 37445, z2k 37445).\n5. Next, let's verify if there are any album releases with a CD format that do not have a Caribou Record label:\n\t* We see that there is no instance of an album release with a CD format and the record label \"Caribou Record\" (either as the artist's name or part of their name).\n6.

We must check if Pacific Ocean Blue by Dennis Wilson was initially released by Caribou Record or not. Unfortunately, we cannot find this information from the given table.\n\nTherefore, our initial conclusion still stands - the release year of 1977 does meet one part of the claim statement, but there's another aspect that needs clarification.",

If such an album exists, then the claim is true.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are multiple instances of The Beach Boys releasing albums with both LP and CD formats. However, one notable example is \"Keepin' the Summer Alive\" (US) which releases in 1980. It has a format \"lp\", but also \"10 years of harmony\" and \"la (light album)\" have formats lp, 2lp and cd respectively which includes cd.\n\n3. Another possible instance where this might occur, is when it comes to the 1979 release of \"La (Light Album)\". The relevant information can be found in cells that are row_index = 1, column_name = 'format'.\n\n4.
