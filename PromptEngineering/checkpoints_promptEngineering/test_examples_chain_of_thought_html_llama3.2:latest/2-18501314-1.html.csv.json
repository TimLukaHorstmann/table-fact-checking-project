Looking at the table, we see that Mark Lillis has 56 goals (20+4+6+20).\n3. We should compare Mark Lillis's total goals with the total goals of other players to confirm if he indeed has the most.\n\nComparing with other players:\n- Mark Lillis has 56 goals.\n- Colleen Russell has 49 + 17 = 66 goals.\n- However, there are no other player scores that can match or exceed Colleen's and therefore her is more than anyone else in terms of total goals scored.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"C\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"D\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `chain_of_thought` contains empty objects for each step since we don't need to explicitly state any calculations or reasoning in this problem.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. The problem asks us to find out if 4 people play the position of forward in the 1982-82 season.\n2. We can start by looking at the table and finding the cells that correspond to the \"forward\" position.\n3. The column names for the positions are not explicitly stated, but based on the data, we can assume that the columns corresponding to the forwards are \"FW\" (forwards).\n4. We need to count the number of rows where the value in the \"FW\" column is greater than 0 (i.e., players playing as forwards).\n5. Let's look at the table and count the rows with a value greater than 0 in the \"FW\" column:\n\t* Row 1: FW = 16\n\t* Row 2: FW = 20\n\t* Row 3: FW = 6\n\t* Row 4: FW = 16\n\t* Row 5: FW = 0 (not playing as forward)\n\t* Row 6: FW = 0 (not playing as forward)\n\t* ...\n6. We see that there are multiple rows where the value in the \"FW\" column is greater than 0, so we need to count them carefully.\n7. After re-examining the table, I found the following rows with a value greater than 0 in the \"FW\" column:\n\t+ Row 2: FW = 20\n\t+ Row 3: FW = 6\n\t+ Row 4: FW = 16\n\t+ Row 5: FW = 0 (not playing as forward)\n\t+ Row 6: FW = 16\n\t+ Row 7: FW = 41\n\t+ Row 8: FW = 41\n\t+ Row 9: FW = 5\n\t+ Row 10: FW = 41\n\t+ Row 11: FW = 16\n\t+ Row 12: FW = 20\n\t+ Row 13: FW = 6\n\t+ Row 14: FW = 0 (not playing as forward)\n8.

To verify this, we need to find the rows where the value in the \"FA Cup Goals\" column for Brian Stanton is not zero.\n3. We can do this by searching for the row index and column name of each cell with the value \"Brian Stanton\" in the table.\n4. Once we have found all these cells, we can compare their values to confirm if they are indeed non-zero.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 30,\n    \"column_name\": \"FA Cup Goals\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 31,\n    \"column_name\": \"FA Cup Goals\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n5. Now, let's verify if the values in these cells are non-zero.\n\n6. Upon inspection, we see that Brian Stanton scored 13 FA Cup goals (at row index 30) and another 4 FA Cup goals (at row index 31). These are indeed non-zero values.\n\n7. However, we need to check all rows where \"Brian Stanton\" appears as the value in the \"FA Cup Goals\" column. Upon further inspection, we find two more instances: at row indices 35 and 36. Both have a value of 4 FA Cup goals.\n\n#### Chain of Thought:\n\n- Search for the row index and column name of each cell with the value \"Brian Stanton\" in the table.\n- Verify if the values in these cells are non-zero.\n- Check all relevant rows to ensure that no one else has scored more than Brian Stanton's 17 FA Cup goals.\n\n8.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To compare David Burke's total apps with Malcolm Brown's, we need to find their respective totals.\n2. We can do this by adding up the \"Total Apps\" column for each player. For David Burke, it is 46 (from row 10). For Malcolm Brown, it is also 56 (from row 13).\n3. Now that we have both totals, we can subtract Burke's total from Brown's to see if he has more.\n4. However, the statement says \"have 3 more\", not just \"has\". Therefore, we must check if Burke's total minus his own is equal to or greater than three and also compare it with Malcolm Brown's total minus his own.\n5. Comparing Burke's apps to Brown's apps: Burke has 46 - 46 = 0 apps, while Brown has 56 - 46 = 10 apps.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Compare David Burke's total apps (46) with Malcolm Brown's total apps (56).
