Based on our comparison, we can now list all teams that scored more points than Geelong's opponent (Richmond).\n   - These are the teams with higher attendance: \"fitzroy\" and \"essendon\".\n   - However, since fitzroy had a slightly lower score than Geelong despite having a higher crowd, it does not meet our criteria.\n   - We then check Essendon's opponent (Hawthorn), who have a lower crowd but the same score as Richmond. Thus they do qualify.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Geelong lost their game but scored more points than all but one other team on May 27.\n \n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify which team Geelong played against: away team geelong\",\n    \"Geelong lose their game compared to Richmond's score (16.9 vs 16.13)\",\n    \"Check the teams that scored more points than Geelong on May 27: fitzroy (21753) and essendon (28187)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",
