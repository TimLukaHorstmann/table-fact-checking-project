The \"attendance\" column in the table is located next to each game's row. We will compare the attendance values for games where the opponent is listed as \"Detroit Lions\".\n\n```markdown\n| week | date       | opponent                  | result | attendance |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|--------|------------|\n| 5    | September 7, 1956 | Detroit Lions            | l      | 48105      |\n| 6    | September 15, 1956 | Detroit Lions at Akron   | l      | 28201      |\n| 1    | August 10, 1956 | College All-Stars at Chicago| w      | 75000      |\n```\n\nFrom the table, we can see that there are two games with Detroit Lions as their opponent. The attendance value for these games is 48105 and 28201 respectively.\n\nTo verify if one of them has the lowest attendance, let's compare it against other games:\n\n```markdown\n| week | date       | opponent                  | result | attendance |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|--------|------------|\n| 4    | September 1, 1956 | Green Bay Packers         | l      | 15456      |\n| 3    | August 24, 1956 | Los Angeles Rams           | l      | 40175      |\n| 2    | August 19, 1956 | San Francisco 49ers        | l      | 38741      |\n```\n\nComparing these values:\n\n- The lowest attendance among the games listed is 15456 which occurred in game number 4.\n\nHowever, to verify our claim that \"the game against the detroit lion[s]\" indeed has the lowest attendance, we should also check other non-Detroit Lions games for their attendance.\n\n```markdown\n| week | date       | opponent                  | result | attendance |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|--------|------------|\n| 1    | August 10, 1956 | College All-Stars at Chicago| w      | 75000      |\n| 2    | August 19, 1956 | San Francisco 49ers        | l      | 38741      |\n| 3    | August 24, 1956 | Los Angeles Rams           | l      | 40175      |\n| 7    | September 21, 1956 | Chicago Bears              | w      | 56543      |\n```\n\nComparing these values:\n\n- The lowest attendance among the non-Detroit Lions games listed is 38741 which occurred in game number 2.\n\nGiven that we've identified a lower value for Detroit Lions opponent with an attendance of 28201 and another lower value (lower than 48105) for non-Detroit Lions opponents, our initial conclusion might seem valid but needs further scrutiny considering both the claimed game and all other data to ensure no oversight.\n\nHowever, upon a closer inspection, we realize that the \"game against the detroit lion[s]\" is actually referring to two different games because of \"at Akron\" in one of them. So the lower attendance value (28201) actually corresponds to a single game where Detroit Lions were not at home but still part of our original claim.\n\nConsidering this clarification and re-checking all games with Detroit Lions, it turns out that we made an initial misinterpretation:\n\n- 48105 is indeed higher than 28201.\n- However the lowest value for attendance among the games with Detroit Lions (considering both \"at Akron\" and the main Detroit Lions game) actually occurs in the second instance.\n\nThis realization means our original interpretation contained a mistake, given the correct details of which specific game had lower attendance.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We compared the values for games where the opponent was listed as 'Detroit Lions'. We found two instances with values of 48105 and 28201 respectively. However we made a mistake in our earlier explanation because when comparing all instances, including both main Detroit Lions game and their 'at Akron' counterpart, we should have identified that 28201 actually corresponds to the lowest attendance value.
