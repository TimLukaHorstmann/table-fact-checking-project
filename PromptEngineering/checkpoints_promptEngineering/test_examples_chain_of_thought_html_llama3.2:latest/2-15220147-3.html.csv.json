The relevant table data is:\n\n- Bronze column (4th column) values.\n- Total column (6th column) values.\n- Rank column (1st column) values.\n\n#### Step 3: List Countries with Only One Bronze Medal\nWe need to find rows where the value in the Bronze column is 1, indicating a single bronze medal win.

We can do this by sorting the table in descending order by the \"total\" column.\n\n2. **Check each of the top 6 teams' gold medal count**: After identifying the top 6 teams, we need to check if each team has exactly 3 gold medals. This will determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant rows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 6,\n  \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n}\n```\n\n3. **Verify each team's gold medal count**:\n\n* Germany: 2\n* Great Britain: 2\n* Italy: 2\n* Netherlands: 2\n* France: 1\n* Belgium: 1\n\nOnly the top 4 teams (Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and Netherlands) have more than 3 gold medals. The remaining two teams (France and Belgium) only have 1 gold medal each.\n\nSince not all of the top 6 teams have exactly 3 gold medals, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the top 6 teams by sorting the table in descending order by the total column.\",\n    \"Check each team's gold medal count to see if they all have exactly 3 gold medals.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
