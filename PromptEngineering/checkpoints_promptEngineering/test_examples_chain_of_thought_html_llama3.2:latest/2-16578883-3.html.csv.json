So, the relevant cell for this location can be represented as:\n   \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 2,\n     \"column_name\": \"location\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Find the total ranking of all locations:** To find the rank of Anaheim, California out of all locations, we need to identify its corresponding rank in the table.\n\n   Looking at the `rank` column, the values start from 1 for Lake Bua Vista, Florida. Since Anaheim, California is in the second row (index 2), it's implied that this ranking starts from 2. Therefore, the relevant cell for the total ranking of Anaheim, California can be represented as:\n   \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 2,\n     \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Compare the rank of Anaheim, California to the total number of locations:** We need to compare the rank we found in step 2 (index 2) with the total number of locations which is 8.\n\n   Since Anaheim, California's index for ranking (row_index 2) and its corresponding value (index 3) are out of order from what was given at the start of the table, we can't use this to make any claims.
