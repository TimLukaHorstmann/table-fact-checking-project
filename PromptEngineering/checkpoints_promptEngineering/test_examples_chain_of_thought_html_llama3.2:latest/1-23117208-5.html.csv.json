    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about Michael Rauch writing the highest number of episodes:\n\n1. Identify all the writers listed for each episode:\n   - We can do this by examining the \"written by\" column (th \"written by\") of the table.\n\n2. Count how many episodes each writer wrote and find out who has the most episodes written:\n   - For Michael Rauch, we see that he co-wrote 5 episodes (\"you give love a bad name\", \"imperfect storm\", \"business and pleasure\", and two others that do not include him as a sole writer) but it is not clear if these 5 episodes are more than any other writers. We also note that Michael Rauch & Jessica Ball, and Andrew Lenchewski & Jeff Drayer wrote additional episodes.\n\n3. Count how many episodes each of the remaining writers listed in the table (other than Michael Rauch) has written:\n   - We can see from examining column 5 (\"written by\") that Constantine Makris, Allison Liddi-Brown, and Tawnia McKiernan have 1 episode each written.\n\n4. Based on step 3, we now know all the writers except for Michael Rauch. Count how many total episodes were written in total:\n   - From examining column 8 (\"viewers (millions)\") of the table we find that there are a total of 53 episodes, with varying viewership numbers.\n\n5. Compare the number of episodes written by each writer to determine who wrote the most and whether they indeed write more than Michael Rauch.\n   - Constantine Makris and Tawnia McKiernan have only one episode each; Allison Liddi-Brown has two episodes but we do not know what she co-wrote with. We can count the number of episodes that Michael Rauch co-wrote, as well as the number of single-written episodes written by Michael Rauch.\n   - With a total of 5 single-written and 4 double-written episodes attributed to him, we now know that Michael Rauch has a total of 9 episodes.\n\n6. Based on steps 3-5, compare the episode count of all writers including Michael Rauch:\n   - We have found out that there are at least 13 other writers listed in column 5 (including those writing one or more episodes with co-authors) with fewer episodes than Michael Rauch.\n   - Constantine Makris and Tawnia McKiernan, Allison Liddi-Brown, Jon Sherman, Carol Flint, Matthew Penn, Emile Levisetti, Andrew Lenchewski, Mark Feuerstein, and Jessica Ball all have fewer than 9 episodes each.\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Michael Rauch has a total of 9 episodes; we also see that the highest single episode number among other writers is around 4 for several of them (e.g., Matthew Penn with an original air date of July 18,2012, and Carol Flint), while some have lower viewership numbers.\n\nGiven these steps, we can now conclude whether Michael Rauch writes the most episodes.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the relevant data**: We need to identify the column that contains information about the writers, which is the 5th column (\"written by\"). We also need to find the number of episodes written by each writer.\n\n2. **Identify the writers and their episode count**:\n    - Look for the cell containing \"Jon Sherman\" in the \"written by\" column.\n    - Find the row index corresponding to Jon Sherman's name.\n    - Count the number of cells in that row, starting from the first non-empty cell (this will represent the total episodes written by Jon Sherman).\n\n3. **Find the writer with the highest episode count**: Compare the episode counts for each writer found in step 2.\n\n4. **Verify if this writer has more than one episode**: Since we need to determine if \"Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes\", verify that there is at least one other writer with a lower episode count.\n\n5. **Output the result**:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Search for Jon Sherman in the table**: Look through each row in the table and find the cell where \"Jon Sherman\" appears in the \"written by\" column.\n    - Row 4 contains the name \"jon sherman\" as written by, but it's not alone; the following cells contain more names separated by '&'.\n\n\n\n2. **Count episodes for Jon Sherman**:\n    - Since there are multiple writers listed for one episode (e.g., &quot;jon sherman&quot;, &quot;jon sherman &amp; jeff drayer&quot;), only count each episode once as written by Jon Sherman.\n\n\n\n3. **Find the row index and column name of all relevant cells**:\n    - The first non-empty cell is in row 4, which contains \"jon sherman\".\n\n\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Count episodes for other writers**: Repeat this process for each writer to determine their total episode count.\n\n2. **Compare counts to find the highest number**:\n    - For instance, look at the counts in row 4: there's a single episode counted as written by Jon Sherman but multiple episodes (all of them) are also written by him.\n\n\n\n3. **Verify that this writer has more than one episode**:\n    - Since there's only one episode with \"Jon Sherman\" and another named cell in row 4 containing other names, we can safely say he's the highest single writer so far.\n\n\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Identify the relevant cells as objects**: Create JSON objects to represent each relevant cell:\n    - ```\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. **List all relevant cells in an array**:\n    - ```\n    [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n        },  \n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n        }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. **Output the final JSON object**:\n```\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Jon Sherman in row 4, counted only one episode as his, compared this count with other writer's counts and verified he has more than one episode.\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n        },  \n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
