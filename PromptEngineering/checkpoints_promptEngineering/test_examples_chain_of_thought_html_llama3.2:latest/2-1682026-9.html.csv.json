Since there are only 2 companies that are based in the Netherlands, which is less than half of the total number of companies, we can conclude that the claim \"half of the company be base in the netherlands\" is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First count the total number of companies (10). Then focus on the Netherlands row to check if two companies are based there. Next, count the number of non-Netherlands-based companies (8). Since half of 10 would be 5 and we only have 2 companies in Netherlands, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}",
