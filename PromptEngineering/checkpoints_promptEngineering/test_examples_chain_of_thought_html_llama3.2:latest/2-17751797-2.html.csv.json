These represent actual games where the result was determined in the replay match rather than an initial draw.\n\n3. **Count how many of those replay games were won by the home team**:\n   Looking at the \"replay\" columns again, we see:\n\n   - In 5 out of these 5 matches (row 9, row 13, row 15, row 17, and row 19), the home team won.\n   \n   Therefore, all 5 replay games were won by the home team.\n\n4. **Determine if this is a majority**:\n   A majority would imply that more than half of the total number of matches in the table are replay games won by the home team. Since there are only two columns with information on replay matches and both have an equal amount of data (5 rows each), we can simply divide 5 by the total number of these matches, which is also 5.\n\n   5/5 = 1\n\nSince this equals 1, not more than half, it does indeed represent a majority.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells for reference**:\n   - For the original claim: \"the majority of replay game be win by the home team\"\n     Relevant cells are in row 9 to row 19 (inclusive) of both the \"replay\" columns.\n   \n   - The total number of matches we need to compare is all 20 rows since we have no other information about the non-replay games.\n\n   Here's what these relevant cells look like:\n   ```\n[\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n6. **Determine the final answer**:\n   Given that we've established all 5 of these replay games were won by the home team, and since this represents more than half (half being 1/2 = 10 total matches out of 20), it is indeed a majority.\n\n7. **Output the final answer in JSON format**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First identified the definition of a replay game as a match that was initially drawn but had to be replayed, then counted how many of these were won by the home team, determined if this represented a majority based on total matches (all non-replay games), and finally identified relevant cells for reference.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"replay\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"7 team score zero point\" is TRUE or FALSE, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Locate the relevant row in the table that corresponds to the 7th tie.\n\nThe table has a header row with the column names, and the second row below it contains the data for the first match. The \"tie no\" column increments by one for each subsequent match, so I can see that the 7th tie is located at row index 7.\n\nStep 2: Identify the score of the 7th team in the table.\n\nIn this case, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Column \"home team\": Shrewsbury Town\n- Column \"score\": 1 - 0\n\nThis indicates that Shrewsbury Town scored zero points against their opponent.\n\n\nStep 3: Check if the score is indeed zero.\n\nThe score is explicitly stated as \"1 - 0\", which means Shrewsbury Town scored one point, not zero. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\", \"value\": \"Shrewsbury Town\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\", \"value\": \"1 - 0\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
