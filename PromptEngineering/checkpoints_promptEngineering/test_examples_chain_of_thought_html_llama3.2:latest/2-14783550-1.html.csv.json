Since both countries have only one gold medal each, we need to look at other categories.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>7</td>\n  <td>philippines (phi)</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td>14</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>18</td>\n  <td>macau (mac)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nStep 3: Since the Philippines won one gold medal and Macau did not win any gold medals, we need to look at silver medals.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>7</td>\n  <td>philippines (phi)</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td>14</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>18</td>\n  <td>macau (mac)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nStep 4: Compare the number of silver medals won by Philippines and Macau. Since both countries have only zero silver medals, we need to look at other categories.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>7</td>\n  <td>philippines (phi)</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td>14</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>18</td>\n  <td>macau (mac)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nStep 5: Since both countries have only zero silver medals, we need to look at bronze medals.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>7</td>\n  <td>philippines (phi)</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td>14</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>18</td>\n  <td>macau (mac)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nStep 6: Compare the number of bronze medals won by Philippines and Macau. Since the Philippines won one bronze medal and Macau won five bronze medals, this is not an equality.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n  <td>7</td>\n  <td>philippines (phi)</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td>14</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>18</td>\n  <td>macau (mac)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nSince the Philippines did not win four more bronze medals than Macau, this is a FALSE statement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract relevant data from table to compare number of gold medals won by Philippines and Macau\",\n      \"data\": [\n        \"<tr><td>7</td><td>philippines (phi)</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>14</td></tr>\",\n        \"<tr><td>18</td><td>macau (mac)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare number of gold medals won by Philippines and Macau\",\n      \"data\": [\n        \"<tr><td>7</td><td>philippines (phi)</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>14</td></tr>\",\n        \"<tr><td>18</td><td>macau (mac)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare number of silver medals won by Philippines and Macau\",\n      \"data\": [\n        \"<tr><td>7</td><td>philippines (phi)</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>14</td></tr>\",\n        \"<tr><td>18</td><td>macau (mac)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare number of bronze medals won by Philippines and Macau\",\n      \"data\": [\n        \"<tr><td>7</td><td>philippines (phi)</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>14</td></tr>\",\n        \"<tr><td>18</td><td>macau (mac)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
