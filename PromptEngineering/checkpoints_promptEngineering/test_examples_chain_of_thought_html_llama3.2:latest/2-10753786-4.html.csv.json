    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. To determine whether Greg Norman spent more than 3 times as many weeks at number 1 than Nick Faldo, we need to first count the number of weeks each player spent at number 1.\n\n2. Let's start by counting the weeks for Greg Norman. According to the table, Greg Norman spent a total of 331 weeks at number 1 (in row 2).\n\n3. Now, let's count the weeks for Nick Faldo. According to the table, Nick Faldo spent a total of 97 weeks at number 1 (in row 3).\n\n4. Next, we need to calculate how many times more weeks Greg Norman spent at number 1 compared to Nick Faldo. To do this, we divide the number of weeks Greg Norman spent at number 1 by the number of weeks Nick Faldo spent at number 1: 331 / 97 = 3.418.\n\n5. Since the claim states that Greg Norman spent more than 3 times as many weeks at number 1 than Nick Faldo, we need to check if our calculated value is indeed greater than 3. However, 3.418 is indeed greater than 3, so the initial assessment seems correct.\n\n6. Therefore, our final answer is TRUE.",
