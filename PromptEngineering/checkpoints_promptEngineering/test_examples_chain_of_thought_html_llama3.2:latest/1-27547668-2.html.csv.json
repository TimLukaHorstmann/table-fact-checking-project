These represent the episodes with 5 viewers.\n   - There is only one such row: <td>6</td><td>the one who knew too little</td><td>larry mclean</td><td>jesse mckeown</td><td>1012000</td><td>february 10 , 2010</td><td>106</td>.\n\n3. **Count the total number of episodes aired in March**:\n   - Next, we need to check how many episodes were aired in March.\n   - The row for \"he sleeps with the chips\" indicates that it was aired on March 17, which is within March.\n\n4.  **Compare the count of episodes with viewers equal to 5 and the total number of episodes aired in March**:\n    - From step 3, we know there are at least two episodes aired in March.\n    - The row for \"the one who knew too little\" states that it was aired on February 10. However, since the claim is about March, this does not meet our criteria.\n    - Looking at other rows with viewers equal to 5 (<td>6</td><td>the one who knew too little</td>,<td>7</td><td>the woman who knew too little</td>, and <td>10</td><td>the pen is mightier than the doyle</td>) does not provide any clear evidence that March had more episodes with 5 viewers compared to other months.\n    - The row for \"he sleeps with the chips\" indicates that it was aired on March 17. Looking at the production code, we see that there are two more rows for March: <td>8</td><td>the tell - tale safe</td>, which is dated March 10; and <td>9</td><td>he sleeps with the chips</td>, which was dated on March 17.\n    - There's no information in this table to determine if there were more episodes with viewers equal to 5, aired in March, compared to other months.\n\nHowever, we can look at the total number of episodes for each month. Looking through each row's \"original airdate\", we notice that January and February have fewer than three rows (rows <td>1</td>,<td>2</td>, and <td>3</td>) respectively compared to March which has four rows (<td>7</td>,<td>8</td>,<td>9</td>, and <td>10</td>).

We need to examine these columns to determine if any director directs more than one episode.\n\nStep 2: Identify all unique directors in the table.\nLooking at the table, we can see that there are several directors listed under both \"directed by\" and \"written by\" columns. However, for our purposes, we only care about directors who have directed an episode.\n\nRelevant cells:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 8,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 9,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 10,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 11,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n}\n\nStep 3: Count the number of unique directors who have directed at least one episode.\nLooking at the table, we can see that each director has only directed one episode.\n\nRelevant cells:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 8,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 9,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 10,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 11,\n  \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n}\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that there is no director who has directed more than one episode.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Observed table structure and identified relevant columns for directors. Counted unique directors who have directed at least one episode, finding all to be single-episode directors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we will compare the number of episodes directed by Mike Clattenburg (column \"directed by\") with the number of episodes directed by Steve Scaini (column \"directed by\").\n\n3. We need to count the total number of episodes for each director and check if Steve Scaini directed more episodes than Mike Clattenburg.\n\n4. After that, we will identify the relevant cells in the table that contain this information.\n\n5. Finally, we can determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on our analysis.\n\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"viewers\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Compare the number of episodes directed by Mike Clattenburg (column 'directed by') with the number of episodes directed by Steve Scaini (column 'directed by').
