First, we need to determine how the nominees are counted for Gillian Anderson.\n   - In order to do that, we'll look at the \"recipients and nominees\" column which contains either a single name or a list of names separated by commas (e.g., 'david duchovny'). When there's only one name, it represents a nomination. However, when there are multiple names in this cell, it indicates that the given person was nominated for more than one award within that year.\n\n2. Next, we will look at each category where Gillian Anderson is listed as a \"nominee\". We'll check if she appears alone in the \"recipients and nominees\" column or if she's part of a list with multiple names.\n   - For instance, in the case of 'david duchovny', it indicates that he was nominated for 2 awards.\n\n3. After identifying how nominations are counted, we can then look at each year where Gillian Anderson appears as a nominee and count her appearances by herself versus alongside others.\n   - If she's only appearing alone (i.e., no one else is listed next to her in the \"recipients and nominees\" column), this implies that she was nominated for 1 award per year.\n\n4. Now, with the understanding of how nominations are counted, we'll proceed to check each category for Gillian Anderson.\n   - Starting from 'best actor in leading role - drama series', we will see if the given \"nominee\" is actually another person (meaning multiple nominations) or a single name indicating one nomination.\n\n5. After reviewing each year and category where Gillian Anderson appears as a nominee, we can calculate how many times she was nominated.\n   - If the number of times she appears alone in 'recipients and nominees' column matches the count from our initial analysis (1 nomination per year), we'll determine her total nominations.\n\n6. Given that we now have an understanding of the counting mechanism for Gillian Anderson's nominations, we can make a final determination.\n   - We compare the total number of times she appears as a nominee to 3 and conclude if the claim is true or false.\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine whether the claim 'gillian anderson be nominate 3 time' is TRUE or FALSE, we'll first analyze how nominations are counted for Gillian Anderson.

If such consecutive nominations are found, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n5. Now, let's analyze the table step by step:\n\n    * For 1998: The X-File was not nominated (it's 'nominated'), so we can stop here and conclude that this year does not satisfy our condition.\n    \n    * Moving up to 1997: David Duchovny was nominated for Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series, but the same cannot be said of the other relevant cells. However, it is true that \"best series - drama\" category won.\n\n        The X-File won this category for the first time in 1996 and then again in 1997 but only as a separate entry (\"best series-drama\" category), so we can't confirm consecutive nominations here either.\n    \n    * For 1996: This is where it gets interesting. In that year, The X-File was nominated for Best Series - Drama (won). Then, the same was done again in 1997 as mentioned earlier.\n\n        However, since the category's winner changed each time from \"drama\" series to \"drama,\" we can conclude this doesn't constitute two consecutive nominations. In fact, it did not have one of its wins as a separate entry (\"best actor-drama\") but as \"best series - drama.\" This seems counterintuitive at first glance because the actual claim is about having been nominated for Best Series - Drama three times in a row.\n\n        However, The X-File only won this award twice. It appears there's an error in how this data was initially written or interpreted.\n\n    * For 1995: David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were both nominated but did not win the category; therefore, they don't count towards the claim.\n\n    Since we found a false condition (a non-consecutive nomination), the entire chain of three consecutive nominations for The X-File in Best Series - Drama does not meet. Hence, \"the x-file be nominate for best series - drama for 3 year in a row\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After analyzing each relevant cell in the table from bottom to top, we found that there was no instance of consecutive nominations (won/lost) within three years (1996-1998).

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the years for which David Duchovny was nominated for Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series.\n2. We can do this by looking at the \"recipients and nominees\" column for the years when David Duchovny is listed as a nominee (1995, 1997, and 1998).\n3. Next, we need to determine how often he was nominated every other year.\n4. Since there are three instances where he was nominated in consecutive years (1995-1996 and 1997), it seems that David Duchovny was not nominated every other year as claimed.\n5. However, looking at the data more closely, we can see that the claim is actually incorrect because David Duchovny was nominated for Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series in three consecutive years (1995-1996 and 1997), but he wasn't nominated every other year. He only wasn't nominated in 1998 which isn't exactly \"every other year\" from the two that were consecutively, since one of those was already mentioned.\n6. Finally, we can determine whether David Duchovny being nominated for Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series every other year is true or false.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First identified years when David Duchovny was nominated (1995, 1997, and 1998).
