    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the column to compare for goal scoring\nTo determine if Guadalajara does not score the highest number of goals in the 1st leg, we need to identify which team scores the most goals in the 1st leg.\n\n#### Step 2: Compare each row's 1st leg result\nWe will examine each row in the table to see which teams scored the highest goal count in their respective 1st legs.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify relevant cells\nFor this comparison, we need to look at columns \"team 2\" and \"1st leg\". Specifically, we want to compare the team that played against Guadalajara (\"guadalajara\") with other teams' scores in their 1st leg results.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze each row for relevant information\n- For the first row, hotels international fc did not play guadalajara. So, this data point is irrelevant to our comparison.\n- For the second row, Chicago Croatan played Olimpia in the 1st leg, but we are interested in Guadalajara's score.\n- For the third row, Deportivo Suchitepquez played \u00c1guila, again not relevant for our purposes.\n- For the fourth row, Vida played Fas, irrelevant to Guadalajara.\n- For the fifth row, Am\u00e9rica played Guadalajara. This data point is relevant because it directly involves us.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if Guadalajara scored the highest number of goals\nAccording to the table in the \"1st leg\" column, Am\u00e9rica scored 3 goals against Guadalajara, which seems high at first glance but let's look further into the comparison with all relevant data points from the rest of the table.\n\n#### Step 6: Compare Am\u00e9rica's score to others for highest 1st leg\nUpon reviewing other matches not involving Guadalajara in their \"1st leg\" column:\n- The only two scores directly comparable involve Guadalajara and another team that also plays them. We need a total 1st leg score comparison.\n- Among these comparisons, if any score higher than Am\u00e9rica's 3 goals in the 1st leg against Guadalajara, then our statement is false; otherwise, it remains true.\n\n#### Step 7: Compile relevant data points\nFrom step 6, we need data on all teams' \"agg\" scores for 1st legs and compare them to Am\u00e9rica's:\n- Hotels International FC vs. Aurora - no direct comparison needed since they didn't play in the 1st leg.\n- Chicago Croatan vs. Olimpia - Score is given as 0-4 but needs total score (4) compared against Guadalajara's 3 goals for highest.\n- Deportivo Suchitepquez vs. \u00c1guila - no direct comparison needed since they didn't play in the 1st leg.\n- Vida vs. Fas - no direct comparison needed since they didn't play in the 1st leg.\n- Am\u00e9rica vs. Guadalajara - already known as 3 goals for Am\u00e9rica.\n\n#### Step 8: Determine relevance and value of data\nOnly Chicago Croatan's 0-4 score counts because it directly involves Guadalajara (Guadalajara is team 2 in the table) with a higher score than Guadalajara's 3 goals in the 1st leg, which would mean Guadalajara did not have the highest number of goals scored.\n\n#### Step 9: Conclusion\nGiven Am\u00e9rica's 3 goals against Guadalajara and Chicago Croatan having a significantly higher total (4) for their \"agg\" score from the first leg, this contradicts our initial assessment.

This means that Guadalajara scored 3 goals in the 1st leg of their match against America.\n\n4. **Find other rows where Guadalajara played against teams with higher scores in the '1st leg'**: We need to look for any row where `team 2` = `guadalajara` and compare this score to the score in the `1st leg` column of the same row.\n\n5. **Compare scores for each relevant match**: Looking at the rows with `team 2` = `guadalajara`, we can see that there is another row where Guadalajara played against FAS, and in this case, the score was `1 - 1`. The other match we care about is between Chicago Croatan and Olimpia. The score for this game's first leg was `0 - 4`.\n\n6. **Determine if Guadalajara scored the highest number of goals in the '1st leg'**: Comparing the scores, we can see that Guadalajara did not have a higher score than Chicago Croatan's 0-4 score.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since Guadalajara did not have a higher score than other teams (Chicago Croatan and FAS) in their '1st leg' matches, the claim is False.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the column containing the scores, find the row where Guadalajara played against America, extract the score from the \\u20191st leg\\u2019 column for the Guadalajara vs America match, find other rows where Guadalajara played against teams with higher scores in the \\u20191st leg\\\u2019, compare scores for each relevant match and determine if Guadalajara scored the highest number of goals in the \\u20191st leg\u2019.
