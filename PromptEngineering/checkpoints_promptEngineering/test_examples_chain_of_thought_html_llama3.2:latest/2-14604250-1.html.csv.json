Look up the first game played by the Washington Redskins against the New York Jets in 2003.\n   - The table shows the date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance, for each week of the season. Since we know that the Redskins play the Jets before they play the Cowboys, we can try to find this information from the data.\n\n2. Search for the index where the week and opponent match.\n   - We look at every row in the table until we find a match between the \"week\" column and the date in September 2003, and the \"opponent\" is the New York Jets. The relevant cell for this step is:\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     }\n\n3. Once found, verify that the team played the Washington Redskins.\n   - Since we know the opponent was the New York Jets, check to see if they were playing the Washington Redskins. If they were not, then the claim is false.\n\n4. Look up the index where the week and date match for after finding a game between the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys in 2003.\n   - The table shows all games played by the team in 2003. Now that we have confirmed the first game was against New York Jets, let's look at the subsequent game to see if they played the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n5. Search for a match with week of 2, and date from December or January 2003.\n   - The table shows all games after the first one in September 2003. We should find an entry where the \"week\" column is 2 (the second week), and check if there's any match in that row for either a Dallas Cowboys game in December, given that we already know they played New York Jets earlier.\n\n6. Verify that the team played against the Washington Redskins after playing New York Jets.\n   - We need to confirm that the entry is the one we are looking for because this will be our final step to validate if the claim was correct or not.\n\n7. After finding all relevant cell indices, verify and output a JSON answer:\n   - Use these indices in your answer where you state that the column is named \"column_name\" and use row_index instead of actual data value.\n\nHere are the steps translated into a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Look for a match between the week and date in September 2003, and opponent New York Jets.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. First, let's count the number of away games played by Washington Redskins in 2003.\n2. To do this, we need to identify all rows where the opponent is not the home team (Washington Redskins).\n3. We can see that there are teams like Atlanta Falcons, New York Giants, New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, and New Orleans Saints that played against Washington Redskins.\n4. Next, let's check the game site for each of these opponents to confirm if they are indeed away games.\n5. Looking at row 2, we can see that the opponent is Atlanta Falcons and the game was played at Georgia Dome (away from Fedex Field). This counts as an away game.\n6. Similarly, in rows 3-17, we can find other away games where teams like New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, and New Orleans Saints played against Washington Redskins. These are all confirmed to be away games.\n7. Now that we have identified 14 away games played by Washington Redskins in 2003, let's count the total number of away games (as stated in the claim).\n8. According to the table, Washington Redskins played a total of 16 home games and 17 away games is not stated but only \"8\" games are mentioned.\n9.

This will give us a list of rows that we need to check: \n    - row_index=15\n    - row_index=17\n3. Check if the attendance for the Redskins' game on December 14, 2003, against the Cowboys is higher than any other attendance in the same row (row index = 15). We can do this by comparing it with the values in cells:\n    - Attendance (column) at row_index=15 and column name = attendance\n    - Attendance (column) at row_index=17 and column name = attendance\n4. Find the attendance for the Redskins' game on December 14, 2003, against the Cowboys by looking at cell with row index 15 and column name \"attendance\": 70284.0.\n5. Check if there are any other games on December 27, 2003, against a Cowboys opponent by finding rows where:\n    - opponent equals 'cowboys'\n    - date does not equal to 'december 14 , 2003'\n6. Find the attendance for that game (step 5) and compare it with 70284.0 from step 4\n7. Compare with other attendance on December 27, 2003:\n   - row_index=17 \n    - Attendance column value = 76766\n\n8. If the Redskins' attendance of December 14 is higher than both the Cowboys' games at those dates, then it must be the highest for that date.\n\n9. Check if 70284 ( Redskins ) > 76766 (cowboys) :\n     Since 70284 < 76766\n10. The highest attendance for the Redskins in 2003 on December 14 against a cowboy is not true",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the number of games played by the Redskins in 2003\nTo determine if the claim about playing 18 games in 2003 is true, we need to first find out how many games were actually played by the Redskins that season.\n\n#### Step 2: Count the rows in the table\nCounting each row in the table represents counting the number of games. The last row indicates a missing value for attendance (NaN), which can be ignored for this count since it's not relevant to the actual game count.\n\n\n```markdown\nThere are 17 rows.\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Validate claim based on the count\nSince there are indeed 17 rows, and we're counting each row as an individual game, we must determine if the number of games aligns with \"the redskin play 18 game in 2003\". In this case, the Redskins did not exactly fit the claimed amount of games but were close, considering they played only one less than that. However, since there's no other indication of them playing 18 games and we're strictly looking for a number to match \"18\", the presence of only 17 games should lead us towards our final conclusion.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven that the Redskins played 17 games in 2003, this does not directly align with the claim of \"18 game\" but it is close. However, strictly speaking, based on the information provided and considering we are looking for an exact number matching \"18\", our answer should be negative.\n\n#### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The Redskins played 17 games in 2003, which does not exactly match the claim of playing 18 games, but is very close. The exact wording 'play 18 game' implies an exact count of 18, making this claim false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": -1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
