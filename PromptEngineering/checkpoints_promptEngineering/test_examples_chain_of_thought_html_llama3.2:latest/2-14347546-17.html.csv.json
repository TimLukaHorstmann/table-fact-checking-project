Row_index = 7 also mentions a QMJHL team in \"victoriaville tigres (qmjhl)\".\n\n2. Analyze the column for 'college / junior / club team (league)' of these rows to see which teams are from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.\n   - For row_index = 4, it mentions \"chicoutimi saguen\u00e9ens ( qmjhl )\" and \"mechel chelyabinsk (rus)\".\n   - For row_index = 7, it explicitly states \"victoriaville tigres (qmjhl)\".\n\n3. Check the number of rows with QMJHL teams to confirm if indeed '2' players come from this league based on our analysis in step 1 and further validation in step 2.\n   - There are two rows with \"qmjhl\" mentioned, which aligns with our initial claim about two selections coming from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.\n\n4. Review that no other row_index has a match for '2' in the 'round' column that could indicate another selection coming from the QMJHL.\n   - All other rows have different values or do not match the criteria set by having a \"2\" in the round and also being from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.\n\n5. Conclude based on step 3 and the fact that no additional row_index fits our conditions perfectly alongside row_index = 4, if indeed two players selected come from the QMJHL.\n   - Since we have identified only one other instance (row_index=7) in addition to the first row_index=4 which supports having at least two selections from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League but no additional matches beyond these two for '2' being part of the round column, our analysis indicates that indeed '2' players selected are likely both from this league.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Listed relevant cells in step 1 and 2 to identify rows with round = 4 or row_index = 7.
