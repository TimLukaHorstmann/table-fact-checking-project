Find the relevant information for this row: In the table, this row can be found in the 5th column (venue) and the last column (date).\n\n3. Check if there's a draw mentioned: The claim says Victoria Park draws the largest crowd, but the actual score at Victoria Park is given as \"10.15 (75)\". A draw would imply an equal score.\n\n4. Look for evidence of a draw by comparing scores in different rows: Compare this row with other rows where the same team plays against another team to see if there's any indication of a draw.\n\n5. Analyze the other teams playing at Victoria Park on that day: In the provided table, Collingwood and Richmond both played their home games at Victoria Park that day, but they had different scores (80-107), indicating no draw between these two teams. \n\n6. Conclusion based on reasoning: If neither of the opposing teams at Victoria Park have a score that matches this row's score or if one of them had a lower attendance while playing at their \"home\", it will indicate there was a draw.\n\n7. Determine if the claim is true or false: Since Collingwood (80) and Richmond (107), both teams with higher attendance, didn't end in a draw, then we can conclude the claim that Victoria Park draws the largest crowd of any game is FALSE.\n\n8.

First, we need to verify if Essendon played at home (Windy Hill) against North Melbourne.\n\n   - The relevant cells for this are:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>essendon</td>\n       <td>14.14 (98)</td>\n       <td>north melbourne</td>\n       <td>16.12 (108)</td>\n       <td>windy hill</td>\n       ...\n     </tr>\n     ```\n   - Since Essendon played at home against North Melbourne, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n2. Next, we need to verify if Hawthorn played away from their home ground (VFL Park).\n\n   - The relevant cells for this are:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>hawthorn</td>\n       <td>16.12 (108)</td>\n       <td>st kilda</td>\n       <td>11.9 (75)</td>\n       <td>vfl park</td>\n       ...\n     </tr>\n     ```\n   - Since Hawthorn played at their home ground VFL Park, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. Since one part of the claim (Essendon playing away from home) is TRUE and another part (Hawthorn playing away from home) is FALSE, we can conclude that the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
