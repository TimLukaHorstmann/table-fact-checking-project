The table shows that Chris Amon held pole position for one race in the Belgian Grand Prix.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"pole position\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Locate the French Grand Prix\nWe also need to find the row in the table corresponding to the French Grand Prix (ROUEN - LES - ESSARTS). This will allow us to check if Chris Amon held pole position for one race.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"race\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Check Pole Position Holder in French Grand Prix\nThen, we verify the pole position holder in the French Grand Prix.
