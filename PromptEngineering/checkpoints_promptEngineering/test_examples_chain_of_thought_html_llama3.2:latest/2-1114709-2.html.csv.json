Since Sasol Jordan only has one race, it is clear that this team has the least amount of races.\n\n5. We should verify if there are any other teams with less than 1 race, which doesn't make sense in this context since we're dealing with whole numbers (races).

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of races that took place in 1984.\n   We can do this by counting the rows where the year is 1984.\n\n2. From the table, we see that there are 3 rows where the year is 1984:\n   - Row 2: 1984, Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW, Arrows A6, Cosworth V8, 5\n   - Row 3: 1984, Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW, Arrows A7, BMW Straight - 4 ( T/C ), 5\n   - Row 11: 1986 is in another row so we exclude this.\n\n   However the table only have two races in 1984. This will be our starting point.\n\n3. Now, let's count the number of races that took place in 1983.\n   We can do this by counting the rows where the year is 1983:\n   - Row 1: 1983, Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A6, Cosworth V8, 0\n\n4. From the table, we see that there is only 1 row where the year is 1983.\n\n5. Now we can compare our results from steps 2 and 4:\n   - In 1984, there were 2 races.\n   - In 1983, there was 1 race.\n   \n6. Since there are indeed 2 races in 1984 and only 1 race in 1983, the claim is true.\n\n7. Now that we know our starting point for how many races took place in 1984 and have verified this, let's determine what relevant cells would be:\n\n   ```\n   [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"\"\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n8.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column for race points: The claim mentions \"race that happen in any year be 2\", which implies that we need to find the year with the most races, but also consider if there's a possibility of having only one race in some years.\n\n   Looking at the table, we see that each row represents a different team and their corresponding car for a given year. So, we can assume that each value in the points column corresponds to the number of races won by that team in that particular year.\n\n2. Determine the relevant cells: To verify if there is indeed a year with 2 races, we need to look at the \"points\" column and check every row for any instance where the value could be interpreted as indicating multiple races (e.g., two instances of a number being greater than zero in a single year).\n\n   We will also need to consider the team names to ensure that we are not mistakenly counting multiple races by a single team.\n\n3. Analyze each relevant cell:\n- Looking at row 4 for 1985, \"barclay arrows bmw\" won 11 points which indicates they had one race in 1985.\n- Looking at rows 6 and 7 for 1986, the same team \"barclay arrows bmw\" won 0 points. Since this team also had a single race that year (implied by the non-zero value of 11), we can confirm that indeed there was only one race in 1985.\n- The claim about 2 races happening on 4 occasions must be investigated for all other years to see if any other year had two instances.\n\n   After analyzing other rows, it seems that \"barclay arrows bmw\" won more than one race but does not show multiple races in the same year. For instance, in row 5 of 1985, there's another value of 11 but for a different team (\"arrows racing team\"). Thus we find two teams with 2 race wins.\n\n4. Determine if there are any other instances: After careful examination, it appears that no other year has more than one race win from the same team.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each row in the points column to verify if there is indeed a year with two races.
