Next, we need to check if Tom Zirbel was the general classification for 5 times according to the table.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all instances where Bissell is mentioned as the team classification across different stages.\n   - We can find this information by checking the values of cells with column name \"team classification\" for each row in the table.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if Mike Northey was indeed only classified under the youth category once throughout the entire race.\n   - We will examine the column names \"youth classification\" and confirm that his name appears exactly one time within it.\n\n3. To determine the truth of the claim, we must compare our findings from steps 1 and 2 to see if they match the description provided in the claim.\n\n4. Now let's analyze each stage separately:\n\n   - For Stage 1: Bissell is indeed classified as \"team classification\", but Mike Northey appears under \"youth classification\" (FALSE, since he does not appear at all).\n   \n   - For Stage 2: Same issue with Mike Northey, and again, Bissell is correctly classified (TRUE).\n   \n   - For Stage 3: Again Mike Northey does not appear under the youth category but we do see that Bissell is still correctly represented as team classification (TRUE).\n   \n   - For stage 4: Still an issue with Mike Northey under youth classification, and again, Bissell gets team classification right (TRUE).\n   \n   - For Stage 5: The only reason we have to check here is because Bissell was already known to be the team classification. We can confirm it as True since Mike appears in \"youth classification\" (FALSE).\n   \n   - For stage 6: This time Mike Northey does appear once under youth classification, so our claim of one appearance being false turns into true this time.\n\n5. From these observations, we find that for every stage of the race, Bissell was indeed correctly classified as the team classification and Mike appeared in \"youth classification\" only one time.\n\n6. Now let's compile our findings into a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"youth classification\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"youth classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"youth classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal answer in JSON format: \n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"youth classification\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"youth classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"youth classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team classification\"}\n  ]\n}",

And checking his point classification at stage 1, we see it says 'thomas soladay' instead of Tom Zirbel:\n     ```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n}\n```\n   There is another row with 'tom zirbel'.\n\n5. Finally, checking his point classification at stage 4, we see it says 'thomas soladay' instead of Tom Zirbel:\n     ```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n}\n```\n   And there is another row with 'tom zirbel'.\n\n6. Now combining all steps we can conclude whether the claim is true or not.\n\nHere's my final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the stage number for Kenneth Hanson**: First, we need to identify which stage of the race Kenneth Hanson was involved in. According to the table, Kenneth Hanson's first appearance as the mountains classification is on stage 3.\n\n2. **Find the row corresponding to Lucas Sebastian Haedo and Kenneth Hanson**: Since the claim mentions that Lucas Sebastian Haedo's third stage as the winner should be when Kenneth Hanson's third stage as the mountain classification occurs, we need to find the rows in the table where both Lucas Sebastian Haedo is the winner and Kenneth Hanson is in the mountains classification.\n\n3. **Analyze row 3**: On this row, Kenneth Hanson is indeed listed as the mountain classification for stage 3. However, Lucas Sebastian Haedo's stage is not mentioned here; he has a different winner on another stage.\n\n4. **Analyze row 4**: On this row, Kenneth Hanson appears again as the mountains classification but also as a different classification in other rows (points and youth). This doesn't match our condition because we are looking for his third appearance as mountain classification.\n\n5. **Verify that Kenneth Hanson only has one more instance after stage 3** : By inspection of subsequent rows where Kenneth Hanson is mentioned as the mountains classification, it's evident he appears in row 6 (where he's not the winner), which doesn't fit our criteria.\n\n6. **Check for any other appearances**: We find that on stage 4, he also appears in mountain classification but we are looking for his third appearance.\n\n\n7. Since Kenneth Hanson does appear as mountain classification for more than one stage and only once at stage 3, the claim is false.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First identified the stage number for Kenneth Hanson (stage 3). Then found that Lucas Sebastian Haedo was the winner on stage 4. We verified that our claim would be false since there's no third stage for Kenneth Hanson being mountain classification for another race, but he appears at least twice with other classifications after stage 3. The chain of logic only works if there is at least one instance where both conditions are met: Lucas Sebastian Haedo as winner and Kenneth Hanson as mountain classifier on the same race. There isn't that case here, hence no true result.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"}\n  ]\n}",
