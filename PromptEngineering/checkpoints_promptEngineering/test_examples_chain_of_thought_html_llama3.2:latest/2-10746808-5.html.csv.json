This means we need to find the row with the smallest crowd value (less than or equal to 10000) and the row with the largest crowd value (greater than or equal to 28628).\n\n2. Next, let's look at the table in HTML format. We see that there are several rows with different values for \"crowd\". To determine if the claim is true, we need to compare these values.\n\n3. Looking at the first row, we see that the crowd value is 28628. This is greater than 28628, so it does not meet the condition of being the largest crowd size.\n\n4. Now let's move on to find the smallest crowd size. To do this, we need to look for rows with a crowd value less than or equal to 10000.\n\n5. In row 3, the crowd value is 15000 which is more than 10000 so it does not meet our requirement of being smaller.\n\n6. However, let's continue checking each row until we find one that meets this condition.\n\n7. After examining all rows in the table, I can see from row 2 that \"crowd\" contains value \"20000\" and also from row 4 that \"crowd\" contains value \"10000\".\n\n8. Since we have found both a crowd size less than or equal to 10000 (row 4) and a crowd size greater than or equal to 28628 does not exist as there is no bigger value in the table, therefore the claim cannot be entirely true.\n\n9.

Now, let's count the number of scores that are less than 40 points from the table.\n\n```python\n# initialize counters and list to store scores\nscores = []\n\n# iterate through rows in the table\nfor i in range(0,10):\n    for j in range(4,8):\n        row_value = data.iloc[i][j]\n        \n        # check if value is a string (contains ')'\n        if isinstance(row_value, str):\n            start_index = row_value.find(\"(\")\n            \n            # if it's an integer\n            try:\n                value = int(row_value[start_index+1:-1])\n                \n                scores.append(value)\n                \n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(f'Error: {e}')\n                    \n        else:\n            try:\n                value = float(row_value)\n\n                if value < 40:\n                    scores.append(value)\n\n                # Add score to list\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(f'Error: {e}')\n\n# count the number of less than 40 points scores in table\ncount = len(scores)\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (Continued)\n\n8.
