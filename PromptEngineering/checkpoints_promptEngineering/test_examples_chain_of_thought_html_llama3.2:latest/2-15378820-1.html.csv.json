Let's start by calculating the margin of victory for each game. We can do this by subtracting the opponent's score from our team's score.\n\n3. For example, in the first game (week 1), the margin of victory is 34 - 13 = 21 points.\n\n4. Now, let's calculate the margins of victory for all games:\n\t* Week 2: 30 - 24 = 6 points\n\t* Week 3: 30 - 13 = 17 points\n\t* Week 4: 24 - 7 = 17 points\n\t* Week 5: 26 - 24 (loss, so negative margin) = -2 points\n\t* Week 6: 38 - 24 = 14 points\n\t* Week 7: 44 - 7 = 37 points\n\t* Week 8: 42 - 31 = 11 points\n\t* Week 9: 31 - 14 = 17 points\n\t* Week 10: 20 - 13 = 7 points\n\t* Week 11: 20 - 7 = 13 points\n\t* Week 12: 27 - 24 = 3 points\n\t* Week 13: 22 - 21 = 1 point\n\t* Week 14: 40 - 17 (loss, so negative margin) = -23 points\n\t* Week 15: 21 - 14 = 7 points\n\t* Week 16: 26 - 17 = 9 points\n\n5. Now that we have the margins of victory for all games, let's find the greatest margin.\n\n6.

The claim states that the worst loss is by 23 points, which means we need to find the largest difference between the score of the home team (opponent) and the score of the visiting team.\n2. We can start by looking at the table for losses, which are denoted by 'l'. We will focus on the row with the smallest attendance value in these losses.\n3. In the given table, we find that the row with a loss has an attendance of 48556 (row index 14) and a score difference of 23 points between the home team's score and visiting team's score.\n4. We check if this match for our condition for worst loss.\n5. If it does not, then continue to search through other rows in the table that are losses.\n6.

In this case, the attendance for the Chiefs is listed as 45161.\n\n5. **Determine if the claim is true or false**: The smallest crowd recorded for the Raiders (Game 6) was indeed 44826, which matches the claim.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to find the row where the Charger played a game against Raiders.\n   - Looking at the table, we can see that there are two games between Chargers and Raiders: one won by Chargers with attendance 44826 (at home), and another lost by Chargers with attendance 51982 (away).\n\n2. We are asked about the smallest crowd the Charger plays in front of. \n   - Since the Charger lost the game with 51982 attendance, we know that 51982 is not the smallest.\n\n3. Now, let's check the first row again where Chargers played against Raiders at home.\n   - The attendance was indeed 44826, which we found to be the smallest crowd.\n\n4. Now we can confirm our answer based on steps above.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, find row where Charger played a game against Raiders. Since there are two games, one won and lost by Chargers respectively. Then check attendance of home game. That is 44826 which is the smallest crowd.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Determine what the claim is saying: The claim states that a team had an opening 4-game win streak, followed by a stretch where they won 5 of their next 6 games.\n\n2. Look at the table for the first 4-game win streak: Check if there's a row in the table with a consecutive sequence of wins.\n\n3. Extract the relevant rows from the table that follow the initial 4-game win streak: If the claim is TRUE, there should be only one such stretch after the initial 4-game win streak. Therefore, we need to look for a row where the attendance is not missing and the attendance in the following games doesn't exceed a certain threshold.\n\n4. Calculate the number of wins within the subsequent 6-game stretch: Count how many times the team won in the last six games.\n\n5. Compare the calculated result with the claim's statement: If there are five wins out of six, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n\n#### Chain of Thought:\n```\nStep1: The initial four game win streak would be from week 1 to week 4.\nStep2: From week 5 onwards, we check for a consecutive sequence of wins.\nStep3: Looking at weeks 5-10. There are no missing attendance values and the attendance is not exceeding 60,000 from week 5 to week 10.\n\n```\n\n#### Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"From week 1 to week 4, there were consecutive wins. The following games from week 5 to week 10 had no missing attendance values and the total wins in these six weeks is five.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
