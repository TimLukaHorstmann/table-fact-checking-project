Note that the row with the highest number of US viewers is indeed the one corresponding to \"Skunk'd\", with 5 million viewers.\n\nHowever, according to the prompt, we need to find the episode title with the highest number of US viewers among those mentioned in the table (i.e., those starting with 'S'), which includes titles like \"Skunk'd\" and \"There goes the bride\". \n\n4. Compare the numbers for these two episodes:\n   - For \"Skunk'd\", the number is 5 million.\n   - For \"There goes the bride\", the number is 2.7 million.\n\nSince 5 million is greater than 2.7 million, we can conclude that:\n\n5.
