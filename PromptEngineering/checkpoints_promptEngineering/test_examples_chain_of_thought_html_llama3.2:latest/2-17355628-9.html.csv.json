Look for rows where Russell Westbrook had exactly 10 assists: We need to find rows where Russell Westbrook has exactly 10 assists in order to determine if he led the Oklahoma City Thunder in assists 10 times during this month.\n\n3. Count the number of such rows: Once we have identified all the relevant rows, we can count how many there are. If this count is equal to the number of games played by the team in March 2009, then Russell Westbrook must have led the team in assists that many times.\n\n4. Determine if the count matches the claim: We will compare our count with the claim \"Russell Westbrook lead the Oklahoma City Thunder in assist 10 time during march of 2009\".

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of games played by Oklahoma City Thunder in March 2009.\n2. We can do this by finding the row with \"March 20\" and counting the total number of wins and losses in that month.\n\n2. The relevant cell is: \n{\n  \"row_index\": 69,\n  \"column_name\": \"Date\"\n}\n\n3. After checking, we see that Oklahoma City Thunder played 10 games in March 2009.\n\n4. Next, we need to find the number of times San Antonio Spur defeated Oklahoma City Thunder in March 2009.\n5. We can do this by finding all rows where Oklahoma City Thunder loses and counting how many times San Antonio Spur wins in those games.\n6. The relevant cells are: \n{\n  \"row_index\": 69,\n  \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"\n}, \n{\n  \"row_index\": 73,\n  \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"\n}\n\n7. In both of these rows, the San Antonio Spur is listed as the home team (i.e., they were playing on their own court). This means Oklahoma City Thunder lost.\n8. However, to figure out how many times San Antonio Spur defeated Oklahoma City Thunder, we need to check if in any of those games San Antonio Spur was listed as away team or home team and that game result is \"San Antonio Spur wins\".\n\n9. The relevant cells are: \n{\n  \"row_index\": 69,\n  \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"\n}, \n{\n  \"row_index\": 73,\n  \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"\n}\n\n10. From the above cells, we can see that in games where Oklahoma City Thunder loses (rows 69 and 73), San Antonio Spur was listed as away team.\n11. Now we need to check if San Antonio Spur wins when they are listed as away team.\n\n12. Looking at row 74 of the table, where Oklahoma City Thunder loses again but it is not listed as an \"away\" game for San Antonio Spurs (San Antonio Spurs' home), and looking at rows where San Antonio Spurs were away or home both but games were tied or won by San Antonio Spurs. In that specific case, we need to look at only row 74 since it's the one in which San Antonio Spur loses against Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n13. We see that in row 74 of the table, San Antonio Spur was listed as \"Away Team\" and Oklahoma City Thunder won with a score of 96-95.\n14. Since San Antonio Spurs were not home team when Oklahoma City Thunder won, we can safely say they lost against them on March 31, 2009.\n\n15. Therefore, the total number of times San Antonio Spur defeated Oklahoma City Thunder in March 2009 is 2.\n\n16. To answer the question \"the oklahoma city thunder defeat the san antonio spur 2 time in march of 2009\": no.\n17. Oklahoma City Thunder only lost to San Antonio Spurs twice in that month, but they didn't win as many times.\n\n18.

In the column for \"points scored\", find the row index of the game played by Nick Collison as part of a 6-game winning streak in March.\n3. Check if the score for that specific game is indeed recorded under the name \"Nick Collison\".\n4. If step 3 is true, then check if there are no other players who scored more points than Nick Collison during this same 6-game winning streak.\n5. Verify that all these conditions are met and conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\nAfter analyzing the data in the table, here's the conclusion:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Look for the column where scores are recorded\",\n    \"Find the row index of Nick Collison's game as part of a 6-game winning streak in March\",\n    \"Check if Nick Collison scored more points than other players during this streak\",\n    \"Verify these conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 70,\n      \"column_name\": \"points scored\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 70,\n      \"column_name\": \"Player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
