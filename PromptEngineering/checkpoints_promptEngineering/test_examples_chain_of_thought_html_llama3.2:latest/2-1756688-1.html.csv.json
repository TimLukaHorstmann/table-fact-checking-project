However, there is an additional entry (\"career totals\") that may be related to Ablett, but we'll ignore this for now.\n4. Now, let's examine the best year column (the one with a \"(best)\" notation). We can see that this column is missing values for some of the rows, which suggests that these years might not have been Ablett's best year.\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that Nathan Ablett's best year for points across all his years with Geelong is 2008.\n2. **Locate relevant data**: We need to check the data for points scored by Nathan Ablett in each of his seasons with Geelong, specifically looking at season 2008 and comparing it to other seasons.\n3. **Find data for season 2008**: In the table, we see that there is a row representing season 2008 under the team \"Geelong\". Looking at this row, we notice that some columns are blank (e.g., disposals, kicks), but points are not mentioned in this particular season.\n4. **Consider career totals**: Instead of focusing solely on season 2008, we also need to consider Nathan Ablett's overall performance throughout his career with Geelong. This includes the \"career totals\" row at the bottom of the table.\n5. **Check points scored for 2008 in career totals**: In the \"career totals\" row, we can see that Nathan Ablett has a total of 47 points across all his seasons with Geelong.\n6. **Evaluate performance in other seasons**: To determine if 2008 is indeed his best year, let's quickly glance at his performance in previous and subsequent seasons to ensure it's not surpassed by another season.\n7. **Find data for comparison**: Upon inspection of the table, we find that Nathan Ablett scored a higher number of points (8) in season 2005 compared to 2008 (0). However, there is no direct information on his performance in other seasons (e.g., 2006, 2007, 2011).\n8. **Draw conclusion**: Without explicit data comparing all seasons, we can't definitively say that Nathan Ablett's best year for points was only 2008. His overall career total of 47 points across all his years with Geelong seems respectable but might not necessarily be the highest score he achieved in a single season.\n9. **Final assessment**: Given the table does provide point totals up to 2011, including Nathan Ablett's performance that year (1), it suggests some discrepancy or lack of data supporting 2008 as his absolute best year for points scored.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified claim, located relevant data (season 2008 and career totals), found no specific data on Nathan Ablett's performance in other seasons; therefore, couldn't confirm if 2008 is indeed his absolute best year for points across all years with Geelong.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
