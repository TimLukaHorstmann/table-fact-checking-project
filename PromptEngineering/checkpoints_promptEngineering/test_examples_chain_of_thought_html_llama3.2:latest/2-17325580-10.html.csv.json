Step 2: Relevant table structure examined; score column considered for analysis. Step 3: Determined to analyze specific row data related to each win team's score being under 100 points and then compare that against the total number of games.\\nStep 4: Found only a single instance where the win team\u2019s final score was 99 or less out of eight wins in the table.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. The claim states that the highest number of assist per game be 11, and the lowest be 4, each scored by Darnell Jackson.\n2. To verify this, we need to find the values in the table for \"high assists\" (column 6), \"date\" (column 2), and the player's name \"Darnell Jackson\" (cell contents).\n3. From the given data in the table, the only row with Darnell Jackson's name is cell (5,7) with value \"maurice williams (8)\".\n4. Since this does not match our target value, we cannot verify that Darnell Jackson scored 11 assists per game, which means we can't prove that he scored at all in the table with data given and the required assist score of 11.\n\nNow, let's output a final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After examining the table, it appears that Darnell Jackson does not have an assist value listed in the relevant row. Therefore, we cannot verify if he scored any assists or not with an assist per game of 11. Thus, we can only conclude his lowest assist number, which is 8.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}",
