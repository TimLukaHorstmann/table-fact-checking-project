From the table, we can see that there is only one player with a transfer fee of 3.8 m + 15% of the profit from next sale, which is Papastathopoulos (in cell A10) and also in row 9.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n4. Now, let's look for other players who have the same transfer fee as Papastathopoulos.\n5. We can see that there is no other player with the same transfer fee of 3.8 m + 15% of the profit from next sale in rows 0 to 9.\n\n6. However, we also need to check if there are any players in rows 10 and above who have the same transfer fee as Papastathopoulos.\n7.

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that all but 5 players have their transfer window during the summer of 2008 - 2009.\n2. We need to check which players do not have their transfer window during this period.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that there are two rows where the transfer window is specified as \"winter\":\n   * Row 7: Edson Ratinho (Player) / Mogi Mirim (Club)\n   * Row 11: Yahaya (Player) / Anagennisi Karditsa (Club)\n4. Therefore, these two players do not have their transfer window during the summer of 2008 - 2009.\n5. We need to count how many other players have their transfer window during this period to determine if there are indeed \"all but 5\" players who meet this condition.\n6. By looking at the table again, we can see that all players except Yahaya and Edson Ratinho have their transfer window during the summer of 2008 - 2009.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to check which players do not have their transfer window during the summer of 2008 - 2009. We found two such players: Yahaya and Edson Ratinho. This means that all but these 2 players have their transfer window during this period, making the claim TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Player\"}\n  ]\n}",
