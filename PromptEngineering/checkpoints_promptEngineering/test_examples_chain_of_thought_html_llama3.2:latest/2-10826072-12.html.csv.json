To verify this, we need to first identify the rows with the smallest crowds from the table.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are multiple games played on 19 June 1971, but only one game has a crowd of each team's respective match (carlton vs north melbourne and st kilda vs geelong).\n4. We can ignore the teams who play against each other, as those two crowds will be larger than any crowd from another match.\n5. For the remaining games, we need to find the smallest two crowds among them.\n\n### Finding the Smallest Two Crowds\n\n6. Looking at the relevant rows for these matches:\n   - Carlton: 13300\n   - St Kilda: 14181\n   - Richmond: 24831 (larger than both others)\n   - Hawthorn: 14181 (same as St Kilda's crowd)\n   - Footscray: 21188\n   - Melbourne: 12528\n\n7.

If it is, we will keep this row as a potential candidate for having one of the smallest crowds.\n\n3. **Identify the two smallest crowds**: After finding the candidates, we need to sort them in ascending order to identify the two smallest crowds. The claim asks if these crowds are less than 10000, so we need to confirm that they indeed meet this condition.\n\n4. **Verify the conditions for the smallest crowds**: We need to check the row index and column name for both of the smallest crowd values, as these will be required in our final output.\n\n5. **Check if there are at least two rows meeting this criteria**: If there is only one row with a crowd less than 10000, then the claim cannot be true because we need to find two such crowds.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the findings from steps 3-5, we can conclude whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\n\nHere's how you would determine if the claim is true based on step 4:\n\n\nBased on our analysis in steps 1 and 2:\n* The smallest crowd value is 13300 (row index: 0, column name: \"crowd\")\n* The second smallest crowd value is not less than 10000 because it's actually 12528 (row index: 5, column name: \"crowd\").
