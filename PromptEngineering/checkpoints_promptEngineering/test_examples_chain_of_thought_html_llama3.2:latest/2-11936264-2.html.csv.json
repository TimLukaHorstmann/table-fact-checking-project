To determine if the claim \"Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense win the least amount of game\" is true or false, we need to compare the number of games won by Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense with the other teams.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are 18 rows representing each team's performance in a season. The columns \"won (pg)\" represents the number of games won by each team.\n\n3. We need to find the row where the value in the \"won (pg)\" column is the smallest.\n\n4. By examining the values in the \"won (pg)\" column, we can see that Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has 3 wins out of 18 games played.\n\n5. To verify if this is indeed the least number of wins among all teams, we need to check if there are any other team with a smaller number of wins.\n\n6. After reviewing the table, we find that no team has fewer than 3 wins. Therefore, Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense does not win the least amount of games in the league.\n\n7. However, since the claim is about winning the LEAST amount of games, and there are indeed teams with less wins (for example, Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed won 6 out of 18), we can conclude that the statement is false.\n\n8.
