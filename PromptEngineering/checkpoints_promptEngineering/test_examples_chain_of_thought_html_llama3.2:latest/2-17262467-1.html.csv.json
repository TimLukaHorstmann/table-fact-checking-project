We can then check if Carlos Kirmayr won only 1 set against Jos\u00e9 Higueras by looking at the \"score in the final\" column for this specific match.\n5.

To verify this, we need to find the dates of these two matches in the table.\n3. From the table, we can see that Carlos Kirmayr lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 (Cell: row_index=1, column_name=\"date\").\n4. We also know that Peter Feigl defeated Carlos Kirmayr in 1980 (Cell: row_index=3, column_name=\"date\"). However, we need to find the date when Peter Feigl defeated Carlos Kirmayr.\n5. Looking at the table again, we can see that there is no direct information about the date of Peter Feigl's victory over Carlos Kirmayr in 1980.\n6. We should look for a match in which Peter Feigl was the runner-up (Cell: outcome=runner - up).\n7. After searching, we find that Peter Feigl defeated Jos\u00e9 Higueras' opponent in the final, not directly defeating Carlos Kirmayr, but we found Carlos's previous loss to Peter Feigl and its year which is 1979 Cell: row_index = 2 , column_name=\"outcome\")\n8.

We will examine each row of the \"championship\" column for any match where \"guaruj\u00e1 , brazil\" (a location that suggests Brazil) could be related to Carlos Kirmayr since Guaruj\u00e1 is in Brazil and is close to S\u00e3o Paulo which is his birthplace.\n3.

Since we found a match where \"guaruj\u00e1 , brazil\" appears which is indeed in Brazil, the only way to be sure that Carlos did not win a championship between 1976 and 1982 would be if there were other matches played in those years by the same player at Guaruj\u00e1 or another place with relevant information, but such evidence is currently absent.\n6. Thus, without other information available on his championships during this period, we can safely say Carlos Kirmayr did win a championship between 1976 and 1982.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n7.

Find the year 3 years after Carlos Kirmayr's latest recorded loss.\n\nSince we don't know the exact date when Carlos Kirmayr lost his last match, we can only find the closest year that is three years later than one of the dates that are present in the table (1979). Since 1982 was not three years after any year from 1976 to 1978, and 1983 is three years after 1980. So 1983 is our target.\n\n3. Find the row for van Winitsky in the table with a date of 1983.\n\nLooking at the table we see that no one lost to van winitsky on clay surface with score 3 - 6 , 3 - 6 in the year 1982, but there is a possible loss by Van in another surface in that same year (guaruj\u00e1 , brazil) for an exact match.\n\n4. Check if Carlos Kirmayr lost to van Winitsky in the year 1983.\n\n\nSince we do not know what year Carlos Kirmayr last played, and there is no row with a date of 1983 where he lose to Van, our evaluation is incorrect.\n\n\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, find the row for Carlos Kirmayr in the table.

To determine if Carlos Kirmayr won a championship between 1976 and 1980, we need to check the table for any championships won by him during this time period.\n\n2. We can start by checking the column \"opponent in the final\" to see who played against him in the final round. If he beat someone in a final match, it is possible that he won a championship.\n\n3. In the row where Carlos Kirmayr's data appears (1979), we have Jos\u00e9 Higueras as his opponent, but we can't conclude anything from this because there is no information about whether or not Kirmayr beat him.\n\n4. However, in the 1980 row of the table, Dominique Bedel appears as Carlos Kirmayr's opponent. Unfortunately for Carlos Kirmayr, he lost to Dominique Bedel with a score of 4-6, 6-7.\n\n5. Since we are looking for evidence that Carlos Kirmayr did NOT win any championships between 1976 and 1980, we can conclude that there is no record in the table of him winning such a championship.\n\nHere's the output as requested:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Determine if Carlos Kirmayr won a championship between 1976 and 1980\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Check the column for opponent in final to see who played against him\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"In row where Carlos Kirmayr's data appears, Jos\u00e9 Higueras as opponent but can't conclude anything from this.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"In the 1980 row of table, Dominique Bedel appears as Carlos Kirmayr's opponent and loses to him with score 4-6 , 6-7\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Since we are looking for evidence that Carlos Kirmayr did NOT win any championships between 1976 and 1980, can conclude there is no record in table of him winning such a championship.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
