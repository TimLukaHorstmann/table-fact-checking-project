    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine if the claim about Leconte being absent in 1989 for Australian Open, Wimbledon, and US Open is true or false:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the relevant tournament years\nFirst, we need to find the year 1989 in the table.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>us open</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>qf</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>2r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Check the Australian Open for the absence in year 1989\nFor each relevant tournament, we need to check if Leconte was absent. For 1989's Australian Open:\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>australian open</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>lq</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>nh</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>2r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nIn the 1989 Australian Open, there is a 'a' in the \"tournament\" column. This means that Leconte was present.\n\n### Step 3: Check Wimbledon for the absence in year 1989\nFor Wimbledon:\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>wimbledon</td>\n    <td>lq</td>\n    <td>2r</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>2r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>qf</td>\n    <td>sf</td>\n    <td>qf</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>2r</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nIn the 1989 Wimbledon, there is also an 'a' in the \"tournament\" column. This means that Leconte was present.\n\n### Step 4: Check US Open for the absence in year 1989\nFor the US Open:\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>us open</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>qf</td>\n    <td>4r</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>2r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>3r</td>\n    <td>1r</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n    <td>a</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\nIn the 1989 US Open, there is an 'a' in the \"tournament\" column.

If there's only one instance where Leconte is described as a quarter-finalist, then this would make our claim TRUE. However, if we can find more than one tournament with the same description (quarter-finalist), this will make our answer FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Table Cells:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"tournament\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"1985\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"1986\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"1990\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nWe will list the tournament where Leconte has been a quarter-finalist, as well as whether they have participated in other tournaments beyond that.\n\n1.

This shows that Leconte was quarter-finalist in French Open.\n\nThe information of Leconte being a quarter finalist only in french open has not been validated by further examination because the other tournaments have already provided results, with no quarter final results. Hence, we can infer our claim is TRUE based on this single instance.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined table rows where Leconte reached a quarter-final position at French Open, as well as other tournament results which did not show any quarter finals.
