Extract the data for bowlers who took 13 wickets: \n   - Keith Miller (13 wickets, played 5 matches)\n   - Norman Yardley (9 wickets, played 5 matches)\n\n2. Determine the match count of these two bowlers:\n   - Keith Miller played 5 matches\n   - Norman Yardley also played 5 matches\n\n3. Compare the number of matches played by both bowlers:\n   Since they have the same number of matches played (5), we need to compare their wicket counts.\n\n4. Check if Keith Miller has taken fewer wickets than Norman Yardley in any match:\n   - In all the available information, there is no indication that Keith Miller took fewer wickets than Norman Yardley.\n   Therefore, it can be inferred that Norman Yardley may have taken fewer wickets (9) compared to what was recorded for Keith miller. However, we need to verify this by cross-checking the wicket counts.\n\n5. Extract the data for bowlers who took 11 wickets: \n   - Ernie Toshack (11 wickets, played 4 matches)\n\n6. Determine the match count of these two bowlers:\n   - Ernie Toshack played only 4 matches\n   - Keith Miller and Norman Yardley each played 5 matches\n\n7. Check if Ernie Toshack has taken fewer wickets in any match compared to Keith Miller:\n   - Given that both took 13 wickets, we need to compare their average.\n   - However, we should first verify whether one of them took more or less than the other in a single match.\n\n8. Since the claim is \"the bowler with 13 wicket appear in less match than the bowler with 11 wicket\", let's verify this by cross-checking wickets taken by both Keith Miller and Ernie Toshack:\n   - We cannot conclude that any of them took fewer wickets than the other based on the given information alone. Therefore, we must proceed to compare their average.\n\n9. Compare the average of these two bowlers:\n   - Keith Miller's average is 23.15\n   - Ernie Toshack's average is 33.09\n\n10. Since Ernie Toshack has a higher average than Keith Miller and Norman Yardley, we can conclude that it is possible that Norman Yardley may have taken fewer wickets in the same number of matches.\n\n11. However, to confirm whether \"the bowler with 13 wicket appear in less match than the bowler with 11 wicket\" holds true for all cases, let's look at Keith Miller and Ernie Toshack again:\n   - It is stated that both took 13 wickets but no information on the number of matches they played is explicitly provided.\n\n12. Based on steps 1-11, we can now conclude whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE.\nThe claim \"the bowler with 13 wicket appear in less match than the bowler with 11 wicket\" holds true because Keith Miller has fewer wickets (13) compared to Ernie Toshack's lower average (33.09).",
