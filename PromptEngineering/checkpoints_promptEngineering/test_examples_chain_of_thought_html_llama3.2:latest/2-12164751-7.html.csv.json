To determine if the claim \"the football club rank most valuable also have the highest operating income\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to identify the ranking of the football clubs by value and compare it with their operating income.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that the clubs are ranked from 1 to 20 based on their value (most valuable).\n\n3. To find the club with the highest operating income, we should look for the cell in the last row of the table where the \"column_name\" is 'operating_income'.\n\n4. Upon examination of the table, we can see that the clubs are ranked as follows:\n    | Rank | Value |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | 1    | ...  |\n    | 2    | ...  |\n    | 3    | ...  |\n    | 20   | 209\n\n5. Comparing this with the operating income, we see that the club with the highest operating income has a value of 209.\n\n6. Next, let's find which clubs have an operating income of 209.

Since one is higher than the other in terms of value but not necessarily operating income, the claim cannot be fully verified by the ranking alone. But to make it clearer, let's look for any cells where 'rank' and 'operating_income' match up.\n\n\n9. In this case, we can see that there are indeed clubs that have both high rank and high operating income.\n\n10.
