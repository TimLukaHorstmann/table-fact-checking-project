    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row index of ngc 2082 in the table.\n   - Open the table and locate the row with \"ngc 2082\" in it.\n   - Count the rows from the top of the table until you reach the row with \"ngc 2082\". This will give you the row index.\n\n2. Next, we need to compare this row index with the claim about the lowest right ascension (or ra).\n   - The claim states that the lowest right ascension is ngc 2082 with a right ascension of 4 hour 8 minute and 58.1 second.\n   - We need to check if the table has an entry for \"ngc 2082\" in its row index where the \"ra ( j2000 )\" value matches the claimed value.\n\n3. To compare values, we should extract only the relevant column name from the table's data structure.\n   - The relevant column names are \"name\", \"type\", and \"ra ( j2000 )\".\n   - We will use these column names to find the matching row index in the table.\n\n\nAfter performing these steps, I found that:\n\n- The row index of ngc 2082 is 5.\n- The value for ra ( j2000 ) when n=5 is 4 hour 8 minute and 58.1 second.\n\nThus, the claim about the lowest right ascension being ngc 2082 with a right ascension of 4 hour 8 minute and 58.1 second is TRUE.\n\n\n\nHere is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"ra ( j2000 )\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ra ( j2000 )\" },\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}",
