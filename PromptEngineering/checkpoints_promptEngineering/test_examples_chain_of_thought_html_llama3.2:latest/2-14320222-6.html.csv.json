This confirms that one game does have a score of 86 points.\n\n#### Step 4: Find all games with a total score of 86 points\nTo find other games with a total score of 86 points, we need to check if there are any other rows with the same value in cell \"points\". We can see that in row 62 and row 63, the values in cell \"points\" are also 86. This confirms that there are indeed three games with a total score of 86 points.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify that these games are distinct\nWe need to verify that game 61 is indeed one of the three games with a total score of 86 points, and not just one of multiple games. Since we found other rows (62 and 63) with the same value in cell \"points\", this confirms that game 61 is one of the three distinct games.\n\n#### Step 6: List relevant cells\nThe relevant cells are:\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 7: Determine the final answer\nSince we verified that there are indeed three games with a total score of 86 points and game 61 is one of them, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verify if game 61 has a score of 86 points (done), find all games with a total score of 86 points (done), verify that these games are distinct (done).

To verify that they have the lowest total score in February, we need to see if there are any lower scores for either of these teams:\n   - The lowest Washington Capitals score is 86 in game 61.\n   - The lowest Vancouver Canucks score is 86 as well in game 63.\n\n7.

According to the table, the score for Washington Capitals is \"3 - 1\" and the score for Vancouver Canucks is \"1 - 3\".\n\n2. Next, we need to convert these scores into a numerical format that can be compared. Since the scores are in the form of \"X - Y\", where X is the number of goals scored by the home team and Y is the number of goals scored by the visiting team, we can assume that the scores are already in the correct order (home team's score first). Therefore, the numerical representation for Washington Capitals' score is 3 (goals scored) + 1 (period played but this value does not contribute to the goal difference), and Vancouver Canucks' score is 1 (goal scored by home team).\n\n3. Now we can calculate the point difference between the two teams. For Washington Capitals, the point difference would be 3 - 1 = 2 points. For Vancouver Canucks, the point difference would be 0 points.\n\n4. Finally, we compare these point differences. The claim states that there is a 3-point difference between the Washington Capital and the Vancouver Canuck.
