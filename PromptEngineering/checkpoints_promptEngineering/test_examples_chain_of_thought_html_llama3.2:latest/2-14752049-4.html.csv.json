Brazil had 5.4 million and Argentina had 5.7 million in 2011.\n   The difference between their 2011 arrivals is actually 0.3 million (in favor of Argentina).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   Given that Brazil's arrival in 2011 (5.4 million) was less than Argentina's (5.7 million), the claim \"Brazil has 3 million more international tourist arrivals (2011)\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Extracted relevant data for Brazil and Argentina from the table.\\nStep 2: Identified cells with the relevant numbers for both countries in 2011.\\nStep 3: Analyzed the claim to be tested (Brazil having more arrivals).\\nStep 4: Compared the numbers directly from the data.\\nConclusion: Brazil does not have 3 million more international tourist arrivals in 2011 than Argentina.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, we need to determine the rank of Peru in the world tourism ranking for 2012.\n   - Look at the table, find the row with \"Peru\" as the country name in the \"country\" column.\n   - The corresponding value is \"2.8 million\".\n\n2. Next, we need to verify if there are indeed two countries with less than 3 million international tourist arrivals (2011) ranked below Peru.\n   - Find the rows that have values less than 3 million in the \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" column.\n   - The country \"Uruguay\" has a value of \"2.5 million\", which is less than 3 million.\n\n3. Now, we need to check if Uruguay is ranked below Peru in the world tourism ranking for 2011.\n   - Look at the table again and find Uruguay's row in the rank column.\n   - The corresponding rank is \"10\", which is above Peru's rank (rank = 9).\n\n4. Since both conditions are met, we need to verify if there's another country with less than 3 million international tourist arrivals (2011) ranked below Peru that has a higher rank.\n   - Look at the table and find all countries with values less than 3 million in the \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" column.\n   - The other two countries are Argentina (\"5.7 million\") and Puerto Rico (\"3.0 million\"), both of which have ranks greater than Uruguay's.\n\n5.

The claim states that Chile should not be one of the countries with more than 4 million international tourist arrivals. Since Chile does meet this condition but another country (Peru), our step to make a determination is not yet complete.\n\n5. **Check other relevant information**: We need to confirm if there are any countries with exactly 4 million or less international tourist arrivals that should exclude Chile from the list. Upon examining the rest of the data, we see no such cases besides Chile and Peru.\n\n6. **Make the final determination**: Given our analysis, Chile (rank 7) does not belong in the group of more than 4 million visitors according to the conditions stated in the claim.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"peru\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"chile\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"uruguay\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Extract the table data\nFirst, we need to extract the relevant data from the table for comparison.\n\n- We are interested in comparing Uruguay's international tourist arrivals with Peru's in 2012.\n- The relevant cell for this purpose is located at row index 10 and column name \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\".\n\n### Step 2: Compare values\nNext, we need to compare the values of Uruguay and Peru in the extracted year. \n- We also need to check the change in both countries' tourism from previous years, if necessary, but for this specific claim it is sufficient to only consider \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\".\n\n### Step 3: Determine truth value\nBased on the comparison in step 2, we will determine whether Uruguay's international tourist arrivals were more than Peru's in 2012. \n\n- If Uruguay has more or equal, then the statement is true.\n- Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Step 4: List of relevant cells\nThe relevant cell for this purpose is located at row index 10 and column name \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\":\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 10,\n        \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Final answer\nBased on the table data, Uruguay has less than Peru in terms of international tourist arrivals.\n\n- So the claim is FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Extract relevant cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Compare values\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Determine truth value: Uruguay has less than Peru in 2012\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Final answer: FALSE\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 10,\n            \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
