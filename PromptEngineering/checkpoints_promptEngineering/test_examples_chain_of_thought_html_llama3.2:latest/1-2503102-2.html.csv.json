First, we need to identify the rows where a team uses a Honda engine.\n   - To do this, we look at the table header row for the \"engine\" column, which lists the possible engine options: Honda, Chevrolet, and Dallara.\n   - We then scan through each row in the table body. Whenever a cell's value is listed as \"Honda\", we note down the corresponding team name.\n\n2. Next, we repeat the process from step 1 for the Chevrolet engine option to find out which teams use it.\n   - Again, we examine the table header for the column labeled \"engine\" and identify rows where \"Chevrolet\" appears.\n\n3. Now that we have identified all teams using Honda engines (in row 2) and Chevrolet engines (in row 4), we can verify our claim by counting the number of each type of engine mentioned in the table.\n   - We then compare this count with the given numbers in the claim: 6 for Honda engines, and 2 for Chevrolet engines.\n\n4. Finally, based on the comparison made in step 3, we determine whether the claim provided is true or false.\n\n### Code Implementation (for reference):\n\nHere's a simple Python program to verify our reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read data from table HTML\nhtml_table = \"\"\"\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe table table-striped\">\n    ...\n</table>\n\"\"\"\n\ndf = pd.read_html(html_table)[0]\n\ndef find_teams_using_engine(engine_name):\n    return df[df['engine'] == engine_name]['team'].tolist()\n\n# Identify teams using Honda engines\nhonda_teams = find_teams_using_engine('Honda')\nprint(\"Teams using Honda:\", honda_teams)\n\n# Identify teams using Chevrolet engines\nchevrolet_teams = find_teams_using_engine('Chevrolet')\nprint(\"Teams using Chevrolet:\", chevrolet_teams)\n\n# Verify claim based on count of engines used by each team type\nhonda_count = len(honda_teams)\nchevrolet_count = len(chevrolet_teams)\n\nclaim_verified = (\n    honda_count == 6 and \n    chevrolet_count <= 2\n)\n\nprint(\"Claim verified:\", claim_verified)\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify Honda teams (6), Chevrolet teams (<2) to verify claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Compare the counts to verify if Honda is used by more teams than Chevrolet:\n\n    Since $hondacount=5$ and $chevcount=3$, we see that Honda engine was indeed used by more teams (2 more) than Chevrolet engine.\n\n    ```javascript\nconst difference = hondacount - chevcount;\n```\n\n4.  Verify if Honda is used by exactly four more teams than Chevrolet:\n\n    Since the calculated difference is $5-3=2$, we see that Honda engine was not used by exactly four more teams than Chevrolet engine; it was used two more times.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Step 1: Count the number of teams using Honda engine\",\n      \"code_snippet\": \"const hondacount = 5;\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Step 2: Count the number of teams using Chevrolet engine\",\n      \"code_snippet\": \"const chevcount = 3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Step 3: Compare the counts to verify if Honda is used by more teams than Chevrolet\",\n      \"code_snippet\": \"const difference = hondacount - chevcount;\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { row_index: 2, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 5, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 6, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 7, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 8, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 3, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 4, column_name: \"\" },\n    { row_index: 5, column_name: \"\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
