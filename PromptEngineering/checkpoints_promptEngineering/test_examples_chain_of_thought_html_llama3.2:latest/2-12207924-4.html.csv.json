    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the relevant cell for Jefferson's 3 loss against the Blue Jays in June 1979.\n2. To do this, we can look at the table structure and identify the relevant columns: \"Team\", \"Opponent\", \"Day of Week\", and \"Result\".\n3. We know that Jefferson played against the Blue Jays, so we need to find a row where the opponent is \"Blue Jays\" and there's a result indicating a loss.\n4. Looking at the table, we can see that there are multiple rows for different dates, but since we're interested in June 1979, we can focus on those rows.\n5. We also know that Jefferson lost exactly 3 games in June, so we need to find rows where the result is \"loss\" and the number of wins is less than or equal to 2.\n6. After searching through the table, I found a row that matches these criteria: Row Index 28, Opponent Blue Jays, Result Loss, Number of Wins 1 (but there's another loss in the same month which has the same number of win for this player, see below).\n7. Here is the relevant cell as an object:\n{\n    \"row_index\": 28,\n    \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n}\n8. After re-reading the prompt, I realized that we need to verify that Jefferson actually played against Blue Jays in June 1979. We can confirm this by looking at the column for Day of Week and ensuring it's a weekday (monday to friday).\n9. Upon reviewing the table again, I found another relevant row: Row Index 12, Day of Week Wednesday, Opponent Blue Jays, Result Loss.\n10. Here is the relevant cell as an object:\n{\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"Day of Week\"\n}\n\nSince we verified that Jefferson played against Blue Jays in June 1979, the claim can be true.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find relevant cell for Jefferson's 3 loss against Blue Jays in June 1979\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Search table structure and identify relevant columns: Team, Opponent, Day of Week, Result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look at table and find rows where opponent is Blue Jays and result indicates a loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Focus on June 1979 rows since we're interested in that month\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find row where result is loss and number of wins is less than or equal to 2 for Jefferson\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Search table again to find another relevant row with the same criteria\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that Jefferson actually played against Blue Jays in June 1979 by checking Day of Week column\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"Day of Week\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, it does mention the Orioles and the Yankees.\n2. The claim talks about games going into extra innings in June of 1979, which could apply to multiple teams.\n3. Since the claim is about two specific games going into extra innings, we need to look for any games involving the Orioles or the Yankees that meet this criteria.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at the table, I notice that there are no games listed where the Blue Jays played 2 games in June 1979.\n2. However, there is a game where the Yankees played the Red Sox on June 22nd with a score of 12-1, but this doesn't meet the criteria since it wasn't an extra inning game due to time constraints (11 innings).\n3. On the same day as the Red Sox game, there was another game between the Orioles and the Yankees. Looking at the table, I see that on June 30th, the Orioles played the Yankees with a score of 2-0, but again this doesn't meet the criteria since it wasn't an extra inning game.\n4. However, I do notice that on June 29th, there was a game between the Orioles and the Yankees where the Orioles won 6-1 in the first game and then lost 4-0 in the second game to the same opponent. This doesn't meet the criteria since it only involved two games.\n5. After re-examining the table I found another possibility for extra innings involving both teams on June 28th, there was a Yankees vs Red Sox game with the Yankees winning 5-3 after 10 innings which does indeed go into an extra inning but I noticed that June 27th also had the Blue Jays play the team, the Orioles however that match is in another year, the Orioles did have two wins against the same opponent in the month of june but only on the 29 and 30th.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"There is no direct evidence to support the claim that the Blue Jays played 2 games going into extra innings in June 1979.

Since the table doesn't explicitly mention the Blue Jays, we should look for teams that might have been referred to as \"Blue Jays\" in 1979 (e.g., Toronto Blue Jays didn't exist until 1977).\n3. The only team mentioned is the Yankees, but they play from June 20th onwards. We need to check the earlier games.\n4. Looking at the table, we see a game between the Red Sox and another team on June 22nd that ended in 12 runs scored by one team and 1 run scored by the other. This is an easy fit for \"extra innings\".\n5. However, since there's no Blue Jays mentioned earlier than Yankees, we can say that this answer has not been directly influenced by the Blue Jays.\n6.
