That makes 4 winners.\n  - However, the total number of winners from row 23 to row 26 must be calculated as well: Alberto Contador (ESP) is a winner on row 19, Sandy Casar (FRA) is a winner on row 21, Fr\u00e4nk Schleck (LUX) is a winner on row 22 and Mark Cavendish (GBR) is a winner on rows 24 and 26. That makes 4 more winners.\n- Counting winners for France:\n  - Thomas Voeckler (FRA) is a winner on row 8.\n  - Sandy Casar (FRA) is a winner on row 21.\n  - Sergei Ivanov (RUS) is a winner on row 18.\n  - Alberto Contador (ESP) is a winner on row 19 and another one on row 23. That makes 2 more winners.\n- Comparing the counts: GBR has 4 + 4 = 8 winners, and FRA has 3 winners.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Counted winners for Great Britain (GBR) as 4+4=8, counted winners for France (FRA) as 3.
