To verify this, we need to check if each player was drafted in the year they were eligible for the NBA draft.\n3. Let's analyze each row of the table:\n\t* Alonzo Mourning: drafted in 1992, but he would have been eligible for the 1990 NBA draft since he graduated from high school in 1988 (not sure when his graduation was). He actually entered university after graduating.\n\t* Chris Jackson: drafted in 1990, and according to the table, this is indeed the year he was eligible (he graduated from high school in 1988).\n\t* Chris Mills: drafted in 1993, but he would have been eligible for the 1991 NBA draft since he graduated from high school in 1991. However, his college information lists \"KENTUCKY / ARIZONA\" which was a common early entry rule at the time. This makes it somewhat ambiguous.\n\t* Billy Owens: drafted in 1991, and according to the table, this is indeed the year he was eligible (he graduated from high school in 1989).\n\t* Kenny Williams: drafted in 1990, but he would have been eligible for the 1988 NBA draft since he graduated from military academy in 1986. However, his college information lists \"Barton CC / Elizabeth City State\" which were junior colleges and community colleges that are not typically considered part of a four-year degree.\n4. Based on this analysis, we can see that Alonzo Mourning (not eligible for the draft until 1992) is an exception to the rule. The other three players were drafted in the year they were eligible according to their college and high school information.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Based on the table, all 5 players except Alonzo Mourning (not eligible for draft until 1992) were selected in the NBA draft in the season they were eligible.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: I used `row_index` as a key for the relevant cells since they all relate to the same column (`nba draft`).",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns for height**: We need to find the column that contains the player's height. In this case, it's \"height\" which has values in the range of \"6 - 0\", \"6 - 7\", \"6 - 9\", and \"6 - 10\".\n\n2. **Compare the heights to determine if Kenny Williams is indeed the tallest**: We need to compare the height of Kenny Williams with other players' heights to confirm that he is the tallest.\n\n3. **Verify if Chris Jackson is indeed the shortest**: Similarly, we will compare Chris Jackson's height with other players' heights to confirm that he is the shortest.\n\n4. **Check if both players were selected in the NBA draft**: We need to verify that Kenny Williams and Chris Jackson were both selected in the NBA draft.\n\nNow let me do the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns for height**:\n   The height column has values \"6 - 10\" for Alonzo Mourning, \"6 - 0\" for Chris Jackson, \"6 - 7\" for Chris Mills, and \"6 - 9\" for Billy Owens.\n\n2. **Compare the heights to determine if Kenny Williams is indeed the tallest**:\n   From the height column, we see that Kenny Williams has a height of \"6 - 10\". Comparing this with other players' heights, we find that Alonzo Mourning also has a height of \"6 - 10\". So, Kenny Williams is not confirmed to be the tallest.\n\n3. **Verify if Chris Jackson is indeed the shortest**:\n   From the height column, we see that Chris Jackson has a height of \"6 - 0\". This value is less than other players' heights in the range, so Chris Jackson is confirmed to be the shortest.\n\n4. **Check if both players were selected in the NBA draft**:\n   We need to verify if Kenny Williams and Chris Jackson were both selected in the NBA draft.\n   The text mentions that Kenny Williams was selected \"2nd round - 46th pick of 1990 draft ( pacers )\". This means he was not selected with a high pick, so it's true that he was selected but we need to verify if he is the shortest and if Chris Jackson was selected as well.\n   The text also mentions that Chris Jackson was selected \"1st round - 3rd pick of 1990 draft ( nuggets )\". This means he indeed was selected in the first round.\n\nAfter the analysis, Kenny Williams and Chris Jackson were selected for NBA but we can't confirm if both selected as per their heights. Since Chris Jackson is confirmed to be the shortest player but only one of them was selected (Kenny Williams), Kenny Williams doesn't fulfill both criteria so his height doesn't matter in this case.\n\n\n\nFinal JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant column for height, compared heights of Kenny Williams and Chris Jackson, verified if they were selected in the NBA draft, but only one was selected so Kenny Williams' height is irrelevant to this claim\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}",

Then, we need to sort the table by 'height' in ascending order and verify that Billy Owens is indeed the shortest player.\n   By sorting the table, we get:\n   ```\n  <tr>\n    <td>billy owens</td>\n    <td>6 - 9</td>\n    <td>carlisle high school</td>\n    <td>carlisle , pa</td>\n    <td>syracuse</td>\n    <td>1st round - 3rd pick of 1991 draft ( kings )</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>kenny williams</td>\n    <td>6 - 10</td>\n    <td>fork union military academy</td>\n    <td>elizabeth city , nc</td>\n    <td>barton cc / elizabeth city state</td>\n    <td>2nd round - 46th pick of 1990 draft ( pacers )</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>alonzo mourning</td>\n    <td>6 - 10</td>\n    <td>indian river high school</td>\n    <td>chesapeake , va</td>\n    <td>georgetown</td>\n    <td>1st round - 2nd pick of 1992 draft ( hornets )</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>chris jackson</td>\n    <td>6 - 0</td>\n    <td>gulfport high school</td>\n    <td>gulfport , ms</td>\n    <td>lsu</td>\n    <td>1st round - 3rd pick of 1990 draft ( nuggets )</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>chris mills</td>\n    <td>6 - 7</td>\n    <td>fairfax high school</td>\n    <td>los angeles , ca</td>\n    <td>kentucky / arizona</td>\n    <td>1st round - 22nd pick of 1993 draft ( cavs )</td>\n  </tr>\n```\n   We can see that Billy Owens is indeed the shortest player, with a height of `6 - 9`.\n3. Now, we need to check if Chris Mills was selected in the NBA draft.\n   Relevant cell: `nba draft = 1st round - 22nd pick of 1993 draft ( cavs )`\n4. From step 2 and step 3, we can conclude that both Billy Owens and Chris Mills were selected for the NBA.\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we need to identify the height of Chris Mills from the table, then sort the table by 'height' in ascending order and verify that Billy Owens is indeed the shortest player.
