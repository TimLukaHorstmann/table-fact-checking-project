This requires identifying both the location of Torpedo - Ska and the number of teams with locations in Minsk.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify location of Torpedo - Ska\nIn the table, we can see that Torpedo - Ska's location is Minsk (located in column \"location\").\n\n#### Step 4: Count teams with locations in Minsk\nWe need to count how many teams have a location in Minsk. This involves checking each row for the presence of \"minsk\" in the \"location\" column.\n\n#### Step 5: Check rows for minsk location\nUpon inspection, we can see that there are multiple instances of \"minsk\" in the locations:\n- Torpedo (zhodino) has Minsk as its location.\n- Dinamo - Minsk has Minsk as its location.\n- Zvezda - Va - BGU has Minsk as its location.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if Torpedo - Ska is one of four teams with a location in Minsk\nWe have identified three other teams besides Torpedo - Ska that have locations in Minsk. Since we are looking for exactly four such teams, and we already know there are fewer than this (as only these three teams were found), the information about position in 2003 does not impact our analysis because it was already known to be at #4. Thus, Torpedo - Ska is indeed one of the four teams with a location in Minsk.\n\n#### Step 7: Compile the relevant data for output\nRelevant cells:\n- Row Index: 5 (since the row index starts from 1)\n- Column Name: \"location\"",
