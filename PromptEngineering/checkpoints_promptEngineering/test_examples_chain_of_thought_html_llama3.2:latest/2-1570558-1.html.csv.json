    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find Sherdrick Bonner's best rating in the table. To do this, we'll look at the \"rating\" column for each year and compare the values.\n\n2. We notice that there are two separate rows in the table: one for 2003 with a rating of 126.5, and another row for career statistics with a rating of 115.9.\n\n3. Since the claim states that Sherdrick Bonner has his best rating in the 2003 season, we need to check if 126.5 is indeed his highest rating in any year.\n\n4. We can see that there are other years with higher ratings, such as 1998 (121.0) and 2006 (109.8). However, these ratings do not belong to Sherdrick Bonner.\n\n5. The career statistics row contains the total number of games played by Sherdrick Bonner, but it doesn't provide any information about his individual best rating in a particular season.\n\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that 126.5 is indeed Sherdrick Bonner's highest rating in any year, and it corresponds to the 2003 season.\n\n7.

We can do this by looking at the relevant cell in the table: <tr> \\n     <td>2003</td> \\n     <td>289</td> \\n     <td>431</td> \\n     <td>67.1</td> \\n   </tr>. Next, we need to find Sherdrick's career total completion percentage. We can do this by looking at the relevant cell in the table: <tr> \\n     <td>career statistics</td> \\n     <td>3314</td> \\n     <td>5366</td> \\n     <td>61.8</td> \\n   </tr>. Now, we can compare Sherdrick's completion percentage in 2003 to his career total. The difference between the two is: 67.1 - 61.8 = 5.3. However, we need to check if this difference is indeed 3.1% higher than his career total. To do that, let's first convert the 3.1% into a decimal: 3.1 / 100 = 0.031 Now, let's subtract this value from Sherdrick's career total to see what percentage it represents: 61.8 - 0.031 * 61.8 = 60.97 Since the difference (5.3) is more than the calculated percentage (60.97), we know that Sherdrick's completion percentage in 2003 is actually lower than 3.1% higher than his career total, making the claim false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"completion percentage\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"career statistics\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
