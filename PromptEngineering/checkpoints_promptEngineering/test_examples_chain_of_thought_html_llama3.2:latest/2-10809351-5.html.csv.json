    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The first task is to identify which two teams are represented by \"north melbourne\" and \"footscray\". This can be done by looking at the table, where \"home team\" and \"away team\" are listed in alternating rows.\n2. Since \"north melbourne\" is in the row below \"melbourne\", it means that North Melbourne is playing as the away team against Melbourne.\n3. Similarly, since \"footscray\" is in the row above \"south melbourne\", it means that Footscray is playing as the home team against South Melbourne.\n4. Therefore, when calculating the combined total away team score, we should be looking at North Melbourne's and Footscray's scores from their respective matches.\n5. Looking at the table, North Melbourne scored 6.12 (48) in the match listed for \"north melbourne\" and Footscray scored 6.14 (50) in the match listed for \"footscray\".\n6. Adding these two scores together gives a combined total away team score of 12.26.\n7.
