The function `find_highest_attendance()` iterates over this data, comparing each game's attendance against the current highest value found so far. If it finds a higher attendance, it updates its reference and records the corresponding cells in `relevant_cells`. After analyzing all games, if October 30, 1988 indeed had the highest attendance, the function outputs a JSON object detailing its reasoning (`chain_of_thought`), whether October 30, 1988 was correct according to our analysis (`answer`), and which specific cells were used for this conclusion (`relevant_cells`).",

However, the question asks for the result in the lowest attendance for the season, which means we need to compare all attendances.\n\nUpon reviewing all the attendances, it appears there's an error in my initial thought process regarding comparing values directly without considering their positions within the dataset accurately. Let's correct that and look at the actual lowest attendance:\n\nThe lowest attendance is indeed 14020 for Week 13, not among the values I initially mentioned or compared.\n\n#### Step 6: Finalize the answer\nGiven the information above, we should verify if October 30, 1988 has the lowest attendance based on all attendances. Since there's an error in my logic about comparing directly without considering the entire dataset accurately:\n\nThe final analysis reveals that the lowest attendance is not for October 30 but rather another week.\n\n#### Step 7: Provide the relevant cells\nHowever, according to our steps and understanding now, the focus should be on identifying the actual lowest attendance across all weeks.
