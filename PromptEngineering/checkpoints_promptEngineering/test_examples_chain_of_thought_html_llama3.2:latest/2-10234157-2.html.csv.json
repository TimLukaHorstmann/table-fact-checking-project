Specifically, we are looking for their drop scores.\n\n- Alberto Di Bernardo's drop score can be found in the table under \"drop\" in row 7 (since he has the most relevant info) with a value of \"5\".\n- Glen Jackson's drop score can also be found in the same manner as his tries and drop value, which is in row 4. His drop score is \"2\".\n\n### Step 2: Compare the values to determine if Alberto Di Bernardo has more drops than Glen Jackson\nNow that we have identified both players' drop scores, we compare these values to see if Alberto Di Bernardo indeed has more drops than Glen Jackson.\n\n- Alberto Di Bernardo's drop score is \"5\".\n- Glen Jackson's drop score is \"2\".\n\nSince 5 is greater than 2, Alberto Di Bernardo does indeed have more drop scores than Glen Jackson.\n\n### Step 3: Conclude the claim based on the comparison\nGiven that we've found both players' drop scores and they are in a relationship where one has more drops than the other, we can now conclude whether the original claim is true or false.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Alberto Di Bernardo's and Glen Jackson's drop scores (5 vs. 2), compared them, and determined that Alberto Di Bernardo indeed has more drops than Glen Jackson.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}",
