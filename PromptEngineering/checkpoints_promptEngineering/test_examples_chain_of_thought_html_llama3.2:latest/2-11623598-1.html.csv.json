Looking at the table provided, we can see a column named \"winner\" which indicates who won each tournament.\n3. Since we are interested in Bob Carmichael's wins, we only need to focus on the rows where his name appears as the winner.\n4. However, upon examining the data more closely, it seems that the data might be incomplete or inaccurate since there is no record of Bob Carmichael winning any of these tournaments. We should also verify if he was even a participant in most of these events.\n\n5. To determine our claim's validity, we must first check if the table indeed contains information about Bob Carmichael's participation and wins, including the last final won by him being in 1978.\n\n6. However, reviewing the data again reveals that there is actually no record of Bob Carmichael winning any of these tournaments, which means it's impossible to verify our claim directly from the provided data.\n7. As a result, we can only make an educated guess based on external knowledge or further investigation into Bob Carmichael's actual tennis career.\n\n8. Although we cannot definitively prove that his last final win was in 1978 using this table alone, and based on general knowledge about Bob Carmichael's tennis career:\n\nBob Carmichael did participate in many tournaments during the late 1970s but finding an exact match of a \"final\" he won exactly in 1978 would likely require additional information or resources not available within this dataset.\n\n9.
