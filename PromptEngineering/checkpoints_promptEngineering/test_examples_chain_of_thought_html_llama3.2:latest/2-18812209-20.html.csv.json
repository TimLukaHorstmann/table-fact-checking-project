We do this by subtracting each point value from its adjacent value and then taking the absolute value of the result.\n\n3. Then, we find the maximum difference in our list of differences calculated in step 2.\n\n4. The final step is to compare the maximum difference found in step 3 with 11. If it's less than or equal to 11, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the data from the table:\n\nFirst, we sort all the 'points' values and extract them for further calculations:\n\n| Row Index | Column Name | Point Value |\n|------------|--------------|-------------|\n| 0          | constructor   | Citro\u00ebn    | 456       |\n| 0          | chassis       | C4 WRC      |            |\n| 0          | starts        | 26          |\n| 0          | finishes      | 24          |\n| 0          | wins          | 9           |\n| 0          | podiums       | 19          |\n| 0          | stage wins    | 127         |\n| 0          | points        | 456         |\n\nSorted 'points' values for calculation:\n[217, 337, 458, 476]\n\nNow we calculate the differences between consecutive point values:\n\nDifferences:\n[0, 130, 139, -26]\nMaximum difference in list of differences: 139\nComparison result (maximum difference <= 11): FALSE\n\nRelevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\":\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"points\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"points\"\n  }\n]\n\nNow let's put this all together in a valid JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We sorted the 'points' values for Citro\u00ebn Junior Team, BP Ford World Rally Team and Munchi's Ford World Rally Team. Then we calculated the maximum difference between these three values, which was 139. Since it's greater than 11, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
