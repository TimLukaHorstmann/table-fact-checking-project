    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. The first step is to find out if there was a test driver in 2010 for Force India F1 team. To do this, we need to look at the relevant cells:\n   - `row_index`: 10\n   - `column_name`: \"Test Driver\"\n2. Now that we know the column name, let's search for it:\n   The relevant cell is:\n   ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Test Driver\",\n      \"value\": \"test driver\"\n    }\n```\n   Since there is a value in this cell (which is not equal to `Paul di Resta`), we can infer that there was no test driver for the Force India F1 team in 2010.\n3. Now, let's check if Paul di Resta joined the team in 2010:\n   - `row_index`: 10\n   - `column_name`: \"Test Driver\"\n   The relevant cell is:\n   ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Test Driver\",\n      \"value\": \"test driver\"\n    }\n```\n   Since there is no value in this cell, it seems that Paul di Resta did not join the team as a test driver.\n4. Let's check if Paul di Resta joined the team at all:\n   - `row_index`: 10\n   - `column_name`: \"Test Driver\"\n   The relevant cell is:\n   ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Test Driver\",\n      \"value\": \"Paul di Resta\"\n    }\n```\n   Since there is a value in this cell, it seems that Paul di Resta did join the team as a test driver.\n5. Now let's verify the column of the answer:\n   The relevant cell for verification is:\n   ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Test Driver\",\n      \"value\": \"Paul di Resta\"\n    }\n```\n   Since there are indeed values in this column, we need to confirm that Paul di Resta was the test driver. To do this, let's check if he joined Force India F1 team:\n   - `row_index`: 9\n   - `column_name\": \"Test Driver`\n   The relevant cell is:\n   ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 10,\n       \"column_name\": \"Formula One\",\n       \"value\": \"test driver\"\n     }\n   ```\n   Since there are values in this column, we need to confirm if the Formula one team was different from other teams. Let's check this:\n    - `row_index`: 9\n      - `column_name` = 'Test Driver'\n        The relevant cell is:\n           ```\n            {\n              \"row_index\": 11,\n              \"column_name\": \"Formula One\",\n              \"value\": \"test driver\"\n          }`\n        ```\n    The value for Formula one team was not equal to the other teams.
