In fact, there are only two records where the team drew: one with no match to either of these goals (in row 4).\n  - However, we notice that for the second occurrence, there is indeed a row with a drawn record having a goal difference of 34-25 (row 5) and another row with a drawn record matching a goal difference of 36-29 (row 6).\n\nRelevant cells:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    }\n]\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to verify if the team drew with a goal difference of 34-25 and 36-29 exactly two times.

Specifically, we are looking for rows where:\n   - The `goal difference` is exactly \"11 - 71\" (case-insensitive).\n   - The `points` is exactly \"0\".\n\n3. **Verify Condition**: For each matching cell in step 2, verify that the condition stated in the claim is true.\n\n4. **Find Matching Cells**:\n   - Looking at the table, we see the row where `games=7`, `drawn=0`, and `goal difference` exactly matches \"11 - 71\" which has a `points` of \"2\". This does not match our condition.\n   - Another matching row is where `games=7`, `drawn=0`, and `goal difference` exactly matches \"17 - 68\" which has a `points` of \"2\". Still, this doesn't fit the claim since points are not 0 in this case.\n   - Yet another is where `games=7`, `drawn=0`, and `goal difference` exactly matches \"11 - 71\" again.

Step 2: Look for relevant data in the table to determine if this claim is true or false. We need to check the points column for values equal to 7 and verify that the corresponding lost columns have a value of 3. Step 3: Check the table's data against the claim. Row 1: Points = 12, Losses = 1. Row 2: Points = 12, Losses = 1. Row 3: Points = 10, Losses = 2. Row 4: Points = 7, Losses = 3. Row 5: Points = 7, Losses = 3. Row 6: Points = 6, Losses = 4. Row 7: Points = 2, Losses = 5. Row 8: Points = 0, Losses = 7 Step 4: Analyze the data for matches to the claim. There are only two rows with a points value of 7 but both have losses equal to 3. Step 5: Draw a conclusion about the claim based on the analysis. Based on the data provided in the table, the claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
