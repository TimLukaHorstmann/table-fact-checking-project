To do this, we will sort the table by the 'attendance' column in ascending order.\n\n2. Once the table is sorted, the row at the top of the table (i.e., row 15) should have the lowest attendance.\n\n3. Now that we know the opponent of the game with the lowest attendance, we can see if it matches the claim's text: \"st louis cardinals\".\n\n4. Finally, we will verify that this match is correct by checking if there are no other opponents at lower attendance games than the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nNow let's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data from html table\nhtml_table = \"\"\"\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe table table-striped\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>week</th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>opponent</th>\n      <th>result</th>\n      <th>attendance</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>september 8 , 1985</td>\n      <td>kansas city chiefs</td>\n      <td>l 47 - 27</td>\n      <td>57760</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>september 15 , 1985</td>\n      <td>denver broncos</td>\n      <td>l 34 - 23</td>\n      <td>74488</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>september 22 , 1985</td>\n      <td>tampa bay buccaneers</td>\n      <td>w 20 - 13</td>\n      <td>45320</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>september 29 , 1985</td>\n      <td>san francisco 49ers</td>\n      <td>w 20 - 17</td>\n      <td>58053</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>october 6 , 1985</td>\n      <td>philadelphia eagles</td>\n      <td>w 23 - 21</td>\n      <td>56364</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>october 13 , 1985</td>\n      <td>los angeles raiders</td>\n      <td>l 23 - 13</td>\n      <td>48152</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>october 20 , 1985</td>\n      <td>atlanta falcons</td>\n      <td>l 31 - 24</td>\n      <td>44784</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>october 27 , 1985</td>\n      <td>new york giants</td>\n      <td>l 16 - 10</td>\n      <td>37717</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>november 3 , 1985</td>\n      <td>atlanta falcons</td>\n      <td>l 28 - 16</td>\n      <td>29527</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>november 10 , 1985</td>\n      <td>atp</td>\n      <td>w 38 - 0</td>\n      <td>24645</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>november 17 , 1985</td>\n      <td>saint louis cardinals</td>\n      <td>w 33 - 10</td>\n      <td>22361</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>november 24 , 1985</td>\n      <td>atp</td>\n      <td>w 41 - 14</td>\n      <td>19553</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>december 1 , 1985</td>\n      <td>saint louis cardinals</td>\n      <td>w 38 - 16</td>\n      <td>17357</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>december 8 , 1985</td>\n      <td>kansas city chiefs</td>\n      <td>w 41 - 17</td>\n      <td>16129</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>december 15 , 1985</td>\n      <td>saint louis cardinals</td>\n      <td>l 31 - 19</td>\n      <td>46065</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16</td>\n      <td>december 22 , 1985</td>\n      <td>atlanta falcons</td>\n      <td>l 16 - 10</td>\n      <td>37717</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>december 29 , 1985</td>\n      <td>saint louis cardinals</td>\n      <td>l 28 - 16</td>\n      <td>29527</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>janeuary 5 , 1986</td>\n      <td>kansas city chiefs</td>\n      <td>w 33 - 10</td>\n      <td>24645</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>july 4 , 1992</td>\n      <td>saint louis cardinals</td>\n      <td\"w 38 - 0</td>\n      <td>22361</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>july 5 , 1994</td>\n      <td>atp</td>\n      <td>w 41 - 14</td>\n      <td>19553</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>july 8 , 1996</td>\n      <td>saint louis cardinals</td>\n      <td>w 38 - 16</td>\n      <td>17357</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>22</td>\n      <td>june 28 , 2003</td>\n      <td>kansas city chiefs</td>\n      <td\"w 41 - 17</td>\n      <td>16129</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\"\"\"\n\ndf = pd.read_html(html_table)[0]\n\n# Sort by attendance\nsorted_df = df.sort_values(by='attendance', ascending=True)\n\nrelevant_cells = [{\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]\nchain_of_thought = \"\"\"Sort the table by 'attendance' in ascending order.

First, let's check if there are indeed 16 weeks in the 1985 season (as indicated by rows 1-16). Since each week has a unique row, it appears that there are 16 weeks.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many times the New Orleans Saints win. We can do this by looking at the \"result\" column for each week where the Saints are the team playing at home.\n\n3. Go through each row (1-16) and check if the Saints' opponent is \"New Orleans Saints\". This will help us identify weeks where the Saints were at home and won.\n\n4. We also need to ensure that we're only looking at rows where the Saints played on a Sunday, since this information wasn't provided but it would be assumed as part of standard football data.\n\n5. The final step is to count how many times the New Orleans Saints win out of the total 16 weeks.\n\nHere are some relevant cells for this task:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe claim that there be only 5 weeks in the 1985 season where the new orleans saint win can be tested by verifying how many times this is true. \n\nBased on the provided data:\n\nSaints won at home:\n- Week 4 (San Francisco 49ers game): Saints won with a score of 20 - 17.\n- Week 12 (Minnesota Vikings game): Saints won with a score of 30 - 23.\n- Week 13 (Los Angeles Rams game): Saints won with a score of 29 - 3.\n\nSaints lost at home:\n- Week 8 (New York Giants game): Saints lost to the New York Giants with a score of 21 - 13.\n- Week 10 (Seattle Seahawks game): Saints lost to Seattle Seahawks with a score of 27 - 3.\n- Week 11 (Green Bay Packers game): Saints lost to Green Bay Packers with a score of 38 - 14.\n- Week 15 (San Francisco 49ers game): Saints lost to the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 31 - 19.\n\nSince this data does not align with the claim that there be only 5 weeks in the 1985 season where the new orleans saint win, it appears as though it is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After reviewing the table and relevant rows (4, 13, and 14), we verified how many times the Saints won out of total games played.

List all attendance values from the table:\n   - Week 1: 57760\n   - Week 2: 74488\n   - Week 3: 45320\n   - Week 4: 58053\n   - Week 5: 56364\n   - Week 6: 48152\n   - Week 7: 44784\n   - Week 8: 54082\n   - Week 9: 49030\n   - Week 10: 47365\n   - Week 11: 52104\n   - Week 12: 54117\n   - Week 13: 44122\n   - Week 14: 29527\n   - Week 15: 46065\n   - Week 16: 37717\n\n2. Find the smallest attendance value:\n   The smallest attendance value is 29527 in week 14.\n\n3. Check if the game with the least attendance was indeed against the Denver Broncos in Week 2:\n   In week 2, the opponent was \"denver broncos\" (note that the correct spelling should be \"Broncos\", but we are checking for a partial match), which is close to our target value. The date of this game is September 15, 1985.\n\n4. Since the claim specifies \"denver broncos\", we need a more precise match in spelling and capitalization. However, the table uses \"denver broncos\" instead of the capitalized correct form \"Denver Broncos\". Although it is close enough to be considered true, this fact might lead one to question whether this could indeed be what was claimed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"List all attendance values from the table.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find the last two games of the season. We can do this by looking at the \"week\" column and finding the rows with values 14 and 15.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if the opponent won in a home game for both games found in step 1. To do this, we need to look at the \"opponent\" column for each of these games and verify that it's the same as the team's home stadium city (not provided in the table).
