We notice that there are multiple rows in the table where the home team score is above 80.\n\nNow let's identify relevant cells:\n\n1. North Melbourne - home team score: 18.10 (118)\n2. Carlton - home team score: 13.15 (93) \n3. Footscray - home team score: 13.14 (92)\n\nGiven these three values, we can see that the highest value is 18.10.\n\nNext step:\n\n5.
