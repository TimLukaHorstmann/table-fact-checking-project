Now let's check if these partners match with claim statements\n   - If Elena likhovtseva is indeed the partner for Indian Wells in 2004 (from row 3), \n     - Then check that Martina Navratilova was not the partner at Toronto championship (row 2).\n   - If Martina Navratilova is indeed the partner for Toronto championship (row 2),\n     - Then Elena likhovtseva should have been the partner at Indian Wells in 2004 (row 3)\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- For claim statement validity:\n  ```\n{\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is true if Elena likhovtseva was indeed the partner for Indian Wells championship in 2004 and not Martina Navratilova.
