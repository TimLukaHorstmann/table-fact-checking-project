    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The claim states there is a positive correlation between the number of games lost and the number of games drawn.\n2. **Observe the table structure**: The table contains columns for \"games\", \"drawn\", and \"lost\".\n3. **Identify relevant data**: To check for a positive correlation, we need to examine how changes in one column (games lost) affect the other (games drawn).\n4. **Check if there's a relationship**: Since both \"games lost\" and \"games drawn\" are part of the same table, we can look at how many times each team draws more games than they lose.\n5. **Analyze data**: Looking at each row:\n   - Czechoslovakia has 0 lost games but also 0 drawn games.\n   - Soviet Union has 1 lost game and 0 drawn games.\n   - Canada, Sweden have some drawn games despite having a higher number of lost games than won games.\n   - West Germany, United States, East Germany, Finland all show that drawing more games can be associated with fewer or no losses.\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the data, there appears to be an inverse relationship where when one team loses more games (and thus draws less), they are likely corresponding teams.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated by observing that as a team loses more games (drawn fewer), they tend to correspond with teams drawing more games. This suggests an inverse correlation rather than a direct positive one, hence the answer needs correction based on this observation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}",

The countries mentioned are Czechoslovakia, Soviet Union, Canada, Sweden, West Germany, United States, East Germany, and Finland.\n\n2. Determine which of these countries are located in the northern hemisphere: To do this, we can consider geographical locations associated with each country. For example:\n   - Canada is located north of the equator.\n   - Sweden and Finland are also located north of the equator.\n   - Czechoslovakia was geographically split between Eastern Europe (near the equator) and Western Europe, but for simplicity let's assume we're only considering the entire country as being in the northern hemisphere.\n\n3. Identify the countries not from the northern hemisphere: This would include:\n   - Soviet Union (the western part of Russia is near the equator)\n   - West Germany (located south of the equator)\n   - United States (located south of the equator)\n\n4. Determine if all competing teams are from countries located in the northern hemisphere: Since there are 8 teams, and we know that not all of them meet this criterion, we can conclude that it is FALSE.\n\nHere's a JSON object with our answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified the countries in the table.

This means I need to calculate the total points for each team by subtracting their games won from their points, and then compare this value with the number of losses.\n\n3. **Calculate total points for each team**:\nFor each row in the table:\n- Get the points: Take the value in the \"points\" column.\n- Get the drawn (games won): Subtract 0 (drawn) from the points to get games won, because a drawn game does not contribute to winning or losing. However this step can be ignored as there is no other way to calculate total points for each team\n- Get the lost (games lost): Take the value in the \"lost\" column.\n- Calculate the total points: Subtract the games lost from the points.\n\n4. **Compare with number of losses**: Compare the calculated total points with the number of losses for each team.\n\n5. **Repeat steps 3-4 for all teams**: Repeat the process for every row in the table to ensure that the claim is true for all teams.\n\n6. **Check if claim holds for all teams**:\nFor each team, check if total points equals to the number of lost games (games lost) and see if this condition holds true or false for every single row in the data frame.\n \n7. If for any row, it is not equal, output FALSE\n8. Else output TRUE\n\nHere are some relevant cells for checking:\n- \"points\" cell with \"row_index=0\" and column_name=\"points\"\n- \"games\" cell with \"row_index=0\" and column_name=\"games\"\n- \"lost\" cell with \"row_index=0\" and column_name=\"lost\"\n\nSince there is no more information to process, we can now output the final answer.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by examining each row of the table for values in 'points', 'drawn' and 'lost'. Then calculate total points for all teams using the formula: total_points = points - drawn. Compare this with the number of losses (games lost).
