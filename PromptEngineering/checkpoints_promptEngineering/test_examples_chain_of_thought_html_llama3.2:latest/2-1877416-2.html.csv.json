Since none of the rows besides rank 1 have silver values greater than zero except for the row with index 4, this will be our basis to make our decision about whether or not the claim is true.\n\n3. Now we know there are indeed other rankings with non-zero silver medal count and one ranking where the silver medal count was zero which is at rank 2. This information supports that \"rank 1 be the only 1 to receive silver medal\" is false.\n\n4.
