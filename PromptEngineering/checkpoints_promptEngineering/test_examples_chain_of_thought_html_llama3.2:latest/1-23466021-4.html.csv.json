The table shows a game involving the lions on August 27, but two games: one at Skydome with attendance 39508 (final score 34 - 25) and another in Iorwynne Stadium with attendance 18461 (final score 48 - 24).

The final score of 34 - 25 in Skydome on August 27 matches the lion's loss as claimed, but we need to check their record before this event.\n3. To verify the lion's current record, compare it with the row for game number 8: \"6-2\". This indicates a different outcome than stated in the claim (5 - 3), suggesting that the actual claim about August 27 might be incorrect because the lion lost that day and had not yet reached the final score of 34-25 mentioned.\n4. Comparing these details shows a discrepancy between what was claimed and what can actually happen according to the information provided in the table. The actual outcome is consistent with a loss but does not match the claim's specified new record value.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, there seems to be an error in interpreting how the lion lost at Skydome on August 27th affecting their current record.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the game where the lion loses, confirm date matches, extract final score and attendance to check for accuracy of claimed event outcome.
