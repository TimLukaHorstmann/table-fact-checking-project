    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that both V Zapata and Curiel were loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in 2008.\n2. First, we need to check if both players were indeed \"loaned out\" to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico. We can find this information in the table by looking at the row where the player's name is \"V Zapata\" and the row where the player's name is \"Curiel\".\n3. For V Zapata, we can see that he was loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in the third row of the table (index 2).\n4. For Curiel, we can also see that he was loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in the same row as V Zapata (row index 2).\n5. Since both players were indeed \"loaned out\" to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in the same row, this supports part of the claim.\n6. However, we need to check if Curiel was also loaned out at some point before or after 2008. The table does not provide a specific date for when each player was loaned out, but it does state that all the transfers occurred in the \"winter\" transfer window. Since V Zapata and Curiel were both loaned out in the same row (row index 2) and this row is listed as being from the \"winter\" transfer window, we can infer that both players were loaned out during the same time period.\n7.
