This indicates he should be on round 4.\n\n3. **Verify Gabriel Dumont's position on Round 5**: According to the claim, Gabriel Dumont should also be on Round 5. Looking at the table again, we can see that Gabriel Dumont's row index is indeed 5 and his \"round\" value matches with this number (5). This confirms he is supposed to be in round 5.\n\n4. **Check if Alexander Avtsin and Gabriel Dumont have different positions on their respective rounds**: Comparing the table, we can see that Alexander Avtsin's position is correct for Round 4 (\"right wing\"), but Gabriel Dumont's position is incorrect for Round 5 (\"center\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above steps, it appears that Alexander Avtsin is in round 4 with the correct position (\"right wing\") and Gabriel Dumont should be on round 5. However, since we are checking the claim as stated - and not just if both players meet their stated round number - then since one player was found to not have a match for his round (Gabriel Dumont), the entire claim must be considered false.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Understood the claim: Alexander Avtsin should be on Round 4 with Gabriel Dumont on Round 5.

This indicates that he is indeed from Omaha Lancers.\n4. However, to confirm if he is also from Omaha Lancers (USHL), we should check if his nationality matches with the team's location. The country of Canada has a USHL league, so it makes sense that Leblanc would be associated with this team.\n5. For Joonas Nattinen, the value in this column is \"Espoo Blues (jr A SM - Liiga)\". This indicates that he is indeed from Espoo Blues.\n6. We need to confirm if Nattinen is also from Espoo Blues ( jr A SM - Liaga), as the claim states.
