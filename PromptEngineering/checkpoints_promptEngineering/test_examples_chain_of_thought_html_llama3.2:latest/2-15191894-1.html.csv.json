We can do this by looking at the values in the \"name\" column for each row. Specifically, we're interested in the entries that correspond to Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully and Ed Weir Ralph Chase.\n\n3. For Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully, we see that they play both end positions (ends) and do not play any other position listed that is relevant to this claim (no college hall of fame entry or any entries in the unanimous column related to end positions).\n\n4. However, for Ed Weir Ralph Chase, they only play one specific position: tackle.\n\n5. Therefore, our reasoning process reveals that Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully plays both end positions and do not play the tackle position but Ed Weir Ralph Chase does not play another specified position besides tackle, so he is playing the exact tackle position stated in the claim.\n\n\n6.

Let's check the table for the position 'ends':\n   - In the guards row (row index 3), we see \"diehl hess both played end\", which confirms that this part of the claim is true.\n   - However, we need to verify if Diehl and Hess played end as a team.\n\n3. Moving on to another relevant position 'halfback':\n   - In the halfbacks row (row index 6), we see \"weir and chase play halfback\", which confirms that this part of the claim is true.\n\n4. Now, let's confirm if Weir and Chase played end:\n   - In the tackles row (row index 2), we see \"weir hof profile no\" for 'college hall of fame'. However, there isn't enough information in this cell to determine if Weir played end.\n   - There is another relevant position that could indicate if either Weir or Chase played end:\n     - In the halfbacks row (row index 6), we see \"oberlander hof profile grange hof profile\" for 'college hall of fame'. However, there isn't enough information in this cell to determine if Oberlander or Grange played end.\n   - Let's check another position:\n     - In the guards row (row index 3), we see \"no no\" for both unanimous and college hall of fame. This implies neither Diehl nor Hess played end.\n\n5. Finally, let's verify that Weir did not play end:\n   - As mentioned earlier in step 4, there isn't enough information to determine if Weir played end.\n   - However, since the claim is saying both Weir and Chase play halfback, and we've already verified this part of the claim as true (step 3), we can say that this aspect of the claim holds.\n\n6. The claim says Diehl Hess both played end which has been shown to be false in step 4. However since Diehl hess plays guard not end, Weir and Chase are halfback which is also true.\n \n7. Combining steps 5 and 6: Since we have verified that Weir does not play end (step 4) and the claim about Weir being a halfback has been confirmed as true, but Diehl Hess both played guard (not ends), this means one part of the claim is false.\n \n8.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. Extract the information about Nevers from Michigan: \n   - We see in the table that Nevers played for Stanford, not Michigan. So, we can conclude that claim 2 about \"nevers from michigan\" is False.\n\n2. Find the information about Swede playing tackle:\n   - We see in the table that \"Swede\" (Andy Swede Oberlander) was indeed part of a row where he played fullback and halfback but his status as a player for the position we're looking at (\"tackle\") can be derived from a 3rd row down in the data.\n\n    For tackling, we see that Andy Swede played tackle for Nebraska.\n\n\n3. Find information about Grange playing fullback:\n   - We see in the table that \"Red Grange\" (Andy Red Grange) indeed played fullback.\n\n\n4. Combine this knowledge: \n   From steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that claim is actually FALSE because \"nevers from michigan\" did NOT play tackle with Swede, but rather with a player from Nebraska who also played tackle.",
