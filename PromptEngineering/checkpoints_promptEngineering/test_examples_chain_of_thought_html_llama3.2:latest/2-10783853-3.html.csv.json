The relevant cells for this verification would be:\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Truth of Claim Based on Table Data\nLooking at the table data:\n- In the \"away team\" column for row 0, St Kilda is listed. \n- In the \"home team\" column for row 1, Fitzroy is listed.\n- The venue for both these teams (at their respective rows) does not match Brunswick Street Oval.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the data again:\n- In the \"venue\" column for row 0, St Kilda plays at Brunswick Street Oval. \n- In the \"home team\" column for row 1, Fitzroy also plays at Brunswick Street Oval.\nThis makes the claim FALSE.\n\n#### Step 5: Compile Full Reasoning Process and Final Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified claim by checking venue matches. St Kilda plays at Brunswick Street Oval while Fitzroy does not.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
