First, we need to identify the oldest winner from the table.\n   - The oldest winner can be determined by comparing the ages listed for each winner.\n   - In this case, Clint Eastwood, with an age of 74 years old at the time of winning in 2004.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the oldest nominee's age when they were nominated.\n   - John Huston was 79 years old at the time of nomination in 1985.\n\n3. Now that we have identified both the oldest winner (Clint Eastwood) and the oldest nominee (John Huston), let\u2019s examine their ages more closely. We can see from the table that Clint was 74 years old when he won, while John was 79 years old at nomination time.\n   - However, neither of them were exactly 70, so we need to compare each of them with another person in the data.\n\n4. Let\u2019s look for someone who also received an award and is older than 70.\n   - The oldest age from the table is 79, which belongs to John Huston.\n\n5. Now let's see if there was any nominee (youngest) who was exactly 70 years old at nomination time or a winner over 70 that won at exactly 70 or under:\n   - Clint Eastwood was older than 70 when he won.\n   - Norman Taurog, the youngest winner at 32 years of age, was significantly younger than both John Huston and Clint Eastwood.\n\n6.

This implies we need to compare the number of nominations William Wyler received with twice the number of nominations John Ford received.\n\n2. **Locate relevant cells in the table**:\n   - For John Ford, look for the row with \"superlative\" = \"most awards\", \"director\" = \"john ford\", and \"record set\" = \"4 awards\". The value for this cell is \"4 awards\".\n   - For William Wyler, look for the row with \"superlative\" = \"most nominations\", \"director\" = \"william wyler\", and \"record set\" = \"12 nominations\". The value for this cell is \"12 nominations\".\n\n3. **Evaluate claim based on relevant cells**:\n   - John Ford's total nominations are not directly provided, so we need to infer it from the statement \"awards resulted from 5 nominations\". Since his record of most awards is given as 4, and it's mentioned that these 4 awards were a result of 5 nominations, we can infer that John Ford had at least 5 nominations. However, since only one specific nomination count is directly provided (for awards resulting in those 5 nominations), we cannot accurately calculate his total nominations from the table directly.\n   - William Wyler's total nominations are given as \"12 nominations\".\n\n4. **Calculate claim based on available data**:\n   - Since we can't determine John Ford's exact number of nominations, we'll have to focus on what we know about William Wyler and compare it against a hypothetical threshold for John Ford that is at least double his known awards (since awards are a result of those nominations). For this evaluation, assuming John Ford received twice as many nominations as he did awards because all his awards came from the same number of nominations, we can infer that if John Ford has 4 awards and they're \"awards resulted from 5 nominations\", then for every award (in terms of count), he had at least 1.25 times more nominations than awards. So to find twice the amount of nomination as John Ford would be \"2 * (nominations + 1)\".\n   - For William Wyler, who has 12 nominations, and if we apply our calculated threshold from above (\"twice the number of his known awards\"), then William Wyler's total is below double that threshold since his total (12) is less than twice the value \"2 * 5\" = 10.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process involving table data,\n    - Claim: 'william wyler receive less than 2 time the amount of nomination as john ford'\n    - Relevance: Knowing John Ford's awards and William Wyler's nominations to compare against our calculated threshold for comparison,\n      We infer that if we were comparing 'twice the number of his known awards' (John Ford) to\n      'twice that amount plus one more', then our threshold can be set as 10.
