Upon re-examining our previous steps, it's clear that we made an error in our count for the visiting teams.

To verify this, we need to check the \"attendance\" column for each game where Vancouver is playing (i.e., rows with \"visitor\" = \"vancouver\").\n3. Let's identify those rows: \n    - Row 1: attendance = 10425\n    - Row 4: attendance = 10575\n    - Row 9: attendance = 15858\n    - Row 10: attendance = 20214\n    - Row 12: attendance = 16150\n    - Row 13: attendance = 16150 (same game as row 12, but attendance is different)\n4. Now we check if there are more than 15000 crowd attendance for these games:\n    - Row 1: 10425 < 15000 ( FALSE )\n    - Row 2: 10575 > 15000 ( TRUE )\n    - Row 9: 15858 > 15000 ( TRUE )\n    - Row 10: 20214 > 15000 ( TRUE )\n    - Row 12: 16150 > 15000 ( TRUE )\n    - Row 13: 16150 > 15000 ( TRUE ) - although it's the same game, attendance for row 13 is indeed greater\n5.

The relevant cells are:\n- `attendance`\n- `row_index`: We will use this to determine which row corresponds to a specific game.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the threshold value\nThe claim states that there should be fewer than 15000 crowd attendance for 6 of Vancouver's games.\n\n#### Step 4: Examine each relevant cell\nWe will iterate through the table and check if the attendance value for each game played by Vancouver is less than 15000.\n\n#### Step 5: Compare with the threshold value\nIf the attendance value is less than 15000, we increment a counter. After examining all games, we compare the counter value with 6.\n\n```html\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe table table-striped\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>visitor</th>\n      <th>score</th>\n      <th>home</th>\n      <th>decision</th>\n      <th>attendance</th>\n      <th>record</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 1</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>5 - 3</td>\n      <td>tampa bay</td>\n      <td>whitmore</td>\n      <td>10425</td>\n      <td>41 - 27 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 3</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>1 - 5</td>\n      <td>detroit</td>\n      <td>mclean</td>\n      <td>19875</td>\n      <td>41 - 28 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 4</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>3 - 0</td>\n      <td>ottawa</td>\n      <td>whitmore</td>\n      <td>10575</td>\n      <td>42 - 28 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 7</td>\n      <td>edmonton</td>\n      <td>4 - 5</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>mclean</td>\n      <td>15858</td>\n      <td>43 - 28 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 9</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>1 - 8</td>\n      <td>calgary</td>\n      <td>mclean</td>\n      <td>20214</td>\n      <td>43 - 29 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 11</td>\n      <td>calgary</td>\n      <td>3 - 6</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>mclean</td>\n      <td>16150</td>\n      <td>44 - 29 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 13</td>\n      <td>los angeles</td>\n      <td>4 - 7</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>whitmore</td>\n      <td>16150</td>\n      <td>45 - 29 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>april 15</td>\n      <td>vancouver</td>\n      <td>8 - 6</td>\n      <td>los angeles</td>\n      <td>whitmore</td>\n      <td>16005</td>\n      <td>46 - 29 - 9</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Iterated through the table and checked attendance values for each game played by Vancouver.
