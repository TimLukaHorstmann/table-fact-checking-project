However, this expedition contains another entry where Yuri Romanenko's name is indeed listed in the crew, but that belongs to Soyuz 27. We also see that he is paired with Georgi Grechko.\n2. Now we need to verify if Yuri Romanenko was a member of the Soyuz 38 flight up crew.\n\t* According to the table, the \"flight up\" for Soyuz 38 is listed as \"soyuz 38\".\n\t* The cell containing Yuri Romanenko's name is in row index 9 and column name \"crew\", where he is indeed listed alongside Arnaldo Tamayo M\u00e9ndez. This indicates that Yuri Romanenko was a member of the crew.\n3. Finally, we need to confirm if Yuri Romanenko was also part of the Soyuz 26 flight up crew, which would mean that we have found an inconsistent information in the given data.\n\t* Since we have established that he is indeed part of the Soyuz 38 crew and we know from another entry of his name paired with Georgi Grechko that this belongs to Soyuz 27 and not 26, it seems like there was some confusion regarding his membership to both Soyuz 26 and 38. This makes our initial conclusion seem plausible.\n4. Given that we have found evidence of Yuri Romanenko being part of the flight up crew for Soyuz 38 but no clear indication of him being a member of the Soyuz 26 flight up crew, we must consider that the claim is not entirely accurate.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if Yuri Romanenko was a member of the Soyuz 26 crew\",\n    \"Check if Yuri Romanenko was a member of the Soyus 38 crew\",\n    \"Confirm the inconsistency with the given data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crew\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"crew\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To evaluate the claim, we need to find the duration of the expedition Salyut 6 - EP-6 and compare it with the duration of the expedition Salyut 6 - EP-1.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that the launch date for Salyut 6 - EP-6 is 5 June 1980 14:19:30. To find the landing date, we need to look up the \"landing date\" column for this specific row.\n\n3. The landing date for Salyut 6 - EP-6 is 9 June 1980 12:39:00.\n\n4. We can now calculate the duration of Salyut 6 - EP-6 by subtracting its launch date from its landing date: \n\n   9 June 1980 12:39:00 - 5 June 1980 14:19:30 = 3 days and 18 hours.\n\n5. Next, we need to find the duration of Salyut 6 - EP-1 by looking up the \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 1\" row in the table. The landing date for Salyut 6 - EP-1 is 26 May 1980 15:06:23.\n\n   We can calculate the duration of Salyut 6 - EP-1 by subtracting its launch date from its landing date:\n\n   Since we don't know the exact launch date for Salyut 6 - EP-1, we will use the \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 1\" row's value in the table. The value is 7.87 days.\n\n6. Now that we have both durations, we can compare them. To find out if the duration of Salyut 6 - EP-6 last more than 80 day longer than Salyut 6 - EP-1, we will subtract the duration of Salyut 6 - EP-1 from Salyut 6 - EP-6:\n\n   Since the \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 6\" row's value in the table is not the actual launch date but rather a specific cell that contains information for this expedition, we will use its value to calculate the duration of Salyut 6 - EP-6.\n\n   The value in the cell is 3.93 days which we calculated earlier.\n\n   The value of Salyut 6 - EP-1's duration is 7.87 days. Now let us subtract this from Salyut 6 - EP-6's duration:\n\n   7.87 - 3.93 = 3.94\n\n7. Comparing the durations, we see that 3.94 days (Salyut 6 - EP-6) is greater than 80 days.\n\n8. Therefore, the claim \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 6 last more than 80 day longer than expedition salyut 6 - ep - 1\" is TRUE.\n\n\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We calculated that Salyut 6 - EP-6 duration was 3.94 days and Salyut 6 - EP-1 duration was 7.87 days.\\nSalyut 6 - EP-6 duration is greater than 80 day longer than Salyut 6 - EP-1 because 7.87 - 3.94 = 3.94 > 80\\nTherefore the claim is TRUE\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 6\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 1\"}]",

The table lists two flights where Yuri Romanenko was part of:\n   - Flight up: Soyuz 26\n   - Landing date: 16 March 1978\n\n2. We need to find if there is any information about the crew for these missions.\n\n3. Looking at the table again, we can see that:\n   - In the first row, Yuri Romanenko is listed as a member of \"salyut 6 - eo - 1\" and Soyuz 26.\n   - In the second row, Yuri Romanenko is listed as a member of \"salyut 6 - ep - 1\" and Soyuz 27.\n\n4. The claim says that Yuri Romanenko be a member of both flight up crew for Soyuz T-4 and Soyuz T-6.\n\n5. Looking at the table again, we can see that:\n   - There is no information about the crew for \"Soyuz T-4\" directly in the table.\n   - However, there is information about the crew for \"soyuz t - 2\" (which is a different type of spacecraft) and \"soyuz t - 3\" (another different type).\n   - Also, we see that in \"salyut 6 - ep - 8\", Yuri Romanenko is listed as a member of Soyuz T-38 crew.\n   - Similarly, in \"salyut 6 - eo - 5\", Yuri Romanenko is listed as a member of Soyuz T-3 crew.\n\n6. From the table, we can't find any information about the flight up Soyuz T-4 crew that includes Yuri Romanenko.\n\n7. However, we can see that in \"salyut 6 - eo - 5\", there are two members for Soyuz T-3:\n   - Leonid Kizim\n   - Oleg Makarov (who is also listed as a member of the flight up Soyuz 27)\n   - Gennady Strekalov\n\n8. Looking at the table again, we can see that Yuri Romanenko was not listed as a member of any other \"soyuz t\" mission apart from \"salyut 6 - ep - 8\".\n\n9. Based on the information available in the table, it is not possible to conclude whether Yuri Romanenko be a member of both flight up crew for Soyuz T-4 and Soyuz T-6.\n\n10. However, we can see that there are two missions (Soyuz T-2 and Soyuz T-3) where Yuri Romanenko was a part of the landing date. But we also know that he was listed as a member of \"salyut 6 - ep - 8\" with Soyuz T-38 crew.\n\n11. Since there are two different \"soyuz t\" missions that include Yuri Romanenko in the table, but not both Soyuz T-4 and Soyuz T-6 directly, we can't determine this claim based on the information available.\n\n12. However, upon further review of the original statement, it appears that it contains an error. The correct interpretation should be that \"yuri romanenko was a member of flight up soyuz t - 2 crew but not listed in the table for the relevant row for Soyuz T-6.\"",
