The first step is to examine the row in the table corresponding to the vessel \"marianarray\". This can be done by looking at the HTML code for the table and finding the row with the correct values.\n2. Once we find this row, we need to determine its column values.

    "resp": "#### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim to be verified is \"the vessel gallion has the lowest maximum speed of 26 knot.\"\n2. **Locate the Gallion in the Table**: Find the row in the table that corresponds to the vessel \"gallion\". This can be done by looking for the cell with the value \"gallion\" in the \"vessel\" column.\n3. **Extract the Speed Value**: Extract the speed value from the \"max speed\" column of the row corresponding to the gallion. The speed value is given as \"30 knots\".\n4. **Find the Row with the Lowest Maximum Speed**: Compare the speed values in the table and identify which one is the lowest.\n5. **Verify if Gallion has the Lowest Speed**: Check if the speed value for gallion (30 knots) matches the claim that it has the lowest maximum speed of 26 knot.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the row corresponding to the vessel 'gallion'\\nExtract its speed value as 30 knots\\nCompare with other vessels and find a lower speed, which is not present in the table, so gallion indeed has the lowest maximum speed of 26 knot\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"vessel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"max speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The table does not have a row with 26 knots for any vessel. Therefore, the gallion indeed has the lowest maximum speed of 30 knots in the given data set.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"...\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [...]\n}",
