We see that each state (alabama, pennsylvania, california, indiana) has only one successor formal installed before February 4, 1857.\n9. Finally, since we know each of these four states had at least one date within the specified range, there are indeed two or more successors in congress between 1855 and 1857.\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyzing the table structure to understand what information it provides.\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"We are looking for successors in Congress between 1855 and 1857.
