For example, in row #1 we have a system with petrol engines and single-point, but it's clearly not what our claim is asking about.\n\n\n### Relevant cells for evaluation\nSince the relevant conditions are not met in any of the rows according to the description given, relevant_cells can be constructed from those that don't match the condition specified by the claim:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Claim evaluated against table data. Claim stated a fuel system with multi point fuel injection also have sohc 8v. No row in the table has both 'fuel system' value of 'multi-point fuel injection' and 'valvetrain' equal to 'sohc 8v'. Relevant cells that show this are: [1, \\\"engine\\\", \\\"dohc 16v\\\"]\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"valvetrain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis above, our claim is false.",
