From the given table, the total number of gold medals is 21 and the total number of bronze medals is also 42.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare the Total Silver Medals with the Sum of Gold and Bronze Medals\nSince the claim states that silver medal awards should be equal to the combination of all gold and bronze medals, we need to check if the sum of gold (21) and bronze (42) medals equals the total number of silver medals (21).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verify the claim by comparing the total number of silver medals with the sum of gold and bronze medals.
