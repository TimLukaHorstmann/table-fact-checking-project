We also know that the current year is 2023 and the height in feet for each building is given.\n\n2. Now we need to find the row that corresponds to the current tallest building in Montreal. Looking at the table, we can see that the column \"years as tallest\" has a start date of 1992 for the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re building. This suggests that this building is currently the tallest.\n\n3. Now we need to verify whether the claim is true or false by comparing it with our findings. From step 1, we identified the relevant column as \"height m / ft\" and from step 2, we found a row corresponding to the current tallest building in Montreal.\n\n4. Since the height for the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is given as 205/673 (where 673 corresponds to the current year), it is likely that this is the current tallest building in Montreal.\n\n5. Next, we need to check if there are any other buildings that could be taller than the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. We can do this by looking at their years as tallest.
