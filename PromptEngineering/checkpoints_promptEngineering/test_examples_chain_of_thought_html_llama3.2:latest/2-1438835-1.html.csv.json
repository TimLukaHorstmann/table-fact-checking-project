For example, in the group H matches for the 2013-14 season, Sevilla scored 2 - 0 and then lost 3 - 1 against Estoril, but they still ended up with a home advantage.\n\nHowever, one of the most prominent instances is that Feyenoord scored 0 - 1 away to their opponents in round three of the UEFA Cup for the 2001-02 season. \n\nLet's continue looking at the other matches. The highest away score seems to be 4 - 1 from a group H match for the 2013-14 season.\n\n#### Step 4: Find instances of away scores being 0 - 0\nLooking at the \"away\" column, we see that there are two instances where the score is 0 - 0. \n\nThe first instance is in the 1995 - 96 season with a match against Slavia Prague.\n \nThe second instance is also in the 2001 - 02 season with a match against St Gallen.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false\nFrom our analysis, we can see that:\n- The highest away score is indeed 4 - 1 (in the group H matches for the 2013-14 season)\n- There are two instances where the away scores were 0 - 0, one in each of the 1995 - 96 and 2001 - 02 seasons.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true.",

Freiburg in 1995-96, but not necessarily in \"second round\". However, Matador P\u00fachov, also participated in 2001-02 and was in the Second Round of the UEFA Cup with Feyenoord.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if there are two occurrences for F.C. Freiburg in the second round of the UEFA cup competition in the seasons mentioned.\n   - From the table, we can see that F.C. Freiburg participated in the \"third round\" but not a second round in 2001-02 and it is unclear when they played in a second round.\n\n3. Then, evaluate if this information confirms or denies the claim.\n   - The claim states that F.C. Freiburg plays in thesecond round on two occasions. However, we found only one instance where this happened (Feyenoord) but not in both of 2001-02 and another separate second-round event which does confirm that there was indeed a second round appearance by the team.\n\n4. Determine if relevant rows were found.\n   - Row 3, 6, and 7 can be considered because Feyenoord was involved in the UEFA Cup with Freiburg twice and we saw Slavia Prague (from Season 1995-96) which does fit into that timeframe.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant table data related to F.C. Freiburg's second round appearances are found in rows 3, 6, and 7 of the table where Feyenoord was involved with Freiburg twice (2001-02), but no single row confirms that this happened twice for Freiburg alone. However, one more instance exists (row 7) which is part of another Second Round event in a different round than what the claim states. Yet there are two instances of F.C. freiburg playing in a third round, and an instance where Slavia played in season 1995-96 which does imply that F.C. Freiburg participated in UEFA Cup in that year.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}",
