The total area of the People's Republic of China (PRC) can be calculated by adding up the areas of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.\n2. We need to find the areas of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet Autonomous Region within the PRC.\n3.

Compare the area value of Xinjiang (`66000`) with the total area of PRC (`9630960`) minus the area of Tibet (`3718530`).\n6.

Find the row indices and column names of Guangxi and Shanxi provinces:\n    - Guangxi: Row index 8, Column name \"Province\"\n    - Shanxi: Row index 21, Column name \"Province\"\n\n2. Extract the area values from the table for both provinces after conversion to square kilometers:\n    - Guangxi (km\u00b2): 239200\n    - Shanxi (km\u00b2): 207600\n\n3. Convert these areas from km\u00b2 to mi\u00b2 using the conversion factor (1 km\u00b2 = 0.3861 mi\u00b2):\n    - Guangxi (mi\u00b2): 239200 * 0.3861 \u2248 92251.92\n    - Shanxi (mi\u00b2): 207600 * 0.3861 \u2248 80045.76\n\n4. Calculate the difference in area between the two provinces:\n    Difference = Guangxi (mi\u00b2) - Shanxi (mi\u00b2)\n                \u2248 92251.92 - 80045.76\n                \u2248 12206.16 mi\u00b2\n\n5. Compare this difference to 10 square miles:\n    Since 12206.16 mi\u00b2 is not equal to 10 mi\u00b2, the claim that the difference in area between Guangxi and Shanxi be only 10 sq mi is false.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Find the row indices and column names of Guangxi and Shanxi provinces.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract the area values from the table for both provinces after conversion to square kilometers:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Convert these areas from km\u00b2 to mi\u00b2 using the conversion factor (1 km\u00b2 = 0.3861 mi\u00b2):\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate the difference in area between the two provinces:\",\n      \"result\": 12206.16\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare this difference to 10 square miles:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Since 12206.16 mi\u00b2 is not equal to 10 mi\u00b2, the claim that the difference in area between Guangxi and Shanxi be only 10 sq mi is false.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"Province\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"Province\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
