Identify the row for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) from the table:\n\t* Row index: 0\n\t* Column name: opposition\n\t* Value: Chennai Super Kings\n2. Extract the number of lost matches for CSK from the same row:\n\t* Cell value at row index 0, column \"lost\": 8\n3. Identify the row for Delhi Daredevils (DD) from the table:\n\t* Row index: 1\n\t* Column name: opposition\n\t* Value: Delhi Daredevils\n4. Extract the number of lost matches for DD from the same row:\n\t* Cell value at row index 1, column \"lost\": 4\n5. Calculate the difference in the number of lost matches between CSK and DD:\n\t* Difference = Number of lost matches for CSK - Number of lost matches for DD\n\t* Difference = 8 - 4\n\t* Difference = 4\n6. Check if the calculated difference (4) is indeed more than what the team lost to Delhi Daredevils:\n\t* Since 4 is equal to the difference, we need to verify this by checking another team's matches or using another metric.\n\n### Additional Verification for Accuracy:\n\nSince we have already verified that CSK lost 8 games and DD lost 4 games, let's check another team to confirm our result. For instance, we can compare the number of lost matches between CSK and DD with that of any other team in the table.\n\nLet's verify if CSK indeed lost more games than DD by comparing with the team Rajasthan Royals (RR):\n\t* Number of lost matches for RR: 5\n\t* Since 8 > 5, our initial calculation is correct.\n7. Determine the final answer based on the verification:\n\nThe claim that \"the team lost 4 more match to the Chennai Super King than they do to the Delhi Daredevil\" seems to be TRUE because CSK indeed lost 8 games while DD lost only 4.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified CSK and DD rows, extracted number of lost matches for both teams.

Compare calculated average with the claim's stated value (50%).\n\n5. Determine if the comparison made in step 4 is true or false based on whether the two numbers are equal.\n\n6. List all cells used to determine this result according to their position in the table, along with their corresponding values and types ('win %'). These will be necessary for providing clarity about how the answer was determined.\n\n\nHere is the code that implements these steps:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data from html into a DataFrame using pandas\nhtml_data = \"\"\"\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe table table-striped\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>opposition</th>\n      <th>span</th>\n      <th>lost</th>\n      <th>tied</th>\n      <th>win %</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>chennai super kings</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2013</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>40.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>delhi daredevils</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2013</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>60.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>kings xi punjab</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2013</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>55.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>mumbai indians</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2013</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>20.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>pune warriors india</td>\n      <td>2011 - 2013</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>80.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>rajasthan royals</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2013</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>50.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>royal challengers bangalore</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2013</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>47.33</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>sunrisers hyderabad</td>\n      <td>2013</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>50.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>deccan chargers</td>\n      <td>2008 - 2012</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>77.78</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>kochi tuskers kerala</td>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\"\"\"\n\ndf = pd.read_html(html_data)[0]\n\n# Apply filter to rows\ndf_filtered = df[df['opposition'].isin(['Sunrisers Hyderabad', 'Delhi Daredevils'])]\n\n# Extract win percentages and calculate average\navg_win_percent = (df_filtered['win %']).mean()\n\n# Make comparison with claim value\nis_true = avg_win_percent == 50\n\nprint({\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"\"\"\n    - First, identified rows where opposition was either 'Sunrisers Hyderabad' or 'Delhi Daredevils'.\n    - Extracted win percentages from those rows.\n    - Calculated average of extracted values. \n    - Compared calculated average with claim value (50%).\n    - Determined if comparison is true based on equality between the two numbers\n    \"\"\",\n    \"answer\": str(is_true).upper(),\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": 'win %'},\n        {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": 'win %'}\n    ]\n})\n```",
