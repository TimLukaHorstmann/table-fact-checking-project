We can start by finding the columns corresponding to the Cubs' name.\n\n2. Next, we'll identify the month of September in the table and look for any row that has a date in September 1989 (since there is no year column, we assume it's 1989).\n\n3. Since we're interested in the number of games played by the Cubs in September 1989, we should also consider rows where \"inning\" or \"score\" indicates that the Cubs were playing, not the opposing team.\n\n4. Now, we'll combine steps 1-3 to find all relevant cells.\n\n\nNow, let's apply these steps with our table:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Find rows corresponding to Cubs' games in September\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"inning\"}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Look for cells with date in September 1989\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Look for cells where Cubs' team is playing\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"inning\"}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Look for cells where Cubs' team is playing in September\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"inning\"}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Count the number of games played\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"inning\"},\n                {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"inning\"}\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```\n\nTherefore the answer is TRUE.",
