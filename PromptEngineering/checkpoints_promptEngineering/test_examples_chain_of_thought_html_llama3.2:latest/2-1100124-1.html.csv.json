This does not match our target.\n   - Game 6 is on October 14, but it seems there was an initial error in matching game dates; the correct table shows that both games are actually listed as playing at Busch Stadium (i) and have a time of 2:37.\n\n5. **Conclude based on verified information**:\n   Since we found that game 6 does not match its supposed date (October 14, when it was October 7 in the table) but both games are indeed listed with the same time of 2:37 at Busch Stadium, we need to correct our analysis regarding the initial claim about the dates.\n\nGiven this corrected understanding:\n   - Both game 5 and game 6 have a time of 2:37.\n   - However, we made an error in matching the dates. The original claim stated that both games should be on October 12 and October 14 for their respective times to be true. Based on our verification process, only game 6 matches its specified date correctly (October 14), not game 5.\n\n**Reevaluation of Conclusion**:\n   - Since we need all conditions in the original claim to be met, and with correct analysis, only one part of the claim is verified while another was misverified.\n   - The actual times listed for both games match (2:37), but there's an error regarding game dates. Therefore, our task is to clarify this mistake and correctly identify if the entire claim can still stand.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Read the claim, found relevant cells in the table, checked if all conditions were met by verifying date matches, concluded based on verified information, but with an error regarding game dates, so the chain-of-thought reveals the process, and the answer is False because not both specified games have matching dates as claimed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}",
