We then check if there are any missing values for both columns by looking at the row with index 3 and finding that one of the column \"former ranking tournaments\" is indeed empty.\n6.

According to the table, the relevant columns are 'ranking tournaments' (for overall ranking) and 'former ranking tournaments' (for specific former ranking positions).\n\n#### Step 3: Find Liu Song's Ranking in 2010 / 11\nLooking at the table, we find Liu Song's ranking for variant format tournaments (which includes former ranking tournaments) in 2010/11. The relevant cell is at row index 34, column name 'variant format tournaments', with value 'a'.\n\n#### Step 4: Find Liu Song's Ranking in 2011 / 12\nSimilarly, we look up Liu Song's ranking for the same position in 2011/12. According to the table, at row index 35, column name 'former ranking tournaments', the value is '3r'.\n\n#### Step 5: Calculate the Change in Ranking\nTo verify if Liu Song fell 5 places, we need to compare his rankings between 2010/11 and 2011/12. Since the exact values of the rankings are not provided for each year, we'll assume that the rank value 'a' (or '3r') is equivalent to a very low position (assuming this as our basis due to lack of specific data) in 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12. The change from 'a' or '3r' implies Liu Song actually increased his ranking, not fell.\n\n#### Step 6: Draw Conclusion\nGiven that we cannot accurately determine the exact rank values but can infer a significant increase from 'a' to '3r', the claim that Liu Song \"fell\" is incorrect based on our interpretation of available data.

In most years, the value is either \"not held\", \"lq\", or a number indicating a specific ranking (e.g., \"1r\", \"3r\").\n4. Since we're interested in Liu Song's lowest ranking, we'll look for the highest number in this column.\n5. In 2009 / 2010, the value is \"not held\".

However, we need to consider other factors as well.\n\nStep 6: Check for any other relevant data.\nIn row 30, under the \"variant_format_tournaments\" column, Liu Song is ranked #46. In row 31, under the same column, Liu Song is ranked #42. This suggests that his ranking in 2009 was actually better than in 2008.\n\nStep 7: Determine if this information supports the claim.\nSince Liu Song's ranking in 2009 was indeed in the top 50, and it is higher than his ranking in 2008, we can conclude that his best ranking was in 2009.\n\nStep 8: List all relevant cells for reference.\n{\n\"row_index\": 30,\n\"column_name\": \"variant_format_tournaments\"\n},\n{\n\"row_index\": 31,\n\"column_name\": \"variant_format_tournaments\"\n}\n\nStep 9: Conclude the answer based on the analysis.\nGiven that Liu Song's ranking in 2009 was indeed in the top 50, and it is his best ranking according to the data, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n\"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant cells are those in rows 30 and 31 of the variant_format_tournaments column. Since Liu Song's ranking in 2009 was #42 and in 2008 was #46, his best ranking was indeed in 2009 when he made it into the top 50.\",\n\"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n{\n\"row_index\": 30,\n\"column_name\": \"variant_format_tournaments\"\n},\n{\n\"row_index\": 31,\n\"column_name\": \"variant_format_tournaments\"\n}\n]",
