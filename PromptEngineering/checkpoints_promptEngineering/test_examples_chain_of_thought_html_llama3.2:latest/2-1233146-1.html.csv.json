Let's look at the \"Group stages\" section again for other teams like FC Rubin Kazan and Tottenham Hotspur FC.\n6. Both of these teams have a column showing multiple games with different scores.\n7. Since Paok FC was listed as playing against both these teams in the Group stages, it is safe to assume they were part of the group.\n\n8.
