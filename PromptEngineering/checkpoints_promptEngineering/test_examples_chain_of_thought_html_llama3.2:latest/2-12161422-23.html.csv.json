    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the column to focus on\nTo determine whether Kevin Murray has a 3-year break in between his career span, we need to examine the 'career span' column.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Kevin Murray's data entry\nKevin Murray's data entry is listed under rank 9, with 'games', 'player', 'club', and 'career span'. The value for 'career span' is '1955 - 1964 , 1967 - 1974'.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify breaks in Kevin Murray's career span\nBreaking down the years mentioned for Kevin Murray's 'career span', we can see two separate intervals:\n- First interval: 1955 - 1964 (9 years)\n- Second interval: 1967 - 1974 (7 years)\n\nHowever, there is also an additional year within the first interval that is not part of either the second or third intervals. Thus the total career span must be calculated over two separate segments as follows:\n9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe gap can then be found by subtracting this value from 17.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if there are other players with a similar situation\nComparing Kevin Murray's data to the rest of the table, we find that Robert Harvey also has two separate time intervals in his 'career span'. However, the years do not add up exactly as 1978 + 1986 = 1964. But since he only had one year missing from each side instead of both (as with Kevin Murray), this does make him have a similar situation.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify other data for players\nAfter verifying more of the table, we see that Dustin Fletcher and Adam Goodes also both had two separate intervals in their career spans. However, like Robert Harvey's, they do not have exactly the same gaps as Kevin Murray's.\n\n#### Step 6: Compare all relevant data to determine if claim is TRUE or FALSE\nAfter examining all players' 'career span', we can see that only Kevin Murray has a gap of three years between his two time intervals (1964 - 1967 = 3). Therefore, the statement \"kevin murray be the only player who have a 3 year break in between\" is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 7: List relevant cells\nThere are several rows that contain information about players with career spans containing gaps, including Kevin Murray. Here are some of the most relevant ones:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"column_name\": \"career span\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 18,\n    \"column_name\": \"career span\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 20,\n    \"column_name\": \"career span\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 8: Finalize output\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Kevin Murray has a gap of three years between his two time intervals (1964 - 1967 = 3). Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"career span\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"career span\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"career span\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
