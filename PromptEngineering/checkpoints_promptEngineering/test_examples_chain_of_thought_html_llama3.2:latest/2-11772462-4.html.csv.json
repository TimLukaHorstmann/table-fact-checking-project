We need to find the row where NY Rangers play Washington and check their scores.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that there are multiple games involving Washington and NY Rangers with different scores: 0-2, 3-2, 0-5, 1-2, 4-1, 1-2, 4-3, and 4-3.\n3. Since each game has a separate row in the table, we can't make any assumptions about which score belongs to which specific row.\n\nNow, let's look at the rows where Carolina is playing Washington:\n4.
