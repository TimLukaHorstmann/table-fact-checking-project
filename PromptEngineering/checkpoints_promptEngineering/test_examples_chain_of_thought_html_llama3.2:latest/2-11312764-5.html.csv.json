    "resp": "#### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. First, let's find the rank and places for Cornelia Haufe Kersten Bellmann and Gabriele Beck Jochen Stahl.\n   - Looking at the table, we can see that Row Index 7 corresponds to Cornelia Haufe Kersten Bellmann and Column 'rank' shows her as Rank 32. Similarly, Row Index 12 corresponds to Gabriele Beck Jochen Stahl and her rank is shown as 114.\n\n2. Next, let's verify the claim by comparing their ranks.\n   - To check if Cornelia Haufe Kersten Bellmann's rank (32) is 5 places higher than Gabriele Beck Jochen Stahl's rank (114), we need to calculate a difference that would be equivalent to 5 places, which means subtracting the lower rank from the higher rank and then checking if it equals 7. However, since ranks are whole numbers starting at 1, to check for \"5 place higher\", let's first get the actual positions of both in terms of being ahead or behind each other. This would mean we need Cornelia Haufe Kersten Bellmann to be in position 117 (114+5), but she is at position 32.\n   \n3. Since her rank (32) does not meet the condition of being \"5 places higher\" than Gabriele Beck Jochen Stahl's rank (114), it means the claim is false.\n\n4. Now, let's list our relevant cells according to the provided JSON format:\n   ```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we found that Cornelia Haufe Kersten Bellmann has rank 32 and Gabriele Beck Jochen Stahl has rank 114.
