Since we are given a table with various events and results, our goal is to verify if this specific event occurred by examining the relevant rows in the table.\n3. We'll start from the \"grand prix de l'albigeois final\" row, as this is the most relevant event mentioned in the claim.\n\n#### Relevant Rows:\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n4. Now, let's examine each relevant row in the table:\n\t* Row 32: The event is indeed \"grand prix de l'albigeois final\", but the driver is listed as Juan Manuel Fangio, not Ken Wharton.\n\t* Row 33: The event is also \"grand prix de l'albigeois final\", and the driver is listed as Jose Froilan Gonzalez, not Ken Wharton.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSince neither row 32 nor row 33 matches the claim that Ken Wharton drove the BRM Type 15 at the Grand Prix de l'Albigeois final, we can conclude that this specific event did not occur.\n\n#### Final Answer JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"examined relevant rows in table and found no match for the claimed event\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
