If the song from \"dead guys remix\" was performed by different artists but originated from the same year, we need to check each case against this rule.\n\n### Step 4: Check Against Rule\n- For 2003:\n    - blondie's \"good boys\" is not a dead guys remix (the artist does not match), which already indicates a potential issue with one of the cases but let's continue for thoroughness.\n    - chicane's \"locking down\" is also not a dead guys remix because it doesn\u2019t have the artist name that should be 'dead guys remix'. \n    - lamb\u2019s song \u201cwonder\u201d does not seem to fit as per given data. Since there was confusion here, we look at 2005 for clarity.\n\n- For 2005:\n    - texas's \"can't resist\" is indeed a dead guys remix but the artist name doesn\u2019t indicate different artists; it\u2019s consistent with 'dead guys remix'. This fits the claim.\n\n### Step 5: Draw Conclusion\nGiven that there are songs from \"dead guys remix\" in 2003 and 2005 where all artists match, and considering the specific year mentioned in the claim (2010) does not contain a dead guys remix song but other conditions aren't explicitly violated. The critical oversight here is the assumption of different artists for 2003 cases based on an incorrect understanding that 'dead guys remix' implies a new or different artist from each entry.\n\nHowever, since we cannot verify the artist performing \"good boys\", \"locking down,\" and \u201cwonder\u201d as part of the claimed statement accurately due to missing details in the prompt about these tracks, it's difficult to conclude directly on their adherence to 'different artist but same song year' solely based on given data. The key information or clarification needed from the prompt seems to be missing.\n\nGiven the available data and focusing strictly on what we can infer directly (the presence of different artists with matching songs), a definitive answer cannot be accurately provided without more context, however, since we have found at least one case in 2005 that fits the description perfectly:\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Given data for certain cases does not strictly adhere to claim due to missing details or misinterpretation of 'dead guys remix' artist.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the condition for the claim**: The claim states that there should be at least one single artist who produces an album after 2005 with a listed album title.\n\n2. **Locate relevant information in the table**:\n   - Identify artists and their respective albums: Look at the \"artist\" column, \"album\" column, and filter by row index greater than 4 (since all rows before this have the same artist).\n   - For each artist, check if there is an album listed in the \"album\" column.\n\n3. **Apply the condition to the data**:\n   - Filter the table by artists with albums after 2005 (from row index 5 onwards).\n   - Check if any of these filtered rows have a non-empty value in the \"album\" column, which indicates that the album title is listed.\n   - If at least one such row exists, the claim is true.\n\n4. **Analyze the table data for truth**:\n   - From row index 5 onwards: Texas (2005) has an album titled \"red book\".\n   - Perry Mystique (2010) does not have a listed album title.\n\n5. **Draw a conclusion based on analysis**: Since there is only one artist who produces an album after 2005, and this artist's album has a listed title, the claim is true.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for JSON output**:\n   - row_index: 5\n   - column_name: artist (for \"Texas\")\n   - row_index: 9\n   - column_name: album (for \"red book\")\n\n#### Output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Identify the condition for the claim.

    "resp": "Step 1: Analyze the table structure\nThe table contains information about music releases, including the artist, song title, album, and remix.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant claim cells\nWe need to examine the \"song\", \"artist\", and \"year\" columns to determine if the song from a specific remix is performed by the same artist in different years.\n\nStep 3: Look for inconsistencies in the data\nThe table shows that for each remix, there are multiple releases with different albums. However, we also see that some artists have songs released in different years, which may affect the claim about performance consistency.\n\nStep 4: Check if any song appears under different artists in different years\nUpon reviewing the data, we notice that Pixie Lott's \"turn it up\" is listed as being remixed by \"dee - lux remix\", but it does not appear to be performed by the same artist in a different year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze table structure\",\n      \"description\": \"Understand the data layout\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant cells\",\n      \"description\": \"Determine which columns to examine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look for inconsistencies in data\",\n      \"description\": \"Check for potential issues with claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check consistency of song performance by artist across remixes\",\n      \"description\": \"Verify if any song appears under different artists in different years\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"artist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The \"relevant_cells\" list includes cells from rows 1-6, as the claim about performance consistency applies to the specific song \"turn it up\", which appears in these rows.",
