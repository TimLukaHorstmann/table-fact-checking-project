Other relevant columns include 'region' and 'catalog'.\n\n2. Extract data from each row related to paid downloads:\n   - Find rows where 'catalog' is not '-'. We can assume that if a catalog number is provided, there must be a physical product or digital release.\n   - In the first row for Indonesia, catalog is '-', which implies a release without a catalog number.\n\n3. Determine regions with paid download formats:\n   - From the table data, we find two instances where 'paid download' and a specific region: Australia (twice) and Indonesia.\n   - However, since Indonesia was not correctly identified as a single instance in step 2 due to its catalog being '-', we must look at it more carefully. We notice that Indonesia does have paid downloads in both formats (cd and cassette), which might be confusing but does indeed show two regions getting paid download formats.\n\n4. Analyze the claim:\n   - The claim states \"indonesia be the only region to get a paid download format release\". \n   - We've found at least one more region besides Indonesia with paid downloads, Australia.\n\n5.
