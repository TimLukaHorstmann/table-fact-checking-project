Since there is a consistent 5-year difference in the release years of the titles, we can verify this by checking the release years of other titles.

Check if there is a consistent 5-year difference in the release years of all titles:\n   - For 1996: 2000 - 1996 = 4, which does not match the claim.

Therefore, another title that does not support the claim.\n   - For 1999 (first): 2000 - 1995 = 5, which matches the claim.

Find rows where the value in the \"english title\", \"korean title\", and \"romanization\" columns is related to \"shim eun-ha\".\n\n3. Determine how many roles Shim Eun-ha has for these titles.\n\n4. Check if there are 2 different titles involved with Shim Eun-ha's role count from step 3.\n\n\n#### Reasoning Steps Code\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load table data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_html('table html')[0]\n\n# Define the columns we're interested in\ncols = ['english title', 'korean title', 'romanization']\n\ndef find_shim_eun_ha(df, cols):\n    # Find rows where Shim Eun-ha appears.\n    shim_eun_ha_rows = df[df['role'].str.contains('shim eun - ha')]\n\n    return shim_eun_ha_rows\n\n# Get relevant cell information\nrelevant_cells = [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"english title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"korean title\"},\n    # Add more relevant rows as needed.\n]\n\n\ndef verify_claim(df):\n    # Find rows where Shim Eun-ha appears.\n    shim_eun_ha_rows = find_shim_eun_ha(df, cols)\n\n    if len(shim_eun_ha_rows) < 2:\n        return False\n    elif len(shim_eun_ha_rows) == 2: \n        # Check each row separately for two different titles.\n        return (len(set(shim_eun_ha_rows[\"english title\"])) == 2 or \n                len(set(shim_eun_ha_rows[\"korean title\"])) == 2)\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Execute the claim verification function\nclaim_result = verify_claim(df)\n\nprint({\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Find rows with shim eun-ha's role, check how many titles are involved and if there are two roles from two different titles.\",\n  \"answer\": str(claim_result).lower(),\n  \"relevant_cells\": relevant_cells\n})\n```\n\n#### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Find rows with shim eun-ha\\\\u2019s role, check how many titles are involved and if there are two roles from two different titles.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"english title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"korean title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We go down through the entire dataset until we find any row with an english title year not equal to 1999.\n\n\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef determine_claim():\n    # Define table data based on given HTML structure\n    import pandas as pd\n    df = pd.read_html(\"your_data.html\")[0]\n\n    # Filter rows for the condition \"all of the title be release in the year 1999\"\n    filtered_rows = df[(df['year'] == 1999)]\n    \n    if not (len(filtered_rows) > 0):\n        return {\n            \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains no data that corresponds to a claim stating all titles were released in the year 1999.\",\n            \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": []\n        }\n    \n    # Define cells as objects with row_index and column_name\n    relevant_cells = [{\"row_index\": i, \"column_name\": col} for i, row in enumerate(filtered_rows) for col in range(len(row))]\n        \n    return {\n        \"chain_of_thought\": (\n            f\"The table contains {len(filtered_rows)} rows corresponding to the condition 'all of the title be release in the year 1999.'\\n\"\n            f\"Relevant cells are: {', '.join(f'{cell['row_index']} ({cell['column_name']})' for cell in relevant_cells)}\"\n        ),\n        \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n        \"relevant_cells\": relevant_cells\n    }\n\nresult = determine_claim()\nprint(result)\n```",
