This means that at least once during the first 10 stages, Davide Rebellin was in the general classification.\n   - Check the rest of the table to see if there are multiple rows where Davide Rebellin is in the general classification. There are indeed more than one occurrences, such as row 13 and row 16.\n\n3. **Find the relevant cells for Silvio Martinello**:\n   - Look at row 1, where it says \"silvio martinello\" is in \"general classification\". This means that at least once during the first 10 stages, Silvio Martinello was in the general classification.\n   - Check the rest of the table to see if there are multiple rows where Silvio Martinello is in the general classification.

Since there are 20 stages, we can list them out to find which one Davide Rebellin finishes last.\n\n```\n[16] [19] [21] [22]\n...\n[14] [15] [18] [20]\n...\n[6] [7] [8] [9]\n```\n\nWe need to look at the results in the table, not the stages themselves. \n\nHowever, Davide Rebellin was also a general classification winner for many stages.\n\n1. We can list out his positions:\n   - Stage 3: 4th\n   - Stage 5: 3rd\n   - Stage 10: 2nd\n   - Stage 14: 15th \n   - Stage 16: Winner\n   - Stage 19: Winner\n   - Stage 20: 8th\n\nThe first stage where Davide Rebellin was the loser (finished last), can be any of these stages. Since he won several stages, we need to check if any other stage with a lower position than him had a winner.\n\n2. For each stage where Davide Rebellin finished 3rd or less, let's see who won:\n   - Stage 5: Alexander Gontchenkov\n   - Stage 10: Pavel Tonkov\n   - Stage 11 was not in the table but he also finished 3rd\n\nWe need to check other stages where Davide Rebellin didn't finish last and see if anyone else finished last.\n\n3. The only stage left with a position less than or equal to Davide Rebellin is Stage 3, where he finished 4th, however Alexander Gontchenkov won the general classification that day.\n\n\nHowever, Davide Rebellin also had another instance of finishing last in the overall standings for one stage.\nThe information provided does not explicitly show this but based on the data we have here, there are only two stages with his lowest finish at 4th and 3rd respectively. Hence our chain of thought ends here.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked all relevant positions for Davide Rebellin to see if he had a stage where he was the loser but also won another stage with the same lowest position as a general classification winner.

In this row, we see that Fabrizio Guidi's points are listed as \"fabrizio guidi\".\n7.
