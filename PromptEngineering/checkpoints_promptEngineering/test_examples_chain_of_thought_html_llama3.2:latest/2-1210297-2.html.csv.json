Specifically, we need to look at the columns \"laid down\", \"launched\", and \"completed\" for these two ships.\n\nStep 3: Convert dates into a comparable format\nTo compare the launch dates of \"havock\" and \"hasty\", we need to convert them into a common format. We can do this by comparing the day, month, and year of each date.\n\nFor \"hast\", the relevant cells are:\n- Laid down: 15 April 1935\n- Launched: 5 May 1936\n- Completed: 11 November 1936\n\nFor \"Havock\", the relevant cells are:\n- Laid down: 15 May 1935\n- Launched: 7 July 1936\n- Completed: 16 January 1937\n\nStep 4: Compare launch dates of \"hast\" and \"Havock\"\nWe now need to compare the launch date of \"hast\" with the launch date of \"Havock\". The claim states that the launch date of \"Havock\" is 8 months and 2 days after the launch date of \"hast\".\n\nStep 5: Calculate the expected launch date of \"Havock\"\nTo verify this, we need to calculate what the expected launch date would be if \"Havock\" was indeed launched 8 months and 2 days after \"Hast\". The difference between the two dates is approximately 70 days. Adding this difference to the launch date of \"hast\", we get:\n- Launched: 5 May 1936 + 70 days = 3 August 1936\n\nStep 6: Determine if Havock's launch date matches the expected date\nNow we compare the actual launch date of \"Havock\" (7 July 1936) with the expected launch date calculated in Step 5 (3 August 1936).
