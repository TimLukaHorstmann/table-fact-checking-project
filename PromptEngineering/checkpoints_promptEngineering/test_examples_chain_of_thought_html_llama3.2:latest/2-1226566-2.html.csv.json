    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, let's count the number of chassis produced by Lotus. We can do this by looking at the column labeled \"chassis\". The values for Lotus are: \"lotus 99t\", \"lotus 100t\", and \"lotus 101\".\n\n2. Next, we need to count the total number of times each chassis model is used across all rows. For \"lotus 99t\", it is used only once (in the year 1987). For \"lotus 100t\", it is also used only once (in the year 1988). For \"lotus 101\", it is used twice (in the years 1989 and 1990).\n\n3. Now, let's count the number of chassis produced by Tyrrell. The values for Tyrrell are: \"tyrrell 018\" and \"tyrrell 019\". Each of these chassis models is used only once.\n\n4. According to the claim, Lotus should produce more than one number of chassis than Tyrrell and the same model be use more than two times in total. In this case, we have 3 different chassis produced by Lotus (\"lotus 99t\", \"lotus 100t\" and \"lotus 101\") but only two models used more than twice (none) whereas three different chassis models of Tyrrell (\"tyrrell 018\" and \"tyrrell 019\") are each used exactly once.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim states that \"the honda v6 engine earn 3 more point than the cosworth v8 when compare in aggregate\". This means we need to compare the points earned by Honda V6 engines with those earned by Cosworth V8 engines across all years.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify the relevant rows and columns for comparison\nWe will focus on rows where both Honda V6 and Cosworth V8 engines are present. These rows are:\n- 1987 (Honda V6 has 7 points, but Cosworth V8 is not in this row)\n- 1988 (Honda V6 has 1 point, but Cosworth V8 is not in this row)\n- 1989 (Cosworth V8 has 3 points)\n- 1990\n  - Row 1: Tyrrell Racing Organisation's engine (Cosworth V8) has 3 points\n  - Row 2: Tyrrell Racing Organisation's engine (Cosworth V8) has 3 points\n- 1991 (Honda V10 is present, not V6)\n\nSince Honda V6 and Cosworth V8 are not in the same row in 1987, 1988, and 1991, we will only consider the relevant rows for 1989 and 1990.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the claim\nIn row 1989, Cosworth V8 has 3 points. In row 1990:\n- In row 1, Tyrrell Racing Organisation's engine (Cosworth V8) has 3 points.\n- In row 2, Tyrrell Racing Organisation's engine (Cosworth V8) has 3 points.\n\nHowever, the claim states that Honda V6 earns 3 more points than Cosworth V8. To evaluate this, we need to find out how many points Honda V6 earned in total.\n\n#### Step 4: Find the total points for Honda V6\n- In row 1987, Honda V6 has 7 points.\n- In row 1990:\n  - Row 1, no Honda V6 data (but Cosworth V8 has 3 points)\n  - Row 2, no Honda V6 data (but Cosworth V8 has 3 points)\n\nHowever, the claim that \"the honda v6 engine earn 3 more point than the cosworth v8\" must be evaluated against the total points for both engines in aggregate. In this case we will find out how many times they appear together and thus can compare the number of points each has.\n\n#### Step 5: Find the frequency of Honda V6 and Cosworth V8\n- The Honda V6 engine appears twice (in row 1987)\n- The Cosworth V8 engine appears three times (in rows 1989, 1990 Row 1 & 2)\n\n#### Step 6: Calculate total points for each engine if it were to appear in the same row as cosworth v8 \nSince Cosworth V8 has appeared 3 times with a total of 3 + 3 = 6 points.\n- The Honda V6 appears twice. In order to \"earn 3 more point than the cosworth v8\" for every appearance of both engines, it would need to have 9 points total (6 points from Cosworth V8's row + 3 extra points).\n\nSince this is not possible with only two appearances in the table and there are no other appearances with a different engine, we will conclude that the claim cannot be evaluated based on these premises.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nBased on our steps above, it is impossible to determine the validity of the claim as stated because we can't see that Honda V6 has 9 points total across all appearances when Cosworth V8 has a total of 6.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in reasoning here. Since we need the answer based strictly on the data given and comparing it directly, let us re-evaluate.\nIf \"the honda v6 engine earn 3 more point than the cosworth v8\" must be evaluated against the total points for both engines in aggregate.\n\n#### Step 7 (re-evaluated): Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nLet's look at how many times Honda V6 and Cosworth V8 appear together:\n- There are 2 rows where they appear: row 1987, row 1990 (Rows 1 & 2). In these two rows each has one appearance.\n- However, given the data provided we should determine if there is any year where they both have the same points.\n\nIn row 1989, Cosworth V8 has 3 points. For Honda V6 to \"earn 3 more point than the cosworth v8\" then it must have at least 6 points. Given that in row 1987, Honda V6 has 7 points, it already does this.\nGiven that we can't use row 1990 for calculation because of missing data on some cells and no comparison with Cosworth V8's total, the evaluation is limited to what is available.\n\nIn order to compare these claims properly, we must look at if both engines have the same amount in aggregate. Since Cosworth V8 appears 3 times (with a total of 6 points) and Honda V6 appears twice (but without any comparison with Cosworth V8's total), then it cannot be evaluated as the claim states.\n\nHowever, looking again at our data we can see that:\n- In row 1987, Honda V6 has 7 points. To \"earn 3 more point than the cosworth v8\" for every appearance of both engines it must have 10 points total.\n- Given this information and re-evaluating step 5 (since there are other appearances), we can see that:\n- Cosworth V8 appears 3 times with a total of 6 points.\n- Honda V6 also appears twice in the table.\n\nGiven the data, for both engines to have an equal amount of points then the two totals should be the same.\n\nSince this is impossible based on available data and the claim's requirements. It seems our evaluation was initially correct but let us refine it.\nGiven the information we have:\n- In row 1989, Cosworth V8 has 3 points.\n- If Honda V6 were to appear in a year with Cosworth V8 then it would need at least 10 points total (7 + 3).\nHowever given our data is as follows:\n\nIn rows 1990 Row 1 and Row 2 both engines appear, but we cannot calculate because we don't know the exact value of either engine. This is due to missing cell values.\n\nSo based on this it seems that there isn't enough data for us to accurately evaluate the claim.\n\nHowever considering other possible interpretations:\nSince Honda V6 appears twice with a total of 7 + 3 = 10 points (in row 1987), and Cosworth V8 also appears twice with a total of 6, then if this pattern holds true it would mean that the claim is indeed TRUE.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{TRUE}$",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify the rows for each entrant**: We need to find the rows where each entrant appears, as we want to compare their points across different years.\n\n2. **For each entrant, find its lowest point year**: For each row, we will check if the points are less than or equal to the points of other rows for the same entrant in any given year.\n\n3.  Compare the point in the claim's condition with the points of that particular entrant across all years and determine if it is indeed the lowest amount of point earned by that specific entrant in that particular year.\n\n4.  Once we have checked all entries, then we can provide our final answer based on whether the condition for a given entrant matches or not.\n\n5. After checking all entries, compare each row with every other entry to make sure this is the lowest amount of points earned by that specific team in that particular year. If we find any other entry in the table where points are lower than the ones found so far, then we should output False.\n\n\n\nBased on these steps:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the rows for each entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"For each entrant, find its lowest point year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the point in the claim's condition with the points of that particular entrant across all years and determine if it is indeed the lowest amount of point earned by that specific entrant in that particular year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check entries for Camel Team Lotus Honda and verify its entry against other entries\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify if this points are also lower than all entries of another team with lower total points for 1987\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the values in the table:**\n   - The Honda V6 engine earned 3 points in 1987 and 2 points in 1991.\n   - The Cosworth V8 engine earned 7 points in 1987 and 3 points in 1990.\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in points between the two engines for each year:**\n   - In 1987, the Honda V6 engine earned 3 points less than the Cosworth V8 engine (7 - 4 = 3).\n   - In 1989 and 1991, there was no direct comparison of the two engines.\n   - In 1990, the Cosworth V8 engine earned more points than the Honda V6 engine (3 - 3 = 0).\n\n3. **Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE:**\n   - The claim states that the Honda V6 engine earns 3 less points than the Cosworth V8 engine.\n   - Based on the calculations, this statement holds true for only one of the relevant years (1987) and does not hold for other years.\n\n4. **Identify relevant cells in the table:**\n   - Relevant cell 1: row_index=0, column_name='points' with values 7 (Cosworth V8 engine in 1987)\n   - Relevant cell 2: row_index=1, column_name='points' with values 3 (Honda V6 engine in 1987)\n   - Relevant cell 3: row_index=2, column_name='points' with value 3 (Cosworth V8 engine in 1990)\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim that the Honda V6 engine earns 3 less points than the Cosworth V8 engine is TRUE for only one of the relevant years.
