We see that at the American Airlines Center, game #77 has an attendance of 20301, which is higher than all other attendances listed for different games.\n6.  Compare this to the attendances recorded in the US Airways Center and other venues: 18422, 15908, 17781, and 18478.\n\n7.  The American Airlines Center stands out because it contains a game with significantly more attendance than any other venue on the list.\n8.  Thus, we conclude that for this claim to be TRUE, it needs to state \"the highest attendance\" without specifying if there are any ties or if it must mention all venues where the high attendance is recorded.\n\n9.  However, since our task is simply to evaluate whether the statement holds true given the data provided, we will proceed under the assumption that the claim aims to highlight American Airlines Center's record for highest attendance in games covered by the table.\n10. This indicates that the statement indeed aligns with the truth when focusing on this single venue.\n\n\n\n11. **Formulate answer**: As per our analysis and comparison of various attendances, we can safely assert that the highest recorded attendance (at 20301) is from the American Airlines Center for game #77.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step-by-step comparison of attendance figures at different venues.
