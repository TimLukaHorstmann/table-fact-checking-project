First, let's filter the table to only include rows where Keiko Tamai is listed as a winner:\n\t* Filter table to `Keiko Tamai == 'win'`\n3. Now, we need to extract the row indices of these wins:\n\t* Extract `row_index` for each filtered row\n4. For each win, check if there are exactly two rows below it where Keiko Tamai is listed as a loser:\n\t* Check if `(row_index + 1) < 11 && 'Keiko Tamai' == 'lose'`\n5. If the condition in step 4 is true for any of the wins, then we can conclude that Keiko Tamai loses two times after winning her first match.\n\n#### Code:\n\n```javascript\nconst table = [\n  // ... table data ...\n];\n\n// Filter rows where Keiko Tamai is a winner\nconst winRows = table.filter((row) => row['Keiko Tamai'] === 'win');\n\n// Extract row indices of wins\nconst winIndices = winRows.map((row, index) => ({ rowIndex: index }));\n\n// Check if each win has two losses after it\nconst result = winIndices.some((winIndex) => {\n  const nextRows = table.slice(winIndex.rowIndex + 1);\n  return nextRows.every((row) => row['Keiko Tamai'] === 'lose');\n});\n\nconsole.log({\n  chain_of_thought:\n    \"Filter rows where Keiko Tamai is a winner, extract row indices of wins, and check if each win has two losses after it\",\n  answer: result ?

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To find the most match Keiko Tamia won in a row, we need to identify all her winning streaks.\n2. We should start by identifying all cells where Keiko Tamia has won (i.e., the \"win\" column).\n3. From these winning cells, we will identify the ones that have no previous wins or losses immediately before them.\n4. For each identified cell, we'll check if there's at least one row immediately after it with a win for the same opponent.\n5. If the answer to step 4 is \"yes\", then the streak of wins continues from this row onwards.\n6. We will keep track of all such winning streaks and their lengths.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe'll consider cells where Keiko Tamia has won, because they are potential start points for a winning streak.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"win\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"win\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"win\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"win\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n- From row 1 to row 5, there are no previous wins or losses for opponent Yuiga Yuiga.\n- For rows 2 onwards, there is a win for the same opponent Yuiga Yuiga.\n  \n- However, there's a row with no win immediately before it (i.e., row 0 for opponent Keiko Tamia).\n\nHowever, according to the table structure given, we can't analyze row 0 because there are no rows available.\n\nThe streak of wins continues until row 5. \n\nThe length of this winning streak is 4.\n\n\n- For rows 3 onwards, there's a win immediately before it (i.e., row 2 for opponent Yuiga Yuiga).\n- However, according to the table structure given, we can't analyze row 0 because there are no rows available.\n\nThis winning streak doesn't count towards our total because we need a complete sequence of wins that doesn't break at any point due to another win or loss.\n\n\nThe length of this first winning streak is 1.\n\n- For other opponents, the winning streaks are broken immediately after a win or lose for opponent Keiko Tamia.\n- This results in no additional valid winning streaks beyond what we've already found.\n\n#### Final Conclusion:\n\nKeiko Tamia has one winning streak that consists of 5 wins: row 4. However, another streak is identified with the length 1 which doesn't meet our condition of \"5\".\n\n\nTherefore, she does not have a winning streak of exactly 5 matches.",
