Extract the values for 'rainfall by volume (km 3 / year)' from the table:\n   - Huetar Norte: 31.8 km^3/year\n   - Brunca: 35.4 km^3/year\n\n2. Compare these two values to determine if the rainfall by volume in Huetar Norte is greater than Brunca:\n   - Since 31.8 (Huetar Norte) is less than 35.4 (Brunca), the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. List the relevant cells that were used for this comparison:\n   - Relevant_cells: [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rainfall by volume (km 3 / year)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rainfall by volume (km 3 / year)\"},\n     ]\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted rainfall values for Huetar Norte and Brunca from the table, compared them, and found that Huetar Norte has a lower value than Brunca. Thus the claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rainfall by volume (km 3 / year)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rainfall by volume (km 3 / year)\"}\n  ]\n}",
