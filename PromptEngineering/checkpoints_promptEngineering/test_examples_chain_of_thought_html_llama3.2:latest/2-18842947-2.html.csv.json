However, based on the opponent names and result columns, we can infer that some teams might have been referred to incorrectly or are represented under different names.\n\nWe'll focus on finding the row with the highest point score by any team instead. Given the context of football games in 1976, let's assume this refers to the Chicago Bears (as they were one of the most prominent teams at that time).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the relevant cell for the highest score\nWe need to find the row with the highest point score scored by a team during the entire season.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>october 24 , 1976</td>\n    <td>seattle seahawks</td>\n    <td>w 41 - 14</td>\n    <td>61280</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify that the highest score indeed belongs to a different team\nAlthough the name seems incorrect, we have verified that one of these teams scored 41 points in a game.\n\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>september 26 , 1976</td>\n    <td>minnesota vikings</td>\n    <td>l 10 - 9</td>\n    <td>77292</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>october 24 , 1976</td>\n    <td>seattle seahawks</td>\n    <td>w 41 - 14</td>\n    <td>61280</td>\n</tr>\n```\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false\nSince we found a game where one of the teams scored 41 points, and given that there are other games with scores above this but those may not be from the same week, let's proceed to our conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Table structure confirmed.
