First, I will extract the relevant information from the table.\n   - The country of interest is \"united states (usa)\".\n   - The column headers for the medal counts are \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\" and \"total\".\n   - For a single event like tennis, we can look at the total medals won by each country in that specific event.\n\n2. Next, I will determine how many times as much gold was won by \"united states (usa)\" compared to \"great britain (gbr)\"\n   - From the table, I see that \"united states (usa)\" won 3 gold medals.\n   - From the table, I see that \"great britain (gbr)\" won 1 gold medal.\n\n3. Next, I will determine how many times as much silver was won by \"united states (usa)\" compared to \"great britain (gbr)\"\n   - From the table, I see that \"united states (usa)\" won 0 silver medals.\n   - From the table, I see that \"great britain (gbr)\" won 1 silver medal.\n\n4. Next, I will determine how many times as much bronze was won by \"united states (usa)\" compared to \"great britain (gbr)\"\n   - From the table, I see that \"united states (usa)\" won 1 bronze medal.\n   - From the table, I see that \"great britain (gbr)\" won 0 bronze medals.\n\n5. Next, I will determine how many times as much total was won by \"united states (usa)\" compared to \"great britain (gbr)\"\n   - From the table, I see that \"united states (usa)\" won 4 total medals.\n   - From the table, I see that \"great britain (gbr)\" won 2 total medals.\n\n6. Finally, I will check if the total number of times as much for each medal type is consistent\n   - The \"gold\" count: 3 > 1, so it is not two times.\n   - The \"silver\" count: 0 != 1, so it is not two times.\n   - The \"bronze\" count: 1 = 0, so it is exactly one time.\n   - The \"total\" count: 4 != 2, so it is not two times.\n\n7. Since for the \"bronze\" count we have equality and for other counts we do not have a multiplier (not even \"exactly one time\"), I conclude that there are no cases where the \"united states (usa)\" won twice as many medals than \"great britain (gbr)\"\n\n8.
