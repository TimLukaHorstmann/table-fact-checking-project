We will check if the team 'Nashville' is indeed the visitor against Detroit on that date by comparing the 'visitor' and 'home' columns.\n3. Next, we'll verify if the attendance on April 10th is indeed 20066 by checking the 'attendance' column for that specific row.\n4. We will repeat steps 1-3 for April 12th to confirm if the same conditions are met.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\nFor April 10th:\n- Row index: 0\n- Column name: visitor (Nashville)\n- Column name: home (Detroit)\n- Since 'visitor' is Nashville and 'home' is Detroit, this condition is true.\n- The attendance on that date is indeed 20066.\n\nFor April 12th:\n- Row index: 1\n- Column name: visitor (Nashville)\n- Column name: home (Detroit)\n- Again, since 'visitor' is Nashville and 'home' is Detroit, this condition is also true.\n- The attendance on that date is indeed 20066.\n\nNow, let's put it all together in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"For April 10th: checked if Nashville was visitor against Detroit (True), verified attendance (True).

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim to be evaluated is: \"the attendance be never more than 21000 or less than 17000 in 6 games between april 10 and april 20\"\n\n### Step 2: Determine the relevant data for evaluation\nThe relevant data can be found in the table by identifying the columns that contain the attendance information. In this case, it's the \"attendance\" column.\n\n### Step 3: Identify all occurrences of attendance within the specified date range\nLooking at the table, we need to find the rows where the date falls between april 10 and april 20. The relevant dates are:\n\n* April 10\n* April 12\n* April 14\n* April 16\n* April 18\n* April 20\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the attendance for each relevant date\nFor each of these dates, we need to check if the attendance is within the specified range (more than 21000 or less than 17000).\n\n- April 10: Attendance = 20066 (within the range)\n- April 12: Attendance = 20066 (within the range)\n- April 14: Attendance = 17113 (less than 17000)\n- April 16: Attendance = 17113 (less than 17000)\n- April 18: Attendance = 20066 (within the range)\n- April 20: Attendance = 17113 (less than 17000)\n\n### Step 5: Determine if any attendance values are outside of the specified range\nFrom our evaluation, we can see that there is one instance where the attendance is within the range (April 10 and April 12), but two instances where it's less than 17000. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that all dates have attendance greater than or equal to 17113.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince no date has an attendance outside of the specified range (more than 21000 or less than 17000), and given the observation in step 5, it seems there is a contradiction in our data. We will need to verify if the values within the specified date range meet the conditions for being more than 21000 or less than 17000.\n\n### Step 7: Verification of the condition\nWe notice that all dates except April 14 and April 16 have attendance greater than 20000, but our claim states attendance should be between 17113 and 21000. Since we found a date (April 10) with an attendance within this range and another with attendance greater than 21000 (April 18), we need to identify any instance where the condition is met.\n\n### Step 8: Review of all attendance values\nReviewing all attendance values:\n- April 10: 20066 (within the specified lower bound)\n- April 12: 20066 (within the specified lower bound)\n- April 14: 17113 (less than the upper bound, but within the specified range)\n- April 16: 17113 (less than the upper bound, and also less than the lower bound)\n- April 18: 20066 (within the specified upper bound)\n- April 20: 17113 (less than the upper bound)\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion based on data\nSince all attendance values are either within or outside of the range specified in our claim, we can conclude that at least some instances do not meet this criteria.\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\",\n    \"Step 2: Determine the relevant data for evaluation\",\n    \"Step 3: Identify all occurrences of attendance within the specified date range\",\n    \"Step 4: Evaluate the attendance for each relevant date\",\n    \"Step 5: Determine if any attendance values are outside of the specified range\",\n    \"Step 6: Conclusion\",\n    \"Step 7: Verification of the condition\",\n    \"Step 8: Review of all attendance values\",\n    \"Conclusion based on data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n  ]\n}",

Therefore, we need to focus on rows where either \"Detroit\" (home) or \"Nashville\" (visitor) is present in the 'home' column.\n\n### Step 3: Extract relevant cells for analysis\nWe will extract all rows where \"Detroit\" (home) or \"Nashville\" (visitor) appears in the corresponding columns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n]\n```\n\nThese are the cells we will examine to determine whether Isaac has the decision in every game when Detroit is home or Nashville is home.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze 'decision' column for each relevant row\nNow let's analyze the 'decision' column for these extracted rows:\n\n* Row 2 (Detroit at home): \"ellis\"\n* Row 4 (Nashville at home): \"ellis\"\n* Row 5 (Nashville at home): \"ellis\"\n\n### Step 5: Determine if Isaac has decision in every game\nSince Isaac's name appears as the 'decision' in all three extracted rows, it indicates that he does have the decision in those specific games.\n\nHowever, we must verify whether this holds true for all relevant scenarios (i.e., Detroit being home or Nashville being home).\n\n### Step 6: Re-examine table to ensure no other relevant scenarios\nWe need to check if there are any cases where \"Nashville\" is at home and Isaac does not have the decision.\n\nUpon examining the table again, we find that in Row 1 (Nashville at home), Isaac's name does not appear as the 'decision'. Instead, it appears as \"visitor\".\n\n### Step 7: Draw a conclusion based on analysis\nGiven our findings, we can conclude that while Isaac has the decision in some games when Detroit is home or Nashville is home (i.e., Rows 2 and 4), there is at least one scenario where he does not have the decision (Row 1). Therefore, we cannot affirmatively state that Isaac has the decision in every game under all relevant scenarios.\n\n### Step 8: Finalize answer\nBased on our step-by-step reasoning process, we can conclude that:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze 'decision' column for rows where Detroit is home or Nashville is visitor. Determine if Isaac has decision in every game under these conditions. Verify no other relevant scenarios exist.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}$.",
