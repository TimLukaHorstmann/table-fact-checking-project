    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the table structure and understand how the scores are calculated.\n   - Each score is the sum of three individual scores, represented by `(score1 + score2 + score3) = total_score`.\n   - The \"to par\" column indicates if the player's total score is under or over par.\n\n2. We need to identify all rows where the total score is under par.\n   - To do this, we will examine each row and determine if `total_score < to_par`.\n\n3. Since there are multiple players with the same score in some positions (e.g., `t4`), we must compare their scores individually.\n\n4. We notice that the \"to par\" for each player is also provided. However, since it's not always possible to determine the exact par without additional information about the specific course (e.g., par for 3 rounds of 71, 72, and 68 would be 21), we will focus on finding players with scores under their respective \"to par\" value.\n\n5. To find any potential matches, let's look at each column in a row where `total_score` is calculated:\n   - We need to determine which rows have the minimum score for that particular position (`min_score`) and then check if this player's score is below their respective \"to par\".\n\n6. After examining all scores, we can conclude whether only 2 players scored under par at the given event.\n\n7. From our analysis in steps 1 through 6, we will create a list of relevant cells to support our conclusion.\n\n8. Now that we have gone through these steps, let's look for any evidence that contradicts or supports our claim about only two player scores being under par:\n\n#### Chain of Thought and Conclusion:\nWe can see from the table provided that in each round, there are multiple players scoring different amounts at `t4`. Upon closer inspection of those rows with scores below their respective \"to par\", we find Jim Colbert (`min_score` = 69 + 69 + 73) is one such player but his score was still above the `+1` value in \"to par\". No other players have a score under their respective \"to par\" for each of these rounds.\n\nHowever, there are multiple players with scores around or below those that were stated as over par in various columns. But if we consider Jim Colbert's example where his total score was at `211`, even though he was under by 1 stroke (`+1` to par) rather than strictly under par:\n\n- The relevant cell list from the table (including only rows and columns relevant to our conclusion):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Careful analysis of scoring system reveals that while multiple players did achieve scores below their respective 'to par', these did not meet strict criteria for being strictly <par. Only two players achieved this - Jack Nicklaus and Bobby Nichols.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output shows that only two players achieved a score under their respective 'to par'.",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, we need to determine the player who won the tournament by comparing the total scores across different rounds. We can do this by finding the row with the lowest score.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are multiple rows with the same score of 211 in the last column (the \"score\" column). However, for a tiebreaker or further evaluation, let's look at the scores from each round to identify any patterns.\n\n3. From row T4, we have three different players: Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson, and George Archer. Their total scores are 211, which is tied with another group of players in later rounds (e.g., Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin). However, for the first round, their individual scores are lower than some other players in that round.\n\n4. Specifically, let's examine the score column for each player mentioned in step 3: Jim Colbert scored 69 on the first round, while George Archer and Bob Erickson had higher first-round scores of 71.\n\n5. Now we need to find another player who also scored better on the first round than Jim Colbert (who scored 69). We can do this by finding another player in row T4 with a lower score than 69 in the first round.\n\n6. Upon further inspection, we see that George Archer also had a score of 71 on the first round. However, there is another player in row T8 who scored better than both George Archer and Jim Colbert: Ken Still and Larry Hinson did not do any worse, but Bruce Devlin actually tied for last place, as his score was equal to theirs.\n\n7. Since George Archer's first-round score of 71 is tied with Jim Colbert's 69, which means he didn't outscore him on the first round. Thus we can conclude that there isn't a single player with a better initial score in row T4 compared to Jim Simon who scored 65.",

First, we need to find the player who scored better on the first round than the eventual winner.\n\n2. To do this, let's look at each row of the table and extract the score of the player in the first round and their overall score (i.e., the sum of all three rounds).\n\n    - In the 1st row, the score is 71 + 71 + 65 = 207, so we have (71, 207).\n    - In the 2nd row, the score is 69 + 72 + 68 = 209, so we have (69, 209).\n    - In the 3rd row, the score is 69 + 72 + 69 = 210, so we have (69, 210).\n    - In the 4th row, the score is 70 + 72 + 69 = 211, so we have (70, 211).\n    - In the 5th row, the score is 71 + 70 + 70 = 211, so we have (71, 211).\n    - In the 6th row, the score is 69 + 69 + 73 = 211, so we have (69, 211).\n    - In the 7th row, the score is 71 + 67 + 73 = 211, so we have (71, 211).\n    - In the 8th row, the score is 71 + 72 + 69 = 212, so we have (71, 212).\n    - In the 9th row, the score is 71 + 71 + 70 = 212, so we have (71, 212).\n    - In the 10th row, the score is 72 + 69 + 71 = 212, so we have (72, 212).\n\n3. Now, let's compare these first-round scores with their overall scores.\n\n    - For (71, 207), the difference between the two is 207 - 71 = 136.\n    - For (69, 209), the difference between the two is 209 - 69 = 140.\n    - For (69, 210), the difference between the two is 210 - 69 = 141.\n    - For (70, 211), the difference between the two is 211 - 70 = 141.\n    - For (71, 211), the difference between the two is 211 - 71 = 140.\n    - For (69, 211), the difference between the two is 211 - 69 = 142.\n    - For (71, 211), the difference between the two is 211 - 71 = 140.\n    - For (71, 212), the difference between the two is 212 - 71 = 141.\n    - For (72, 212), the difference between the two is 212 - 72 = 140.\n\n4. Now, we need to find players who scored better on the first round than their eventual winner.\n\n    - The player in the 1st row has a better score than no one since everyone else in this row had a worse final score.\n    - The player in the 2nd row has a worse score than the player in the 3rd row, so they don't meet the criteria.\n    - The player in the 4th row has a worse score than the players in rows 5 through 7 and 9-10, so they don't meet the criteria.\n    - There are no other players who scored better on the first round than their eventual winner.\n\n5. Now let's count how many of these players exist to answer the original question:\n\nWe found that there was one player in the table whose score in the first round was higher than his score at the end of the tournament.\n\n6. The claim stated that \"more than 4 player score better on the first round than the eventual winner\". This would be TRUE if more than four players meet this criteria, so we are done determining whether or not this statement is true based on our findings.\n\n\nHere's the final answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Find all scores of the player in each row. Compare these to the score at the end of the tournament (i.e., overall score). Check if they were better than their eventual winner. If so, continue for that individual. Otherwise, move on to another row. Count how many players meet the criteria and compare this number with 4. Determine whether or not more than four players meet this criteria based on these findings.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n    ]\n}",
