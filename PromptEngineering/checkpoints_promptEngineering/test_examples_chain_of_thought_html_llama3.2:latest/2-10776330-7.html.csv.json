    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the total crowd participation for each venue during the 1961 VFL season by multiplying the crowd size by the score of the home team.\n2. We will compare the total crowd participation values of all venues to determine if MCG has the highest value.\n3. If the total crowd participation value for MCG is greater than or equal to the total crowd participation value for any other venue, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- The relevant cells will be:\n  ```\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n```\nThese are the columns we need to consider for our analysis: crowd size (first row), home team score (second row) and again crowd size (third row). However, because the claim is specifically about the venue with the highest crowd participation, we should calculate this value by multiplying the crowd size of MCg by its home team score. So the relevant cells are:\n  ```\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n```\n\nNow let's calculate the total crowd participation for each venue and compare them:\n\n- MCg: (49678) * (15.14) = 743, 492\n- Arden Street Oval: (13000) * (9.14) = 119, 120\n- Glenferrie Oval: (15000) * (10.13) = 150, 165\n- Kardinia Park: (18683) * (13.13) = 243, 961\n- Lake Oval: (14500) * (7.8) = 113, 700\n- MCG Venue: (49678) * (15.14)\nMCG has the highest crowd participation\n\nNow let's output a final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First calculated the total crowd participation for each venue by multiplying the crowd size by the home team score, then compared these values to determine if MCg had the highest value\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The first step is to check if Kardinia Park was used as one of the 6 venues on June 3, 1961. To do this, we need to find out how many unique venues were used that day and then count Kardinia Park among them.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there are several venues listed, each with a different date. We're interested in the row where the date is June 3, 1961. That's the third row of the table (0-indexed).\n\n3. In this row, we find Kardinia Park under \"venue\". The column for venue contains all unique venues that were used on June 3, 1961.\n\n4. Let's list out the other venues and compare them to the list in the relevant cell:\n\n- Avene: arden street oval\n- Glenferrie Oval: glenferrie oval\n- Victoria Park: victoria park\n- Kardinia Park: kardinia park\n- Lake Oval: lake oval\n- MCG: mcg\n\n5.
