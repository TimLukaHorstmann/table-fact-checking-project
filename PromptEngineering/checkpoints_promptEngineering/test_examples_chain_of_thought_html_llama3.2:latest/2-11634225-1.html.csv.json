We are given a table with various software products, their corresponding prices, and licensing information.\n2. The claim is that accuhash is the only software with a specific price of $19.95.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are multiple columns related to pricing, including \"cost ( usd )\" which lists the cost in USD for each software product.\n4. Upon reviewing this column, we notice that there is no entry for accuhash with a price of $19.95.\n5.

We can focus on the \"cost ( usd )\" column.\n\n#### Step 3: Locate winhasher's information\nIn the table, we find that the row corresponding to 'winhasher' has the following values:\n```\n\"winhasher\"        | \"2012 - 06 - 07 (v1.6.1.65)\" | \"free\" | \"yes\" | \"gpl\"\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze prices of other software\nWe examine the prices listed for other software products:\n- 'sfv checker' has a price of \"no\", indicating it is free.\n- The cost of various versions of different software (e.g., 'md5deep', 'winhasher', etc.) are not specified in this table.\n\n#### Step 5: Draw conclusion\nSince winhasher's price ($19.95) is the only specific price mentioned for a software product, and it does not match our target value of $19.95, we cannot conclude that winhasher meets the criteria based on this table alone.\n\nHowever, the instruction specifically states \"Claim: 'winhasher be the only software that have a specific price of 19.95'\", implying that if no other software has a price listed as exactly $19.95, then winhasher would meet the claim.\n\n#### Step 6: JSON output\nGiven the table does not contain any other exact price of $19.95 for any software product, and considering that winhasher's actual price is stated to be \"free\", we need to correct our interpretation based on the instruction.
