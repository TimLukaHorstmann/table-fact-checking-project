Compare it with the value in the corresponding column of Nasim - Ul - Ghani's row.\n5. The value in that column is \"101 not out\".\n6.

His row also contains \"australia\" in team column, thus qualifying him initially, but he has a separate entry indicating another game where he did bat before facing Bangladesh.\n- Mark Boucher's entry (row index 3 and 4) with score '101 not out' indicates he was the nightwatchman in that specific match. His team is listed as \"south africa\", so he does not meet this part of our criteria.\n\nStep 5: Assess if there are indeed 2 players who meet these qualifications.\nFrom Step 4, we identified Jason Gillespie as a potential nightwatchman from Australia. However, we need another player. There isn't another clear instance in the table that fits the role and country of origin for another Australian nightwatchman.\n\nStep 6: Draw conclusion based on the assessment.\nBased on the provided data, there is at least one Australian nightwatchman (Jason Gillespie), but no definitive second nightwatchman from Australia among the given rows to confirm this claim fully.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to determine if there are any players who have played for England.\n2. We can do this by looking at the table rows where the \"team\" column equals \"england\".\n3. From the table, we see that England is represented in two different rows:\n\t* Row 1: player = \"nasim - ul - ghani\", team = \"pakistan\"\n\t* Row 5: player = \"mark boucher\", team = \"south africa\" (Note: This row does not represent England playing, but rather Mark Boucher who plays for South Africa)\n4. Since there is only one row where the team equals \"england\", and it's not present in the table at all, we can conclude that England has played zero times against a player known as 'nightwatchman' (cricket).\n5. However, according to cricket rules, any batsman has to face 4 balls or be given out before night-watchmen could come into play.\n6. So if there is no bowler attacking the batsman in this case then the batsmen does not have to walk back as he is facing 2 overs and hence night watchmen rule cannot be applied here.\n7. From the table, we see that England was playing against Australia (in row 1) and also played against India in another game.\n8. However, these games are for other teams rather than 'England'.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First checked the table to see if there were any players who have played for England.

This can be converted to an integer (num) as follows:\n     ```\n      num = 101\n     ```\n\n3. **Calculate the double of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score**: We need to calculate double of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score for comparison.\n   - Double of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score = `2 * num`\n   ```\n       double_num = 2 * num\n   ```\n\n4. **Extract Jason Gillespie's score**: We extract Jason Gillespie's score and convert it into a numerical value.\n   - The score for Jason Gillespie is \"201 not out\". To compare with Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score, we need to consider the numerical part of his score which is 201. This can be converted to an integer (`double_not_out`) as follows:\n     ```\n       double_not_out = 201\n   ```\n\n5. **Compare Jason Gillespie's score with its double**: We compare Jason Gillespie's score (`double_not_out`) with the double of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score (`double_num`). To compare them, we first need to check if `double_num` and `double_not_out` are both numerical values (i.e., integers). Since `double_num` is 202 and `double_not_out` is an integer, it can be safely said that Jason Gillespie's score is not double the value of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Identify the relevant rows for comparison\\nStep 2: Extract the scores from both players and convert them into numerical values\\nStep 3: Calculate the double of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's score\\nStep 4: Extract Jason Gillespie's score and convert it to an integer value, then compare with its double\\nConclusion: Since Jason Gillespie 's score is less than double that of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's, Jason Gillespie 's score be more than double that of Nasim - Ul - Ghani 's is FALSE\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
