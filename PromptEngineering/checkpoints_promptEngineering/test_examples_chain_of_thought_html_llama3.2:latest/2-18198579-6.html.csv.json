    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Extract the total earnings for each year from 2004 to 2013 by looking at the cell containing the row \"totals\" and the column \"earnings\". The value in this cell is $7603184.\n\n2. Check if the total earnings ($7603184) matches the sum of individual earnings for each year from 2004 to 2013. This can be done by comparing the single-value \"total\" in the row \"totals\" with the values in the other cells corresponding to the rows of years 2004-2013.\n\n3. Extract all relevant cells as objects that contain their respective row index and column name:\n    ```\n    [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 9,\n        \"column_name\": \"earnings\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 7,\n        \"column_name\": \"year\"\n      }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n4. Since the claim about earnings of $7603184 total being made from 2004-2013 requires that this number is equal to the sum of individual earnings for each year from 2004 to 2013, we can use the values in the \"earnings\" column.\n\n5. Check if the value of $7603184 matches the value of the cell corresponding to row index 9 (in row 10) and column name \"earnings\". If this is not true, then the answer would be FALSE.\n6. Compare each individual earnings with the total. \n\nThe comparison yields that each individual year's earnings equals the total, meaning the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Total earnings for all years extracted from row 'totals' and column 'earnings'.

Since we found one entry for year 2013 with an earnings of $2335460, this supports the claim.\n\n### Step 5: Check Other Years\nAlthough our goal is specifically to verify the claim for 2013, it's worth noting that other years' earnings are also relevant when assessing total earnings over a period. However, since the question specifies \"total be made during 2013,\" we focus on 2013.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven that there is indeed an entry in 2013 with earnings of $2335460, which matches part of the claim's requirement (being made during 2013), and acknowledging that a total comparison across years isn't explicitly requested but implied by \"total be made,\" we proceed to finalize our answer.\n\n### Step 7: Format Answer\nTo present this in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified earnings of $2335460 for year 2013 matches part of the claim.
