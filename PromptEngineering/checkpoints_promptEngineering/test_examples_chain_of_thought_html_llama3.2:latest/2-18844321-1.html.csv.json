    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find all the match dates in October 1978.\n2. We will then sort these dates in ascending order.\n3. Next, we will check if each date is after the 25th of the month.\n4. If any date is on or before the 25th, the claim is FALSE. Otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Find all match dates in October 1978<br>2. Sort these dates in ascending order<br>3.
