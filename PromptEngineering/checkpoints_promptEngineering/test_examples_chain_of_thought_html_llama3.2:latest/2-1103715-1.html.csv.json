This means we need to find the game with the short time, which is in game 4, and check if it's less than 3 hours.\n\n2. **Locate relevant cells for game 4**: The table has a row index starting from 1.

We want to find row index 4 for game 4 because we are looking at \"game 4\". We have a column named \"time\".\n\n### Extract Time Value\nExtract time value from \"row_index=4\" and \"column_name=time\". The time is \"3:02\".\nConvert time to hours by converting minutes to seconds first, then dividing by the total number of seconds in an hour. So \"3:02\" converts into (3*3600 + 2)/3600 which equals approximately 3.00556.\n\n\n### Comparing with Claim\nThe claim says that the game 4 has just under a 3-hour time frame.

This can be subjective and not always clearly defined.\n    - Look at rows for October 20, specifically those involving the Anaheim Angels vs. San Francisco Giants games.\n    - Check if either game had a score difference that was more than one run at any point.\n\n4. **Evaluate Score Differences on October 20**:\n    - For row 2 (October 20): The final scores were San Francisco Giants - 10, Anaheim Angels - 11. This is not within one run, but since the claim mentions \"second long game,\" we need to see if this qualifies.\n    - For row 6 (October 26) and row 7 (October 27), these games occurred later and are out of the scope for determining the second long game on October 20.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n    - The key is whether the score difference between San Francisco Giants - 10, Anaheim Angels - 11 (row 2) constitutes a \"long game.\"\n    - A game with such a close final score margin might indeed be considered long, making this game potentially the second long game of the series.\n    - We also need to verify that no other games on October 20 had scores within one run difference for most or all of the game, which is not directly relevant since we've identified a game fitting the description.\n\n6. **Final Check**: Confirm the attendance was indeed in thousands and the location correctly specified as \"edison international field of anaheim\".\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows for October 20, checked for long game conditions, evaluated score differences, concluded that San Francisco Giants - 10, Anaheim Angels - 11 does indeed fit the description of a 'long game', verified attendance and location correctness\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
