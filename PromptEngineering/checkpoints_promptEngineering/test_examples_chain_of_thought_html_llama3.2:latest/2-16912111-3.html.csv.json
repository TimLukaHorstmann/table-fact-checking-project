    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find the games where the Blue Bomber defeat the Edmonton Eskimos 30-23 at home.\n   - This can be determined by finding rows in the table with a \"score\" of \"32 - 28\", an opponent of \"Calgary Stampeders\", and a \"date\" that is less than the date of the game where they lost to Edmonton Eskimos 36-22 on the road.\n\n2. The date of the first instance is July 24, which was away.\n   - This row does not match because it is the away game.\n\n3. Now we can check for home games with this score and opponent before September 1, where the Blue Bomber defeated Edmonton Eskimos 30-23. \n   - The relevant rows are:\n      * Row 4: \"aug 14\", \"hamilton tiger-cats\" does not match because it is away.\n      * Row 5: Not relevant. It's the same as row 4.\n      * Row 6: Not relevant. It's the same as row 4.\n\n4. Now we check for games between September 1 and October 10 where the score matches. We know that on \"sept 19\", they beat Hamilton by a score of 25 - 23 at home, but it does not match our criteria.\n   * Row 13: Not relevant because the team was Hamilton, not Blue Bomber.\n   * Row 14: Not relevant because it's also Hamilton.\n   * Row 15: Not relevant because Edmonton is on the road.\n\n5. We can now check for games where the score matches but date after September 1 and before October 10:\n   - There are no other games that meet this criteria, so we have to look at the last game of the season.\n\n6. The Blue Bomber defeats Edmonton Eskimos 30-23 on Oct 4. Since this was a home game for Edmonton's opponent (Blue Bomber), this is relevant.\n7. We can now check if they beat Edmonton by a score of 36 - 22 on the road, which happens to be before their loss at home.\n   - The date of the last game where they lost to Edmonton Eskimos 36-22 is October 4 (home) and also Oct 10 (away), so we can conclude that there was indeed one week between these two losses.\n\n\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. First, we need to understand the claim being made. The claim states that there was a difference in attendance between two different Blue Bombers games on October 26, 2008.\n\n2. Next, let's look at the table provided for us. We can see that there are multiple rows and columns, but most of them don't seem to be relevant to our claim.\n\n3. However, we do see a few specific details that might help us verify or falsify the claim. For example:\n  - The attendance at the Calgary Stampeders game on October 18 is listed as 30110.\n  - The attendance at the Montreal Alouettes game on October 26 is listed as 20202.\n\n4. Based on these specific details, we can try to verify or falsify the claim. To do this, let's look for other rows that have relevant information about Blue Bombers games played in October 2008.\n\n5. After examining the table again, I noticed a row with an entry of \"Blue Bomber game\" which is dated \"oct 18\", and another row with an entry of \"Blue Bomber game\". But we can't verify if this matches exactly what was claimed.\n\n6. Now that we have found relevant information in rows 17 and the rest of the table, I realized there was no other relevant row for October. So I checked again for a Blue Bombers game on October 26, 2008.\n\n7. In that case we can see another entry with \"Blue Bomber game\" which is dated \"oct 26\".\n\n8.

For instance, Hamilton Tiger-Cat played at home versus Montreal Alouettes on Oct 18. However, we need to find if they also played at home versus another team (Hamilton Tiger-Cat) on Nov 1.\n5.

In this case, the opponent is \"calgary stampeders\", so it is not the toronto argonauts.\n\n2. However, we can find out if the blue bomber (also known as the calgaryStampeders) indeed played against the toronto Argonauts on oct 18 by looking at their score and result columns.\n   - In the game where \"date\" equals \"oct 18\", \"opponent\" is indeed \"toronto argonauts\". The score was 37 - 16, which means they won.\n\n3. Next, we need to verify that there's a subsequent game against calgary Stampeders in the table where the blue bomber lose by the mentioned score.\n   - Looking through the table again, in row 17 \"opponent\" is \"calgary stampeders\".
