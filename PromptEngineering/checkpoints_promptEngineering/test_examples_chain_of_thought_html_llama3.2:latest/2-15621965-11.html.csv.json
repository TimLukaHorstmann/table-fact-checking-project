One instance is from row 7 with year in Orlando as 2003-2004 and another instance is from row 10 with only year in Orlando as 2009.\n  - However, since one of these years has a range of values, this step would normally require finding the value that falls within the given range. Unfortunately, we can't verify that Tyronn Lue had his second stint in Orlando from the data provided because it does not contain a time interval. This is a problem as our claim requires both instances to have a year in orlando, but one of them has only a single value.\n  - The relevant cells for this step are: { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\" }, { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\" } and { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\" }.\n\n- Step 3: Verify the claim statement:\n  - Based on our findings from steps 1 and 2, we cannot verify the claim since there are two players with Nebraska as their school/team but one Tyronn Lue only has a single year of involvement in Orlando.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We found two players from Nebraska.

Looking at the table, there are two players named \"jason lawson\", but only one has data for years in orlando that matches our criteria: \"1997 - 1998\". The second row with \"jason lawson\" has a year range of \"2000 - 2001\".\n\n3. For player \"rashard lewis\", we see that his years in orlando are \"2007 - 2010\", which does not match our criteria.\n\n4. Next, looking at the players who played from \"1998 - 1999\". One such player is \"jason lawson\" with years in orlando as \"1997 - 1998\".\n\n5. Another relevant row to check for this specific year range would be looking for any player named \"tyronn lue\", but given the information of only one player being named \"jason lawson\", and since that row has a data entry of only \"2000 - 2001\" in line with another entry for tyronn lue, we can safely assume there is no additional center from that list.\n\n6. Checking further, looking at other players like rashard lewis does not provide an example because the claim specifically asks for years 1998-1999 and his data only shows a period of time after this range.\n\n7. Since we are searching for two center players with years between 1998 - 1999, only one player fits that requirement: jason lawson from row 1, no second valid match is found as seen when looking at tyronn lue rows.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by searching for the two center players who played between 1998 - 1999.
