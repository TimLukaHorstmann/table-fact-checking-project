Here, it's the range 325 which indicates one locomotive was built.\n- For c3, it is 300 - 309.\n\nComparing these values:\n- The total range for i1 is less than the individual value but since \"loco nos\" refers to number of locomotives built for a specific class we should use either of the provided ranges. Here both are 1 which seems incorrect as the claim states that there be 10 more i1 builds than c3. However, given how \"loco nos\" is defined for this dataset (the range), it appears to be referring to individual locomotives rather than overall production totals.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the truth of the claim\nThe statement about 10 more i1 build than c3 seems incorrect based on provided data. However, reevaluating 'loco nos' with correct understanding - for c3 (class c3), it is a range of 300 - 309 indicating at least one locomotive was built within this class and similarly for other classes. Upon closer inspection of \"loco nos\" in the dataset:\n- For i1, there are indeed less than or equal to 10 locomotives with \"4 - 6 - 2t\" being considered as one unit since it's not clearly indicated otherwise.\n- For c3, there is at least one.\n\nGiven that \"loco nos\" seems to represent individual units of a class rather than overall totals for each class which appears to be the case in this table: \nthe claim seems to be based on wrong understanding of 'loco nos'. But still let's compare:\n- 1 - 10595 - 604 could indeed suggest much more locomotives (over ten) were built for class i1 than c3.\n\n### Step 5: Final evaluation\nBased on how 'loco nos' is defined in this table, there seems to be at least one unit of locomotive for both classes, but for class i1 it's much less and could indeed be more if considering the individual numbers provided.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column for \"loco nos\" (or \"no built\") which contains data on the number of locomotives built.\n2. Locate the row corresponding to class \"c3\".\n3. Extract the value in the \"loco nos\" column for class \"c3\", which is \"300 - 309\".\n4. Move to the row corresponding to class \"i1\".\n5. Extract the value in the \"loco nos\" column for class \"i1\", which is \"1 - 10595 - 604\".\n6. Compare the values extracted in steps 3 and 5.\n7. Determine if there are exactly 10 fewer locomotives built in class \"i1\" compared to class \"c3\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n8. Extract the value for the difference between \"loco nos\" for classes \"i1\" and \"c3\". Calculate this by subtracting the value for \"i1\" from the value for \"c3\": 309 - (10595 + 604) = 309 - 10699.\n9. Compare this result to 10.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the column for loco nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate the row corresponding to class c3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Extract the value in the loco nos column for class c3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Move to the row corresponding to class i1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Extract the value in the loco nos column for class i1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Compare values extracted\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if there are exactly 10 fewer locomotives built in class i1 compared to class c3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Extract the value for the difference between loco nos for classes i1 and c3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 9,\n      \"description\": \"Compare this result to 10\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"loco nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"no built\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"loco nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"no built\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
