To compare with other players, we need to look at their total stats. We also notice that there is another row for Dennis Hull, who also played during the same period.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of playoff goals for Bobby Hull with other Chicago Blackhawk players.\nWe need to verify if Bobby Hull has indeed scored the most playoff goals among all Chicago Blackhawk players.
