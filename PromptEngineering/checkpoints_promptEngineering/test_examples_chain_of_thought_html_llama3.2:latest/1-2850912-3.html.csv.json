We need to check if this is indeed the highest pick number in that row.\n\n\n#### Step 4: Compare with other picks in the same row\nAfter examining the row, we can see that there are no higher numbers than 43.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nBased on our analysis, David McLay's pick number (43) is the only number in his row.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. Review the claim: The claim states that \"4 players come from the WHL hockey league.\" We need to determine if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\n2. Identify relevant columns:\n   - 'college / junior / club team' column contains information about where each player played before joining the NHL.\n   - We will focus on rows where 'college / junior / club team' contains 'WHL'.\n\n3. Locate WHL rows in the table:\n   Looking at the table, we find the following rows that contain 'WHL':\n\n   | pick # | player            | position          | nationality      | NHL Team  | college / junior / club team                     |\n   |--------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n   |     43 | David McLay       | Left Wing         | Canada           | Philadelphia Flyers                               |\n   |     45 | Trent Yawney      | Defence            | Canada            | Chicago Black Hawks                                  |\n   |     55 | Landis Chaulk     | Left Wing          | Canada            | Vancouver Canucks                                |\n\n4. Count the number of players from WHL:\n   There are 3 rows in total where 'college / junior / club team' contains 'WHL', indicating that there are indeed 3 players from the WHL hockey league.\n\n5. Determine if the claim is true or false based on the count:\n\n   Since we found 3 players who came from the WHL, and the claim states \"4 players come from the WHL\", the statement is false.\n\n6. Identify relevant cells for the answer:\n   The relevant cells that support our conclusion are those associated with the three identified rows (row_index 43, 45, and 55). Here's how we represent them in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified WHL rows: row 43, row 45, and row 55. Counted players from these rows to determine if the claim is true or false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format.",

The claim mentions \"gaol tender\", which seems to be a typo, and it's likely referring to \"goal tender\" (a position on the ice).

The NHL team of each player: Specifically, we're looking for players who are listed as playing for the \"Philadelphia Flyers\".\n2.  The \"pick\" number of each player and its corresponding position in the pick order.\n3.  The range being referred to - In this case it is 'range show' which isn't explicitly defined in the table. Given the data we can infer that 'range show' likely refers to players with a pick number below 43.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table step by step:\n\n*   First, we'll identify all instances where the player plays for the \"Philadelphia Flyers\":\n    *   Player David McLay - Pick number 43, position Left Wing\n    *   Player John Stevens - Pick number 47, position Defence\n    *   Player John English - Pick number 48, position Defence\n    *   Player Milan Chalupa - Pick number 49, position Defence\n    *   Player David Saunders - Pick number 52, position Left Wing\n    *   Player Graeme Bonar - Pick number 54, position Right Wing\n    *   Player Landis Chaulk - Pick number 55, position Left Wing\n\nFrom the data we see that there are five players with a pick number below 43 who play for the Philadelphia Flyers. However, we need two picks in order to fulfill the claim.\n\n*   Now let's move on to identifying any other possible sources of another 'Philadelphia Flyer' pick:\n    *   Player Landis Chaulk - Pick number 55 is indeed a member of the Philadelphia Flyers\n    *   Player Graeme Bonar - Pick number 54, although listed as being part of the Flyers, was found in the player data. However the other player from this group is actually the one with pick number 52.\n    *   There isn't any other Philadelphia Flyer picked after these five players.\n\nAfter evaluating all possible sources for a second 'Philadelphia Flyer' pick and verifying its accuracy we can now output our response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step1\": \"Identifying players who play for the Philadelphia Flyers\",\n    \"Step2\": \"Analyzing player pick numbers to see if any are below 43\",\n    \"Step3\": \"Determining if there is another 'Philadelphia Flyer' picked below 43\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Pick Number\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
