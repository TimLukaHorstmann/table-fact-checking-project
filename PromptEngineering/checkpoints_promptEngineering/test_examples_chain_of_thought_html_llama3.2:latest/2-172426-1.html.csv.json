However, this is a death date, not a divorce.\n   \n   - Similarly, the same applies to other rows; they contain death dates for spouses rather than divorce information.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Cells for Princess Anne**: Locate the specific princess named \"Anne\" in the table and identify any relevant cells that could indicate a divorce (e.g., `date married`, `husband names`).\n\n   - Princess Anne's entry is found in rows `(7,1)` to `(7,6)`. In row `(7,5)`, there is an entry `\"1973 - 1992\"` for \"divorce\", indicating the end of her marriage. However, no divorce date exists in row `(7,4)`.\n   \n   - The second occurrence of Princess Anne's entry also contains `\"1992\"` as a \"divorce\" year.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Divorced Princesses**: After identifying that Princess Anne has been divorced at least once (and another occurrence where divorce date is not specified but implied by the row), check if there are two more princesses on the list who have also experienced divorces, as stated in the claim.\n\n   - Upon reviewing the table again, we find that there is only one other entry with a marriage/divorce range, for Princess Charlotte. However, it was incomplete regarding her divorce; she died at 1828 without any indication of divorce.\n   \n   - There is no information on the divorce status or date of another princess like Mary or Anne beyond those already specified, making this a single case.\n\n4. **Determine the Validity of the Claim**: Based on the count and details gathered from relevant cells, determine if the claim that Princess Anne is one of three princesses who have experienced divorces is true or false.\n\n   - Since only Princess Anne's divorce has been explicitly mentioned in more than one context, it seems to be the case.\n   \n   However, without additional information on two other princesses experiencing divorces as specified by the claim, we cannot conclude that the claim is true. It appears partially true based on available data but lacks comprehensive evidence for a definitive answer.\n\n5. **Output Final Answer in JSON Format**:\n\nSince there's only one confirmed divorce case (Princess Anne) and lacking sufficient information to confirm two more princesses have also been divorced, we can conclude that the claim is not entirely accurate but leans towards being true based on available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process as described above was followed.
