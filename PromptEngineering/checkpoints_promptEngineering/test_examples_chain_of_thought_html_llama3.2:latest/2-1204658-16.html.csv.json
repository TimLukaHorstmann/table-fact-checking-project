To verify this, we need to check if the date column (`<th>date</th>`) in the table contains only one entry with the date \"8 August 1908\".\n3. Let's examine each row in the table:\n\t* Row 1: home team = fitzroy, away team = university, and date = \"8 August 1908\"\n\t* Row 2: home team = essendon, away team = melbourne, and date = \"8 August 1908\"\n\t* Row 3: home team = collingwood, away team = st kilda, and date = \"8 August 1908\"\n\t* Row 4: home team = south melbourne, away team = richmond, and date = \"8 August 1908\"\n\t* Row 5: home team = geelong, away team = carlton, and date = \"8 August 1908\"\n4. As we can see, all rows have the same date (\"8 August 1908\"), which supports the claim.\n5. However, to confirm that this is true for all games, we should also check if there are any other dates present in the table.\n6. Upon reviewing the table again, we notice that there are no other entries with different dates.\n7.
