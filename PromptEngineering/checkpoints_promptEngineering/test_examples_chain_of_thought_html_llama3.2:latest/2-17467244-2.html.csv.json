To verify this claim, we need to find the row in the table with the highest total score (i.e., the sum of all six cells in each row).\n\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that rows 4 and 13 have scores of 4 and 5 goals respectively (see the \"result\" column in these two rows). Row 13 also has a tiebreaker goal scored by Milbrett.\n\n4. We need to determine if the score on 1995 - 06 - 10 is among those with the highest total score, i.e., row 4 or 13.\n\n5. Looking at row 4 (see the \"date\" column), it has a date of 1995-06-13 and row 13 (see the \"date\" column) has a date of 1999-07-10.\n\n6. The claim specifies 1995 - 06 - 10, which is before the dates in rows 4 and 13.\n\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that 1995 - 06 - 10 does not have among those with the highest total score.\n\n8.

The \"lineup\" column lists Tisha Venturini as part of the starting lineup in both cases.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate how many matchs she plays for each tournament\n- In the \"1995 FIFA Women's World Cup\", Tisha Venturini played a total of 3 matches (as indicated by row indices 4, 6 and 13).\n- In the \"USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup\" and the \"Atlanta 1996 Olympic women's football tournament\", she played only one match each.\n\n#### Step 5: Combine the results to determine if Tisha Venturini played a total of 13 matches in different tournaments.\nSince Tisha Venturini did not play 13 matches, but rather 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 across three different tournaments, we conclude that this claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Step 6: List the relevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\"\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 4,\"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13,\"column_name\": \"lineup\"}\n]\n\n#### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Tisha Venturini played a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 matches across three different tournaments; thus, she did not play 13.
