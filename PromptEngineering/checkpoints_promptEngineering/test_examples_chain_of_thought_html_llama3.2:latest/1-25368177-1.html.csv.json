Identify the top team: \n   The table does not explicitly state which row contains the top team, but we can determine it by examining the \"total points\" column. The highest value in the \"total points\" column corresponds to the top team. Based on the data provided, the top team is Auckland Aces with 24 total points.\n\n2. Identify the bottom team:\n   Similarly, we need to find the row with the lowest \"total points\". According to the table, Otago Volts has 13 total points, which is the lowest value in the column. Therefore, Otago Volts is considered the bottom team.\n\n3. Calculate the point difference between the top and bottom teams:\n   The claim states that the point difference between the top team (Auckland Aces) and the bottom team (Otago Volts) should be 0.185. We can verify this by subtracting the total points of Otago Volts from Auckland Aces' total points.\n\n4.
