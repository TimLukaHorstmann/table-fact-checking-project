    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Determine the total number of times Scotland plays at Hampden Park, Glasgow:**\n   - Looking at the table, we find that Scotland played at Hampden Park, Glasgow 4 times (rows 6, 11, 15, and 31).\n\n2. **Determine the total number of times Scotland plays at Easter Road, Edinburgh:**\n   - From the table, we see that Scotland played at Easter Road, Edinburgh 3 times (rows 30, 27 is actually an away game for a friendly match against Tallinn, not the same as Hampden Park Glasgow which is also a home friendly but was missed in this count - however given there were only three total matches and one of those was indeed home it will be stated so, we can confirm that Easter road is played 3 times).\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the two:**\n   - Subtracting the number of times Scotland plays at Hampden Park, Glasgow (4) from the number of times they play at Easter Road, Edinburgh (3), we get a negative result.\n\n4. **Determine if the claim is True or False based on the calculation:**\n   - Since the difference between the two numbers is negative, the claim that Scotland plays at Easter Road, Edinburgh 5 times more than Hampden Park, Glasgow must be false.\n\n### Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1-4 as described above\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"easter road , edinburgh\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
