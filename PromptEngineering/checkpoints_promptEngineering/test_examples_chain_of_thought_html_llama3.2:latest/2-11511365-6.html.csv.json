In the table, the relevant cells for Jerzy Janowicz are:\n   - Row index: 3\n   - Column name: 'opponent'\n3. The value in the 'opponent' column for Jerzy Janowicz is indeed \"jerzy janowicz\".\n4. Next, we need to check if Edouard Roger-Vasselin was a winner. We can do this by looking at the table and finding the row where Edouard Roger-Vasselin is listed as an opponent.\n5. In the table, the relevant cells for Edouard Roger-Vasselin are:\n   - Row index: 1\n   - Column name: 'opponent'\n6. The value in the 'opponent' column for Edouard Roger-Vasselin is indeed \"roko karanu\u0161i\u0107\".\n7. Since Jerzy Janowicz was not a runner-up to Edouard Roger-Vasselin, we need to check if there are any other rows where Edouard Roger-Vasselin is listed as an opponent and has been a runner-up.\n8. Upon reviewing the table again, we see that there is indeed another row for Edouard Roger-Vasselin:\n   - Row index: 2\n   - Column name: 'opponent'\n9. In this row, the value in the 'score' column is \"6 - 7 (5 - 7) , 6 - 3 , 1 - 0 , ret\". Since Edouard Roger-Vasselin lost to Karol Beck in this match, he was not a runner-up.\n10. However, we still need to check the row where Jerzy Janowicz is listed as an opponent:\n    - Row index: 2\n    - Column name: 'opponent'\n11.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that \"Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games\", implying that Vasselin must have played a best-of-five set match.\n2. To determine the validity of this claim, we need to analyze the table for any matches where Vasselin was involved and if they were played as a best-of-five set match.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are four instances where Vasselin is listed as the \"winner\". We will check each of these instances:\n\t* Row 1: In this row, Vasselin's opponent is Roko Karanu\u0161i\u0107, and the score is 6-4, 6-4. Since the match did not go to a fifth set, it is unlikely that this was a best-of-five set match.\n\t* Row 2: In this row, Vasselin's opponent is Karol Beck, and the score is 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 1-0 (ret). Although the score suggests that Vasselin lost the second and third sets, it does not specify whether the match was a best-of-five set match.\n\t* Row 3: In this row, Vasselin is listed as the \"runner-up\", which means he did not win the match. Therefore, we do not need to consider this instance.\n\t* Row 4: In this row, Vasselin's opponent is Matthias Bachinger, and the score is 7-6 (11-9), 4-6, 6-1. Since the match went to a fifth set, it is likely that this was a best-of-five set match.\n5. Based on these observations, we can conclude that Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games in at least one instance, making the claim TRUE.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games, implying a best-of-five set match. Analyzing the table reveals that Vasselin played a best-of-five set match against Matthias Bachinger (Row 4). Therefore, it is likely that he also fought hard to win this match.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
