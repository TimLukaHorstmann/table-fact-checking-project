    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim \"all of the class pg type 0 - 6 - 0 locomotive make be incorporate in uta\". This means we need to check if all rows in the table where 'class' is 'pg' and 'type' is '0 - 6 - 0' have a value for 'uta' that is not empty.\n\n2. Next, let's look at the table and find the relevant rows:\n   ```\n   <tr>\n     <td>pg</td>\n     <td>0 - 6 - 0</td>\n     <td>10 - 11 , 78 , 100 - 103</td>\n     <td>7</td>\n     <td>1899 - 1904</td>\n     <td>0</td>\n     <td>7</td>\n     <td>1960 - 1964</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>q</td>\n     <td>4 - 4 - 0</td>\n     <td>120 - 125 , 130 - 136</td>\n     <td>13</td>\n     <td>1899 - 1904</td>\n     <td>5</td>\n     <td>4</td>\n     <td>1951 - 1963</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>qg</td>\n     <td>0 - 6 - 0</td>\n     <td>152 - 155</td>\n     <td>4</td>\n     <td>1903 - 1904</td>\n     <td>4</td>\n     <td>0</td>\n     <td>1958</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>nqg</td>\n     <td>0 - 6 - 0</td>\n     <td>9 , 38 - 39 , 109 , 112</td>\n     <td>5</td>\n     <td>1911</td>\n     <td>2</td>\n     <td>3</td>\n     <td>1958 - 1963</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>nlqg</td>\n     <td>0 - 6 - 0</td>\n     <td>165</td>\n     <td>1</td>\n     <td>1911</td>\n     <td>0</td>\n     <td>1</td>\n     <td>1961</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>s</td>\n     <td>4 - 4 - 0</td>\n     <td>170 - 174</td>\n     <td>5</td>\n     <td>1913</td>\n     <td>3</td>\n     <td>2</td>\n     <td>1964 - 1965</td>\n   </tr>\n\n   <tr>\n     <td>sg</td>\n     <td>0 - 6 - 0</td>\n     <td>37 , 40 - 41 , 137 - 138</td>\n     <td>5</td>\n     <td>1913</td>\n     <td>3</td>\n     <td>2</td>\n     <td>1961 - 1965</td>\n   </tr>\n   ```\n   \n3. Now, let's analyze each of these rows for the 'uta' column:\n   - The first row has a value of '7' in 'uta', which is not empty.\n   - The second row does not have any information about 'uta'.\n   - The third row has a value of '0' in 'uta', which is not empty.\n   - The fourth row has a value of '3' in 'uta', which is not empty.\n   - The fifth row does not have any information about 'uta'.\n   - The sixth row has a value of '2' in 'uta', which is not empty.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, it appears that all rows where 'class' is 'pg' and 'type' is '0 - 6 - 0' do not have an empty value for 'uta'.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After analyzing the claim and the table, it seems like all of the class pg type 0 - 6 - 0 locomotive make be incorporate in uta.

This rules out the claim that they were the last made.\n   * However, both classes d and dg have a latest withdrawn date of 1965. The claim states \"the class d and dg be the last made and latest withdrawn locomotive\". Since both were last produced in recent times (1913 for 'd' and 1964 for 'dg'), this condition also does not satisfy the claim.\n\n   Based on our step-by-step analysis, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Step 5: List the relevant cells to support the conclusion**\n\n   The relevant cells are:\n\n   * Cell at row index 9 column name \"Last Made\" with value \"1913\".\n   * Cell at row index 12 column name \"First Withdrawn\" with value \"1956 - 1960\".\n   * Cell at row index 14 column name \"Last Withdrawn\" with value \"1965\".\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified that class d and dg were produced in recent times (1913 for 'd' and 1964 for 'dg') but had been withdrawn as late as 1965.
