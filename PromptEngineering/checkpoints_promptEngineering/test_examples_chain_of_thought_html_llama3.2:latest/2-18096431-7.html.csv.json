If the value is Zimbabwe, then verify that there are no other players from Zimbabwe listed in the table.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given table:\n\n- First step: Find the country name of player Nick Price. The relevant cell can be found by looking at the \"country\" column for a match with the name \"zimbabwe\".\n  - Relevant cells:\n    ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 21,\n        \"column_name\": \"country\"\n      }\n    ```\n- Second step: Verify if the country value is indeed Zimbabwe.\n  - The table cell containing this information is located at row index 21 and column name \"country\". This matches with a Zimbabwean player, Nick Price.\n- Third step: Check that there are no other players from Zimbabwe listed in the table.\n  - The relevant cells for this check can be found by looking for rows where the country value is indeed Zimbabwe. \n    ```\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 19,\n        \"column_name\": \"country\"\n      }\n    ```\n- Fourth step: Verify that there are no other players from Zimbabwe listed in the table.\n   The cell at row index 19 and column name \"player\" contains Nick Price, which confirms this result.\n\nTherefore, since Nick Price is indeed the only player from Zimbabwe as per our check of the relevant cells:\n\n- The final answer can be expressed in JSON format as follows:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant cell containing country name for Nick Price confirmed he was from zimbabwe.

Compare these values to the \"to par\" of other players to determine if they are indeed tied:\n   - Since both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry have a \"to par\" of -11, we need to check the remaining players to see if any of them also have this value.\n   - We can find the \"to par\" values for these remaining players in cells B5 (again), D2 (again), H7 (for Lee Janzen) and F2 for Per-Ulrik Johansson.\n\n3. After checking, we see that only Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Lee Janzen and Per-Ulrik Johansson have a \"to par\" value of -11.\n   - Since the claim says that they are tied for having the lowest \"to par\", this is true because their values are identical.\n\n4. However, we still need to confirm if other players who had a lower \"to par\" score were not in this table and also had only one or more of these players listed.\n   - No such confirmation was found since no player has a lower value than Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Lee Janzen and Per-Ulrik Johansson.\n\n5. We can find the lowest total values by comparing each column for non-tie rows, but this isn't required to answer whether or not the two players tie for having the lowest score.\n   - This step confirms that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry are tied for having the lowest \"to par\", but we already found that all four of these players have an identical value.\n\n6.

Since both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry have the same total score of 277, we need to check their scores separately to determine if Kenny earned less than Mark.\n4.

However, the question asks for a comparison of their \"money\" values, which are $430000 and $260000 respectively.\n6.
