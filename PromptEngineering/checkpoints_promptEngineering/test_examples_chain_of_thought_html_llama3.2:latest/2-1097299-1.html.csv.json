    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, let's calculate how many judges have more than 10 years to go until their mandatory retirement.\n   We need to determine which judges have a value of \"more than 10 year\" for the column 'years until mandatory retirement'. \n\n2. Now we can find which cells match that criteria:\n- Liana fiol matta has only 2 years, so she doesn't meet the criteria.\n- Roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n has 19 years (but it is more than 10), so he meets the criteria.\n- Rafael mart\u00ednez torres also meets criteria because 15 > 10\n- Mildred pab\u00f3n charneco has 13 year, which is more than 10, so she also meets the criteria.\n\n3. From step 1 and 2 we have two judges, out of five that meet this criteria: federico hern\u00e1ndez denton (0 years), luis estrella mart\u00ednez (27 years) do not meet it because they have less than 10 year to mandatory retirement\n\n4. Now let's calculate how many judges there are in total\n   We can find the number by checking which cells contain data for the column 'name'\n    - Federico hern\u00e1ndez denton is a judge.\n    - Liana fiol matta is also a judge (but it doesn't meet criteria)\n    - Luis estrella mart\u00ednez has 27 years of time until mandatory retirement, so he's not one of our target group\n    - Mildred pab\u00f3n charneco has 13 year to mandatory retirement, she does not match the criteria.\n    - Rafael mart\u00ednez torres also doesn't match because his data is in \"more than 10 year\" column\n    - Roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n and anabelle rodr\u00edguez meet our condition.\n\n5. Now let's see if we have exactly two third of the judges that match our criteria:\n   We know there are five judge in total, so 'two third' will be $\\frac{2}{3} * 5 = \\frac{10}{3}$, which is not a whole number.\n   Thus, it can't be true.\n\n6. Since our claim has to be \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\", we need to determine that the condition was met. In this case it wasn't\n    because $\\frac{2}{3} * 5$ is not a whole number\n\n7. Our final conclusion will be that since one third of the group doesn't match with two thirds, then our claim must be false.\n\nHere's how we can represent all of these steps into json format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"first let's calculate how many judges have more than 10 years to go until their mandatory retirement.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\": 'years until mandatory retirement'},\n        {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\": 'years until mandatory retirement'},\n        {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\": 'years until mandatory retirement'},\n        {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\": 'years until mandatory retirement'},\n        {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\": 'years until mandatory retirement'}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"now we can find which cells match that criteria.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\": 'name'}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"from step 1 and 2 we have two judges, out of five that meet this criteria: federico hern\u00e1ndez denton (0 years), luis estrella mart\u00ednez (27 years) do not meet it because they have less than 10 year to mandatory retirement\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\": 'name'}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"now let's calculate how many judges there are in total\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n        {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\": 'name'}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"we know there are five judge in total, so  two third will be \\u22102\\u00b23 * 5 = \\u220212\\u002f3 which is not a whole number.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\":\n        [\n          {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n          {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n          {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n          {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\": 'name'},\n          {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\": 'name'}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"thus, it can't be true because \\u22102\\u00b23 * 5 is not a whole number.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will examine the table to understand the structure and content.\n2. Next, I will analyze each row of the table to identify which judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n3. Then, I will count the number of judges who were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o to determine if the claim is true.\n4. After that, I will verify the appointment year for each judge who was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o to ensure it matches the claim.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n  }\n]\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that Luis Fortu\u00f1o appointed the following judges: edgardo rivera garcia (2010), erick kolthoff caraballo (2009), federico hern\u00e1ndez denton (2004), luis estrella mart\u00ednez (2011), mildred pab\u00f3n charneco (2009), and rafael mart\u00ednez torres (2009). Therefore, the claim is true because 6 judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. However, upon closer inspection, we see that edgardo rivera garcia was indeed appointed by luis fortu\u00f1o and in the year 2010 which matches with what the claim stated, making the answer TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the table structure and the claim\nThe table has columns for 'name', 'rank', 'years until mandatory retirement', 'appointed by', and 'year appointed'. The claim is \"Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appoints the chief justice\".\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the relevant rows in the table\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to find the row that corresponds to Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n being the one who appointed someone. We look for the 'appointed by' column.\n\n#### Step 3: Look up Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n's appointment information\nWe examine the table and see that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n is listed as the 'appointed by' person for two associate justices (anabelle rodr\u00edguez, liana fiol matta) and one chief justice (federico hern\u00e1ndez denton).\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze if any of these appointments match the claim\nWe see that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed federico hernandez denton as chief justice in 2004. Since this matches our original statement, we are left to verify only other appointees.\n\n#### Step 5: Confirm the claim based on the analysis\nSince one and only one appointment by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n matches our desired outcome (an appointment of a Chief Justice), we can say that this appointment by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n is indeed what was stated, making the statement TRUE.\n\n#### Relevant cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 4,\"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4,\"column_name\": \"name\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5,\"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n]\n\n#### JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in the table, found her appointment information for an associate justice and a chief justice.
