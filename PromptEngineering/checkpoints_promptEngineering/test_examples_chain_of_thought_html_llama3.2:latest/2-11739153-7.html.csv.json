    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. The first task is to identify the player whose decision changed more often than Backstrom's during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season.\n\n2. From the table, we can see that there are three players who made decisions: Harding, Backstrom, and one other player (the \"decision\" column).\n\n3. However, from the \"decision\" column, it is not possible to identify which decision was made by whom since the names of those making the decision do not appear in the table.\n\n4. Therefore, our goal now shifts to comparing the number of times Harding and Backstrom made decisions during the 2007 - 08 season. The relevant data can be found in two columns: \"decision\" and the respective player's name (\"Backstrom\").\n\n5. To find this information, we need to locate all instances where a decision was made by either Harding or Backstrom.\n\n6. The instance numbers are as follows:\n- Harding (row 10): decision was made for St Louis on February 10\n- Harding (row 12): decision was made for Edmonton on February 12\n- Harding (row 16): decision was made for Washington on February 26\n- Harding (row 18): decision was made for Tampa Bay on February 27\n- Harding (row 20): decision was made for Florida on February 29\n\n7. The relevant data about Backstrom is as follows:\n- Backstrom (row 9): decision was made for New York Islanders on February 9\n- Backstrom (row 15): decision was made for Vancouver on February 14\n- Backstrom (row 17): decision was made for Nashville on February 17\n\n8. Now we compare the number of decisions Harding and Backstrom made: Harding made 4 decisions, while Backstrom made 3.\n\n9.
