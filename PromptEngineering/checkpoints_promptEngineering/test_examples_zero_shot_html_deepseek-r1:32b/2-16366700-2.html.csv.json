The claim says, \"bobby hull have score the most playoff goal of all chicago blackhawk player.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should check the table provided to see who has the highest playoff goals among Chicago Blackhawk players. Looking at the HTML table, I can see each row represents a player with their years, regular season goals, playoffs goals, and total goals.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"playoffs.\" I'll go through each row and note the playoff goals for each player:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3. Steve Larmer: 45\n4. Denis Savard: 61\n5. Dennis Hull: 33\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 35\n7. Tony Amonte: 13\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n9. Bill Mosienko: 10\n10. Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, I'll compare these numbers to see who has the highest. Bobby Hull has 62 playoff goals. Let's see if anyone else has more than that. Stan Mikita has 59, which is less than 62. Denis Savard has 61, also less than 62. The others have even fewer. \n\nWait a second, the claim says \"the most,\" so I need to make sure Bobby Hull's 62 is indeed the highest. From the numbers above, yes, 62 is the highest playoff goal count in this table.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are Bobby Hull's playoff goals and comparing them with others to confirm he has the highest. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bobby Hull scored the most playoff goals among Chicago Blackhawk players.

So, the relevant column for postseason goals would be the 'playoffs' column since that's where the playoff stats are listed.\n\nNext, I need to find Bill Mosienko in the table.

His row index is 8 because counting starts from 0: rows 0-9 correspond to the ten entries given.\n\nLooking at the 'playoffs' column for Bill Mosienko's row, it shows 10 goals.

The claim says: \"In the regular season, only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns for name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. I'm interested in the 'regular season' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a difference of 398 goals between the highest and lowest scorers. So, I should look at each player's total goals because that would indicate their overall contribution throughout their career.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The \"total\" column is the sum of regular season and playoff goals, so that's where I'll focus my attention.\n\nNow, let's list out each player's total goals:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 666\n2. Stan Mikita: 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 451\n4. Denis Savard: 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 268\n\nFrom this list, the highest total is Bobby Hull with 666 goals. The lowest totals are shared by Tony Amonte (281), Hubert Pit Martin (269), and both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram at 268 each.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the numbers because 398 seems like a large difference, but looking again, perhaps I misread one of the totals.\n\nLet me list them correctly:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 604 regular season + 62 playoffs = 666 total (correct)\n- Stan Mikita: 541 + 59 = 600\n- Steve Larmer: 406 + 45 = 451\n- Denis Savard: 377 + 61 = 438\n- Dennis Hull: 298 + 33 = 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 267 +35=302\n- Tony Amonte: 268 regular season +13 playoffs=281 total\n- Hubert Pit Martin:243+26=269\n- Bill Mosienko:258+10=268\n- Ken Wharram:252+16=268\n\nWait, actually, I think I made an error earlier. Let me recalculate the totals to be precise:\n\nBobby Hull: 604 +62=666\n\nStan Mikita:541+59=600\n\nSteve Larmer:406+45=451\n\nDenis Savard:377+61=438\n\nDennis Hull:298+33=331\n\nJeremy Roenick:267+35=302\n\nTony Amonte:268+13=281\n\nHubert Pit Martin:243+26=269\n\nBill Mosienko:258+10=268\n\nKen Wharram:252+16=268\n\nSo the highest total is 666 (Bobby Hull) and the lowest is 268, which is shared by Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram.\n\nNow, to find the difference between the highest and the lowest scorers: 666 - 268 = 398 goals. So that's exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the difference is indeed 398 goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there's a 398 goal difference between the highest and lowest scorers. From the table:\n\n- Highest scorer: Bobby Hull with 666 total goals (row_index 0).\n- Lowest scorer(s): Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram, each with 268 total goals (row_indices 8 and 9).\n\nCalculating the difference: 666 - 268 = 398.

It's stating that Bobby Hull scored the fewest playoff goals among all Chicago Blackhawks players listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with their respective years active, regular season goals, playoff goals, and total goals. The column names are 'name', 'years', 'regular season', 'playoffs', and 'total'.\n\nI need to focus on the 'playoffs' column because that's where the playoff goal numbers are listed. Bobby Hull is one of the players in the table, so I should check his playoff goals.\n\nLooking at Bobby Hull's row (row index 0), under the 'playoffs' column, it shows he scored 62 goals. Now, to verify if this is indeed the least among all players, I have to compare it with each player's playoff goals.\n\nLet me list out the playoff goals for each player:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2.

Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, going through each player's playoff goals:\n\n- Stan Mikita has 59, which is less than Bobby Hull's 62.\n- Steve Larmer has 45, even lower.\n- Denis Savard has 61, still higher than Bobby but not the lowest.\n- Dennis Hull with 33 is much lower.\n- Jeremy Roenick at 35.\n- Tony Amonte scored only 13 playoff goals, which is significantly less.\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26.\n- Bill Mosienko: 10.\n- Ken Wharram: 16.\n\nFrom this list, the lowest number of playoff goals is 10 by Bill Mosienko.

So I need to check if that's accurate according to the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The \"playoffs\" column should represent the number of postseason goals each player scored. \n\nNow, let me find Bill Mosienko in the table. Scanning through the names, I see his row is the 9th one (since rows start from index 0). His details are: name is Bill Mosienko, years are 1942-1955, regular season goals are 258, playoffs goals are 10, and total is 268.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says he scored 33 postseason goals. But according to this row, his playoff goals are only 10. That's way lower than 33. So that contradicts the claim right there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check all other players' playoff numbers to see if someone else actually has 33. Let me go through each player:\n\n- Bobby Hull: playoffs 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nOh, wait! I see that Dennis Hull has 33 playoff goals. That's the number mentioned in the claim, but attributed to Bill Mosienko instead of Dennis Hull.

So, my job is to check each player's 'total' column and see if there are any duplicates.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, total. The relevant column here is 'total' as that's where the claim focuses.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row and note down the total goals:\n\n1. Bobby Hull - 666\n2. Stan Mikita - 600\n3.

These would be the 'total' cells for both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram since their totals are identical.\n\nSo, in terms of row indices (starting from 0), Bill Mosienko is at row index 8, and Ken Wharram is at row index 9. Both have the same value in the 'total' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because two players share the same total goal count of 268.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a certain claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is provided in HTML format, and I need to examine it carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has headers: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. Each row represents a player with their respective statistics across these categories.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" So, this seems to suggest that the difference between the highest and lowest total goals is 20.\n\nMy first thought is to identify which columns are relevant here. Since we're talking about scoring totals, I should look at the 'total' column because it represents the overall goals scored by each player in their career, including both regular seasons and playoffs.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. Bobby Hull has a total of 666.\n2. Stan Mikita: 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 451\n4. Denis Savard: 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 268\n\nSo, the highest total is Bobby Hull with 666 goals. The lowest totals are shared by both Tony Amonte and Ken Wharram, but wait\u2014looking again, I see that Hubert Pit Martin has 269, Bill Mosienko also 268, and Ken Wharram 268 as well.\n\nWait a second, actually, looking at the 'total' column:\n\n- The highest is Bobby Hull: 666\n- The lowest seems to be the smallest number in that column. Let's go through each row:\n   - Bobby Hull: 666 (highest)\n   - Stan Mikita: 600\n   - Steve Larmer: 451\n   - Denis Savard: 438\n   - Dennis Hull: 331\n   - Jeremy Roenick: 302\n   - Tony Amonte: 281\n   - Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n   - Bill Mosienko: 268 (lowest)\n   - Ken Wharram: 268\n\nSo, the lowest total is 268, shared by Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram. The highest is 666.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between Bobby Hull's total and the lowest scorer(s). So, 666 minus 268 equals 398. That's a significant gap, much larger than 20 goals.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" But according to my calculation, it's 398 goals difference, not 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it refers to the regular season or playoffs columns instead of total? Let me check:\n\nLooking at 'regular season' column:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 604\n- Stan Mikita: 541\n- Steve Larmer: 406\n- Denis Savard: 377\n- Dennis Hull: 298\n- Jeremy Roenick: 267\n- Tony Amonte: 268\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 243\n- Bill Mosienko: 258\n- Ken Wharram: 252\n\nHighest in regular season is Bobby Hull with 604, lowest is Hubert Pit Martin with 243. Difference is 604 - 243 = 361.\n\nSimilarly, for playoffs:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nHighest in playoffs is Bobby Hull with 62, lowest is Tony Amonte with 13. Difference is 62 - 13 = 49.\n\nSo neither regular season nor playoffs have a difference of 20; the total column's difference is 398. Therefore, the claim that it's only 20 goals apart doesn't hold true based on any of these columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in identifying the highest and lowest scorers? Let me double-check:\n\nIn 'total', Bobby Hull is definitely the highest with 666. For the lowest, both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram have 268, which is indeed much lower than others like Tony Amonte at 281.\n\nThus, the difference between 666 and 268 is 398, not 20. Therefore, the claim seems to be false based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that there's only a 20-goal difference between the highest and lowest scorers in the 'total' column is incorrect. The actual difference is 398 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Total\"}\n  ],\n  \"result\": false\n}\n```",
