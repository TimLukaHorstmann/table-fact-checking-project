    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sony has the most subnotebooks with their Vaio series based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Sony as a manufacturer has the most subnotebooks with their Vaio series. So, I need to check how many entries in the table are from Sony and specifically under the Vaio series.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple manufacturers listed. The relevant columns here would be \"Manufacturer\" and possibly the \"Model\" or any other column that indicates the series. Wait, actually, in this table, each row represents a model, so I can look at the manufacturer for each model to count how many Sony models there are.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Manufacturer is \"You are tasked...\" Hmm, no, that's not part of the data. The actual rows start from index 0 with \"vaio vgn-tx2\" as the model and manufacturer \"sony\".\n\nWait, I need to recount properly. Let me list out all the manufacturers:\n\n- Row 0: sony\n- Row 1: sony\n- Row 2: sony\n- Row 3: sony\n- Row 4: sony\n- Row 5: sony\n- Row 6: nec\n- Row 7: micro - star international\n- Row 8: micro - star international\n- Row 9: micro - star international\n- Row 10: micro - star international\n- Row 11: nec\n- Row 12: sony\n- Row 13: sony\n- Row 14: sony\n- Row 15: sony\n- Row 16: nec\n- Row 17: sony\n- Row 18: sony\n- Row 19: micro - star international\n- Row 20: micro - star international\n- Row 21: micro - star international\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recount each row's manufacturer:\n\nLooking at the table, starting from index 0:\n\nRow 0: vaio vgn-tx2 (manufacturer: sony)\nRow 1: vaio vgn-tx2 (sony)\nRow 2: vaio tz (sony)\nRow 3: vaio tz (sony)\nRow 4: vaio tx2 (sony)\nRow 5: vaio tx2 (sony)\nRow 6: versapro vy10f / bh - l (nec)\nRow 7: u200 (micro-star international)\nRow 8: x340 (msi)\nRow 9: x370 (msi)\nRow 10: s30 (msi)\nRow 11: vaio vgn-tz (sony)\nRow 12: vaio tz (sony)\nRow 13: vaio tx2 (sony)\nRow 14: vaio tz (sony)\nRow 15: nec\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all manufacturers in order:\n\nLooking at the table's \"Manufacturer\" column for each row:\n\n0: sony\n1: sony\n2: sony\n3: sony\n4: sony\n5: sony\n6: nec\n7: micro-star international\n8: micro-star international\n9: micro-star international\n10: micro-star international\n11: sony\n12: sony\n13: sony\n14: sony\n15: nec\n16: nec\n17: sony\n18: sony\n19: micro-star international\n20: micro-star international\n21: micro-star international\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me recount correctly:\n\nLooking at each row's \"Manufacturer\" as per the table data provided:\n\nRows 0-5 (index 0 to 5): All are sony.\n\nRow 6: nec\n\nRow 7: micro - star international\n\nRow 8: micro - star international\n\nRow 9: micro - star international\n\nRow 10: micro - star international\n\nRow 11: sony\n\nRow 12: sony\n\nRow 13: sony\n\nRow 14: sony\n\nRow 15: nec\n\nRow 16: nec\n\nRow 17: sony\n\nRow 18: sony\n\nRow 19: micro - star international\n\nRow 20: micro - star international\n\nRow 21: micro - star international\n\nWait, that seems too many. Let me count the number of entries:\n\nFrom row index 0 to 21 (total 22 rows). So each row has a manufacturer.\n\nCounting Sony's models:\n\nRows: 0,1,2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14,17,18. That's 12 entries for Sony.\n\nNec has rows 6,15,16: 3 entries.\n\nMicro-star international (msi) has rows 7,8,9,10,19,20,21: 7 entries.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nSony: rows 0-5 (6), then 11-14 (4 more), then 17-18 (2). Total 6+4+2=12.\n\nNec: rows 6,15,16. That's 3.\n\nmsi: rows 7-10 (4) and 19-21 (3). So 7 total.\n\nSo Sony has 12 entries, msi has 7, nec has 3.\n\nTherefore, Sony has the most subnotebooks in this table with 12 models. Since the claim is that Sony has the most with their Vaio series, and all of Sony's entries are under Vaio (as per the model names), then yes, Sony has the most subnotebooks.\n\nSo the answer would be that the claim is true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists 12 models from Sony under the Vaio series, more than any other manufacturer. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nSony has the most subnotebooks with their Vaio series in the given data. The relevant rows are:\n\n- Rows 0-5 (6 entries)\n- Rows 11-14 (4 entries)\n- Rows 17-18 (2 entries)\n\nTotal of 12 models from Sony.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nSony has the most subnotebooks with their Vaio series in the table. The relevant rows are:\n\n- Rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, and 18.\n\nThus, the claim is true.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only sony offer dvd in their subnotebooks as an option\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each column represents. The columns are: Subnotebook Name, Vendor, Weight (kg), Display Size (inch), CPU Model, and Storage. The claim is about whether Sony is the only vendor offering a DVD option in their subnotebooks.\n\nI should focus on the \"Storage\" column because that's where any mention of DVDs would be. So I'll go through each row and check if \"dvd\" appears in the storage options.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Row 0: Storage is \"ssd\". No DVD here.\n- Row 1: Same as row 0, no DVD.\n- Row 2: Storage is \"hdd\". Still no DVD mentioned.\n- Row 3: Again, same as previous rows, no DVD.\n\nContinuing this way:\nRows 4 to 9 don't mention DVDs either. \n\nLooking at the Sony entries specifically:\nRow 16: Storage includes \"ssd , dvd\" and another entry for the same model with \"hdd  , dvd\". So Sony does offer DVD as an option here.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other vendors also offer DVD. Let's go back through all rows:\n\n- Row 0 to row 15: None of these mention DVDs except for the two Sony entries in row 16 and another row where it's repeated (maybe a duplicate). \n\nWait, let me double-check. Rows after Sony include other vendors like NEC, MSI, etc. Looking at row 24: Storage is \"hdd\". No DVD there.\n\nRow 25: Same as others. \n\nWait, actually, looking back, I might have missed some entries. Let me go through each row again carefully:\n\n1. Toshiba Libretto L10S - storage ssd\n2. Toshiba Libretto W10 - same\n3. Samsung NC10 - hdd\n4. Samsung R580 - same\n5. Acer Aspire 1 - ssd\n6. Acer Aspire 1 - hdd\n7. HP Mini 210-1120sa - hdd\n8. HP Mini 2130nr - same\n9. Dell Inspiron 1010 - hdd\n10. Lenovo IdeaPad U160 - ssd\n11. Lenovo X60s - same\n12. Apple Macbook Air - ssd\n13. Sony Vaio VGN-TZ (row 16) - has dvd in storage options\n14. Another entry for the same Sony model with hdd and dvd\n15. Sony Vaio TX2 models also have dvd as an option\n16. NEC Versapro offers hdd, no dvd\n17. MSI U200 - hdd\n18. MSI X340 - hdd\n19. MSI X370 - same\n20. MSI S30 - hdd + ssd\n\nSo in the entire table, only Sony's subnotebooks list DVD as an option. All other vendors either have SSD, HDD, or combinations without mentioning DVDs.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Sony is the only vendor offering DVD in their subnotebooks.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Storage\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Storage\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"only 2 subnotebooks use amd as their primary chipset processor.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. We're looking for how many subnotebooks in the table have AMD as their primary chipset processor. If only two do, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: Model, Company, Price, Screen Size (inches), Processor, and Storage. The relevant column here is \"Processor.\" I need to scan through each row and note which ones have AMD listed as the processor.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Processor is Pentium M. Not AMD.\n2. **Row 1**: Pentium M again. Still not AMD.\n3. **Row 2**: Pentium M. Nope.\n4. **Row 3**: Core Duo ULV U7600. That's Intel, so no.\n5. **Row 4**: Core 2 Duo ULV U7600/U7700. Still Intel.\n6. **Row 5**: Pentium M ULV 773. Intel again.\n7. **Row 6**: Core i3. Intel's processor, not AMD.\n8. **Row 7**: Core i3. Same as above.\n9. **Row 8**: Core 2 Duo ULV U7600. Intel.\n10. **Row 9**: Pentium M. Not AMD.\n11. **Row 10**: Core 2 Duo ULV U7600. Intel.\n12. **Row 11**: Pentium M ULV 773. Still Intel.\n13. **Row 12**: Core 2 Duo ULV U7600. Intel again.\n14. **Row 13**: Core 2 Duo ULV U7600/U7700. Intel.\n15. **Row 14**: Pentium M. Not AMD.\n16. **Row 15**: Core i3. Intel.\n17. **Row 16**: Core i3. Same as above.\n18. **Row 17**: Core i3. Still Intel.\n19. **Row 18**: Core i3. Intel again.\n20. **Row 19**: AMD E-450. Okay, here's the first AMD processor I see.\n21. **Row 20**: AMD E-450. Another one with AMD.\n\nSo, from row 20 and row 21 (assuming rows are zero-indexed), we have two entries with AMD processors. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes the table might be 1-indexed or I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, in the table provided, each row is listed without explicit indices, so perhaps it's better to count from top to bottom. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- The first few rows up to row 16 (assuming starting from 0) don't mention AMD.\n- Then I see two models with AMD E-450: one in the U200 model and another in the X370 model.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, let me list out all the processors:\n\nRow numbers as per the table's tbody:\n\n1. Pentium M\n2. Pentium M\n3. Pentium M\n4. Core Duo ULV...\n5. Core 2 Duo...\n6. Pentium M\n7. Core i3\n8. Core i3\n9. Core 2 Duo\n10. Pentium M\n11. Core 2 Duo\n12. Pentium M\n13. Core 2 Duo\n14. Core 2 Duo\n15. Pentium M\n16. Core i3\n17. Core i3\n18. Core i3\n19. Core i3\n20. AMD E-450\n21. AMD E-450\n\nWait, that can't be right because the table has 22 rows (from 0 to 21). So in row 20 and 21, there are two entries with AMD processors.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table again:\n\nThe last few models:\n\n- s30: Intel Core i3\n- x370: AMD E-450\n- u200: Core 2 Solo SU3500 (Intel)\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each model's processor again.\n\nLooking back, the last few rows:\n\n18. s30: Intel Core i3\n19. x370: AMD E-450\n20. u200: Core 2 Solo SU3500 (Intel)\nWait, but in the original table, after row 17, which is the X370 with AMD E-450, there's another entry:\n\nRow 18: s30 has Intel Core i3.\n\nSo perhaps I miscounted. Let me list each model and its processor:\n\nRow 0: Pentium M\nRow 1: Pentium M\nRow 2: Pentium M\nRow 3: Core Duo ULV...\nRow 4: Core 2 Duo...\nRow 5: Pentium M\nRow 6: Core i3\nRow 7: Core i3\nRow 8: Core 2 Duo\nRow 9: Pentium M\nRow 10: Core 2 Duo\nRow 11: Pentium M\nRow 12: Core 2 Duo\nRow 13: Core 2 Duo\nRow 14: Pentium M\nRow 15: Core i3\nRow 16: Core i3\nRow 17: AMD E-450 (X370)\nRow 18: AMD E-450 (U200?)\n\nWait, no. Let me check the actual table:\n\nIn the given table, after row 17 (which is s30 with Core i3), there's u200 with Core 2 Solo SU3500, which is Intel.\n\nThen, X370 has AMD E-450.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list the models and their processors accurately:\n\n1. Model: [various], Processor: Pentium M\n...\nRow 19: u200 - Core 2 Solo SU3500 (Intel)\nRow 20: X370 - AMD E-450\nRow 21: [Is there another? Or perhaps the last row is s30 with Core i3]\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nThe table has 22 rows in tbody:\n\nRows 0-21.\n\nLooking through each processor:\n\n- Rows 0-3: Pentium M\n- Row 4: Core Duo ULV...\n- Row 5: Pentium M\n- Row 6: Core i3\n- Row 7: Core i3\n- Row 8: Core 2 Duo\n- Row 9: Pentium M\n- Row 10: Core 2 Duo\n- Row 11: Pentium M\n- Row 12: Core 2 Duo\n- Row 13: Core 2 Duo\n- Row 14: Pentium M\n- Row 15: Core i3\n- Row 16: Core i3\n- Row 17: AMD E-450 (X370)\n- Row 18: Core 2 Solo SU3500 (u200, Intel)\n- Row 19: s30 - Core i3\n\nWait, so only one entry with AMD? Or two?\n\nLooking back, the X370 and another model both have AMD E-450. Let me check:\n\nIn the table provided, after row 17 (X370 with AMD), is there another model with AMD?\n\nNo, in row 18: u200 has Core 2 Solo SU3500 (Intel). Row 19: s30 - Core i3.\n\nSo only one entry with AMD? Or did I miss another?\n\nWait, perhaps the X370 is the only one. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's processor:\n\nRow 0: Pentium M\nRow 1: Pentium M\nRow 2: Pentium M\nRow 3: Core Duo ULV...\nRow 4: Core 2 Duo...\nRow 5: Pentium M\nRow 6: Core i3\nRow 7: Core i3\nRow 8: Core 2 Duo\nRow 9: Pentium M\nRow 10: Core 2 Duo\nRow 11: Pentium M\nRow 12: Core 2 Duo\nRow 13: Core 2 Duo\nRow 14: Pentium M\nRow 15: Core i3\nRow 16: Core i3\nRow 17: AMD E-450 (X370)\nRow 18: Core 2 Solo SU3500 (u200, Intel)\nRow 19: s30 - Core i3\n\nSo only one subnotebook uses AMD as the processor. Therefore, the answer is one.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking at the table provided in the question:\n\nThe user provided a table with multiple rows. Each row has details like Model, Processor, etc.\n\nI need to count how many have 'AMD' in the processor column.\n\nFrom the given table:\n\nRow 0: Pentium M\nRow 1: Pentium M\nRow 2: Pentium M\nRow 3: Core Duo ULV...\nRow 4: Core 2 Duo...\nRow 5: Pentium M\nRow 6: Core i3\nRow 7: Core i3\nRow 8: Core 2 Duo\nRow 9: Pentium M\nRow 10: Core 2 Duo\nRow 11: Pentium M\nRow 12: Core 2 Duo\nRow 13: Core 2 Duo\nRow 14: Pentium M\nRow 15: Core i3\nRow 16: Core i3\nRow 17: AMD E-450 (X370)\nRow 18: Core 2 Solo SU3500 (u200, Intel)\nRow 19: s30 - Core i3\n\nSo only one entry has AMD. Therefore, the number of subnotebooks with AMD processors is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe number of subnotebooks with AMD processors is \\boxed{1}.",

The claim is \"Sony have the lightest subnotebook at 0.78 kg.\" I need to check if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries where the manufacturer is Sony. Looking down the Manufacturer column:\n\n- There are multiple Sony entries in rows 15 (vaio vgn-tz), 16 (vaio vgn-tz again), 17 (vaio vgn-tx2), and 18 (vaio vgn-tx2 again). \n\nWait, row indexes start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: Toshiba Libretto W100\nRow 1: Toshiba Libretto L200\n...\nLooking through each row until I find Sony entries.\n\nAh, starting from the beginning:\n\nRows 15-18 are Sony models:\n- Row 15: vaio vgn-tz, weight 1.20 kg\n- Row 16: same model as 15, 1.20 kg\n- Rows 17 and 18: vaio vgn-tx2, both 1.20 kg\n\nWait, but the claim mentions 0.78 kg. That's much lighter than 1.20 kg.

The claim is that \"there be 7 subnotebooks that offered solid state drive as their hard drive.\" I need to verify if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: Model, Company Name, Weight (kg), Screen Size (inch), Processor, and Hard Drive. The relevant column for checking SSDs is \"Hard Drive.\"\n\nI need to scan each row's \"Hard Drive\" entry to see if it includes an SSD.

Let me go through each row systematically:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Not relevant (header or placeholder).\n2. **Row 1**: ssd \u2192 counts.\n3. **Row 2**: hdd \u2192 no.\n4. **Row 3**: ssd , dvd \u2192 yes.\n5. **Row 4**: hdd  + ssd \u2192 yes.\n6. **Row 5**: hdd  , dvd \u2192 no.\n7. **Row 6**: ssd  , dvd \u2192 yes.\n8. **Row 7**: hdd  , dvd \u2192 no.\n9. **Row 8**: hdd \u2192 no.\n10. **Row 9**: hdd \u2192 no.\n11. **Row 10**: hdd \u2192 no.\n12. **Row 11**: hdd \u2192 no.\n13. **Row 12**: hdd \u2192 no.\n14. **Row 13**: hdd \u2192 no.\n\nWait, that only gives me four rows where SSD is present. But the user's initial count was seven. Clearly, I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nAh, perhaps there are multiple entries for the same model but different configurations. For example, \"vaio vgn - tz\" appears twice with different Hard Drive setups:\n\n- First occurrence: ssd , dvd \u2192 yes.\n- Second occurrence: hdd  , dvd \u2192 no.\n\nSimilarly, other models might have multiple entries where some include SSD and others don't.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, I notice that \"vaio vgn - tz\" is listed twice with different Hard Drive configurations. One has SSD, the other doesn't. Similarly, other models like \"vaio vgn - tz2\" might be present but not in this snippet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial count was seven based on considering each occurrence of SSD across multiple rows, even if they are duplicates of the same model but different configurations.\n\nBut according to the table provided, I can only see a few instances where SSD is mentioned. Therefore, the claim that there are 7 subnotebooks with SSD might not hold true based on the data in this table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the rows. Let me count again:\n\n- Row 1: ssd \u2192 1\n- Row 3: ssd , dvd \u2192 2\n- Row 4: hdd  + ssd \u2192 3\n- Row 6: ssd  , dvd \u2192 4\n\nThat's four rows where SSD is mentioned. Unless there are more rows beyond what's shown, the count would be four, not seven.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are seven subnotebooks with SSD seems to be FALSE based on this table.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided table, only four subnotebooks have an SSD as part of their hard drive configuration. Therefore, the claim is:\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{4}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim \"most of sony 's subnotebooks be the versapro series\" is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that most of Sony's subnotebooks belong to the VersaPro series. So, I should check how many of Sony's subnotebooks are in the VersaPro series compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a column named \"Submodel\" which lists different models and their manufacturers under \"Manufacturer\". Let me go through each row where the manufacturer is Sony to count how many are VersaPro versus other models.\n\nLet's list all the rows with Manufacturer as Sony:\n\n1. Row 0: Submodel \"vaio vgn-tz\", Manufacturer \"sony\"\n2. Row 1: Submodel \"vaio vgn-tz\", Manufacturer \"sony\"\n3. Row 2: Submodel \"vaio vgn-tx2\", Manufacturer \"sony\"\n4. Row 3: Submodel \"vaio vgn-tx2\", Manufacturer \"sony\"\n5. Row 15: Submodel \"versapro vy10f / bh - l\", Manufacturer \"nec\" \u2014 Wait, this is NEC, not Sony.\n6. Checking all rows, I don't see any other Sony subnotebooks except the ones listed above.\n\nWait a minute, looking again at row indices:\n\n- Row 8: Submodel \"versapro vy10f / bh - l\", Manufacturer \"nec\" \u2014 so it's NEC, not Sony.\n- The rest of Sony's models are all under the \"vaio vgn-tz\" and \"vaio vgn-tx2\".\n\nSo, Sony has four subnotebooks listed:\n\n- vaio vgn-tz (twice)\n- vaio vgn-tx2 (twice)\n\nNone of these are VersaPro. The only VersaPro is under NEC.\n\nTherefore, none of Sony's subnotebooks in the table are VersaPro. So, the claim that \"most\" of them are VersaPro is definitely false because all of Sony's listed models are Vaio series, not VersaPro.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that most of Sony's subnotebooks are the VersaPro series. However, examining the data, all Sony subnotebooks listed under 'Manufacturer' are from the 'vaio vgn-tz' or 'vaio vgn-tx2' models, none being the VersaPro series.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Submodel\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Manufacturer\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I'll continue checking all rows to see how many use AMD as their primary processor.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Most models are using Intel processors like Core 2 Duo, Pentium M, etc.\n- Only a few, like X370 and some others, mention AMD E-450 or similar.\n\nAfter reviewing all the data, it seems that more than two subnotebooks use AMD.

Wait, the claim says both Panasonic and Sony.\n\nWait, let me check all manufacturers:\n\nLooking through each row's Manufacturer column to find 'panasonic' and 'sony'.\n\nFor Panasonic:\n- I don't see any rows where the manufacturer is Panasonic except maybe if there are more rows beyond what's shown here? Wait, in the table provided, looking at each row from 0 onwards.\n\nWait, the table provided includes several manufacturers: Dell, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Acer, Asus, Fujitsu, Sony, NEC, and Micro-Star International.

I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: Model Name, Vendor, Price (Euro), Screen Size (Diag.), CPU, and Hard Drive. The relevant column here is \"Hard Drive\" because that's where the information about SSDs would be listed.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the table to check if the Hard Drive column mentions an SSD. \n\nStarting from the top:\n1. Row 0: The hard drive is \"ssd\". This counts as one.\n2. Row 1: Hard drive is \"hdd\". Doesn't count.\n3. Row 2: Hard drive is \"hdd\". Doesn't count.\n4. Row 3: Hard drive is \"ssd, dvd\". There's an SSD here, so that's two.\n5. Row 4: Same as row 3 but different hard drives; still counts as three.\n6. Row 5: Hard drive is \"pentium m ulv 773\". Not clear if it's SSD or HDD, probably doesn't count.\n7. Row 6: Same as row 5, so no.\n8. Row 7: Hard drive is \"hdd + ssd\". This includes an SSD, making four.\n9. Rows beyond that don't mention SSD.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed some rows. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: ssd \u2192 1\n- Row 3 and 4 both list ssd alongside dvd \u2192 two more (total 3)\n- Row 7 mentions hdd + ssd \u2192 another one (total 4)\n\nAre there any other SSD entries? Rows like row 8 have \"ssd\" only, but in the data provided, I don't see that. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all rows carefully:\n\n- The first model with an SSD is at row index 0.\n- Then rows 3 and 4 have SSD options.\n- Row 7 mentions an SSD as part of a combination drive.\n\nNo other entries in the table mention SSDs beyond these four instances.
