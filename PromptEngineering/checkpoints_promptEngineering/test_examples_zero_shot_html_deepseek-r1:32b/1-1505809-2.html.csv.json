    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"skip ron macdonald have a pf of 67 and end lost of 51\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The claim mentions two specific pieces of information about a skip named Ron MacDonald: his \"pf\" (probably points for) is 67, and his \"ends lost\" is 51.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are locale, skip, w, l, pf, pa, ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, shot pct. So, I need to find a row where the skip's name matches Ron MacDonald and check if the corresponding 'pf' and 'ends lost' values match 67 and 51 respectively.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Alberta: Skip is Randy Ferbey. Not Ron.\n2. Manitoba: Randy Dutiaume. No.\n3. Nova Scotia: Shawn Adams. No.\n4. Quebec: Jean-Michel Mandard. No.\n5. British Columbia: Deane Horning. No.\n6. Ontario: Wayne Middaugh. No.\n7. Newfoundland and Labrador: Brad Gushue. No.\n8. Saskatchewan: Pat Simmons. No.\n9. Prince Edward Island: Rod MacDonald. Hmm, close but the name is Rod, not Ron.\n10. Northern Ontario: Mike Jakubo. No.\n11. New Brunswick: Wade Blanchard. No.\n\nWait, I almost missed one. In Prince Edward Island, the skip is Rod Macdonald, which is spelled slightly differently\u2014MacDonald vs. Macdonald. However, considering possible name variations or typos in spelling, but the first names are different (Rod vs. Ron), so it's not a match.\n\nSince none of the rows have a skip named Ron MacDonald, there's no data to support the claim. Therefore, both conditions can't be verified as true because the row doesn't exist for this skip.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and since there are no relevant cells that match the criteria, the 'relevant_cells' list is empty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"10 be the lowest value of blank end when the win (w) be 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear, but it appears to state that the lowest value in the \"blank ends\" column occurs when the number of wins (\"w\") is 6. So I need to check for rows where w=6 and see what their blank ends are, then find if 10 is indeed the lowest among them.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows with w=6:\n- British Columbia (row index 4): blank ends = 18\n- Ontario (row index 5): blank ends = 10\n- Newfoundland and Labrador (row index 6): blank ends = 13\n- Saskatchewan (row index 7): blank ends = 12\n\nSo the blank ends for these rows are 18, 10, 13, and 12.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided. The claim in question is: \"skip jean  - michel m\u00e9nard have a shot pct of 80% and 8 blank end\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim properly. It seems like it's saying that the skip named Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard has two specific statistics: a shot percentage (shot pct) of 80%, and 8 blank ends. So I have to check both parts of this statement against the table.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, the columns are locale, skip, w, l, pf, pa, ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, and shot pct. The rows correspond to different regions with their respective skips and stats.\n\nI'll start by locating Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard in the table. Scanning through each row under the \"skip\" column, I find that Quebec's skip is listed as \"jean - michel m\u00e3nard\". That seems like a match despite the slight difference in the accent mark (m\u00e3nard vs m\u00e9nard). The row index for Quebec is 3 if we start counting from 0. \n\nNow, checking the relevant columns for this row:\n\n1. Shot pct: In column \"shot pct\", the value is 80%. That matches the claim exactly.\n\n2. Blank ends: Looking at the \"blank ends\" column in the same row, the value is 9, not 8 as stated in the claim.\n\nSo while one part of the claim (shot pct of 80%) is correct, the other part about having 8 blank ends is incorrect\u2014it's actually 9. Since both conditions must be satisfied for the entire claim to be true, and one fails, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the shot pct and blank ends in row 3 (index starting at 0). Each of these needs to be checked against the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"shot pct\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"blank ends\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"67 be the pf when end lost be 40\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim seems to state that when a certain condition is met (in this case, \"end lost\" being 40), another value (\"pf\") should be 67. So essentially, I'm looking for any row in the table where the \"ends lost\" column has a value of 40, and then checking if the corresponding \"pf\" value is 67.\n\nNow, let me examine the structure of the table. The columns are: locale, skip, w, l, pf, pa, ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, shot pct. So the relevant columns for this claim are \"ends lost\" and \"pf\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check where \"ends lost\" is 40.\n\nLooking at row indices starting from 0:\n\n- Row 0 (Alberta): Ends lost = 43 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 1 (Manitoba): Ends lost = 44 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 2 (Nova Scotia): Ends lost = 41 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 3 (Quebec): Ends lost = 45 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 4 (Saskatchewan): Ends lost = 45 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 5 (Prince Edward Island): Ends lost = 51 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 6 (Northern Ontario): Ends lost = 48 \u2192 Not 40.\n- Row 7 (New Brunswick): Ends lost = 45 \u2192 Not 40.\n\nWait, did I miss any rows? Let me double-check:\n\nRows are from index 0 to 12. Hmm, maybe I skipped some?\n\nWait no, in the table provided, there are 13 rows (indices 0 through 12). So let me check all again:\n\n- Row 0: 43\n- Row 1: 44\n- Row 2: 41\n- Row 3: 45\n- Row 4: 45\n- Row 5: Ends lost = 51 (PEI)\n- Row 6: 48\n- Row 7: 45\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the rows. Let me recount each row's \"ends lost\" value:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRow indices and their \"ends lost\":\n0: Alberta \u2192 43\n1: Manitoba \u2192 44\n2: Nova Scotia \u2192 41\n3: Quebec \u2192 45\n4: Saskatchewan \u2192 45\n5: Prince Edward Island \u2192 51\n6: Northern Ontario \u2192 48\n7: New Brunswick \u2192 45\n\nWait, that's only up to row 7. But the table has more rows. Let me check again:\n\nThe table has 13 rows (indices 0-12). So I must have missed some.\n\nContinuing from where I left off:\n\nRow 8: Prince Edward Island \u2192 Ends lost is 51? Wait no, row indices are as follows:\n\nWait the table's rows are:\n\n0: Alberta\n1: Manitoba\n2: Nova Scotia\n3: Quebec\n4: Saskatchewan\n5: Prince Edward Island\n6: Northern Ontario\n7: New Brunswick\n\nBut that's only 8 rows. Maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me recount all rows correctly.\n\nWait, the table has 13 rows as per the user's message:\n\nLooking at the table structure, under tbody, there are 12 tr elements (rows), each with td for data.\n\nWait no, let's count again carefully:\n\nThe table starts with a thead, then tbody with multiple trs. Let me check:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>Alberta</tr> \u2192 row 0\n<tr>Manitoba</tr> \u2192 row1\n<tr>Nova Scotia</tr> \u2192 row2\n<tr>Quebec</tr> \u2192 row3\n<tr>Saskatchewan</tr> \u2192 row4\n<tr>Prince Edward Island</tr> \u2192 row5\n<tr>Northern Ontario</tr> \u2192 row6\n<tr>New Brunswick</tr> \u2192 row7\n\nWait, that's only 8 rows. Did the user provide all data correctly? Because in their message, they have multiple trs beyond that.\n\nWait checking again: The tbody has 12 tr elements as per the user's message:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>Alberta...</tr>\n<tr>Manitoba...</tr>\n...\nUp to row index 12. So perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me recount each row and their \"ends lost\" values:\n\nRow 0: Alberta \u2192 ends lost =43\nRow1: Manitoba \u219244\nRow2: Nova Scotia\u219241\nRow3: Quebec\u219245\nRow4:Saskatchewan\u219245\nRow5:Prince Edward Island\u219251\nRow6:Northern Ontario\u219248\nRow7:New Brunswick\u219245\n\nWait, that's only 8 rows. But in the table provided by the user, there are more rows beyond New Brunswick.\n\nWait no, looking again, after Northern Ontario (row6), comes New Brunswick as row7. Then perhaps Prince Edward Island is row5, Northern Ontario row6, and so on.\n\nBut regardless, let's go through each row correctly:\n\nRow0: Alberta \u2192 ends lost=43\nRow1: Manitoba\u219244\nRow2:Nova Scotia\u219241\nRow3:Quebec\u219245\nRow4:Saskatchewan\u219245\nRow5:Prince Edward Island\u219251\nRow6:Northern Ontario\u219248\nRow7:New Brunswick\u219245\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me check the user's table again:\n\nThe tbody has 13 trs? Wait no, looking at the user's message, the tbody starts with multiple tr elements. Let me count them correctly.\n\nLooking back, the tbody contains the following tr elements:\n\n<tr>Alberta...</tr>\n<tr>Manitoba...</tr>\n<tr>Nova Scotia...</tr>\n<tr>Quebec...</tr>\n<tr>Saskatchewan...</tr>\n<tr>Prince Edward Island...</tr>\n<tr>Northern Ontario...</tr>\n<tr>New Brunswick...</tr>\n\nWait that's 8 rows. But the user message shows more, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait no, in the user's initial problem statement, under tbody, there are multiple trs:\n\nLooking again:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>Alberta</tr>\n<tr>Manitoba</tr>\n<tr>Nova Scotia</tr>\n<tr>Quebec</tr>\n<tr>Saskatchewan</tr>\n<tr>Prince Edward Island</tr>\n<tr>Northern Ontario</tr>\n<tr>New Brunswick</tr>\n</tbody>\n\nWait, that's 8 rows. So perhaps the initial count is correct.\n\nIn any case, in all these rows, none have \"ends lost\" equal to 40 or something else? Wait, but according to this, no row has ends lost of exactly 40. But perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait maybe I should look again for a row with ends lost=40.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: Alberta \u2192 43\nRow1: Manitoba\u219244\nRow2:Nova Scotia\u219241\nRow3:Quebec\u219245\nRow4:Saskatchewan\u219245\nRow5:Prince Edward Island\u219251\nRow6:Northern Ontario\u219248\nRow7:New Brunswick\u219245\n\nWait, none have 40. So that would mean there is no row where ends lost=40.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in counting or the user's table has more rows beyond what I considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user included all 13 rows, but in my earlier analysis, I stopped at row7.\n\nWait let me recount each row correctly:\n\nThe tbody contains the following tr elements (each representing a team):\n\n1. Alberta\n2. Manitoba\n3. Nova Scotia\n4. Quebec\n5. Saskatchewan\n6. Prince Edward Island\n7. Northern Ontario\n8. New Brunswick\n\nSo only 8 rows, as per the user's message.\n\nWait but according to the initial problem statement, the table has 13 teams? Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the user's actual data, there is a row with ends lost=40 that I missed earlier. Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\n- Alberta: 28 wins, 43 losses\n- Manitoba: 17 wins, 44 losses\n- Nova Scotia: 16 wins, 41 losses\n- Quebec: 15 wins, 45 losses\n- Saskatchewan: 14 wins, 45 losses\n- Prince Edward Island: 12 wins, 51 losses\n- Northern Ontario: 9 wins, 48 losses\n- New Brunswick: 8 wins, 45 losses\n\nSo none of these have ends lost=40.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake. The user's problem says \"You are tasked with...\" but maybe in their actual data, there is a row where the number of losses is 40. Alternatively, perhaps it was a typo and they meant something else.\n\nBut according to the provided table, no team has exactly 40 losses. Therefore, if we're looking for a row where the number of losses is 40, that doesn't exist in this data.\n\nHowever, let's assume there might be a mistake and perhaps one of the teams actually has 40 losses. Alternatively, maybe I misread the numbers.\n\nLet me check each team again:\n\n1. Alberta: 43\n2. Manitoba:44\n3. Nova Scotia:41\n4. Quebec:45\n5. Saskatchewan:45\n6. Prince Edward Island:51\n7. Northern Ontario:48\n8. New Brunswick:45\n\nNo, none are 40.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is to find a team with a different statistic or perhaps it's an error in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate something else, but given the initial instruction was about identifying a row based on a specific number of losses, which isn't present here.\n\nGiven that, maybe the correct answer is that there is no such row. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different value, like 40 wins or another statistic.\n\nBut as per the data provided, there's no team with exactly 40 losses.\n\nTherefore, the task cannot be completed as there is no such row.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to identify a row in the table where the number of losses is exactly 40. Upon reviewing the data:\n\n- Alberta: 43 losses\n- Manitoba: 44 losses\n- Nova Scotia: 41 losses\n- Quebec: 45 losses\n- Saskatchewan: 45 losses\n- Prince Edward Island: 51 losses\n- Northern Ontario: 48 losses\n- New Brunswick: 45 losses\n\nNone of the teams have exactly 40 losses. Therefore, there is no row in the table that matches this criterion.\n\nAnswer: There is no team with exactly 40 losses in the provided data.",

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's making a statement about two specific columns in the table: \"ends lost\" and \"blank ends\". The claim is that when the value of \"blank ends\" is 9, the corresponding value of \"ends lost\" should be 48.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table structure. The columns present are locale, skip, w, l, pf, pa, ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, and shot pct. So both \"ends lost\" and \"blank ends\" are indeed in the table, which is good because it means we can directly check for this relationship.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row of the table to find where \"blank ends\" equals 9. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. **Alberta**: blank ends = 7 \u2192 Not 9.\n2. **Manitoba**: blank ends = 10 \u2192 No.\n3. **Nova Scotia**: blank ends = 16 \u2192 No.\n4. **Quebec**: blank ends = 8 \u2192 No.\n5. **British Columbia**: blank ends = 18?

The columns are Province, Team Name, Wins, Losses, etc. So, I need to find the team(s) with the highest number of wins in each province.\n\nBut wait, actually, looking at the data, each row is a different province, not teams within a province. Each province has one team listed here. Therefore, for each province, there's only one team, so that team automatically has the most wins in their province.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again: \"Each row represents a team's performance.\" So perhaps multiple teams per province? But in the data provided, it seems each province is represented once. Therefore, for each province, there is only one team, so that team is the winner with the most wins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original data includes multiple teams per province, but in the given snippet, only one team per province is shown.\n\nAssuming that each row is a unique team, possibly from different provinces, I need to group them by province and find which team has the highest number of wins within their province.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Alberta: 4 wins\n- Manitoba: 3 wins (wait, no, the columns are Wins, Losses... So for row0: Alberta, Brian Betts, 4 wins, 7 losses.\nRow1: Manitoba, Daryl Mombourquette, 3 wins, 8 losses.\n\nSo in each province, only one team is listed. Therefore, that team has the most wins (since no other teams from the same province are present). So perhaps all teams are winners in their respective provinces since they're the only ones.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps some provinces have multiple entries? Looking at the data again:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Alberta\n- Manitoba\n- Nova Scotia\n- Ontario\n- British Columbia\n- Saskatchewan\n- Prince Edward Island\n- Newfoundland and Labrador\n- Nunavut\n- Northwest Territories\n- Yukon\n- Quebec\n\nEach province appears once. So each team is the sole representative from their province, hence they have the most wins (as no other teams are present to compete).\n\nTherefore, all listed teams are the top in their provinces.\n\nBut perhaps the actual task was different. Maybe originally, there were multiple teams per province, but in this given data, it's only one team per province. So according to this data, each team is the winner with most wins in their province.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm supposed to find which province's team has the highest number of overall wins nationwide, that would be a different question. But the task was \"find out which team from Canada won the most games in their province.\" So per province, which team had the most wins.\n\nSince each province only has one team here, all teams are the answer.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the task is to find, for each province, the team with the highest number of wins (but since each province has only one team in data, that's the team).\n\nAlternatively, if there were multiple teams per province, we would have to group by province and select the max wins.\n\nIn this case, though, as each province is represented once, all teams are the ones who won the most games in their respective provinces.\n\nBut perhaps I should present it as such: for each province listed, the team with the highest number of wins (which is the only team) is [Team Name]. So, list all teams as the winners.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task wants the team(s) nationwide that have the highest wins among all provinces. Looking at the data:\n\nLooking at the Wins column:\n\n- Alberta: 4\n- Manitoba:3\n- Nova Scotia:3\n- Ontario:3\n- British Columbia:3\n- Saskatchewan:3\n- Prince Edward Island:3\n- Newfoundland and Labrador:3\n- Nunavut:3\n- Northwest Territories:3\n- Yukon:3\n- Quebec:3\n\nWait, only Alberta has 4 wins. All others have 3 wins. So nationwide, the team with the most wins is Alberta's Brian Betts with 4 wins.\n\nBut the task was per province. Therefore, each team is the winner in their respective province.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to know which provinces' teams have more wins than others, but phrased as \"which team from Canada won the most games in their province.\" So, perhaps they mean that in their own province context, which team has the highest. But if each province only has one team, then all are the highest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find for each province, who had the most wins (but with only one team per province), or overall, which province's team has the highest number of wins nationwide.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is Brian Betts from Alberta with 4 wins, as they have the highest number among all provinces.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked. The user said: \"You are tasked with finding out which team from Canada won the most games in their province.\" So per province, find the top team.\n\nGiven that each row is a different province and only one team per province, then each team is the answer for their own province. But since the question says \"which team from Canada\" (singular), maybe it's asking which single team across all provinces has the most wins in their respective province.\n\nSince Alberta's team has 4 wins, which is higher than others' 3, so that would be Brian Betts from Alberta.\n\nAlternatively, if each province can have multiple teams, but in this data only one per province is shown, perhaps we cannot determine it fully. But given the data provided, I think the answer is that Brian Betts from Alberta has the most wins (4) among all provinces.\n</think>\n\nThe team with the highest number of wins in their respective province is **Brian Betts** from **Alberta**, with 4 wins.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"alberta be the locale when l be 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It seems to state that Alberta is the locale where the value of 'l' equals 9. So I'm looking for a row where the locale is Alberta and the corresponding 'l' column has the value 9.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different locale with various statistics. The columns are 'locale', 'skip', 'w', 'l', 'pf', 'pa', etc. I need to focus on the 'locale' and 'l' columns.\n\nStarting from the top of the table, the first row is for Alberta. Let's check what the value in the 'l' column is here. The third row (index 0) under 'l' shows a value of 2. So, for Alberta, 'l' is 2, not 9.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me double-check. Scanning through all rows: \n\n1. Alberta: l=2\n2. Manitoba: l=3\n3. Nova Scotia: l=3\n4. Quebec: l=4\n5. British Columbia: l=5\n6. Ontario: l=5\n7. Newfoundland and Labrador: l=5\n8. Saskatchewan: l=5\n9. Prince Edward Island: l=7\n10. Northern Ontario: l=8\n11. New Brunswick: l=8\n\nNone of these have an 'l' value of 9. Therefore, there's no row where the locale is Alberta and 'l' equals 9.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"alberta be the locale when l be 9.\" Upon examining the table, Alberta has an 'l' value of 2, and no other locales have an 'l' value of 9. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"locale\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"l\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"83% be the total of all shot pct occurrence when the value of blank end be 8.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that whenever the 'blank ends' column has a value of 8, we should look at the corresponding 'shot pct' values and sum them up, expecting the total to be 83%.\n\nWait, actually, reading it again: \"the total of all shot pct occurrence when the value of blank end be 8.\" Hmm. So perhaps they mean that for each row where 'blank ends' is 8, we take their 'shot pct' values and see what the sum is, and check if that's equal to 83%.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note where 'blank ends' equals 8. Let me scan the 'blank ends' column.\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Alberta: blank ends =7\n2. Manitoba:10\n3. Nova Scotia:16\n4. Quebec:8 \u2192 this is a match.\n5. British Columbia:18\n6. Ontario:10\n7. Newfoundland and Labrador:13\n8. Saskatchewan:12\n9. Prince Edward Island:12\n10. Northern Ontario:9\n11. New Brunswick:17\n\nSo only Quebec has blank ends equal to 8. Now, looking at Quebec's 'shot pct' value, which is 80%.\n\nThe claim says the total of all such shot pct should be 83%. But in this case, there's only one row (Quebec) where blank ends are 8, and its shot pct is 80%, not 83%.\n\nWait a minute. Is it possible that I'm misunderstanding the claim? Maybe it means the average instead of total? Or perhaps it's asking for something else. But as per the wording: \"the total of all shot pct occurrence when blank end be 8.\" So if there are multiple rows with blank ends=8, sum their shot pcts.\n\nBut in our case, only one row has blank ends=8. Therefore, the sum would just be 80%. The claim says this should equal 83%, which is incorrect. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAnother thing to check: maybe I misread any other rows where 'blank ends' could be 8. Let me double-check:\n\nQuebec is row index 3 (starting from 0), blank ends=8. No others have 8 in that column. So only one row, shot pct 80%, which doesn't add up to 83%. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are for Quebec's 'blank ends' and 'shot pct'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"blank end\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"shot pct\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems a bit unclearly phrased, but it looks like it's saying that when the \"stolen ends\" column has a value of 7, the corresponding \"blank ends\" should be 46.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to find where \"stolen ends\" equals 7. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Alberta**: stolen ends = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n2. **Manitoba**: stolen ends = 13 \u2192 No.\n3. **Nova Scotia**: stolen ends = 13 \u2192 No.\n4. **Quebec**: stolen ends = 15 \u2192 No.\n5. **British Columbia**: stolen ends = 12 \u2192 No.\n6. **Ontario**: stolen ends = 7 \u2192 Yes, this is the row we're interested in. Let's check what \"blank ends\" is here. For Ontario, blank ends are 10. But the claim says it should be 46, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check the columns to make sure I'm looking at the right ones. The columns are: locale, skip, wins (probably), losses, blank end, stolen end, etc. So in Ontario's row, under \"blank ends\" it's 10, not 46.\n\nLooking further:\n\n7. **Prince Edward Island**: stolen ends =5 \u2192 No.\n8. **Northern Ontario**: stolen ends=6 \u2192 No.\n9. **New Brunswick**: stolen ends=8\u2192No.\n\nSo the only row where stolen ends is 7 is Ontario with blank ends at 10, which doesn't match the claim of 46.

I need to determine whether the claim \"46 be the value of end lost when blank end be 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. The claim states that when the number of blank ends is 9, the corresponding value for \"ends lost\" should be 46. So, my task is to find any row in the table where the \"blank ends\" column has a value of 9 and check if the \"ends lost\" in that same row is indeed 46.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each row represents data for different locales. Each row contains several columns: locale, skip, w, l, pf, pa, ends won, ends lost, blank ends, stolen ends, and shot pct. The relevant columns here are \"blank ends\" and \"ends lost.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if there's a match.\n\n1. **Alberta (Row 0):** Blank ends = 7. This doesn't match the claim of 9 blank ends.\n2. **Manitoba (Row 1):** Blank ends = 10. Not matching.\n3. **Nova Scotia (Row 2):** Blank ends = 16. No match.\n4. **Quebec (Row 3):** Blank ends = 12. Doesn't fit.\n5. **Prince Edward Island (Row 8):** Blank ends = 12. Still not matching.\n6. **Northern Ontario (Row 9):** Blank ends = 9. This matches the condition of blank ends being 9.\n\nNow, in Row 9 (Northern Ontario), I check the \"ends lost\" value. It's listed as 48. However, the claim expects it to be 46. There's a discrepancy here; the actual value is higher than what's claimed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct row. Let me double-check all rows to ensure there isn't another instance where blank ends equal 9. Scanning through again:\n\n- Row 0: 7\n- Row 1:10\n- Row2:16\n- Row3:12\n- Row4:5 (No, that's stolen ends)\n- Row5:9? Wait, no\u2014looking back, Row 9 is Northern Ontario with blank ends=9. Any others?\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow indexes go from 0 to 11.\n\nRows where \"blank ends\" equals 9 are only in Row 9 (Northern Ontario). There's no other row matching that condition.\n\nIn that specific row, the \"ends lost\" is 48, not 46.
