Scanning through all rows in the 'entrant' column, I don't see any entry that mentions \"ivor bueb\". The only entrants for 1959 are both \"british racing partnership\".\n\nSo, even though there are two entries for Cooper T51 chassis in 1959, the entrant isn't ivor bueb.

However, looking at the table, there's no mention of any driver names like Ivor Bueb. The entrant is listed as 'connaught engineering' in row 0, but the driver isn't specified here.\n\nNext, regarding the engines used: In both rows (index 0 and 2), the engine column shows 'alta straight - 4'. So Connaught Engineering and BC Ecclestone both did use this engine. But the claim includes \"ivor bueb race for\" which isn't present in the data.\n\nSince the table doesn't include any driver names, we can't confirm if Ivor Bueb raced for these teams.

The key points are:\n\n1. The person involved is Ivor Bueb.\n2. He only raced the Lotus 12 chassis once between the years 1957 and 1959.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to see if there's any mention of Ivor Bueb. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Entrant is Connaught Engineering.\n- Row 1: Entrant is Gilby Engineering Ltd.\n- Row 2: Entrant is BC Ecclestone.\n- Row 3: Entrant is Ecurie Demi Litre.\n- Rows 4 and 5: Entrant is British Racing Partnership.\n\nI don't see \"ivor bueb\" listed as an entrant in any of these rows. The entrants are all organizations or companies, not individual people like Ivor Bueb.\n\nSo, since the table doesn't mention Ivor Bueb at all, there's no data to support that he raced the Lotus 12 chassis even once. In fact, without his presence in the table, we can't confirm any races he might have done. \n\nLooking further, the only time the Lotus 12 appears is in row 3 (year 1958). The entrant there is Ecurie Demi Litre, not Ivor Bueb.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim that Ivor Bueb raced the Lotus 12 chassis once between 1957 and 1959 isn't supported by the table. In fact, since he's not mentioned at all, it's likely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions \"ivor bueb\" as an entrant, but checking each row in the table:\n\n- Row 0: Entrant is Connaught Engineering\n- Row 1: Gilby Engineering Ltd\n- Row 2: BC Ecclestone\n- Row 3: Ecurie Demi Litre\n- Rows 4 and 5: British Racing Partnership\n\nNo row has \"ivor bueb\" as the entrant.

Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"ivor bueb race use the climax straight 4 engine 2 time between 1958 and 1959.\" \n\nWait a minute, looking at the table, I don't see any mention of \"ivor bueb\" as an entrant. The entrants listed are \"connaught engineering,\" \"gilby engineering ltd,\" \"bc ecclestone,\" \"ecurie demi litre,\" and \"british racing partnership.\" So Ivor Bueb isn't in the table at all.\n\nNext, I check for entries where the engine is \"climax straight - 4\" between 1958 and 1959. Looking through each row:\n\n- In 1957: The engines are alta straight 4 and maserati straight 6.\n- For 1958, two rows:\n   - Row index 2 (year 1958): engine is alta straight 4.\n   - Row index 3 (year 1958): engine is climax straight 4. So that's one occurrence in 1958.\n- For 1959, two rows:\n   - Both have \"british racing partnership\" as entrant. The first has climax straight 4, and the second has borgward straight 4. So in 1959, there's only one use of climax engine.\n\nSo between 1958 and 1959, the climax engine is used twice: once in 1958 (row index 3) and once in 1959 (row index 4). However, since the claim mentions \"ivor bueb,\" who isn't present in the table, the entire claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.

So, I need to determine whether the claim \"ivor bueb score a point in 1958\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Each row represents data from different years, specifically 1957, 1958, and 1959. The claim mentions the year 1958, so I'll focus on the rows where the year is 1958.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two entries for 1958:\n\n1. Row index 2: Entrant is bc ecclestone, chassis is connaught type b, engine is alta straight -4, points are 0.\n2. Row index 3: Entrant is ecurie demi litre, chassis is lotus 12, engine is climax straight -4, points are 0.\n\nThe claim is about \"ivor bueb\" scoring a point in 1958. I don't see any mention of ivor bueb in the entrant column for either of these rows. The entrants listed are bc ecclestone and ecurie demi litre, but neither matches ivor bueb.\n\nAdditionally, both entries for 1958 have points as 0. So even if ivor bueb was involved, there's no point scored in that year according to the table.\n\nTherefore, since ivor bueb isn't listed in any entrant field and the points are zero in 1958, the claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: It has columns for year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Each row represents a different entry with details about who entered what car and engine in a particular year, along with their points.\n\nThe claim mentions \"ivor bueb,\" so I'm assuming that's referring to an entrant or driver. However, looking at the 'entrant' column in each row:\n\n- 1957: connaught engineering\n- 1957: gilby engineering ltd\n- 1958: bc ecclestone\n- 1958: ecurie demi litre\n- 1959: british racing partnership (twice)\n\nI don't see \"ivor bueb\" listed as an entrant in any of the rows. So, that's a red flag. Maybe it's possible he was involved in another capacity, but since the claim mentions him racing, I should check if there's any mention of him.\n\nNext, the chassis mentioned is \"lotus 12.\" Looking at the 'chassis' column:\n\n- 1957: connaught type b and maserati 250f\n- 1958: connaught type b and lotus 12\n- 1959: cooper t51 (twice)\n\nSo, the lotus 12 was raced in 1958 by ecurie demi litre. The claim says it's in 1959, which doesn't match.\n\nAlso, the year mentioned is 1959. Checking all rows for 1959:\n\n- Both entries are from british racing partnership with cooper t51 and different engines (climax straight 4 and borgward straight 4). No lotus 12 in 1959.\n\nPutting it together: The claim mentions ivor bueb, but he's not listed as an entrant. The chassis is lotus 12, which was used in 1958, not 1959.

Racing for Connaught Engineering\n3. Using the Climax Straight-4 engine\n\nI need to check each part against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows from 1957 and 1958. The columns include year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points.\n\nStarting with the entrant \"Connaught Engineering\". I see that in row 0 (year 1957), the entrant is indeed Connaught Engineering. However, looking at their engine, it's listed as \"alta straight-4\", not Climax. \n\nNext, checking for any other rows where the entrant is Connaught Engineering. Row 2 in 1958 also has Connaught Engineering, but again, the engine is Alta Straight-4. There are no entries for Connaught Engineering with a Climax Straight-4 engine.\n\nNow, regarding Ivor Bueb. Scanning through all the entrants' names in each row: 'connaught engineering', 'gilby engineering ltd', 'bc ecclestone', 'ecurie demi litre', 'british racing partnership'. I don't see any mention of 'ivor bueb' as an entrant. The entrant field lists team names, not driver names. Therefore, the table doesn't provide information about individual drivers like Ivor Bueb.\n\nSo, the claim that \"ivor bueb race for connaught engineering use the climax straight 4 engine\" isn't supported by the data in the table because:\n\n- Connaught Engineering used an Alta engine, not Climax.\n- There's no entry for Ivor Bueb as an entrant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.

It mentions \"ivor bueb,\" but looking at the table, none of the entrant names are Ivor Bueb. The entrants listed are Connaught Engineering, Gilby Engineering Ltd, British Racing Partnership, etc. So, there's no mention of Ivor Bueb as an entrant or participant in these races.\n\nNext, the claim talks about racing \"both the lotus 12 chassis.\" Looking at the table, I see that in 1958, Ecurie Demi Litre used a Lotus 12 chassis. But there's only one entry for Lotus 12 in the entire table. The claim says \"multiple times,\" which would mean more than once. Since it appears only once between 1957 and 1959, this part is also not supported.\n\nSo both parts of the claim\u2014regarding Ivor Bueb and racing the Lotus 12 multiple times\u2014are unsupported by the table data.

The claim states: \"ivor bueb race use the alta straight 4 engine 2 times between 1958 and 1959.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse each part of the claim:\n\n- **Entrant**: Ivor Bueb. I need to check if there are any entries in the table where the entrant is Ivor Bueb.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Rows 0: Entrant is Connaught Engineering (1957)\n- Row 1: Gilby Engineering Ltd (1957)\n- Row 2: BC Ecclestone (1958)\n- Row 3: Ecurie Demi Litre (1958)\n- Rows 4 and 5: British Racing Partnership (1959)\n\nI don't see any mention of Ivor Bueb as an entrant in the table. All entries have different team names.\n\nSince the claim refers to \"ivor bueb race,\" which I assume means he was racing, but since he's not listed in the entrants, there's no data supporting his participation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if Ivor Bueb is associated with any of the teams mentioned. For example, sometimes drivers are part of a team. But the table doesn't list individual drivers; it lists the teams or constructors as entrants. So without more information, we can't confirm Ivor Bueb's participation.\n\nNext, let's check the engines: Alta Straight 4. The claim says he used this engine twice between 1958 and 1959. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- In 1957, Connaught Engineering uses an Alta Straight 4 (row 0) and Maserati 250F with Maserati Straight 6 (row1).\n- 1958: BC Ecclestone uses Connaught Type B with Alta Straight 4 (row2), and Ecurie Demi Litre uses Lotus 12 with Climax Straight 4 (row3).\n- 1959: British Racing Partnership has two entries, both Cooper T51 but different engines: one Climax and one Borgward Straight 4.\n\nSo, the Alta Straight 4 is used in 1957 and 1958. Specifically:\n- Row0: 1957\n- Row2: 1958\n\nThat's two instances of the engine being used. However, since Ivor Bueb isn't listed as an entrant or driver, we can't tie these engine uses to him.\n\nTherefore, even though the Alta Straight 4 was used twice between 1957 and 1959 (but not between 1958-59 specifically), and considering that Ivor Bueb isn't in the table, the claim isn't supported.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
