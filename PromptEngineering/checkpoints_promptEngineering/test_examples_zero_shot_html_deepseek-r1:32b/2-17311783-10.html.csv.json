    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"washington have a record of 41 - 36 and play at the verizon center 20173 people in attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. There are 8 rows, each representing a different game.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Washington have a record of 41-36.\n2. They play at the Verizon Center with 20,173 people in attendance.\n\nI'll start by searching for the row where the team is Washington. Scanning through the 'team' column, I find that in row index 2 (since counting starts at 0), the team is listed as Washington.\n\nNext, I'll check the relevant columns:\n- The 'record' column: In row 2, it says \"41 - 36\". This matches the first part of the claim.\n- The 'location attendance' column: It shows \"verizon center 20173\", which is exactly what the second part of the claim states.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in row index 2, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be \"TRUE\" with relevant cells pointing to the 'record' and 'location attendance' columns in that specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies Washington's record as 41-36 and their game at Verizon Center attended by 20,173 people. The table confirms both details in row index 2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table in HTML format is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll carefully read the claim: \"charlotte improve to 40 - 36 with a win of 97 - 92 in ot.\" So, there are three main parts here that need verification:\n\n1. The team involved is Charlotte.\n2. They improved their record to 40-36 after this game.\n3. The score was 97-92 in overtime (OT).\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. Each row represents a game with various details like game number, date, opponent, result, and other stats.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find Charlotte's game. Let's go row by row:\n\n- Game 75: Opponent is Dallas, not Charlotte.\n- Game 76: Opponent is Charlotte. This looks promising because the claim mentions Charlotte. \n\nLooking at this specific row (row index 1), let me check each of the three points.\n\nFirst, the team column says \"charlotte,\" which matches part one of the claim.\n\nNext, for the record: The 'record' column in this row shows \"40 - 36.\" However, I need to confirm whether this is their new record after winning. The game result here is a win (97-92 OT). So, if before this game they were 39-36, adding one more win would make it 40-36. Let me check the previous row.\n\nLooking at Game 75: The team was Dallas, and the record after that game is \"39 - 36.\" Since Game 76 is against Charlotte and resulted in a win, their record improves by one to 40-36. So this part checks out.\n\nThirdly, checking the score: In the 'score' column for Game 76, it's listed as \"w 97 - 92 (ot).\" The 'w' indicates a win, and the score is indeed 97-92 in overtime. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are supported by the data in row index 1. \n\nI don't think I need to check other rows because Charlotte appears only once here, so this must be the game they're referring to.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the information from row 1 of the table where Charlotte's win against Dallas resulted in their record improving to 40-36 with a score of 97-92 in overtime.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"verizon center 20173 for the location and attendance when the record be 49 - 36%\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Location and Attendance**: The claim mentions \"verizon center 20173\". Looking at the table, I should check each row's \"location attendance\" column to find this exact string.\n\n2. **Record**: The claim refers to a record of \"49 - 36%\". Wait, that seems off because in sports records, it's usually wins-losses without a percentage sign. Maybe it's a typo and should be \"49 - 36\" instead of including the percent sign.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find where the location attendance is \"verizon center 20173\". \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 2 (index starting at 0):** The \"location attendance\" is \"verizon center 20173\". So this matches. Now, what's the record in that row? It shows \"41 - 36\".\n\nWait, the claim says the record should be \"49 - 36%\", but in the table, it's \"41 - 36\" when location attendance is \"verizon center 20173\". That doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. If \"49 - 36%\" was a typo and should be \"41 - 36\", then it would match. But as written, the record in that row is \"41 - 36\".\n\nSince the claim's record doesn't match any row where the location attendance is \"verizon center 20173\", the claim must be FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cell for this check is the row where \"location attendance\" is \"verizon center 20173\", which is row index 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"when michael beade be the highest scorer, the score be w 97 - 92 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I notice that there's a typo in the claim. It should probably say \"Michael Beasley\" instead of \"beade\". So I'll proceed under the assumption that it refers to Michael Beasley.\n\nI need to find all rows where Michael Beasley is the highest scorer. Looking at the table, each row has a column called \"high points\" which lists the player with the highest points and their score in parentheses.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0 (game 75): High scorer is Dwyane Wade (23). Not Beasley.\n- Row 1 (game 76): High scorer is Dwyane Wade (27). Not Beasley.\n- Row 2 (game 77): High scorer is Dwyane Wade (33). Not Beasley.\n- Row 3 (game 78): High scorer is Dwyane Wade (32). Not Beasley.\n- Row 4 (game 79): High scorer is Dwyane Wade (31). Not Beasley.\n- Row 5 (game 80): High scorer is Dwyane Wade (55). Not Beasley.\n- Row 6 (game 81): High scorer is Michael Beasley (23).\n- Row 7 (game 82): High scorer is Chris Quinn (26). Not Beasley.\n\nSo the only row where Beasley is the high scorer is row index 6. Now, I need to check what the score was in that game. Looking at the \"score\" column for row 6: It's l 79 - 81 (ot), which means it was a loss with an overtime period.\n\nThe claim says the score should be w 97-92 (ot). However, row 6 shows a loss, not a win, and different scores. Therefore, when Beasley is the highest scorer, the team lost, which contradicts the claim that the score was a win of 97-92.\n\nWait, did I miss any other rows where Beasley might be the high scorer? Let me double-check all rows again. Rows 0 to 5 have Wade as the high scorer, row 6 has Beasley, and row 7 doesn't. So only one occurrence.\n\nThus, the claim isn't supported by the data because in that instance, the score was a loss, not a win with those specific points.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where Michael Beasley is the highest scorer (row 6) and the corresponding score. The claim's score doesn't match the actual result.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
