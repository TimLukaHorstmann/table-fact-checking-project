The relevant columns here are \"outcome\", \"tournament\", and maybe others like \"date\" if needed for counting occurrences over time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Tournament in Lachine, Canada. Outcome is winner.\n2. **Row 1**: Hamilton, Canada. Winner again.\n3. **Row 4**: Toronto, Canada. Winner.\n4. **Row 6**: Hamilton, Canada. Winner.\n5. **Row 8**: Vancouver, Canada. Winner.\n\nWait, that's five entries where the tournament is in Canada. Now, checking the outcome of each:\n\n- Row 0: Winner\n- Row 1: Winner\n- Row 4: Winner\n- Row 6: Winner\n- Row 8: Winner\n\nSo all five times when the tournament was in Canada, Wozniak won. But wait, let me double-check if there are more entries. I see that in row 5, it's Mexico City, Mexico, so not Canada. Similarly, other rows like Pelham, US; Victoria, Mexico; Ashland, US; Pittsburgh, US; Redding, US; Nassau, Bahamas\u2014none of these are Canada.\n\nSo according to the table, Wozniak has competed five times in Canada and won each time.

The claim says, \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 1 time but win.\" I need to check this against the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table's tournament locations to find any entries from the Bahamas. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Lachine, Canada\n- Row 1: Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 2: Pelham, United States\n- Row 3: Victoria, Mexico\n- Row 4: Mexico City, Mexico\n- Row 5: Toronto, Canada\n- Row 6: Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 7: Ashland, United States\n- Row 8: Pittsburgh, United States\n- Row 9: Redding, United States\n- Row 10: Vancouver, Canada\n- Row 11: Nassau, Bahamas\n\nSo, the only tournament in the Bahamas is in row 11.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"wozniak have be runner  - up 3 time but never in canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Wozniak has been a runner-up three times. Then it adds that she was never a runner-up in Canada. I'll need to check both parts against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match where either Wozniak won or was a runner-up. The columns include outcome, date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score. \n\nI'll go through each row and count how many times she was a runner-up and check if any of those were in Canada.\n\n1. First row: Outcome is winner. Not relevant for the runner-up part.\n2. Second row: Winner again. So nope.\n3. Third row: Runner-up at Pelham, United States. That's one time as runner-up outside Canada.\n4. Fourth row: Winner. Doesn't count.\n5. Fifth row: Runner-up in Mexico City, Mexico. Second runner-up instance, still not Canada.\n6. Sixth row: Winner again.\n7. Seventh row: Winner.\n8. Eighth row: Winner.\n9. Ninth row: Winner.\n10. Tenth row: Runner-up at Redding, United States. That's the third time as a runner-up, and it's in the U.S., so still not Canada.\n11. Eleventh row: Winner.\n12. Twelfth row: Winner.\n\nSo from this, I can see that there are three instances where Wozniak was a runner-up (rows 3,5,10). Now, checking if any of these were in Canada:\n\n- Row 3: Pelham, United States \u2013 not Canada.\n- Row 5: Mexico City, Mexico \u2013 not Canada.\n- Row 10: Redding, United States \u2013 not Canada.\n\nTherefore, all three times she was a runner-up were outside Canada. The claim states that she was never a runner-up in Canada, which is correct because none of her runner-up finishes were in Canadian locations. \n\nNow, I'll list the relevant cells to support this conclusion. Each time she was a runner-up, we need to check both the outcome and the tournament location.\n\nSo, row indices 2 (third row), 4 (fifth row), and 9 (tenth row) are relevant because they show her as runner-up. For each of these rows, I'll note the \"outcome\" column and the \"tournament\" column to confirm she was a runner-up outside Canada.\n\nWait, in the table structure provided earlier, the columns are outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. So for each relevant row, we need both \"outcome\" (to confirm runner-up) and \"tournament\" (to check location).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells will be:\n\n- For row 2: outcome and tournament.\n- For row 4: outcome and tournament.\n- For row 9: outcome and tournament.\n\nThis gives me a total of six cells to check across three rows. Each runner-up instance requires checking both columns to confirm the status and location.\n\nSo, compiling this, I have the answer as TRUE because all conditions in the claim are satisfied: she was a runner-up three times, none in Canada.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have win 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the table. The table has several columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a match where someone either won or was a runner-up.\n\nThe claim is about Wozniak winning 9 times between 2002 and 2012. I don't see the name \"wozniak\" in the table; instead, I notice names like Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, Soledad Esper\u00f3n, Olga Blahotov\u00e1, Olena Antypina, Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault, \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay, Victoria Azarenka, Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1, Jamie Hampton, and Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. It seems like the player in question might not be listed as \"wozniak\" here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm looking at the wrong column. The outcome column shows whether the player was a winner or runner-up. So perhaps each row represents Wozniak's matches, and she either won or lost. But in that case, her name isn't listed as the opponent; instead, it's who she played against. That means the table is listing opponents, not necessarily who she is playing as.\n\nSo to count how many times Wozniak was a winner between 2002 and 2012, I need to look at each row where the outcome is \"winner.\" Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Winner against Beier Ko on June 30, 2002. So that's one win.\n\nRow 1: Winner against Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri on July 17, 2005. Second win.\n\nRow 2: Runner-up, so not a win.\n\nRow 3: Winner against Olga Blahotov\u00e1 on August 7, 2011. Third win.\n\nWait, no, row 3 is actually in the data as \"runner-up\" or \"winner\"? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: Outcome - winner\n- Row 1: Outcome - winner\n- Row 2: Outcome - runner-up\n- Row 3: Outcome - winner (I think, but let me confirm)\n\nWait, in the table provided, I see that row indices go from 0 to 12. Let's list each outcome:\n\nRow 0: Winner (yes)\nRow 1: Winner (yes)\nRow 2: Runner-up (no)\nRow 3: Winner\nRow 4: Runner-up (row 4 is date March 23, 2008)\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nActually, let me list all the outcomes:\n\n- Row 0: Winner\n- Row 1: Winner\n- Row 2: Runner-up\n- Row 3: Winner\n- Row 4: Runner-up (March 23, 2008)\nWait no, row indices are from 0 to 12. Let me recount:\n\nRows:\n0: Winner\n1: Winner\n2: Runner-up\n3: Winner\n4: Runner-up\n5: Winner\n6: Winner\n7: Winner\n8: Runner-up\n9: Winner\n10: Winner\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the table has 12 rows. Let me count each row's outcome:\n\nRow 0: Outcome - winner (yes)\nRow 1: Outcome - winner (yes)\nRow 2: Outcome - runner-up (no)\nRow 3: Outcome - winner (yes) [against Olga Blahotov\u00e1]\nWait, no, looking back at the table data:\n\nLooking at each row's outcome:\n\n- Row 0: Winner\n- Row 1: Winner\n- Row 2: Runner-up\n- Row 3: Winner\n- Row 4: Runner-up (March 23, 2008)\nWait no, actually the rows go from 0 to 11 because there are 12 data rows.\n\nLet me list all outcomes:\n\nRow 0: Winner (June 30, 2002)\nRow 1: Winner (July 17, 2005)\nRow 2: Runner-up (March 23, 2008)\nRow 3: Winner (August 7, 2011)\nWait, no, that's not correct because the dates vary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Date is June 30, 2002 - Outcome: Winner\nRow 1: July 17, 2005 - Winner\nRow 2: March 23, 2008 - Runner-up\nRow 3: August 7, 2011 - Winner\nWait, no. Actually, the table has rows from 0 to 11 because there are 12 data rows.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows:\n0: June 30, 2002 - Winner\n1: July 17, 2005 - Winner\n2: March 23, 2008 - Runner-up\n3: August 7, 2011 - Winner\n4: March 17, 2012 - Winner\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check the table structure:\n\nThe table has 12 rows in the tbody:\n\nRows:\n0: June 30, 2002 - Winner\n1: July 17, 2005 - Winner\n2: Runner-up (March 23, 2008)\nWait, no, row 2 is March 23, 2008 with outcome runner-up.\n\nThen rows 3 to 11:\n\nRow 3: August 7, 2011 - Winner\nRow 4: March 17, 2012 - Winner\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the outcomes and their years:\n\nRow 0: 2002 - Winner (yes)\nRow 1: 2005 - Winner (yes)\nRow 2: 2008 - Runner-up (no)\nRow 3: 2011 - Winner (yes)\nRow 4: 2012 - Winner (yes)\n\nWait, that's only four wins. But the claim says nine times between 2002 and 2012.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each row represents a match where WTA player won or lost, but the outcome is whether it was a win or loss for the player in question. So perhaps the player has multiple wins across different tournaments.\n\nBut looking at the data provided, there are only four rows with \"Winner\" within 2002-2012:\n\nRows 0: 2002 - Winner\nRow 1: 2005 - Winner\nRow 3: 2011 - Winner\nRow 4: 2012 - Winner\n\nWait, that's four wins. So the total number of wins in this dataset is four.\n\nBut the claim says nine times between 2002 and 2012.\n\nSo either the data provided doesn't include all matches, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a different event, so if the player won multiple events in a year, each win counts as a separate entry. For example, in 2002, one win; in 2005, another; then in 2011 and 2012.\n\nBut according to the data provided, only four wins are listed between 2002 and 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she won nine times between those years would be incorrect based on this data. However, perhaps the data is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The user presented a problem where they need to determine whether the player won nine times between 2002 and 2012, based on some data or analysis.\n\nWait, no, the original query was about solving a problem where someone needs help determining if a player won nine matches between certain years. But perhaps the user provided a table with specific outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario where the task is to determine how many times the player won, given some data points.\n\nIn any case, based on the data provided in the table, which has four wins (2002, 2005, 2011, 2012), the answer would be that she won four times, not nine. Therefore, the claim of nine wins is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe player did not win nine matches between 2002 and 2012; based on the data provided, she won four times during that period.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe player won \\boxed{4} matches between 2002 and 2012.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak compete in 5 tournament in 2006 and win 3 of them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a match or tournament result for someone named Wozniak (I assume it's the same person throughout).\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Competed in 5 tournaments in 2006.\n2. Won 3 of them.\n\nSo, I need to check how many entries there are in 2006 and whether the player was a winner in those.\n\nLooking at the date column for each row:\n\n- Row 0: June 30, 2002 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 1: July 17, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 2: October 2, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 3: October 16, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 4: October 23, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 5: November 13, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 6: July 23, 2006 \u2192 This is 2006.\n- Row 7: October 1, 2006 \u2192 2006.\n- Row 8: November 12, 2006 \u2192 2006.\n- Row 9: March 23, 2008 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 10: August 7, 2011 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 11: March 17, 2012 \u2192 Not 2006.\n\nSo, in 2006, there are entries in rows 6, 7, and 8. That's only three tournaments in 2006, not five as the claim states.\n\nNow, checking how many were won:\n- Row 6: Outcome is \"winner\" \u2192 Win.\n- Row 7: Outcome is \"winner\" \u2192 Win.\n- Row 8: Outcome is \"winner\" \u2192 Win.\n\nAll three entries in 2006 are wins. But since there are only three tournaments, not five, the first part of the claim is false. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the dates and outcomes for rows 6,7,8 as they pertain to 2006 competitions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the claim. It has two main parts: \n\n1. Wozniak has been a winner three times.\n2. Despite those wins, she never won in Canada.\n\nI need to check both these statements against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an outcome (either winner or runner-up) along with details like date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score. I don't see a column specifically mentioning \"wozniak,\" but it's likely that this is about a player named Wozniak, perhaps Maria Wozniak, as she was an active tennis player around the time periods mentioned.\n\nSo, my first task is to count how many times Wozniak appears as the winner in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Winner against Beier Ko on June 30, 2002, in Lachine, Canada (hard surface). If this is Wozniak's win, that's one.\n2. **Row 1**: Another win on July 17, 2005, in Hamilton, Canada (clay). That would be the second win if it's her.\n3. **Row 2**: Runner-up in Pelham, US (clay) on October 2, 2005. Not a win, so no count here.\n4. **Row 3**: Winner again on October 16, 2005, in Victoria, Mexico (hard). Third win if it's her.\n5. **Row 4**: Runner-up in Mexico City, Mexico, on October 23, 2005. Not a win.\n6. **Row 5**: Winner on November 13, 2005, in Toronto, Canada (hard). That would be the fourth win if this is her.\n7. **Row 6**: Another win on July 17, 2005, but wait, that's a duplicate date? Wait, no\u2014row 6 is August 7, 2011, in Vancouver, Canada (hard). So that would be the fifth win if it's her.\n8. **Row 7**: Runner-up on March 23, 2008, in Redding, US. Not a win.\n9. **Row 8**: Winner on August 7, 2011, in Vancouver, Canada (hard). That would be another win if it's her. Wait, that seems like the same date as row 6? Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- Row 0: Lachine, Canada \u2013 winner\n- Row 1: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 winner\n- Row 3: Victoria, Mexico \u2013 winner\n- Row 5: Toronto, Canada \u2013 winner\n- Row 6: Vancouver, Canada \u2013 winner\n- Row 8: March 17, 2012, Nassau, Bahamas \u2013 winner\n\nWait, that's six wins. But perhaps not all are Wozniak. I think the claim is about how many times she won, so if she has three wins but never in Canada, we need to check each win location.\n\nBut wait, in the table, several of her wins are in Canada: Lachine (row 0), Hamilton (row1), Toronto (row5), Vancouver (row6). So if she's a winner in these locations, which are all in Canada, then the second part of the claim that she never won in Canada is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misattributing the wins to Wozniak. The table doesn't specify her name; it just has opponents and outcomes. Maybe not all these wins are hers. For example, maybe row 0 is someone else's win against Beier Ko, but if we're assuming that each row represents her matches, then she's the one who either won or was runner-up.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, it's likely listing Wozniak's matches because all entries are about matches involving opponents, so perhaps each row is a match where she either won or lost. Therefore, the number of times she is listed as 'Winner' would be her total wins.\n\nCounting the winners:\n\n- Row 0: Winner\n- Row1: Winner\n- Row3: Winner\n- Row5: Winner\n- Row6: Winner\n- Row8: Winner\n\nSo that's six times she was a winner. But wait, maybe I'm miscounting because some of these might not be her matches. For example, row 0 is against Beier Ko in Lachine, Canada \u2013 perhaps Wozniak won here.\n\nRow1: Opponent Alize Cornet? No, opponent is Alize Cornet in row12 (March 17, 2012). Wait no, row1's opponent is Alize Cornet? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- Row0: Winner vs Beier Ko\n- Row1: Winner vs Alize Cornet? No, wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait, no\u2014row1 has opponent Alize Cornet in 2012 (March 17), but that's row8. So perhaps I need to correct myself.\n\nLet me list each winner with their location:\n\n- Row0: Winner in Lachine, Canada\n- Row1: Winner in Hamilton, Canada\n- Row3: Winner in Victoria, Mexico\n- Row5: Winner in Toronto, Canada\n- Row6: Winner in Vancouver, Canada\n- Row8: Winner in Nassau, Bahamas\n\nSo if all these are her wins, then she has six wins. But the claim says she was a winner three times but never in Canada.\n\nBut according to this, she won multiple times in Canada (Lachine, Hamilton, Toronto, Vancouver). Therefore, the second part of the claim is false because she did win in Canada. Hence, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misattributing these wins. Perhaps not all are hers. Let me check each row's opponent to see if they're relevant:\n\n- Row0: Beier Ko \u2013 perhaps a player she beat.\n- Row1: Alize Cornet? No, wait, in row8, the opponent is Alize Cornet on March 17, 2012.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure each row's details:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 12 (assuming 13 rows):\n\nBut looking back, there are 12 rows in total, indexed from 0 to 11.\n\nLet me list all winners and their locations:\n\n- Row0: Winner in Lachine, Canada\n- Row1: Winner in Hamilton, Canada\n- Row3: Winner in Victoria, Mexico\n- Row5: Winner in Toronto, Canada\n- Row6: August 7, 2011 \u2013 Vancouver, Canada\n- Row8: March 17, 2012 \u2013 Nassau, Bahamas\n\nWait, row indices:\n\nRow0: Lachine (Canada) \u2013 winner\nRow1: Hamilton (Canada) \u2013 winner\nRow3: Victoria (Mexico) \u2013 winner\nRow5: Toronto (Canada) \u2013 winner\nRow6: Vancouver (Canada) \u2013 winner\nRow8: March 17, 2012 \u2013 Nassau, Bahamas \u2013 winner\n\nSo that's six wins in total. If the claim is she was a winner three times but never in Canada, then it's false because she has multiple Canadian wins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table; maybe not all rows are her matches, but rather matches involving other players where she was involved. But without more context, we have to assume that each row represents her performance as either a winner or runner-up.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, she has multiple wins in Canada, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak was a winner three times but never in Canada. However, upon reviewing the matches:\n\n- **Row 0**: Winner in Lachine, Canada\n- **Row 1**: Winner in Hamilton, Canada\n- **Row 3**: Winner in Victoria, Mexico\n- **Row 5**: Winner in Toronto, Canada\n- **Row 6**: Winner in Vancouver, Canada\n- **Row 8**: Winner in Nassau, Bahamas\n\nWozniak has multiple wins in Canada (Lachine, Hamilton, Toronto, Vancouver) and other countries. Therefore, the claim is false because she did win in Canada.\n\n**Answer:** False",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"wozniak have lose 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"wozniak,\" which I believe refers to a tennis player, likely Aleksandra Wozniak since she was active around that time. The claim states that she lost 9 times between 2002 and 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various outcomes with columns like outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a match result for Wozniak, I assume.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to count how many times she was a \"runner-up\" in these matches within that timeframe because being a runner-up means she lost the final of that tournament.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Winner against Beier Ko on June 30, 2002. So, this is a win.\n2. **Row 1**: Winner against Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri on July 17, 2005. Another win.\n3. **Row 2**: Runner-up against Soledad Esper\u00f3n on October 2, 2005. This counts as one loss.\n4. **Row 3**: Winner against Olga Blahotov\u00e1 on October 16, 2005. A win again.\n5. **Row 4**: Runner-up against Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri on October 23, 2005. Second loss.\n6. **Row 5**: Winner against Olena Antypina on November 13, 2005. Win.\n7. **Row 6**: Winner against Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault on July 23, 2006. Another win.\n8. **Row 7**: Winner against \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay on October 1, 2006. Win.\n9. **Row 8**: Winner against Jamie Hampton on August 7, 2011. Wait, that's a 2011 date. So within the timeframe but let me check if she was the winner here. Yes, she won.\n10. **Row 9**: Runner-up against Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1 on March 23, 2008. Third loss.\n11. **Row 10**: Winner against Aliz\u00e9 Cornet on March 17, 2012. Another win.\n\nWait a minute, I think I went through all the rows. Let me recount how many times she was a runner-up:\n\n- Row 2: Runner-up (loss)\n- Row 4: Runner-up (loss)\n- Row 9: Runner-up (loss)\n\nThat's three losses in total within the specified years. The claim says she lost nine times, but according to the table, it's only three. \n\nI should double-check if I missed any rows where she was a runner-up. Let me go through each row again quickly:\n\nRows 0-12 (but actually, there are 13 rows from index 0 to 12). So:\n\n- Row 0: Win\n- Row 1: Win\n- Row 2: Loss\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 4: Loss\n- Row 5: Win\n- Row 6: Win\n- Row 7: Win\n- Row 8: Win (but wait, row 8 is on November 13, 2005. Wait no, looking back, the dates are:\n\nWait, let me correct that. The rows go from 2002 to 2012 as per the dates in each row.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: 2002 (win)\nRow 1: 2005 (win)\nRow 2: 2005 (loss)\nRow 3: 2005 (win)\nRow 4: 2005 (loss)\nRow 5: 2005 (win)\nRow 6: 2006 (win)\nRow 7: 2006 (win)\nRow 8: 2011 (win)\nRow 9: 2008 (loss)\nRow 10: 2012 (win)\n\nSo indeed, only three losses. So the claim that she lost nine times is incorrect based on this data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Wozniak as a runner-up three times between 2002 and 2012, not nine.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim focuses on losses (runner-up outcomes) by Wozniak from 2002 to 2012.\n2. **Scan Each Row for Losses:** Check each row's \"outcome\" and \"date.\"\n3. **Count the Losses:** Found three instances where she was a runner-up.\n4. **Compare with Claim:** The claim states nine losses, which doesn't match.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
