    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It appears that the claim is asserting that there are no entries in the table where the 'year' is before 2009 and the corresponding 'lifetime india distributor share' exists (i.e., has a value). So, essentially, we're checking if all movies released before 2009 have either no data or zero in their distributor shares.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to see if any of them contradict this claim. The columns relevant here are 'year' and 'lifetime india distributor share'.\n\nLet's list out the years for each movie:\n1. Chennai Express - 2013\n2. Ek Tha Tiger - 2012\n3. 3 Idiots - 2009\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani - 2013\n5. Dabangg 2 - 2012\n6. Bodyguard - 2011\n7. Dabangg - 2010\n8. Rowdy Rathore - 2012\n9. Agneepath - 2012\n10. Ready - 2011\n\nThe claim specifies \"earlier than 2009,\" which would be years before 2009, so 2008 or earlier. Looking at the table, all movies are from 2009 onwards; there's no movie listed with a year prior to 2009. \n\nWait, but let me check each entry again to make sure I didn't miss any. Scanning through each row, the earliest year is 2009 for \"3 Idiots.\" All others are from 2010 up to 2013. Therefore, there are no movies in this table released before 2009.\n\nSince all entries have years starting at 2009 or later, there's nothing in the table that would contradict the claim. The claim is saying that prior to 2009, there were no distributor shares given. Given the data provided, since no movies are listed from before 2009, this supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any entries with a year earlier than 2009. Thus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine if the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that for movies released before 2009, their lifetime India distributor share should be zero. So I'm looking for any movie in the table with a release year earlier than 2009 and checking if its \"lifetime india distributor share\" is zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. The relevant information here is the 'year' and 'lifetime india distributor share'. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Chennai Express (2013) - Year is after 2009.\n2. Row 1: Ek Tha Tiger (2012) - Also after 2009.\n3. Row 2: 3 Idiots (2009) - The year is exactly 2009, so it's not earlier than that.\n4. Rows 3 to 9 all have years from 2010 onwards or 2009 at the latest.\n\nWait, I don't see any movie in this table released before 2009. The earliest year is 2009 for \"3 Idiots\". So there are no entries where the year is earlier than 2009 to check. \n\nSince the claim states that all movies before 2009 have a share of zero, but there are no such movies in the data provided, does this make the claim true? Or does it mean we can't confirm it?\n\nIn logic, if there's no counterexample (i.e., no entries to contradict the claim), then the claim holds as TRUE. Because all instances that meet the condition (year <2009) would have a share of 0, and since none exist in the table, the statement is vacuously true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The claim states that in the year 2009, the movie \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release. I need to check two things: when \"ek tha tiger\" was released and whether it was indeed the first release of that year according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a movie with details like rank, title, release year, studio, etc. The claim mentions 2009, so I should look for movies released in that year. Let me scan through the \"year\" column.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 1: chennai express (2013)\n- Row 2: ek tha tiger (2012)\nWait, the claim says it was released in 2009, but according to row 2, its year is 2012. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The table's rows are ordered by rank, not necessarily by release date. So the first row (rank 1) is chennai express from 2013. Rank 2 is ek tha tiger from 2012. Looking further down:\n\nRow 3: 3 idiots (2009)\nSo in 2009, there's a movie called \"3 idiots\" at rank 3. So if the claim says \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2009 as first release, but according to the table, ek tha tiger is from 2012 and there is another movie (3 idiots) from 2009.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because ek tha tiger wasn't released in 2009; it was released in 2012. Also, in 2009, \"3 idiots\" was a top movie but whether it's the first release would depend on its rank or other factors not specified here.\n\nSo, based on the table, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2009 as the first release. Checking the table, \"ek tha tiger\" was actually released in 2012 (row 2), and there's a movie \"3 idiots\" from 2009 (row 3). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"movie\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The relevant information for this claim would be the 'movie' and 'year' columns because the claim is about when \"agneepath\" was released.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find where the movie name matches \"agneepath.\" Looking at row indices 0 to 9, I see that in row index 8 (since indexing starts at 0), the movie listed is \"agneepath.\" \n\nNow, checking the 'year' column for this row: it's 2012.
