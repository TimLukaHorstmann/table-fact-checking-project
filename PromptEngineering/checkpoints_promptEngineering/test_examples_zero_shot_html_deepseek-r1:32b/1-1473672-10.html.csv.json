Scanning the player names, I see that Rene Lambert is listed in the third row (row index 2 since it starts at 0). \n\nNext, I'll check his position. The position column for Rene Lambert shows \"right wing,\" which matches the claim.\n\nThen, I need to verify the pick number. Looking at the 'pick' column for Rene Lambert's row, it says 146. This also aligns with the claim stating he was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied according to the table data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"right wing , rene lampert  , be pick 145th\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key pieces of information are:\n\n1. Position: right wing\n2. Player's name: Rene Lampert (though it might be a typo since \"lampert\" could be \"lambert\")\n3. Pick number: 145th\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any player named Rene Lambert and check their position and pick number.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows are numbered from 144 to 151.\n- Scanning each row for \"Rene Lambert\":\n  - Row 146 has \"rene lambert\" as the player's name. That seems like a match, considering possible typos between \"lampert\" and \"lambert\".\n  \nNow, checking the relevant columns for this row:\n\n- Position: right wing (matches the claim)\n- Pick number: The pick column shows 146 for Rene Lambert.\n\nWait, the claim says he was picked at position 145. But according to the table, Rene Lambert is at pick 146. That's a discrepancy.\n\nSo, the claim states that Rene Lampert (or Lambert) was the 145th pick as a right wing, but the table shows him as the 146th pick.\n\nAlso, looking for any other players named Rene or similar:\n\n- The next rows don't have another Rene. So, it's likely that the claim has an error in the pick number.\n\nTherefore, the correct information is:\n\n- Player: Rene Lambert\n- Position: right wing\n- Pick: 146\n\nSince the claim says 145th, which doesn't align with the table, the statement is false.\n\nAdditionally, I'll check if there's any other player picked at 145. Looking at pick 145:\n\n- The player is Steve Lyon.\n- His position is defence, not right wing.\n\nSo, the claim incorrectly attributes both the pick number and possibly conflates two different players or has a typo in the name.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the table, the claim is false because Rene Lambert was picked at 146th, not 145th.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"rene lampert\" (likely \"lambert\") was the 145th pick as a right wing. Checking row 146 in the table shows that Rene Lambert is indeed a right wing but was picked at position 146, not 145. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
