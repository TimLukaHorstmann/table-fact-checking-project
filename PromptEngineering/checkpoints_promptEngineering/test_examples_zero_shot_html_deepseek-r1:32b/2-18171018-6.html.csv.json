    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is provided in HTML format, and I need to check each part of the claim against the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has five columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a different player's performance with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is: \"player gil morgan represent the united state tie for 7th place with - 2 to par.\"\n\nI need to break this down into its components:\n\n1. Player name: Gil Morgan.\n2. Country: United States.\n3. Place: Tied for 7th (t7).\n4. To par score: -2.\n\nNow, I'll go through the table row by row to see if all these details match.\n\nStarting from the top, looking at each player:\n\n- Tom Watson is first place, so not relevant here.\n- Ken Brown and Lee Trevino are tied for 2nd (t2).\n- Ben Crenshaw is in 4th place.\n- Andy Bean and Hubert Green are tied for 5th (t5).\n- Then we have several players tied for 7th (t7): Isao Aoki, Sandy Lyle, Carl Mason, Gil Morgan, Jack Nicklaus, Craig Stadler.\n\nLooking at Gil Morgan's row:\n\n- Place: t7.\n- Player: Gil Morgan.\n- Country: United States.\n- Score: 70 + 70 + 71 = 211.\n- To par: -2.\n\nNow, let me check each part of the claim against this data.\n\nFirst, does Gil Morgan represent the United States? Yes, the country column for his row is \"united states.\" So that's correct.\n\nNext, is he tied for 7th place? The place column shows \"t7,\" which stands for tied 7th. That matches the claim.\n\nLastly, what about the to par score? It says \"-2\" in the table, which aligns with the claim stating \"- 2 to par.\"\n\nSince all parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, these would be the ones that directly support each part of the claim. For Gil Morgan's row:\n\n- Place (to confirm t7): row index 9, column \"place.\"\n- Player name: row index 9, column \"player.\"\n- Country: row index 9, column \"country.\"\n- To par score: row index 9, column \"to par.\"\n\nSo these four cells are necessary to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}",
