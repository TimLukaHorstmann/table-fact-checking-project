Scanning through each row, I notice that the rows are numbered from 0 onwards, but the government numbers go up to 32 or 33 in some cases. So I need to find where the government number is 31.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The first few rows don't have a government number of 31.\n- Then I see a row with \"Government\" column value 31: that's the row for Tzipi Livni, Kadima party. So row index is relevant here.\n\nNow, checking the details in this row: Tzipi Livni is listed as part of Kadima. The claim says government 31 has the Kadima party. That matches exactly.\n\nSo the relevant cell is where Government is 31 and Party is Kadima. This directly supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with that specific cell highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Government\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"government 31 started before 18 January 2006.\" Let me go through the table step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find which row corresponds to government 31. Looking at the table, each row lists a Prime Minister and details about their term. The column names are \"Prime Minister,\" \"Party,\" \"Government(s),\" \"Start Date,\" and \"End Date.\"\n\nI'll scan through the \"Government(s)\" column to find where it says 31. I see that towards the end of the table, there's a row with \"Tzipi Livni\" as Prime Minister under the Kadima party. The government number here is listed as 31.\n\nNext, I need to check the start date for this government. In the same row, the \"Start Date\" column shows \"18 January 2006.\" The claim says that government 31 started before that date, which would be earlier than 18 January 2006. But according to the table, it started exactly on that day.\n\nSo, since the start date is not before but exactly on 18 January 2006, the claim isn't supported by the data provided in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI also need to note which cells were relevant for this check. The relevant information was in row index 30 (since counting starts at 0) under \"Government(s)\" and \"Start Date\" columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Government(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Start Date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
