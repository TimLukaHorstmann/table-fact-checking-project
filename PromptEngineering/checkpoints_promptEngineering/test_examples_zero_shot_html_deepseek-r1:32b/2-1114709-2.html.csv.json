    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be 2 race that take place in 1984, while there be only 1 race in 1983.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim is asserting.\n\nThe first part says there were two races in 1984. To verify this, I'll look at the 'year' column for entries with the value 1984 and count how many rows have that year.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Rows 1 and 2 are both from 1984. So there are two entries under 1984. That seems to support the first part of the claim.\n\nThe second part claims only one race took place in 1983. Checking the 'year' column for 1983:\n- Only row 0 has 1983 as the year. So there's just one entry, which matches the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correct based on the table data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells. The 'year' column is where we find these entries. For 1984, rows 1 and 2 are relevant because they show two separate races in that year. For 1983, only row 0 is applicable as it's the sole entry for that year.\n\nThus, the relevant cells include:\n- Row 0 with column 'year'\n- Rows 1 and 2 with column 'year'\n\nPutting this all together, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The team in question is \"SASOL Jordan.\" The claim states that this team tied for the least number of races with only one point. Wait, actually, the wording says \"least amount of race with 1,\" which might be a bit confusing. It's more likely referring to points rather than races because the table has a column named 'points' indicating how many points each team earned in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan for entries related to SASOL Jordan. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The last row (row index 13) shows \"sasol jordan\" with 0 points.\n- No other teams have 0 points except Arrows Racing Team in 1983 and Ligier Gitanes in 1991.\n\nWait, let me check all the rows:\n\nRow indices start from 0. Let's list all 'points' per team:\n\n- 1983: Arrows Racing Team - 0\n- 1984: Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW (twice) - 5 each\n- 1985: Barclay Arrows BMW - 11\n- 1986: Barclay Arrows BMW (twice) - 0 each\n- 1987: Benetton Formula Ltd. - 16\n- 1988: Benetton Formula Ltd. - 27\n- 1989: Canon Williams Team (twice) - 37 each\n- 1990: Canon Williams Renault - 34\n- 1991: Ligier Gitanes (twice) - 0 each\n- 1992: Ligier Gitanes Blondes - 2\n- 1993: SASOL Jordan - 0\n\nSo, the teams with 0 points are:\n\n- Arrows Racing Team in 1983\n- Barclay Arrows BMW in 1986 (twice)\n- Ligier Gitanes in 1991 (twice)\n- SASOL Jordan in 1993\n\nSo, the minimum points is 0. The number of teams tied at 0 points: Let's see how many unique teams have 0 points.\n\nLooking at team names:\n\n1. Arrows Racing Team (1983) - 0\n2. Barclay Arrows BMW (1986) - appears twice, but it's the same team in different years.\n3. Ligier Gitanes (1991) - two entries, same team.\n4. SASOL Jordan (1993) - once.\n\nSo the teams that have 0 points are:\n\n- Arrows Racing Team\n- Barclay Arrows BMW\n- Ligier Gitanes\n- SASOL Jordan\n\nThat's four different teams with 0 points each in some year. Wait, but the claim says \"tie for the least amount of race with 1.\" Hmm, perhaps it's referring to the number of races, but the table shows 'points' not races.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"least amount of race with 1,\" which could mean that they had only one race each. But in the table, points are given per team per year, not per race. Each row represents a year's performance. So if SASOL Jordan has 0 points in their row (row index 13), does that mean they didn't score any points in any races that year? Or maybe they participated in only one race?\n\nBut the table doesn't specify the number of races each team participated in, just the points they earned per year. So based on the data given, we can only infer about their points, not the number of races.\n\nGiven that, if the claim is about having 1 point (maybe a typo for 'points'), then looking at SASOL Jordan's points: it's 0, which is tied with several others. If it's about being tied for the least amount (which would be 0), then yes, they are tied. But the claim says \"tie for the least amount of race with 1,\" which might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that SASOL Jordan had only one point in total across all years. Let me check if SASOL Jordan appears more than once. In this table, it's only present once (row 13), with 0 points. So their total is 0.\n\nIf other teams have 0 as well, then they are tied for the least. But the claim says \"tie for the least amount of race with 1,\" which is unclear. Maybe it meant that they had one point in a year? SASOL Jordan has 0, so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim intended to say that SASOL Jordan had the least points (0) and tied with others for being the lowest. So, how many teams have 0 points?\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- Arrows Racing Team: 1983\n- Barclay Arrows BMW: 1986 (twice)\n- Ligier Gitanes: 1991 (twice)\n- SASOL Jordan: 1993\n\nSo, each of these teams has at least one year with 0 points. So, they are tied for having the least points (0). Therefore, if the claim is that SASOL Jordan ties for the least amount of points (not race) with others, then it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait, in row index 13, SASOL Jordan has 0 points. The claim says \"tie for the least amount of race with 1.\" Hmm, maybe 'race' here refers to races they participated in. But we don't have data on how many races each team ran; only their points.\n\nSo without that information, perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's not based on available data. Alternatively, if the user meant points, then SASOL Jordan is tied with others at 0 points, making the claim TRUE.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit off: \"tie for the least amount of race with 1.\" That could mean they had one race and scored points, but in their row, they have 0. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and 'race' should be 'points.' If so, then yes.\n\nBut since we can't be sure about the intended meaning, perhaps the claim is incorrect because SASOL Jordan has 0 points, which is tied with others, but not necessarily related to '1 race.'\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that SASOL Jordan participated in only one race and thus scored 0 points. But without knowing how many races they entered, we can't confirm that.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the claim is TRUE because SASOL Jordan has 0 points, which ties them with other teams for the least points. So their 'points' column is 0, making them tied.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the most race that happen in any year be 2, which happen on 4 occasion\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully. It seems a bit unclear due to possible grammatical issues, but I think it means that the maximum number of races that occurred in any given year was 2, and this situation happened on four occasions (i.e., there are four years where exactly two races took place).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents data for a particular team in a specific year. The key columns here are \"year\" and \"points.\" Points usually indicate how many races a team participated in or won, but I'm not entirely sure if each point corresponds to a race. However, given that points can accumulate based on finishes, perhaps the number of points relates to the number of races.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the claim is about the number of entries (rows) per year rather than points. If so, we should count how many times each year appears in the table because each row might represent a race or an entry into a race.\n\nLet me list out the years and their counts:\n\n- 1983: 1 entry\n- 1984: 2 entries (rows 1 and 2)\n- 1985: 1 entry\n- 1986: 2 entries (rows 4 and 5)\n- 1987: 1 entry\n- 1988: 1 entry\n- 1989: 2 entries (rows 8 and 9)\n- 1990: 1 entry\n- 1991: 2 entries (rows 11 and 12)\n- 1992: 1 entry\n- 1993: 1 entry\n\nSo, the years with two entries are 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1991. That's four occasions where a year had two entries (rows). Therefore, if each row represents a race or an occasion, then the maximum number of races in any given year is two, and this occurred four times.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim: \"the most race that happen in any year be 2, which happen on 4 occasion.\" It matches our observation. The maximum is two races per year, and this happened four times (in years 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1991).\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the rows where the year has two entries. Specifically, these are the years with row counts of two, which are:\n\n- Row indices for 1984: 1 and 2 (but since we just need to count the occurrence, maybe each row's year is enough)\nBut perhaps the relevant cells are all the \"year\" columns where the count per year is two. So rows where the year appears twice.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2 (year 1984)\n- Rows 4 and 5 (year 1986)\n- Rows 8 and 9 (year 1989)\n- Rows 11 and 12 (year 1991)\n\nBut since the user just wants to know which cells are relevant, perhaps it's sufficient to note each occurrence of these years in the \"year\" column.\n\nSo for each row where the year is one of those four, we list their row indices and column name as \"year\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include all rows from 1984 (rows 1,2), 1986 (4,5), 1989 (8,9), and 1991 (11,12). That's a total of 8 entries.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the maximum being two races per year, which happened four times. So perhaps each occurrence where a year had exactly two rows contributes to this count. Therefore, all these rows are relevant because they demonstrate that in those years, there were two races (or two team entries), and across four different years, this maximum of two was reached.\n\nSo the JSON should list all these row indices with column name \"year\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the table shows four years (1984, 1986, 1989, 1991) each having exactly two entries, indicating two races per year. \n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"canon williams 2 time earn 37 point in race during 1989\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like the claim is saying that the team named \"Canon Williams\" earned 37 points twice (2 times) in races during the year 1989. So, I'm looking for two entries where the team's name includes \"Canon Williams,\" they have 37 points each, and both are from the year 1989.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each row to find matches. The rows are indexed starting from 0. \n\nRow 0: Year 1983, team is \"arrows racing team.\" Not relevant.\nRow 1: Year 1984, team is \"barclay nordica arrows bmw.\" Still not the team we're looking for.\nRow 2: Also 1984, same team as row 1. Points are 5 each time.\nRows 3 and 4: Both 1985 and 1986 with \"barclay arrows bmw.\" Not relevant.\nRow 5: 1987, team is \"benetton formula ltd.\" Different team.\nRow 6: 1988, same as row 5. Points are higher, but not the team we need.\n\nNow, looking at rows 7 and 8: Both have the year 1989. The team in both cases is \"canon williams team,\" which matches the claim's team name. Let me check their points. Both rows have 37 points each. So that's two entries for the same team, same year, with 37 points.\n\nRow 9: 1989 again, same team but chassis and engine might be different? No, the team is \"canon williams team,\" and points are still 37. Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, row indices in HTML tables usually start at 0, so let me recount.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The table has multiple rows for each year. Let me count them properly:\n\nRows:\n0: 1983\n1: 1984\n2: 1984\n3: 1985\n4: 1986\n5: 1986 (second entry)\n6: 1987\n7: 1988\n8: 1989\n9: 1989\n10: 1991\n11: 1991\n12: 1992\n13: 1993\n\nSo rows 8 and 9 are both for 1989, team \"canon williams team,\" each with 37 points. That's two times they earned 37 points in that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by these two entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Canon Williams\" earned 37 points twice in 1989.

So I need to check if there are entries in the table for the year 1991 where the engine is specified as Lamborghini and how many such entries exist.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and focus on the 'year' and 'engine' columns because those are the key pieces of information needed to verify the claim.\n\nStarting from the top, the first few rows are for years before 1990, so I can skip those. Let's move down until we hit the year 1991.\n\nRow index 11: Year is 1991, team is ligier gitanes, chassis is ligier js35, engine is lamborghini v12, points are 0.\nRow index 12: Year is 1991 again, same team and chassis model but with a different version (js35b), same engine lamborghini v12, points still 0.\n\nSo there are two entries for the year 1991 where the engine is Lamborghini.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the most amount of race win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that \"sasol jordan\" as a team tied for the most number of race wins. So I need to check if sasol jordan has the highest points, which likely indicate race wins or participation points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and details about the team's performance. The 'points' column probably shows how many points the team earned that year, which could correlate with their success in races\u2014more points typically mean more wins or podium finishes.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see where \"sasol jordan\" appears. Scanning down, the last row has the team as \"sasol jordan\" with 0 points in 1993. That's only one entry for this team, and they have zero points, so no wins that year.\n\nNext, I'll check other teams to see their total points across the years. For example:\n\n- Arrows Racing Team: In 1983, they had 0 points.\n- Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW (1984): 5 points each in two entries.\n- Benetton Formula Ltd: They have 16 points in 1987 and 27 in 1988. So total of 43 over two years.\n- Canon Williams Team: In 1989, they had 37 points twice. That's 74 for the year.\n- Ligier Gitanes: They have 0 points in both 1991 entries and 2 points in 1992.\n\nCanon Williams Team seems to have the highest points with 37 in each of two rows, but looking back, maybe I misread. Wait, the years for Canon Williams are 1989 (two entries) and 1990 (one entry). In 1989, they have 37 each, so that's a total of 74 points for the year, but actually, each row represents a different chassis or engine perhaps, so it's two entries in 1989. Then in 1990, they have 34 points. So their total across years would be 37 + 37 + 34 = 108? Or is each row per race? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a different chassis used by the team in that year, not multiple races. For example, in 1989, Canon Williams had two entries with the same points because they might have run both cars, but it's still one team, so their total points for the year would be 37. Similarly, in 1990, they have 34.\n\nWait no, looking at the table, each row is a separate entry, possibly per race or per chassis. So I need to sum all points for each team across all years to find out their total points.\n\nLet me list out the points for each team:\n\n- Arrows Racing Team: 0 (1983)\n- Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW: 5 + 5 = 10 (both in 1984)\n- Benetton Formula Ltd: 16 (1987) + 27 (1988) = 43\n- Canon Williams Team: In 1989, two entries with 37 each, so 74 for the year. Then in 1990, 34. So total is 74 +34=108.\n- Ligier Gitanes: 0 (both in 1991) and 2 (1992)\n- SASOL Jordan: 0 (1993)\n\nSo the highest points are from Canon Williams with 108, followed by Benetton's 43. Therefore, sasol jordan has only 0 points in their entry, which is the lowest.\n\nThe claim says they tied for the most amount of race wins. But since their points are zero and others have much higher, it's not possible. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: For sasol jordan, that's row 14 (assuming rows start at 0). The columns needed are 'team' to confirm it's them and 'points' to see their points. Also, checking other teams' points to compare.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include the team name in row 14 and their points. But since I need to check all teams for comparison, perhaps all rows' 'points' are relevant? Or maybe only the maximum points found elsewhere. However, per instructions, I should list cells that directly support the claim. Since sasol jordan has 0 points, which is clearly not the highest, their cell is sufficient.\n\nWait, but to fully verify, we need to check all teams to ensure none have zero as the max. But since others have higher, perhaps only sasol jordan's point is needed to show they didn't tie for most.\n\nBut maybe I should include all points cells to compare. Alternatively, just the ones that are highest and sasol's.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to list all points cells to confirm no one else has zero as the max. But given the structure, each team's total is more than sasol jordan's. So the key cell is row 14, 'points' being 0.\n\nSo relevant_cells would be:\n\n{\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"} and {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"ligier gitanes 2 time earn 37 point in race during 1989\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to understand what each part refers to. \n\n1. **Team Name**: The team mentioned is \"ligier gitanes\". Looking at the table, I need to find all rows where the team column matches this name.\n2. **Year**: The claim specifies the year 1989. So, among the rows for \"ligier gitanes\", I should check if any have the year 1989.\n3. **Points Earned**: The claim mentions earning 37 points twice. This means I need to see if there are two entries in the table where \"ligier gitanes\" earned exactly 37 points in 1989.\n\nNow, examining the table provided:\n\n- Scanning through each row:\n  - Rows 0-5: These are from years before 1989 or involve different teams. So, I can skip these.\n  - Row 6: Team is \"benetton formula ltd\", not relevant.\n  - Row 7: Same team as above; still not the one we're looking for.\n  - Rows 8-9: These are from 1989 and have the team \"canon williams team\". However, this doesn't match \"ligier gitanes\".\n  - Row 10: Team is \"canon williams renault\", which again doesn't match our target.\n  - Rows 11-12: These are from 1991 with the team \"ligier gitanes\". Here, both rows have points of 0, not 37. This suggests that in 1991, ligier didn't earn 37 points.\n  \nWait a minute\u2014there's no mention of \"ligier gitanes\" in the year 1989 at all. All instances of this team are in 1991 and 1992. Therefore, the claim that they earned 37 points twice during 1989 doesn't hold up because they didn't participate or earn any points that year.\n\nMoreover, looking back at rows 8 and 9, which are from 1989 but under \"canon williams team\", both have points of 37. This could be a point of confusion if someone mistakenly associates the points with the wrong team. But since the claim specifically mentions \"ligier gitanes\", we must ensure that the data matches this.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no evidence in the table supporting that \"ligier gitanes\" earned 37 points twice in 1989. The relevant cells show their involvement in later years with different point totals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"ligier gitanes\" earned 37 points twice during 1989, but the table shows they only participated from 1991 onwards.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most race that happen in any year be 4 , which happen on 3 soccasions",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the most race that happen in any year be 4, which happen on 3 occasions.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It seems like it's talking about the number of races per year and how many times a particular maximum number of races occurred. Specifically, the claim is stating that the highest number of races in any given year was 4, and this happened three different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents data from a specific team in a specific year. The columns are 'year', 'team', 'chassis', 'engine', and 'points'. I need to figure out how many teams raced each year because that might correspond to the number of races or participants. Alternatively, it could be about points per race, but since the claim mentions \"most race,\" I think it's more likely referring to the count of events or participations.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the 'points' column, these are likely points accumulated by each team in that year. But to find out how many races occurred in a year, we might need to look elsewhere. However, since the table doesn't directly list the number of races per year, perhaps it's about how many times each team participated or scored points.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"the most race that happen in any year be 4.\" So maybe it's saying that in a particular year, there were 4 races (or 4 teams participating?), and this maximum of 4 happened three times across different years.\n\nLooking at the 'year' column:\n\n- 1983: 1 team\n- 1984: 2 teams (since there are two entries for 1984)\nWait, no. Wait, looking closer, in 1984, the same team appears twice with different chassis and engines but same points. So that might be two entries for the same team in one year, not necessarily two different teams.\n\nSimilarly, for other years:\n\n- 1985: 1 entry\n- 1986: 2 entries (same team)\n- 1987: 1\n- 1988: 1\n- 1989: 2 entries (same team)\n- 1990: 1\n- 1991: 2 entries (same team)\n- 1992: 1\n- 1993: 1\n\nSo, the number of teams per year isn't necessarily matching. Wait, but perhaps each entry is a different race or event that the team participated in. So if a team has two entries in one year, it might mean they participated in two races.\n\nBut then, how many races were there in total per year? That's not directly given. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to the number of points entries per year, but I'm not sure that aligns with race counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'most race' is a typo and should be 'most races,' meaning the maximum number of races in any single year was 4, which occurred three times across different years.\n\nTo check this, I need to see how many races happened each year. But since the table doesn't provide that information directly, it's tricky. Each row might represent a race result for a team in a specific year, but without knowing how many races there were per year, we can't determine the total number of races.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the maximum points any team earned in a single race being 4, and this happened three times across different years. But looking at the 'points' column:\n\n- The highest points are 2 (1992) and some have higher numbers elsewhere? Wait, checking each row's points:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- 1983: 0\n- 1984: 0 for both entries\n- 1985: 0\n- 1986: 0 each\n- 1987: 0\n- 1988: 0\n- 1989: Each has points, but I need to check the exact numbers. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in 1983, the points are not visible; perhaps it's zero. In 1984, two entries with 0 points each. Then, for other years like 1987: 0? Or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, actually, I need to look at the 'points' column properly. Let me list all points:\n\n- Row 0 (1983): points not visible, but perhaps it's zero.\n- Rows 1 and 2 (1984): both have 0 points each.\n- Row 3 (1985): 0\n- Rows 4 and 5 (1986): both 0\n- Row 6 (1987): 0\n- Row 7 (1988): 0\n- Rows 8 and 9 (1989): let's see, row 8: points=2, row 9: points=0? Or maybe they're different. Wait, looking at the table:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 14.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nRow 8: year 1989, points 2\nRow 9: same team in 1989, points 0\n\nSo perhaps in 1989, there were two races where the team scored 2 and 0 points.\n\nSimilarly, row 10 (1991): points=0\nRow 11: same team in 1991, points=0\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that corresponds to races or other events. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a single race result for a specific team in a year. So the number of rows per year would indicate how many races the team participated in. But since multiple teams can be present in a year, the total number of races in a year would be more than that.\n\nBut without knowing the exact number of races per year, it's challenging to confirm the claim. The table doesn't provide information about the number of races each year; it only shows how many entries (teams and their points) exist for each year.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, I can't verify whether any year had 4 races or if this happened three times. The relevant cells would be the 'year' column to check how many entries are there per year, but without additional info on races, it's impossible to confirm.\n\nSo, since the claim isn't supported by the available data in the table, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified with the provided data because the number of races per year is not specified. The relevant cells are the 'year' column entries that show how many times each team participated but don't indicate race counts.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"a renault v10 engine be use during 2 race in 1991\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a Renault V10 engine being used. I need to look for rows where the engine is specified as 'renault v10'. Looking at the table, let's go through each row:\n\n- 1983: Cosworth V8\n- 1984 (rows 2 and 3): Cosworth V8 and BMW STR-4\n- 1985: BMW Straight-4\n- 1986 (rows 5 and 6): BMW Straight-4\n- 1987: Cosworth V6\n- 1988: Cosworth V8\n- 1989 (rows 9 and 10): Renault V10\n- 1990: Renault V10\n- 1991 (rows 12 and 13): Lamborghini V12\n- 1992: Renault V10\n- 1993: Hart V10\n\nWait, so in 1991, the engines are Lamborghini V12 for both entries. That means there's no Renault V10 used in 1991 according to the table.\n\nNext part of the claim is \"during 2 races\". So it's saying that the Renault V10 was used twice in 1991. But from the data, since 1991 entries don't have a Renault engine at all, this can't be true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because in 1991, the engines were Lamborghini V12s for both Ligier Gitanes entries, and there are no Renault V10 engines used that year. The relevant cells to check are the 'engine' column in all rows where the year is 1991.\n\nSo, looking at row indices 11 (assuming index starts at 0), but actually checking each row:\n\nWait, let me recount the rows correctly. Let's list them with their indices:\n\nRow 0: 1983\nRow 1: 1984\nRow 2: 1984\nRow 3: 1985\nRow 4: 1986\nRow 5: 1986\nRow 6: 1987\nRow 7: 1988\nRow 8: 1989\nRow 9: 1989\nRow 10: 1990\nRow 11: 1991\nRow 12: 1991\nRow 13: 1992\nRow 14: 1993\n\nSo rows 11 and 12 are the 1991 entries, both with Lamborghini V12 engines. Therefore, the relevant cells are in these two rows under the 'engine' column.\n\nThus, since neither of these have a Renault V10, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
