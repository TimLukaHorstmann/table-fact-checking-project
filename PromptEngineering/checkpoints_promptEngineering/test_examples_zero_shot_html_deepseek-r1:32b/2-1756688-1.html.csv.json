    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether the claim \"nathan ablett play with geelong for 4 year, before switch to gold coast\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: season, team, games, disposals, kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, goals, and behinds. The rows represent different seasons and teams that Nathan Abblett played for.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: playing with Geelong for 4 years before switching to Gold Coast. So I need to check how many seasons he was with Geelong and then if there's a switch to Gold Coast.\n\nLooking at the table, the first few rows are for Geelong in the seasons 2005, 2006, 2007, and then 2008 has all \"-\" which probably means no data or he didn't play that year. Then in 2011, it's Gold Coast with two games.\n\nSo, for Geelong, the seasons listed are 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 (but 2008 is missing data). However, since the claim says \"4 years\", I should count each season as a year. So that's 2005-2008, which is four seasons.\n\nThen in 2011, he switched to Gold Coast. That seems to align with the claim of playing for Geelong for 4 years before moving to Gold Coast.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the relevant cells in the table. Each row corresponds to a season and team. So for each year he was with Geelong (2005-2008), that's rows 0 to 3. The \"team\" column would be relevant because it shows which team he played for each year.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions switching to Gold Coast in 2011, which is row index 4. So I should include the \"team\" column of row 4 as well.\n\nWait, but how many rows are there? Let me recount:\n\nRow indices start at 0. The Geelong entries are rows 0 (2005), 1 (2006), 2 (2007), and 3 (2008). Then row 4 is Gold Coast in 2011, and row 5 is the career totals.\n\nSo for each of these Geelong years, I need to check the \"team\" column. Therefore, the relevant cells are rows 0-3 under \"team\".\n\nAdditionally, since the claim mentions switching to Gold Coast, we should also include the cell where he plays for Gold Coast, which is row 4 in the \"team\" column.\n\nWait, but does the claim specify that he switched after four years? Yes. So it's important that after the four Geelong seasons (2005-2008), his next recorded season is 2011 with Gold Coast, implying a switch after 2008.\n\nSo to verify the claim, I need to check:\n\n1. He played for Geelong in four consecutive seasons: 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008. Each of these is represented by rows 0-3 with \"team\" as Geelong.\n\n2. Then he switched to Gold Coast in a later season (2011), which is row 4 with team Gold Coast.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For each of the four Geelong seasons: rows 0-3, column \"team\".\n\n- The switch to Gold Coast: row 4, column \"team\".\n\nSo in total, five relevant cells. Let me list them as such.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data showing four years with Geelong followed by a switch to Gold Coast.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"94% of ablett's game be play with geelong, with the rest on gold coast\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has several rows corresponding to different seasons and a career totals row. Each row includes information about the team, games played, disposals, kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, goals, and behinds.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Geelong and Gold Coast. So I need to check how many games Ablitt played with each of these teams. Let me find the relevant rows for each team.\n\nLooking at the table, there are rows where the team is \"geelong\" and one where it's \"gold coast\". The seasons for geelong are 2005, 2006, 2007, and a blank row for 2008. For gold coast, there's only one entry in 2011.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of games Ablitt played with Geelong. The games column shows 4, 7, 21, and then \"-\" for 2008. Since \"-\" likely means no games or data wasn't recorded, I won't include that. So adding up: 4 + 7 = 11, plus 21 gives a total of 32 games with Geelong.\n\nNext, the gold coast row shows 2 games played in 2011. So Ablitt played 2 games for Gold Coast.\n\nNow, let's check the career totals. The last row under \"career totals\" says he played 34 games in total. That makes sense because 32 (Geelong) + 2 (Gold Coast) = 34 games.\n\nThe claim states that 94% of his games were with Geelong, and the rest were with Gold Coast. Let's verify this percentage. \n\nCalculating 94% of 34 games: 0.94 * 34 \u2248 31.96, which is approximately 32 games. That matches exactly with the number of games he played for Geelong (32). The remaining games are 34 - 32 = 2, which were with Gold Coast. So the claim accurately reflects that 94% of his career was with Geelong and the rest (6%) with Gold Coast.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. The key cells are:\n\n1. For Geelong:\n   - Season 2005: Games = 4\n   - Season 2006: Games =7\n   - Season 2007: Games=21\n\n2. For Gold Coast:\n   - Season 2011: Games=2\n\n3. Career Totals:\n   - Total games=34\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 0 (Season 2005), column \"games\"\n- Row index 1 (Season 2006), column \"games\"\n- Row index 2 (Season 2007), column \"games\"\n- Row index 4 (Season 2011, gold coast), column \"games\"\n- Row index 5 (Career totals), column \"games\"\n\nThese cells provide the necessary data to compute the total games for each team and verify the percentages mentioned in the claim. Since all these numbers add up correctly, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data showing that Ablitt played 32 out of 34 games (94%) with Geelong and the remaining 2 games with Gold Coast.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Ablett have 164 more disposal between his record in 2005 and 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Ablett having 164 more disposals between 2005 and 2007. So I'm assuming this refers to the difference in disposal counts for Geelong in those years.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant rows are for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007, all under the team Geelong. The column of interest is \"disposals.\"\n\nFor 2005, the disposals are listed as 27 (6.8). For 2007, it's 191 (9.1). I'm going to subtract the 2005 disposal count from the 2007 one.\n\nSo, 191 - 27 equals 164. That exactly matches the claim. \n\nNow, checking if these cells are correctly referenced in the table. The rows for 2005 and 2007 correspond to row indices 0 and 2 (since the first data row is index 0). The \"disposals\" column is what we need, so each relevant cell is from that column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there's a difference of 164 disposals between 2005 and 2007. By looking at the 'disposals' column for these years (27 in 2005 and 191 in 2007), subtracting gives exactly 164.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"nathan ablett score less goal in 2006 than he do in 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim compares Nathan Ablitt's goals scored in two different years: 2005 and 2006. It states that he scored fewer goals in 2006 than in 2005. So, I need to check how many goals he scored each year according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"season,\" \"team,\" \"games,\" \"disposals,\" etc., and one of them is \"goals.\" Each row represents a different season or career totals for a player. Since the claim mentions Nathan Ablitt, I assume the data here pertains to him.\n\nNow, let's locate the relevant rows for 2005 and 2006. Scanning through the table:\n\n- For 2005: The row with season=2005 has goals listed as \"8 (2.0)\". So, in 2005, Nathan scored 8 goals.\n- For 2006: The row with season=2006 shows goals as \"4 (0.6)\". Therefore, he scored 4 goals in that year.\n\nComparing these numbers, 4 is less than 8. That means Nathan Ablitt did score fewer goals in 2006 compared to 2005. So the claim appears to be TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant for this determination. The \"goals\" column in both the 2005 and 2006 rows are important. Checking the row indices, 2005 is at index 0 and 2006 at index 1 (since counting starts from 0). \n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the answer should be TRUE, supported by the goals cells in those two rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"across all his year on geelong, nathan abletts best year for point be 2007.\" So, I'll break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"best year for point\" means here. In Australian Rules Football, points are typically calculated based on goals and behinds. Goals are worth 6 points each, and behinds are 1 point each. So the total points would be (goals * 6) + behinds.\n\nLooking at the table, I see rows for Geelong from 2005 to 2007 and then 2008 with dashes, which probably means no data. Then in 2011, it's Gold Coast. The claim is about Nathan Ablett while he was on Geelong, so I'll focus on the years 2005, 2006, and 2007.\n\nI need to calculate the points for each of these years based on goals and behinds.\n\nFor 2005:\nGoals: 8\nBehinds: 2\nPoints = (8 * 6) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50\n\nFor 2006:\nGoals: 4\nBehinds: 3\nPoints = (4 * 6) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27\n\nFor 2007:\nGoals: 34\nBehinds: 18\nPoints = (34 * 6) + 18 = 204 + 18 = 222\n\nLooking at these, 2007 clearly has the highest points with 222 compared to 50 in 2005 and 27 in 2006. Therefore, Nathan Ablett's best year for points while on Geelong was indeed 2007.\n\nNow, mapping this to the table:\n\n- For each year, I'll need the 'goals' and 'behinds' columns.\nSo, relevant cells are:\n- Row index 0: goals (8) and behinds (2)\n- Row index 1: goals (4) and behinds (3)\n- Row index 2: goals (34) and behinds (18)\n\nThese are the rows where the team is Geelong, so row indices 0, 1, and 2. The columns involved are 'goals' and 'behinds'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"nathan ablett play with geelong for 3 year before switch to gold coast\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has columns: season, team, games, disposals, kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, goals, and behinds. Each row corresponds to a specific season or a career total for a player.\n\nThe claim mentions Nathan Ablitt playing with Geelong for three years before switching to Gold Coast. So I need to check the seasons where he was with Geelong and see if there are exactly three consecutive years, followed by a switch to Gold Coast in another year.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- 2005: Geelong\n- 2006: Geelong\n- 2007: Geelong\n- 2008: Geelong (but all stats are '-', so maybe he didn't play that season)\n- 2011: Gold Coast\n\nWait, the seasons listed are 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 (with dashes), and then a jump to 2011. So from 2005 to 2007, he was with Geelong for three seasons. Then in 2008, there's no data, maybe he wasn't playing or the data isn't recorded. Then in 2011, he's with Gold Coast.\n\nSo, does that mean he played three years (2005-2007) before switching? Yes, but there's a gap between 2008 and 2011. The claim doesn't mention the gap; it just says he switched after three years. So based on the data, he did play with Geelong for three seasons (2005, 2006, 2007) before moving to Gold Coast in 2011.\n\nNow, let's map this to the table cells:\n\n- For each season where he was with Geelong: rows 0 (2005), 1 (2006), and 2 (2007). The relevant column is \"team\" in these rows.\n- Then, the row for Gold Coast is row 4 (2011) under the \"team\" column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0, column \"team\"\n- Row 1, column \"team\"\n- Row 2, column \"team\"\n- Row 4, column \"team\"\n\nThis supports the claim that he played three years with Geelong before switching to Gold Coast.

The table shows statistics for a player named Ablatt across different seasons and teams. Let me look at the relevant columns which are \"season,\" \"team,\" and \"games.\" Each row represents a season or a career total.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 2005: Geelong, 4 games\n- 2006: Geelong, 7 games\n- 2007: Geelong, 21 games\n- 2008: Geelong, but no games listed (maybe not applicable)\n- 2011: Gold Coast, 2 games\n\nThe career totals row shows a total of 34 games. \n\nNow, let's calculate the number of games played for each team:\n\nGeelong:\n2005: 4\n2006: 7\n2007: 21\nTotal Geelong = 4 + 7 + 21 = 32 games\n\nGold Coast:\nOnly in 2011, 2 games.\n\nSo total games with Geelong are 32 out of 34.

Again, looking at the \"goals\" column, it shows 4  (0.6) for that year. So, he scored 4 goals in 2006.\n\nComparing these numbers: 8 goals in 2005 versus 4 goals in 2006. Clearly, he scored more goals in 2005 than in 2006. Therefore, the claim that he scored more goals in 2006 is FALSE.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other data that might affect this conclusion. The table doesn't have information for 2008 or 2011 related to Geelong except for Gold Coast in 2011, which isn't relevant here. Career totals show 47 goals across all seasons, but since we're specifically looking at 2005 and 2006, the detailed yearly data is sufficient.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 0 (2005), column \"goals\"\n- Row index 1 (2006), column \"goals\"\n\nBased on these values, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"ablett have 150 more disposal between his record in 2005 and 2007\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The claim mentions Ablett having 150 more disposals between 2005 and 2007. So I'm looking at two seasons: 2005 and 2007. For each of these years, I'll check the \"disposals\" column in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season or career total for a team, which seems to be Geelong except for the Gold Coast entry. The claim doesn't specify a particular player, but since it's about Ablett, maybe we're talking about Lance Ablett, who played for Geelong around that time.\n\nIn 2005, under the \"disposals\" column, it says 27 (6.8). I think the number before the parentheses is the total disposals for the season, and the number in parentheses might be per game or average. Similarly, in 2007, the disposals are listed as 191 (9.1).\n\nSo for 2005: disposals = 27\nFor 2007: disposals = 191\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference between these two years. So 191 (2007) minus 27 (2005) equals 164.\n\nWait, but the claim says there's a difference of 150 more disposals. My calculation gives me 164, which is actually higher than 150. Hmm, that suggests the claim might be false because it's saying there are 150 more, but in reality, it's 164 more.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if \"disposals\" here refers to something else or if I'm misinterpreting the numbers. Let me double-check the table structure. The columns are season, team, games, disposals, kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, goals, and behinds. So \"disposals\" is a direct stat per season.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the claim refers to career totals? Let's check the career totals row. Disposals there are 296 (8.7). But that's across multiple years, not just between 2005 and 2007.\n\nWait, but in 2005 he played 4 games, in 2006 he played 7 games, and in 2007 he played 21 games. The number of games might affect the total disposals. So in 2005 with 4 games, he had 27 disposals; in 2007, 21 games led to 191 disposals.\n\nIf I consider the difference between these two years, it's a significant jump from 27 to 191, which is an increase of 164. So the claim says he had 150 more, but actually, it's 164 more. That makes the claim false because it's not exactly 150.\n\nWait another thing: perhaps the claim refers to the average per game? Let me check the numbers in parentheses. In 2005, disposals are 27 (6.8), which could mean 27 total with an average of 6.8 per game. Similarly, 191 (9.1) would be 191 total with 9.1 per game.\n\nBut the claim is about the difference between 2005 and 2007 records, so it's likely referring to the total disposals each season, not per game. So again, the difference in totals is 164, which isn't 150, making the claim false.\n\nI think that's the conclusion. The relevant cells are the \"disposals\" column for rows corresponding to 2005 and 2007, which have row indexes 0 and 2 respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ablett had 150 more disposals between 2005 and 2007. Checking the table:\n\n- In 2005 (row index 0), disposals were 27.\n- In 2007 (row index 2), disposals were 191.\n\nThe difference is 191 - 27 = 164, which is more than 150. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"Across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Ablitt's best year for points was 2008.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a player's \"best year\" in terms of points. Typically, in Australian Rules Football (which is what this table seems to be about), points are calculated based on goals and behinds. Each goal is worth six points, and each behind is worth one point.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see 'goals' and 'behinds'. So for each year, the total points would be (goals * 6) + behinds.\n\nNow, let's look at the years Nathan Ablitt played for Geelong. From the table:\n\n- 2005: Goals = 8, Behinds = 2\n- 2006: Goals = 4, Behinds = 3\n- 2007: Goals = 34, Behinds = 18\n- 2008: All columns are \"-\", which likely means no data or he didn't play that year.\n\nCalculating points for each year:\n\n2005: (8 * 6) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50 points\n2006: (4 * 6) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27 points\n2007: (34 * 6) + 18 = 204 + 18 = 222 points\n2008: No data, so we can't include this year.\n\nSo the best year in terms of points is clearly 2007 with 222 points. The claim says that 2008 was his best year, which doesn't make sense because there's no data for 2008 and even if he played, without numbers we can't consider it as better than the years where he scored.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are from the rows corresponding to Geelong in each year (rows 0-3) under 'goals' and 'behinds' columns since these determine points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
