    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"when the 1st leg be 1 - 2 the club be paok fc in the 2011 - 12 uefa europa league\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that during the first leg (presumably a home or away match), there was a score of 1-2 for PAOK FC in the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.\n\nI'll look through the table provided to find relevant information about PAOK FC, the year 2011-12, and the scores associated with them. \n\nLooking at the rows, I spot a few entries related to \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league\". Let me list out those rows:\n\nRow indices:\n- 16: paok fc with score 1 - 3\n- 17: paok fc with score 1 - 2\n- 18: rubin kazan with score 1 -4\n- 19: tottenham with score 0 -4\n\nSo, in row 16 and 17, PAOK FC is involved. The scores are 1-3 and 1-2 respectively.\n\nThe claim mentions the first leg being 1-2. I'm assuming \"leg\" refers to a match or game in a series of matches (like group stages). So, row 17 has a score of 1 -2 where PAOK FC is the club involved.\n\nWait, but is this the first leg? The table lists multiple group stages and other rounds. Let me check if these are part of the same competition or different legs.\n\nThe rows for 2011-12 uefa europa league are from index 14 to 19. Each entry seems to be a separate match in the group stages, possibly against different opponents.\n\nIn row 17: \"paok fc\" with score 1 - 2. The opponent is not explicitly stated here, but looking at other entries, it's possible that this was against Tottenham Hotspur or another team.\n\nSo, the claim says when the first leg was 1-2, the club involved was PAOK FC in 2011-12 uefa europa league. From the table, row 17 shows a score of 1 -2 involving PAOK FC in that competition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by row 17.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim about two specific matches in the UEFA Europa League seasons 2010-11 and 2011-12. The claim says that in the 2010-11 season, Juventus FC had a first leg result of 0-1, and in the 2011-12 season, FC Flora Tallinn had a first leg of 1-0.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant rows. The table has multiple entries for different seasons and competitions, so I need to focus on the UEFA Europa League specifically.\n\nFor the 2010-11 season: I'm looking for any row where the \"Season\" is \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" and the opponent is Juventus FC. Scanning through the rows, I find a match under that season where Juventus is listed with a score of 0-1. The row index here is 37.\n\nNext, for the 2011-12 season: The claim mentions FC Flora Tallinn having a first leg of 1-0 in their UEFA Europa League matches. Looking through the rows for \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league\" or \"2011 - 12\", I find a row where Flora Tallinn is playing against another team with a score of 1-0.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user has provided a table with various football match details, and there's a specific claim to verify: \"the largest first leg be 0 - 7 for team G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994 - 95 season.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim is referring to. The term \"first leg\" typically refers to the away match in a two-legged competition (like a knockout round), with the second leg being the home match. So the claim is stating that G\u00f3rnik Zabrze had their largest first-leg score as 0-7 in that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to scan through each row to find any mention of G\u00f3rnik Zabrze and see what scores they have in the first legs. The relevant columns are likely \"Season,\" \"Team,\" and \"Score.\"\n\nStarting from the top, row 0: It's about a different team, so not relevant. Moving down, I check each row until I reach row 19 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). Wait, actually, in the table provided, the rows don't have explicit indices here, but based on the structure, let me recount.\n\nWait, the user included the entire HTML table, which has a tbody with multiple tr elements. Each tr represents a row. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1994-95: G\u00f3rnik Zabrze vs. some team, score 0-7 (row index might be 0 if starting from the top of the tbody)\n2. Then other rows follow.\n\nWait, looking back, in the provided table, the first row under tbody is for the 1994-95 season with G\u00f3rnik Zabrze having a score of 0-7. So that's row index 0.\n\nThe claim says this was their largest first leg. To verify if it's the largest, I need to check all other rows where G\u00f3rnik Zabrze is mentioned as the team and see if any of their scores in first legs are higher than 0-7.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, score 0-7 (1994-95)\nThen looking for other rows with G\u00f3rnik Zabrze. Scanning down, I don't see any other mentions of G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the table provided. All subsequent rows are about different teams like FC Flora Tallinn, Tottenham Hotspur, etc.\n\nSince there's only one entry for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, and it's a score of 0-7, which is quite high (a heavy defeat), it would indeed be their largest first leg in that season because there are no other scores to compare. \n\nTherefore, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that G\u00f3rnik Zabrze had a first-leg score of 0-7 in the 1994-95 season. The table shows this score for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in that specific row, and since there are no other scores to compare within their entries, it is their largest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 2003 at the uefa intertoto cup the round be first round and second round when the first leg be 2-1 and 0-2.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Year**: 2003\n2. **Competition**: UEFA Intertoto Cup\n3. **Rounds Mentioned**: First Round and Second Round\n4. **Scores (first legs)**: 2-1 and 0-2\n\nNow, I'll go through the table to see if these elements match.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\n- Rows 12 and 13 mention \"2003\" under the Season column.\n  - Row 12: UEFA Intertoto Cup, First Round, score 2-1\n  - Row 13: UEFA Intertoto Cup, Second Round, score 0-2\n\nThese rows exactly match the claim. The years are correct (2003), the competition is the UEFA Intertoto Cup, and the rounds with their respective scores align.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect the answer.

Specifically, these rows show matches against PAOK FC with results like 1-2 and 1-3.\n\nThis indicates that PAOK FC did participate in the 2011-12 Europa League because they were playing against other teams in the group stages.

Wait no, that's not correct. Let me go through each relevant cell.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It might be saying that in the first leg, both Celtic and AC Omonia have a 0-1 score. So I need to see if there are any rows where the result is 0-1 for either club.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow index 4: Club is \"AC Omonia\", result is 1-3.

So that's not 0-1.\n\nRow index 5: Club = \"Celtic\", Result = 0-3 against Tottenham. Hmm, but the claim is about 0-1, so this doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

For example:\n\nRow index 4: Group Stages, Club = AC Omonia, Opponent = Tottenham Hotspur FC, Result = 1-3\nRow index 5: Group Stages, Club = Celtic, Opponent = Paok FC, Result = 0-2\nWait, no, the result is 1-2?

The claim mentions a 0-1 result for both clubs in their first legs.\n\nBut in the table, I don't see any entries where either club has a 0-1 score. For example:\n\nLooking at all rows with Club as Celtic or AC Omonia:\n\nCeltic appears in row index 5: Result is 0-2\nAC Omonia appears in row index 4: Result is 1-3\n\nSo neither of them have a 0-1 result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nLooking at row index 4:\n\nClub: AC Omonia\nOpponent: Tottenham Hotspur FC\nResult: 0-3\n\nWait, maybe it's Opponent score vs Club score? So 0-3 would mean AC Omonia scored 3, but that doesn't make sense. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, I think the result format is Club's goals - Opponent's goals. So if Club is AC Omonia and Result is 1-3, that means AC Omonia scored 1, Tottenham scored 3.\n\nSimilarly, for Celtic in row index 5: Result is 0-2, meaning Celtic scored 0, Paok FC scored 2.\n\nSo, neither club has a result of 0-1. The claim says both have a first leg of 0-1, but in the table, their results are different.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if both Celtic and AC Omonia have a match result of 0-1 in their respective rows. \n\nLooking through the table:\n- **Celtic** appears in row 5 with a result of 0-3 against Tottenham Hotspur FC.\n- **AC Omonia** appears in row 4 with a result of 1-3 against the same opponent.\n\nNeither club has a result of 0-1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"juventus fc do not score a goal in the first leg of the 2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions Juventus FC and their performance in the first leg of the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League. The key point here is whether they scored any goals in that match. If they didn't score, then the claim would be true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row that corresponds to Juventus FC and the specific competition mentioned, which is the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League. Let me scan through the rows:\n\nI see a row with \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" in the first column. That's definitely relevant. The details for that match are: Opponent Juventus FC, Stage Group stages, and Result 0 - 3. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking closer, it says \"juventus fc do not score a goal.\" Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me check again. The row in question is under the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League, with the opponent being Juventus FC. The result for that match was 0 - 3. That means the team from the table scored 0 goals against Juventus, and Juventus scored 3. So if the claim says Juventus didn't score in the first leg, that would be false because they actually scored 3 goals.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure this is indeed the first leg. Sometimes competitions have two legs (home and away). The table shows multiple entries for different stages, so perhaps there are more than one match involving Juventus. Let me check all rows related to Juventus FC in that competition.\n\nLooking through, I see another row under 2010-11 UEFA Europa League where the opponent is again Juventus FC, but this time the result is 1 - 3. That seems like a different stage or perhaps a return leg. So in the first instance, they scored 3 goals, and in the second, maybe 3 again. \n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking at the table more carefully, I realize that each row represents a single match, not legs. The claim specifically mentions the \"first leg,\" so there should be two matches: home and away. Let me check if there are two entries between the same teams in the group stages.\n\nLooking back, yes, under 2010-11 UEFA Europa League, there are two rows with opponent Juventus FC:\n\n1. Result: 0 - 3\n2. Result: 1 - 3\n\nWait, that can't be right because if it's a first leg and second leg, the scores would typically be against each other. For example, in the first leg, maybe they scored at home, and in the second leg, away.\n\nBut the table shows two matches where the opponent is Juventus FC with results 0-3 and 1-3. That seems odd because it's the same team being played twice in group stages? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe these are different teams?\n\nWait no, looking closer, maybe the team in question is not Juventus but another team. The claim is about Juventus, so I need to see if Juventus scored in their first leg.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is from a specific team's perspective\u2014like how they performed against various opponents. So in this case, the rows are showing matches where the team (maybe the home team) played against Juventus FC and other teams.\n\nSo for the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League group stages:\n\n- Opponent: Juventus FC, Result: 0 - 3\n- Opponent: Tottenham Hotspur FC, Result: 1 - 3\n- Opponent: Paok FC, Results: 1 - 2 and 1 - 3\n- Opponent: FC Rubin Kazan, Results: 0 - 3 and 1 - 4\n\nWait, so the first match against Juventus was a loss with a score of 0-3. That means the home team (the one whose data is in the table) didn't score, but Juventus scored three goals.\n\nSo according to this, Juventus did score goals in that first leg. Therefore, the claim that they didn't score is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in 2003 at the uefa intertoto cup the first and second round be tie in the first leg.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It mentions that in 2003, during the UEFA Intertoto Cup, both the first and second rounds had ties in the first leg. So, there are two main parts here: checking for entries in 2003 related to the Intertoto Cup, specifically looking at the first and second rounds, and seeing if those matches were tied.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to scan through each row to find any entries from 2003. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 1: Season is 2002-03. Competition is UEFA Champions League. Round is Second Qualifying Round. Opponent is FC Rostov. The score was a tie (1-1). So, this might be relevant since it's close to 2003, but the competition isn't Intertoto Cup.\n\nRow 2: Season 2003-04. Competition is UEFA Intertoto Cup. Round is First Round. Opponent is FC Spartak Trnava. The score was 1-0, which isn't a tie. So, this doesn't support the claim about both first and second rounds being tied.\n\nRow 3: Season 2003-04. Competition is UEFA Intertoto Cup. Round is Second Round. Opponent is H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar. Score was 1-2, which also isn't a tie.\n\nLooking further down the table, I see multiple entries for different years and competitions. However, focusing on 2003 specifically, only rows with season 2002-03 or 2003-04 are relevant because they include the year 2003.\n\nFrom row 2 and 3, which are part of the 2003-04 season, both first and second rounds in the Intertoto Cup don't have tied scores. The first round was 1-0, and the second was 1-2. There's no indication of any ties in these matches.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows, I don't see any entries for 2003 with a competition named UEFA Intertoto Cup that resulted in ties in both the first and second rounds. \n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there is no support for the claim that both the first and second rounds in the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup were tied in the first leg. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "celtic and omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"celtic and omonia never have a first leg of 0-1\" is true based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in their respective matches, Celtic and Omonia never had a score where they lost 0-1 in the first leg. So, I'm looking for any instances where either of these teams played a match (specifically the first leg) with a result of 0-1.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if Celtic or Omonia are listed as opponents and check their scores.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 3: Opponent is Celtic, score is 1-2. That's not 0-1, so this doesn't support the claim being false.\nRow 4: Opponent is PAOK FC, score is 1-2. Not relevant to Celtic or Omonia.\nRow 5: Opponent is Omonia, score is 1-3. Again, not 0-1.\nRow 6: Opponent is Tottenham, score is 0-4. Not related.\nRow 7: Another match against Omonia with a score of 1-3. Still not 0-1.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table, I might have miscounted. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow indices start from 0. So let's go one by one:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Celtic, score is 1-2.\nRow 1: Opponent is PAOK FC, score is 1-2.\nRow 2: Opponent is Omonia, score is 1-3.\nRow 3: Opponent is Tottenham, score is 0-4.\nRow 4: Opponent is PAOK FC again, same as row 1? Or maybe it's a different match. Wait, the table seems to have multiple entries for some opponents.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the entire table provided, I see that in rows where the opponent is Celtic and Omonia, their scores are:\n\nFor Celtic: In one instance, the score is 0-1 (row index 3) when the opponent was Celtic? Wait no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing row indices. Let me recount from the top of the table provided in the user's message.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nThe rows with opponents are as follows:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"celtic\", score is 1-2 (first leg)\nRow 3: Opponent is \"tottenham hotspur fc\", score is 0-4\nWait, no. Let me list all the rows correctly.\n\nActually, in the table provided by the user, I see that there are multiple entries for each match. So perhaps I need to look through all of them carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go row by row:\n\nLooking at each row where the opponent is either Celtic or Omonia and check if their score was 0-1 in the first leg.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow index 2: Opponent is \"Omonia\", score is 1-3 (first leg). So that's not 0-1.\nRow index 4: Opponent is \"Celtic\", score is 1-2. Not 0-1.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, in the table provided by the user, let me list each relevant row:\n\nLooking at all rows where the opponent is either Celtic or Omonia and check their scores.\n\nIn the table, I see that there are two matches against Omonia. Let's see:\n\n- First match: Opponent \"Omonia\", score 1-3\n- Second match: Opponent \"Omonia\", score 1-4 (but wait, no, looking back at the table, perhaps it's a different structure).\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided by the user, the rows are as follows:\n\nRow indices and opponent columns:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 0: Opponent \"Omonia\", score 1-3\nRow index 4: Opponent \"Celtic\", score 1-2\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the table is quite long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to search for any instance where either Celtic or Omonia have a first leg score of 0-1. So looking through each row:\n\nLooking at all rows where opponent is \"Celtic\":\n\nIn row index 4: Opponent is \"Celtic\", score is 1-2 (so our team scored 1, Celtic scored 2). So that's not 0-1.\n\nLooking for any row where the opponent is \"Omonia\" and the score is 0-1. From the table:\n\nRow index 2: Opponent is \"Omonia\", score is 1-3 (our team scored 1, Omonia scored 3). Not 0-1.\n\nRow index 6: Opponent is \"Omonia\", score is 1-4. Still not 0-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rows. Let me go through all the rows in order:\n\nStarting from row 0 to the end:\n\nRow 0: Opponent \"Omonia\", score 1-3\nRow 1: Opponent \"PAOK FC\", score 1-2\nRow 2: Opponent \"Omonia\", score 1-4\nRow 3: Opponent \"Tottenham Hotspur FC\", score 0-4\nRow 4: Opponent \"Celtic\", score 1-2\nRow 5: Opponent \"PAOK FC\", score 1-2\nRow 6: Opponent \"Omonia\", score 1-3\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount the rows:\n\nLooking at the table as provided by the user, it's structured with multiple entries, some of which are for Omonia and Celtic.\n\nUpon reviewing each row where the opponent is either Celtic or Omonia, I don't see any instance where their score in the first leg was 0-1. All the scores are either higher than that or not matching.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, it seems that neither Celtic nor Omonia had a first leg with a score of 0-1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Celtic and Omonia never had a first leg score of 0-1. After reviewing each relevant row in the table, there are no instances where either team's score was 0-1 in the first leg.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true; neither Celtic nor Omonia had a first leg with a score of 0-1.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",
