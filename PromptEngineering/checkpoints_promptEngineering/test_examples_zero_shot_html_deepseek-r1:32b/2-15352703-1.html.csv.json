    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in HTML format and a claim that says, \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to. The claim has two main components: the draft pick number (155) and the college/university it's associated with (arizona university).\n\nI need to locate where the draft pick number 155 is in the table. Let me look through the rows one by one.\n\nLooking at the first row, the pick number is 16, which is much lower than 155. The second row has a pick of 43, still not 155. Moving on to the third row, the pick is 70\u2014closer but still not there. \n\nThe fourth row has a pick number of 101. Still not 155 yet. I'll keep going down the list. The fifth row shows a pick number of 155. Aha! This is the row we're interested in.\n\nNow that I've found the row with pick number 155, I need to check the college associated with it. Looking at the \"college\" column for this row, it says \"arizona.\" That matches exactly what the claim states about the university being Arizona.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to ensure there are no other rows with pick number 155 or any discrepancies in the data. Scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see any other entries with pick number 155. So, this row is the only one relevant to the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim\u2014pick number 155 and arizona university\u2014are accurately represented in the same row, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that draft pick number 155 comes from Arizona University. By examining the table, we find that pick number 155 corresponds to John Nies, who attended the University of Arizona.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It has columns: round, pick, player, position, and college. Each row represents a player picked in different rounds with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions that Arizona is the college with the last draft pick. So, I need to find out which college corresponds to the highest \"pick\" number because a higher pick number indicates a later selection in the draft.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"pick\" numbers go up as we move down the rows. The last row has the pick number 293, which is the highest among all entries. This means this player was picked last in the draft.\n\nNow, checking the college for that pick: the row with pick 293 shows the college as \"northwestern state , la\". Wait, but another row earlier had Arizona as the college in round 6 and pick 155, which is lower than 293. So, while Arizona does have a player picked, it's not the last one.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Arizona has the last draft pick isn't correct because the last pick (293) was from Northwestern State, LA.\n</think>\n\nThe college with the last draft pick (293) is Northwestern State, LA, not Arizona. So the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
