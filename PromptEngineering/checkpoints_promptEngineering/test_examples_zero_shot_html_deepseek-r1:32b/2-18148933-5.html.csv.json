    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's asserting that David Frost comes from the United States.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find where David Frost is mentioned. Scanning through the rows under the \"player\" column, I see that David Frost is listed in row 2 (since counting starts at 0, so index 2). Let me double-check: Row 0 is Paul Azinger, Row 1 is Nick Faldo, and Row 2 is David Frost. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the claim is about his country of origin. So I need to look at the \"country\" column for the row where David Frost is listed. In row 2, under the \"country\" column, it says South Africa. Hmm, so according to this table, David Frost is from South Africa, not the United States.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm looking at the right rows and columns. Sometimes tables can be confusing if they have multiple entries or similar names. But in this case, there's only one entry for David Frost, and his country is clearly marked as South Africa. There are other players from the United States like Paul Azinger, Craig Stadler, Payne Stewart, Tom Watson, Raymond Floyd, Mark Calcavecchia, but none of them are David Frost.\n\nSo putting it together: The claim says David Frost is from the United States, but according to the table, he's from South Africa. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also note which cells I looked at for verification. For row index 2 (David Frost), I checked the \"player\" column and the \"country\" column. These are the relevant cells because they directly relate to the player in question and his country of origin.\n\nSo my final determination is that the claim is FALSE, with the relevant cells being the ones under \"player\" and \"country\" for row 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
