The claim is about the highest crowd participation at a venue during the 1961 VFL season, specifically mentioning Junction Oval. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and identify which cells are relevant. The table has columns like \"venue\" and \"crowd,\" which are directly related to the claim.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Hawthorn vs North Melbourne)**: Venue is Glenferrie Oval with a crowd of 14,000.\n2. **Row 1 (Essendon vs Geelong)**: Venue is Windy Hill with a crowd of 27,500.\n3. **Row 2 (Collingwood vs Footscray)**: Venue is Victoria Park with 22,324 attendees.\n4. **Row 3 (Carlton vs South Melbourne)**: Played at Princes Park with a crowd of 16,889.\n5. **Row 4 (St Kilda vs Melbourne)**: Junction Oval had 33,100 people.\n6. **Row 5 (Richmond vs Fitzroy)**: Punt Road Oval saw 15,547 attendees.\n\nThe claim states that Junction Oval recorded the highest crowd.

Looking at the first row, the home team is hawthorn and the away team is north melbourne. The score for the away team there is 6.11 (47).

Let me go through each row.\n\nLooking at the first row, the home team is Hawthorn, and the venue is Glenferrie Oval with a crowd of 14000 on August 5, 1961.\n\nNext, in the second row, the home team is Essendon, and the venue is Windy Hill. The crowd here is listed as 27500 on the same date.\n\nSo, I need to compare the crowd numbers at these two venues. Glenferrie Oval had 14,000 attendees, while Windy Hill had 27,500. \n\nTo check the claim: Is Windy Hill's crowd 13,500 more than Glenferrie Oval's? Let's subtract 14,000 from 27,500. That gives me 13,500 exactly. So yes, Windy Hill had exactly 13,500 more attendees than Glenferrie Oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll carefully read the claim: \"punt road oval venue record a lower crowd participation than that of the prince park venue.\" So, I need to compare the crowd numbers for these two venues.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, it's structured with columns like 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', etc., including 'venue' and 'crowd'. The rows represent different matches played on August 5, 1961.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to the venues mentioned in the claim. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first row has venue \"glenferrie oval\".\n- The second is at \"windy hill\".\n- The third is at \"victoria park\".\n- The fourth is at \"princes park\" with a crowd of 16889.\n- The fifth is at \"junction oval\".\n- The sixth is at \"punt road oval\" with a crowd of 15547.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row index 3 for princes park and row index 5 for punt road oval. \n\nNext, I'll extract the crowd numbers from these rows:\n\n- Princes Park: 16889\n- Punt Road Oval: 15547\n\nThe claim states that punt road oval had lower crowd participation than princes park.

It seems like it's saying that Victoria Park was one of three venues used out of six total venues on August 5, 1961. So I need to check two things: how many unique venues are listed for that date and whether Victoria Park is among them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details including the venue.

Princes Park\n5. Junction Oval\n6. Punt Road Oval\n\nThat's a total of six different venues. So the claim mentions that Victoria Park is 3 of these six, which I think means it's one of them.

My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"north melbourne away team record an away score of 714 (56) while south melbourne record an away score of 9.14 (68)\". Hmm, that seems a bit off because looking at the table, each row has an 'away team' and their corresponding 'away team score'. \n\nLooking at the table structure, there are six rows, each representing a match between home and away teams on August 5, 1961. The columns include 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', 'away team score', venue, crowd, and date.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. North Melbourne as an away team has a score of 7.14 (56).\n2. South Melbourne as an away team has a score of 9.14 (68).\n\nI'll check each part against the table data.\n\nStarting with North Melbourne: In the first row, under 'away team', it's North Melbourne with an away score of 6.11 (47). Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says 7.14 (56). So there's a discrepancy here. The claim states their score as 7.14 (56), but in reality, it's 6.11 (47). That already suggests the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking South Melbourne: In the fourth row, 'away team' is South Melbourne with a score of 7.10 (52). The claim says their away score is 9.14 (68), which again doesn't match. So both parts of the claim are inaccurate based on the table data.\n\nI also noticed that in the last row, Fitzroy is the away team against Richmond with a score of 9.14 (68). But the claim incorrectly attributes this to South Melbourne instead of Fitzroy. That's another error in the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: North Melbourne's away score isn't 7.14 (56), and South Melbourne's away score isn't 9.14 (68) either. Therefore, both parts of the claim are false, making the entire statement FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the scores for both North Melbourne and South Melbourne as away teams, and also misattributes a score to South Melbourne that belongs to Fitzroy.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that Punt Road Oval had the highest number of people attending a game during the 1961 VFL season according to the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The dates are all \"5 august 1961,\" so it's likely these are games from that specific day or week within the 1961 season.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"crowd participation,\" which in this context refers to the number of people attending each game. So I need to check the 'crowd' column for each venue and see which has the highest number.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Venue is Glenferrie Oval, Crowd is 14,000.\n2. **Row 1**: Venue is Windy Hill, Crowd is 27,500.\n3. **Row 2**: Venue is Victoria Park, Crowd is 22,324.\n4. **Row 3**: Venue is Princes Park, Crowd is 16,889.\n5. **Row 4**: Venue is Junction Oval, Crowd is 33,100.\n6. **Row 5**: Venue is Punt Road Oval, Crowd is 15,547.\n\nNow, I'll list the crowd numbers alongside each venue to compare them:\n\n- Glenferrie Oval: 14,000\n- Windy Hill: 27,500\n- Victoria Park: 22,324\n- Princes Park: 16,889\n- Junction Oval: 33,100\n- Punt Road Oval: 15,547\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest crowd is at Junction Oval with 33,100 attendees.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"windy hill venue record 13500 more crowd participant than that of the glenferrie oval venue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the windy hill venue had a crowd participation that was 13,500 higher than that of glenferrie oval. To verify this, I should look up both venues in the table and compare their crowd numbers.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, etc. The columns relevant here are \"venue\" and \"crowd\". \n\nStarting with glenferrie oval: scanning through the rows, I find that the first row has \"glenferrie oval\" as the venue.

Since the rows are zero-indexed:\n\n- Junction Oval is in row 4, so {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"}\n- Princes Park is in row 3, so {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"}\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The first row is index 0.\n\nRow 0: Glenferrie Oval\nRow 1: Windy Hill\nRow 2: Victoria Park\nRow 3: Princes Park (Carlton vs South Melbourne)\nRow 4: Junction Oval (St Kilda vs Melbourne)\nRow 5: Punt Road Oval\n\nSo, the crowd for princes park is row 3, and junction oval is row 4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows 3 and 4 in the \"crowd\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Junction Oval had a lower crowd than Princes Park. However, according to the table, Junction Oval had 33100 attendees while Princes Park had 16889. Since 33100 is higher, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
