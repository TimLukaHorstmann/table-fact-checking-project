    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and then checking against each row in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It says that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng three times at tournaments. I need to verify if this happened as per the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. Each row represents a different event or occurrence where a partner was involved.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: All cells say \"world championships\". This seems like a header repetition and might not be relevant for the claim since it doesn't specify any specific partners or events.\n\n2. **Row 1**: The outcome is 3, event is 'wd', year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada, and partner Kang Haeng Suk. So here, Hwang Sun (assuming Hwang Sun is the one being referred to in the claim) partnered with Kang Haeng Suk once.\n\n3. **Row 2**: All cells say \"asian games\". Again, this looks like a header repetition and not relevant for specific partnerships.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Outcome is 1, event 'wd', year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner Kang Haeng Suk. So another instance where Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng Suk, making it the second time.\n\n5. **Row 4**: All cells say \"other open tournaments\". Another header repetition, not relevant for specific data.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Outcome is 1, event 'wd', year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng Suk. This is the third instance where Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng Suk at a tournament.\n\nSo, counting these instances: Row 1 (1st), Row 3 (2nd), and Row 5 (3rd). That makes three times they partnered together. \n\nTherefore, the claim that they partnered three times is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in calgary , canada.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key components of this claim:\n\n1. **Event Type**: World Championship\n2. **Year**: 1985\n3. **Venue**: Calgary, Canada\n4. **Partnership**: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng\n5. **First Time Partnership**: This implies that they started partnering in 1985.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to see if these details are supported.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n- There are several rows, some with repeated entries like \"world championships\" across all columns, which seems to be a header or placeholder. Then there are specific data rows with numbers and actual details.\n\nLet's examine each row for relevant information.\n\nRow 0:\nAll cells have \"world championships\". This might be a category row, not containing actual event data.\n\nRow 1:\n- outcome: 3\n- event: wd (possibly 'World Doubles' or similar)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: Calgary , Canada\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThis row seems to have the details we need. The year is 1985, venue is Calgary, Canada, and one of the partners is Kang Haeng.\n\nRow 2:\nAll cells say \"asian games\", likely another category.\n\nRow 3:\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd\n- year: 1982\n- venue: New Delhi , India\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nHere, the year is 1982, which is earlier than 1985. The partners include Kang Haeng again.\n\nRow 4:\nAll cells say \"other open tournaments\", another category.\n\nRow 5:\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd\n- year: 1985\n- venue: India Open\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nAnother row with year 1985, but the venue is different (India Open), and the same partner.\n\nNow, analyzing the claim:\n\nThe claim says that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time in 1985 at the World Championship in Calgary. \n\nBut looking at Row 3, which is from 1982, the partners are also Kang Haeng. This suggests that they were already partnering before 1985.\n\nAdditionally, in Row 1, we have a 1985 event where one partner is Kang Haeng, but there's no mention of Hwang Sun here; instead, it's just \"kang haeng - suk\". The name \"Hwang Sun\" doesn't appear in any of the rows. \n\nMoreover, the venue for the World Championship in 1985 according to Row 1 is Calgary, Canada. But since there's a prior partnership in 1982, this indicates that their partnership started earlier.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n- The partners were already working together in 1982.\n- Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner anywhere in the table; only Kang Haeng and Suk are mentioned.\n- The first time they partnered was before 1985.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"In 1982, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Game in the women's double event, finished first, which was one of two times she won an event with Kang Haeng.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries related to the year 1982. Scanning through the rows, I see that row index 3 has the year 1982. Let me check what other columns say in this row.\n\nIn row 3:\n- Outcome: 1\n- Event: wd (which I think stands for women's doubles)\n- Year: 1982\n- Venue: New Delhi, India\n- Partner: Kang Haeng-suk\n\nSo, the outcome is 1, which likely means first place. The event is women's doubles, so that fits \"women's double event\". The year is correct as 1982.\n\nNow, checking if this was one of two times she won with Kang Haeng. I need to see how many entries there are where the partner is Kang Haeng-suk and the outcome indicates a win (like 1 or 3). \n\nLooking at other rows:\n- Row 1: Outcome is 3, which might be third place. Partner is Kang.\n- Row 4: Outcome is 1, but it's about the Asian Games? Wait, row 4 has all columns as \"asian games\", so perhaps not a specific event result.\nWait, no, let me recheck.\n\nActually, rows are:\nRow 0: All cells say \"world championships\" except the first which is outcome. Not sure if that's an actual entry or just headers?\nRows 1-5 seem to be data rows.\n\nLooking at each row where partner is Kang Haeng-suk:\n\nRow 1: Partner is Kang, year 1985. Outcome is 3.\nRow 3: Partner is Kang, year 1982. Outcome is 1.\nRow 5: Partner is Kang, year 1985. Outcome is 1.\n\nSo, in row 3 and 5, she won with Kang (outcomes 1). That's two wins. The claim says \"one of two times,\" which matches because she has two wins listed here.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open finish first 2 year after win the Asian game.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify each part of the claim and see if it aligns with the data in the table.\n\n1. **Partner Information**: The claim mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng. Looking at the \"partner\" column, I need to find rows where the partner is Kang Haeng. Scanning through:\n   - Row 2: Partner is Kang Haeng Suk (but this seems like a different person's name).\n   - Rows 4 and 5 also mention Kang Haeng Suk or similar variations. However, none of these entries explicitly state \"Kang Haeng\" as the partner.\n\n2. **1985 India Open**: The claim refers to the 1985 India Open. Checking the \"venue\" column for this event:\n   - Row 5: Venue is \"India Open\" and year is 1985, but the outcome here is listed as 1. Wait, looking at row indices, actually in the table provided, the first row is index 0 with all cells saying \"world championships\", then row 1 has specific data, etc.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have misread the rows earlier. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: All cells are \"world championships\" \u2013 probably not relevant.\n- Row 1: Outcome is 3, event is wd (maybe world doubles?), year 1985, venue Calgary, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\n- Row 2: All cells are \"asian games\".\n- Row 3: Outcome 1, event wd, year 1982, venue New Delhi, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\n- Row 4: All cells are \"other open tournaments\".\n- Row 5: Outcome 1, event wd, year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nSo, for the 1985 India Open, row 5 has the outcome as 1. That would mean they finished first at that tournament in 1985.\n\n3. **Asian Game Win**: The claim says \"2 year after win the Asian game.\" So, if the India Open was in 1985, then the Asian Games should have been in 1983. However, looking at row 3:\n   - Year is 1982, event is Asian Games, outcome is 1 (first place). So, they won the Asian Games in 1982.\n\nThe claim states that the India Open was two years after the Asian Games. From 1982 to 1985 is three years later, not two. Therefore, this part of the claim doesn't hold true.\n\nAdditionally, checking the partners: The partner in row 5 (India Open 1985) is Kang Haeng Suk, but Hwang Sun isn't explicitly mentioned as a partner anywhere in the table. It only mentions Kang Haeng Suk as the partner, not another person like Hwang Sun.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n- They did finish first at the 1985 India Open (row 5).\n- However, the Asian Games win was in 1982, making it three years before 1985, not two.\n- The partner is Kang Haeng Suk, but Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner in any relevant row.\n\nTherefore, the claim has some truth but also inaccuracies regarding the timing and the partner's name. Hence, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"With her partner Kang Haeng, Hwang Sun finish in the top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n1. Partner: Kang Haeng\n2. Athlete: Hwang Sun (though not explicitly mentioned in the table)\n3. Finishing in the top 3: So outcome should be 1st or 2nd or 3rd place.\n4. Three different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event with various details. The relevant columns are 'outcome', 'event', 'year', 'venue', and 'partner'.\n\nLet me go through each row to find matches for Hwang Sun's partner Kang Haeng:\n\nRow indices start from 0:\n- Row 1: Partner is \"kang haeng - suk\". This seems like a variation of the name, possibly the same person. Outcome is 3. So this counts as top 3.\n  Year: 1985, Venue: calgary , canada.\n\n- Row 3: Partner again is \"kang haeng - suk\", Outcome is 1. Year: 1982, Venue: new delhi , india.\n\n- Row 5: Partner is the same, Outcome is 1. Year: 1985, Venue: India Open.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014Row 5's event is \"wd\", which I assume stands for women's doubles, and the venue is \"india open\". So that's another event in 1985 at a different venue.\n\nSo now, let me list out all relevant entries where partner is Kang Haeng:\n\nRow 1: Outcome 3, Year 1985, Venue Calgary\nRow 3: Outcome 1, Year 1982, Venue New Delhi\nRow 5: Outcome 1, Year 1985, Venue India Open\n\nWait a minute\u2014this is three entries. So venues are Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. That's three different venues.\n\nThe years span from 1982 to 1985, which fits the time frame mentioned in the claim.\n\nHowever, I notice that Row 5 has the same year as Row 1, both being 1985. So the claim says \"from 1982 to 1985,\" and we have events in those years. But do they occur at three different venues? Let's check:\n\n- Calgary, Canada (Row 1)\n- New Delhi, India (Row 3)\n- India Open (Row 5)\n\nWait, isn't the India Open also in India? So venues are Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. But wait\u2014India Open might be a different city within India or maybe it's another location. The table doesn't specify cities beyond \"new delhi\" for one and \"india open\" for another.\n\nBut regardless, each venue is listed differently: Calgary is in Canada, New Delhi is in India, and India Open (which could be in a different Indian city). So three distinct venues.\n\nWait no\u2014actually, the venues are:\n\nRow 1: calgary , canada\nRow 3: new delhi , india\nRow 5: india open\n\nSo these are three different venues across two countries. So that's three different venues as per the claim.\n\nBut looking at the outcome in Row 1 is 3, which is top 3 (third place), and Rows 3 and 5 have outcomes of 1, which is definitely within top 3. So all three events meet the top 3 condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" The years in the table are 1982 (Row 3) and 1985 (Rows 1 and 5). So that's within the time frame mentioned. And three different venues as listed.\n\nWait, but I have a question: Is \"india open\" considered a different venue from \"new delhi , india\"? Because if both are in India, perhaps they are two different cities or just different events in the same country. But regardless, the claim doesn't specify countries; it's about venues, which can be distinct events even within the same country.\n\nSo putting it all together: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng participated in three events between 1982 and 1985 at three different venues (Calgary, New Delhi, India Open) with outcomes of 3rd, 1st, and 1st place respectively. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n\n- For each row that supports this:\n   - Row 1: outcome (3), venue (calgary)\n   - Row 3: outcome (1), venue (new delhi)\n   - Row 5: outcome (1), venue (india open)\n\nSo the columns we need are 'outcome', 'venue', and perhaps 'year' to check the timeframe.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has multiple same values except for rows 1,3,5. So when considering the partner is Kang Haeng, it's rows 1,3,5.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 1: outcome (value 3), venue (calgary)\nRow 3: outcome (1), venue (new delhi)\nRow 5: outcome (1), venue (india open)\n\nAdditionally, checking the years to ensure they are within 1982-1985. So for each of these rows, we also check the 'year' column.\n\nSo in total:\n\nFor Row 1:\n   - outcome (3)\n   - year (1985)\n   - venue (calgary)\n\nRow 3:\n   - outcome (1)\n   - year (1982)\n   - venue (new delhi)\n\nRow 5:\n   - outcome (1)\n   - year (1985)\n   - venue (india open)\n\nSo all these cells are relevant to confirming the claim.\n\nWait, but in the response, I need to list each cell as per row and column. So for example:\n\n- Row 1: 'outcome' is 3, which is at position (Row=1, Column=outcome)\nSimilarly for other rows and columns.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, perhaps it's sufficient to note that we're checking these specific cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by three entries in the table where Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng participated in events between 1982 and 1985 at three distinct venues with outcomes within the top three. \n\n- **Row 1**: Outcome is 3 (third place), Venue is Calgary, Canada, Year is 1985.\n- **Row 3**: Outcome is 1 (first place), Venue is New Delhi, India, Year is 1982.\n- **Row 5**: Outcome is 1 (first place), Venue is India Open, Year is 1985.\n\nThese entries confirm the claim of participating in three different venues within the specified timeframe with top-three finishes.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE. \n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 1: 'outcome' (3), 'venue' (Calgary), 'year' (1985)\n- Row 3: 'outcome' (1), 'venue' (New Delhi), 'year' (1982)\n- Row 5: 'outcome' (1), 'venue' (India Open), 'year' (1985)",

Another placeholder.\n- outcome: other open tournaments\n- event: other open tournaments\n- year: other open tournaments\n- venue: other open tournaments\n- partner: other open tournaments\n\nNot relevant as it's not specific data.\n\n**Row 5:** Specific data about the India Open in 1985.\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd (World Doubles)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: india open\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThis row shows that in 1985, at the India Open, Kang Haeng was a partner. However, the claim is about 1982, so this doesn't align.\n\nNow, analyzing each part of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Partnership with Kang Haeng:**\n   - Rows 1,3,5 all mention \"kang haeng - suk\" as a partner. So Hwang Sun did partner with Kang Haeng multiple times.\n\n2. **First time at 1982 World Championship:**\n   - The claim states the partnership started in 1982. Looking at the table:\n     - Row 3 has year 1982, event 'wd', venue New Delhi, partner Kang Haeng.\n     - However, Row 1 is 1985 with venue Calgary, same partner.\n     - There's no data showing a partnership before 1982 in the table. So if this is their first time partnering, it would be at 1982.\n\n3. **Venue as India Open:**\n   - The claim mentions \"India Open\" as the venue. However:\n     - Row 3 has venue New Delhi, India.\n     - Row 5 has venue India Open in 1985.\n   - So in 1982, the venue was New Delhi, not India Open.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- The partnership between Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng did exist, as seen in multiple rows (1,3,5).\n- Their first recorded partnership in the table is in 1982 at the Asian Games (Row 3). However, the venue was New Delhi, not India Open.\n- The claim states that this happened at the \"India Open\", which according to the table, took place in 1985.\n\nTherefore, while they were partners starting in 1982, it wasn't at the India Open but at the Asian Games. Additionally, there's no entry for a World Championship event in 1982; instead, the World Championships are mentioned in a placeholder row (Row 0).\n\nThus, the claim has inaccuracies regarding both the year and venue of their first partnership.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng starting in 1982, it was at the Asian Games in New Delhi, not the India Open. Additionally, there's no record of a World Championship event in 1982.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nI'll go through each relevant cell:\n\n1. **Rows with Partner Kang Haeng**: \n   - Row 1: Partner is \"kang haeng  - suk\" (maybe a typo or full name)\n   - Rows 3 and 5 also have the same partner.\n   \n2. **Outcomes**:\n   - In row 1, outcome is '3' which might mean third place, not first.\n   - Row 3: outcome is '1', which would be first place.\n   - Row 5: outcome is '1' again.\n\nWait, so from the table, Hwang Sun (if she's represented in these rows) has two wins (rows 3 and 5). But the claim says three different venues. Let me check the venues:\n\n- Row 1: Calgary, Canada\n- Row 3: New Delhi, India\n- Row 5: India Open\n\nSo that's three venues: Calgary, New Delhi, India Open.\n\nBut wait, looking at row 1, the outcome is '3', which might mean third place. So Hwang Sun didn't finish first there. The claim says she finished first at three different venues. From the table, only rows 3 and 5 show her finishing first (outcome=1). That's two venues, not three.\n\nSo the claim says three venues but according to the data, it's only two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun finished first at three different venues with her partner from 1982 to 1985.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng at the 1982 New Delhi, India finish first 2 years after win the world championship.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key points from the claim:\n\n1. **Partner**: Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng.\n2. **Year and Venue**: The event took place in 1982 at New Delhi, India.\n3. **Outcome**: They finished first.\n4. **Timeframe**: This happened two years after winning the World Championship.\n\nNow, let's check each part against the table.\n\n**Partner (Kang Haeng):**\nLooking through the \"partner\" column, I see \"kang haeng  - suk\" in rows 1 and 3. So, Hwang Sun did partner with Kang Haeng.\n\n**Year 1982:**\nIn row 3, under the \"year\" column, it's 1982. This matches the claim's year.\n\n**Venue New Delhi, India:**\nRow 3 has \"new delhi , india\" in the venue column. So that checks out.\n\n**Outcome First Place:**\nThe outcome for row 3 is listed as \"1\", which I assume means first place. That aligns with finishing first.\n\n**World Championship Win Two Years Prior:**\nThe claim says this happened two years after winning a World Championship. From row 1, the event was in 1985 with the same partner. So if they won the World Championships in 1983 (two years before 1985), that would fit. However, the table doesn't explicitly show a World Championship win in 1983. It only shows their performance in 1985. Therefore, we can't confirm that there was a World Championship victory two years prior to 1982 because 1982 is before 1985.\n\nWait, actually, the claim mentions \"two years after win the world championship.\" If they finished first in 1982, then the World Championship would have been in 1980. But there's no data for 1980 in the table. So without evidence of a World Championship win prior to 1982, this part isn't supported.\n\nBut wait again: Row 1 shows a \"world championships\" outcome in 1985. So if they won the World Championships in 1985, then two years later would be 1987. But the claim is about 1982, which doesn't align with that timeframe.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim says they finished first in 1982, and this was two years after winning the World Championship. So the World Championship win should be in 1980. However, looking at row 3, which is from 1982, the outcome is \"asian games\" not a World Championship. The only World Championship entry is in row 1 with year 1985.\n\nSo, according to the table, they won the World Championships in 1985 (row 1), and then in 1987 (two years later) they might have another event, but there's no data for that. The claim is about 1982 being two years after a World Championship, which would require a win in 1980, which isn't present.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they finished first in 1982, which was two years after their World Championship victory, isn't supported by the table because there's no evidence of a World Championship win in 1980. The only World Championship data is from 1985.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be fully supported as there's no information about a World Championship win in 1980. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"In 1985, Hwang Sun participate in the Asian game in the women's doubles event, finish second, 2 of 3 times she win an event with Kang Haeng.\"\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I don't see any row mentioning \"Hwang Sun\" or \"Kang Haeng.\" The partner column has \"kang haeng  - suk,\" which might be a different person. So maybe there's confusion here.\n\nNext, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Year 1985:** Checking the 'year' column for rows where year is 1985. Rows 2 and 6 have 1985 as the year.\n\n2. **Asian Game participation in 1985:** Looking at row 2, it's labeled under \"asian games.\" The event is \"wd\" (probably women's doubles). The partner is \"kang haeng - suk.\"\n\n3. **Finished second:** In row 2, the 'outcome' is listed as \"world championships,\" which might not directly indicate finishing second. But let me check other rows for 'asian games.' Another row is index 2: outcome is \"asian games\" but no specific position.\n\nWait, actually, in row 3 (index starting at 0?), the outcome is 1, year 1982. So perhaps I'm mixing up indices. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: All cells say 'world championships'\n- Row 1: 3, wd, 1985, Calgary, kang haeng - suk\n- Row 2: all \"asian games\"\n- Row 3: 1, wd, 1982, New Delhi, same partner\n- Row 4: all \"other open tournaments\"\n- Row 5: 1, wd, 1985, India Open, same partner\n\nSo the claim is about 1985 and Asian Games. Looking for rows where year is 1985 and event relates to Asian Games.\n\nRow 2 has outcome as \"asian games\" but all columns are labeled as such, not specific data. The actual data row would be index 3? Wait no: looking again:\n\nWait, the HTML table has a header (thead) with 5 columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nThen tbody has six rows.\n\nRow 0 in tbody is all \"world championships\" across each column.\n\nRow 1: 3, wd, 1985, Calgary, kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 2: all \"asian games\"\n\nRow 3: 1, wd, 1982, New Delhi, same partner\n\nRow 4: all \"other open tournaments\"\n\nRow 5: 1, wd, 1985, India Open, same partner\n\nSo for the claim about 1985 and Asian Games:\n\nLooking at row 2 (tbody index 2), it's labeled as \"asian games\" in all columns. But does that correspond to data? Or is it just a header-like row?\n\nWait, perhaps rows 0, 2, 4 are not actual entries but more like section headers. Because they have the same string across all columns.\n\nSo the real data rows are 1,3,5:\n\n- Row 1: outcome=3, event=wd, year=1985, venue=Calgary, partner=kang haeng - suk\n\n- Row 3: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1982, venue=New Delhi, same partner.\n\n- Row 5: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1985, venue=India Open, same partner.\n\nSo in 1985, there are two entries:\n\nRow 1: Outcome=3 (probably third place), event=wd, at Calgary.\n\nRow 5: Outcome=1 (win), event=wd, at India Open.\n\nBut the claim says Hwang Sun participated in Asian Games in 1985. However, row 2 is just \"asian games\" across all columns, which might be a header, not an actual data point with specific details. So perhaps there's no data about Asian Games participation by Hwang Sun in 1985.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions finishing second (position 2) and that out of three times she won events with Kang Haeng. Let me check:\n\nLooking at all rows with partner \"kang haeng - suk\":\n\nRow 1: outcome=3 (third place), event=wd, year=1985\n\nRow 3: outcome=1 (win), event=wd, year=1982\n\nRow 5: outcome=1 (win), event=wd, year=1985\n\nSo total wins with partner: two times (rows 3 and 5). The claim says \"2 of 3 times she win an event,\" but in the table, there are only three entries with this partner:\n\n- Row 1: third place (loss)\n\n- Row 3: first (win)\n\n- Row 5: first (win)\n\nSo total wins are two out of three events. That part matches.\n\nBut the claim also states participation in Asian Games in 1985, which might correspond to row 2, but that row is all \"asian games\" without specific details. So perhaps Hwang Sun did participate in Asian Games 1985, but the outcome isn't specified in the data rows.\n\nWait, row 2 is:\n\noutcome: asian games\n\nevent: asian games\n\nyear: asian games\n\nvenue: asian games\n\npartner: asian games\n\nThat seems like a header or label rather than actual data. So there's no specific data about Hwang Sun's participation in Asian Games 1985; the only relevant data rows are row 1 (Calgary, third place) and row 5 (India Open, first place), both in 1985.\n\nSo maybe the claim is incorrect because she didn't participate in Asian Games 1985 as per the given data. Or perhaps the Asian Games entry is missing specific details.\n\nAlternatively, if row 2 represents an actual event where outcome was \"asian games\" (which doesn't make sense), but that's unclear.\n\nMoreover, the claim mentions finishing second, which isn't reflected in any of her outcomes in 1985; she either finished third or won.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The table shows two wins and one third place with partner kang haeng - suk in events across different years (two in 1985, one in 1982).\n\n- There's no specific data about participation in Asian Games 1985 beyond row 2 being labeled as such without details.\n\nThus, the claim that she participated in Asian Games 1985 and finished second might not be supported by the given data. Also, her outcomes in 1985 were third place (Calgary) and first place (India Open), so no second place.\n\nTherefore, the information provided doesn't fully support the claim as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to verify the claim that Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1985, finished second, and had two wins out of three events with her partner. Upon analyzing the data:\n\n- **Participation in Asian Games 1985**: The table lacks specific details about her participation in the Asian Games; only a header-like row mentions \"asian games,\" which doesn't provide concrete information.\n\n- **Finishing Second**: There's no record of her finishing second in any event. In 1985, she finished third at Calgary and won at the India Open.\n\n- **Two Wins Out of Three Events**: She did win two events (rows 3 and 5) with her partner, but these were in different years (1982 and 1985), not all three in 1985. The third event in 1985 was a third-place finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim isn't fully supported by the data provided. She won two events with her partner, but there's no evidence of her participating in or finishing second at the Asian Games in 1985 as per the given table.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{\\text{The information does not support the claim about Hwang Sun's participation and outcome at the 1985 Asian Games.}}",
