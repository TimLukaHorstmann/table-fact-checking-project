    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says that Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information for both institutions.\n\nDartmouth College is in the first row (row index 0). The columns related to ranking are \"world rank by the - wur, 2013\", \"world rank by arwu, 2013\", and \"world rank by qs, 2013\". \n\nLooking at Dartmouth's ranks:\n- WUR: 126th\n- ARWU: 151 - 200th\n- QS: 113th\n\nNext, I'll check the University of T\u00fcbingen. It's in row index 4.\n\nT\u00fcbingen's ranks are:\n- WUR: 201 - 225th\n- ARWU: 151 - 200th\n- QS: 144th\n\nNow, comparing each ranking:\n\n1. **WUR Ranking (World University Rankings by THE):**\n   - Dartmouth is 126th.\n   - T\u00fcbingen is between 201st and 225th.\n   So, Dartmouth is higher here.\n\n2. **ARWU Ranking:**\n   - Both are in the same range (151-200). It's a tie in this ranking.\n\n3. **QS Ranking:**\n   - Dartmouth is 113th.\n   - T\u00fcbingen is 144th.\n   So, Dartmouth is higher here as well.\n\nSince two out of the three rankings show Dartmouth higher than T\u00fcbingen and one is a tie, it can be concluded that overall, Dartmouth ranks higher in more sources. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Dartmouth's WUR rank (row 0)\n- Dartmouth's QS rank (row 0)\n- T\u00fcbingen's WUR rank (row 4)\n- T\u00fcbingen's QS rank (row 4)\n\nI'll note these as the relevant_cells in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Durham University is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"overall, durham university have the best rank, ie 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" So the claim states that Durham University has the highest (best) rank of 80th in the WUR 2013 ranking.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: members, country, year established, world rank by wur 2013, world rank by arwu 2013, and world rank by qs 2013.\n\nI need to focus on the \"world rank by wur 2013\" column because that's what the claim is about. Let me list out the universities along with their respective ranks from this column:\n\n1. Dartmouth College: 126th\n2. Durham University: 80th\n3. Queens University: 226-250th\n4. University of Otago: 226-250th\n5. University of T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n6. University of Western Australia: 168th\n\nLooking at these ranks, Durham University has the rank of 80th, which is better (i.e., higher) than all others in this category. Dartmouth College is next with 126th, followed by UWA at 168th, and then the rest are even lower.\n\nSo, based on the data, Durham University does indeed have the best rank of 80th in the WUR 2013 ranking. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells were checked. The claim specifically mentions Durham University and its rank in the \"world rank by wur 2013\" category. Looking at the table, Durham University is in row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed, but wait\u2014actually, looking back, the first data row is Dartmouth College as row 0, so Durham would be row 1). The column name is \"world rank by wur 2013\".\n\nWait, no\u2014the rows start from index 0. So let's recount:\n\n- Row 0: Dartmouth\n- Row 1: Durham\n- Row 2: Queens\n- Row 3: Otago\n- Row 4: T\u00fcbingen\n- Row 5: Western Australia\n\nSo, the relevant cell is row index 1 under the column \"world rank by wur 2013\".\n\nI think that's all. So the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cell being row 1 and that specific column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"university of western australia do better, overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what needs to be verified here. The claim is making two points:\n\n1. University of Western Australia (UWA) performs better overall than Durham University.\n2. This performance is despite UWA being established later than Durham.\n\nSo, I need to check both parts using the data from the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row contains information about a university, including their country, year established, and world ranks by three different organizations: WUR (World University Rankings), ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), and QS. The relevant columns for this claim are \"year established\" and the various rank columns.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the rows for each university. Durham University is in row 1, and University of Western Australia is in row 5. \n\nChecking their years of establishment:\n- Durham: Established in 1832\n- UWA: Established in 1911\n\nSo, UWA was indeed established later than Durham, which supports the \"despite it's late date\" part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to compare their overall performance. The table provides three different rankings for each university. To determine \"overall better,\" we should consider all these rankings or find a way to evaluate which university is ranked higher across these metrics.\n\nLooking at the ranks:\n- Durham University has WUR rank 80th, ARWU in 201-300th, and QS rank 90th.\n- UWA has WUR rank 168th, ARWU 91st, and QS 134th.\n\nNow, comparing these:\n- For WUR, Durham is higher (80 vs. 168).\n- For ARWU, UWA is significantly better (91st vs. 201-300th for Durham). \n- For QS, Durham is slightly better (90 vs. 134).\n\nSo, UWA is better in one ranking and worse in two others compared to Durham.\n\nBut the claim says that overall, UWA does better despite being established later. The term \"overall\" can be subjective here. However, considering the ARWU rank is a major point for UWA\u2014it's much higher than Durham's\u2014this might give more weight to their performance. But it's not clear if one ranking should carry more importance.\n\nAlternatively, we could look at average rankings or consider that being better in two out of three might indicate an overall advantage. However, since in ARWU UWA is significantly better but worse in WUR and QS, it's a bit mixed.\n\nMoreover, considering the claim mentions \"despite its late date,\" which refers to the year established. Since UWA was indeed founded later (1911 vs. 1832), this part checks out.\n\nBut does being established later mean that UWA's better performance is more impressive? That depends on how we interpret it. The claim suggests that despite being newer, UWA is doing better overall. However, from the rankings, UWA isn't better in all categories; they are worse in WUR and QS compared to Durham.\n\nTherefore, whether \"overall\" considers multiple factors or not, it's arguable. If \"overall\" means performing better across more metrics, then perhaps it could be considered as such since ARWU is a strong ranking for UWA. However, if considering the average position, UWA has higher ranks (worse) in WUR and QS than Durham.\n\nIn conclusion, while UWA was established later, their overall performance isn't clearly better across all metrics. Therefore, the claim might not be fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the University of Western Australia (UWA) performs better overall than Durham University despite being established later. \n\n- **Year Established**: UWA (1911) is indeed later than Durham (1832), supporting the second part of the claim.\n- **Performance Comparison**:\n  - WUR: Durham (80th) > UWA (168th)\n  - ARWU: UWA (91st) > Durham (201-300th)\n  - QS: Durham (90th) > UWA (134th)\n\nSince UWA is better in one ranking but worse in two, the overall claim isn't fully supported. \n\n**Answer**: FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" Hmm, okay, first off, there might be a typo here\u2014probably meant \"Queen University\" instead of \"queen university,\" but I think it's referring to Queen's University from the table. Let me check the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two universities: Dartmouth College and Queens University (I assume that's Queen's). The three categories mentioned are world ranks by WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013.\n\nSo, for each of these three ranking systems, I need to compare the positions of Dartmouth and Queens. If Queens did worse (i.e., has a higher numerical rank) in all three categories compared to Dartmouth, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me look at the relevant cells:\n\n1. **WUR 2013:**\n   - Dartmouth College: 126th\n   - Queens University: 226-250th\n   Here, Dartmouth is better because 126 is lower than 226.\n\n2. **ARWU 2013:**\n   - Dartmouth: 151-200th\n   - Queens: 201-300th\n   Again, Dartmouth is better since 151-200 is higher than 201-300.\n\n3. **QS 2013:**\n   - Dartmouth: 113th\n   - Queens: 189th\n   Dartmouth is better here too because 113 is less than 189.\n\nSince in all three categories, Dartmouth College has a better rank (lower numerical value) than Queen's University, the claim that Queen's hasn't done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories is TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm capturing the right rows and columns.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the University of T\u00fcbingen is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"give how it have a great headstart, university of t\u00fcbingen, germany have not do as well as the other university, overall.\" So, I'm interpreting this to mean that despite having an earlier establishment (a great headstart), the University of T\u00fcbingen hasn't performed as well as others in terms of world rankings.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant rows and columns would be those that show when each university was established and their respective world ranks. Let me list out the universities with their year established and their ranks from different sources (WUR, ARWU, QS).\n\n1. Dartmouth College: Established in 1769\n   - WUR: 126th\n   - ARWU: 151-200th\n   - QS: 113th\n\n2. Durham University: 1832\n   - WUR: 80th\n   - ARWU: 201-300th\n   - QS: 90th\n\n3. Queens University: 1841\n   - WUR: 226-250th\n   - ARWU: 201-300th\n   - QS: 189th\n\n4. University of Otago: 1869\n   - WUR: 226-250th\n   - ARWU: 201-300th\n   - QS: 155th\n\n5. University of T\u00fcbingen: 1477 (earliest)\n   - WUR: 201-225th\n   - ARWU: 151-200th\n   - QS: 144th\n\n6. University of Western Australia: 1911\n   - WUR: 168th\n   - ARWU: 91st (which is quite high)\n   - QS: 134th\n\nNow, the claim mentions that despite a great headstart (which would be having been established earlier), T\u00fcbingen hasn't done as well overall.\n\nLooking at establishment years, T\u00fcbingen is the earliest (1477). However, looking at their rankings:\n\n- In WUR, they are 201-225th. Compared to Dartmouth (126th) and Durham (80th), which were established later, T\u00fcbingen ranks lower in WUR.\n\nIn ARWU, T\u00fcbingen is 151-200th. Queens and Otago are also in the same range or lower. But Dartmouth is higher at 151-200th as well, but Durham is lower (201-300th). So in ARWU, T\u00fcbingen is around similar ranks to some others.\n\nIn QS, T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Dartmouth is 113th, which is better. Durham is 90th, much higher. Queens is 189th, lower than T\u00fcbingen. Otago is 155th, also lower. So in QS, T\u00fcbingen is better than some but not as high as Dartmouth and Durham.\n\nBut looking at the overall performance across all three rankings: T\u00fcbingen's best rank is ARWU at 151-200th and WUR at 201-225th. Meanwhile, universities established later like Dartmouth (1769) have higher ranks in QS and WUR.\n\nSpecifically, University of Western Australia was established in 1911 but has a high ARWU rank of 91st, which is better than T\u00fcbingen's 151-200th. So despite being much newer, UWA outperforms T\u00fcbingen significantly in the ARWU ranking.\n\nTherefore, based on these comparisons, it seems that even though T\u00fcbingen was established much earlier, its overall performance across rankings isn't as strong as some of the other universities, especially considering institutions like UWA which are much newer but have better ranks. So the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the  - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"dartmouth college have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and find the relevant information about Dartmouth College and University of T\u00fcbingen. Let me scan through the rows. \n\nI see Dartmouth College is in row 0. It has entries for world ranks from three sources: WUR, ARWU, and QS, all in 2013. The ranks are 126th, between 151-200th, and 113th respectively.\n\nNext, I need to find University of T\u00fcbingen. That's row 4. Its world ranks are 201-225th by WUR, 151-200th by ARWU, and 144th by QS.\n\nThe claim is about whether Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. So I need to compare their rankings across all three sources.\n\nLooking at the first rank (WUR): Dartmouth is 126th, while T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. So in WUR, Dartmouth is definitely higher.\n\nIn ARWU: Dartmouth is 151-200th, and T\u00fcbingen is also 151-200th. That's a tie or same range.\n\nQS: Dartmouth is 113th, T\u00fcbingen is 144th. So again, Dartmouth is higher here as well.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. But in WUR and QS, Dartmouth is higher. That would mean the claim isn't true because there are instances where Dartmouth is higher.\n\nSo the claim is false because Dartmouth College did rank higher than University of T\u00fcbingen in at least two ranking systems. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to note which cells were relevant for this determination. For Dartmouth, that's row 0, columns 'world rank by the - wur , 2013', 'world rank by arwu , 2013', and 'world rank by qs , 2013'.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"university of western australia do better in all ranking than durham university despite its late date of establishment.\" So, I need to check each ranking for both universities and see if Western Australia does better in all cases.\n\nFirst, let's identify where each university is located in the table. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Durham University is in row 1.\n- University of Western Australia is in row 5.\n\nNow, checking their ranks across the three ranking systems: wur (world rank by the - wur, 2013), arwu (world rank by arwu, 2013), and qs (world rank by qs, 2013).\n\nFor Durham University:\n- wur: 80th\n- arwu: 201 - 300th\n- qs: 90th\n\nFor University of Western Australia:\n- wur: 168th\n- arwu: 91st\n- qs: 134th\n\nNow, comparing each ranking:\n\n1. WUR (world rank by the - wur, 2013):\n   - Durham is 80th.\n   - Western Australia is 168th.\n   So, Durham is better here.\n\n2. ARWU (world rank by arwu, 2013):\n   - Durham: 201-300th\n   - Western Australia: 91st\n   Here, Western Australia is better because 91st is higher than 201-300th.\n\n3. QS (world rank by qs, 2013):\n   - Durham is 90th.\n   - Western Australia is 134th.\n   So, Durham is better here again.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says that Western Australia does better in all rankings than Durham. But according to this comparison, Western Australia only does better in ARWU and worse in WUR and QS. Therefore, the claim isn't true because they don't outperform in all three rankings.\n\nAdditionally, checking the establishment years:\n- Durham was established in 1832.\n- Western Australia in 1911, which is later. But since the claim mentions that despite being established later, their performance is better across all rankings, but as we saw, they aren't better in all.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Western Australia does not have a better rank than Durham University in all three ranking systems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim states: \"queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the three categories are. Looking at the table headers, there are four ranking columns: world rank by WUR (World University Rankings), ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), and QS (Quacquarelli Symonds). So, these are the three rankings we're comparing.\n\nNext, I'll locate the rows for Queen's University and Dartmouth College. From the table:\n\n- Queen's University is in row 2: country Canada, year established 1841.\n- Dartmouth College is in row 0: country USA, year established 1769.\n\nNow, let's compare their ranks in each category:\n\n1. **WUR (World University Rankings):**\n   - Queen's: 226 - 250th\n   - Dartmouth: 126th\n\n   Here, Dartmouth is ranked higher than Queen's since 126th is better than 226-250th.\n\n2. **ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities):**\n   - Queen's: 201 - 300th\n   - Dartmouth: 151 - 200th\n\n   Again, Dartmouth is ranked higher because 151-200th is better than 201-300th.\n\n3. **QS (Quacquarelli Symonds):**\n   - Queen's: 189th\n   - Dartmouth: 113th\n\n   Dartmouth still holds a higher rank here as well, since 113th is better than 189th.\n\nSince Dartmouth College has a better ranking in all three categories compared to Queen's University, the claim that Queen's did better in all three is false. \n\nI'll note the relevant cells for each comparison:\n- For WUR: row 2 and 0, column 'world rank by the - wur , 2013'.\n- For ARWU: same rows but 'world rank by arwu , 2013'.\n- For QS: same rows under 'world rank by qs , 2013'.\n\nSo, all three comparisons are needed to confirm that Queen's didn't outperform Dartmouth in any category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "durham university have the second - best rank , ie , 80th , in the world rank by - wur 2013 category",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Durham University's rank is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"Durham University have the second-best rank, ie 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" Okay, so they're claiming that Durham is ranked 80th according to WUR's 2013 ranking. But wait, the term \"second-best\" suggests it's the second position, but the number given is 80th, which seems conflicting. That might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each university has multiple rankings from different sources: WUR, ARWU, and QS for the year 2013. The columns in question are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" which is the third column after 'country' and 'year established'.\n\nI'll locate Durham University in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find that Durham University is in row index 1 (since counting starts at 0). The relevant columns are: members, country, year established, wur rank, arwu rank, qs rank.\n\nFor Durham University, under the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" column, the value is listed as '80th'. So according to the table, their WUR rank is indeed 80th. However, the claim mentions it's the second-best, which I think might be a mistake because 80th isn't second place but rather a position much lower.\n\nWait, perhaps \"second-best\" was a misinterpretation. Let me check if there are any universities ranked higher than 80th in the WUR column. Looking at all the entries:\n\n- Dartmouth College: 126th\n- Durham University: 80th\n- Queens University: 226-250th\n- University of Otago: 226-250th\n- University of T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n- University of Western Australia: 168th\n\nSo Durham's rank is the highest (i.e., best) among these, but it's 80th. Is there a university in this table with a better WUR rank than 80? Yes, for example, if any other university has a lower numerical rank (like 79th or higher), then Durham would not be the second-best. But looking at all entries, Durham is the highest-ranked here. So perhaps the claim refers to it being in the top 100, but \"second-best\" might be misleading.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion comes from how ranks are presented. If \"best\" means the highest rank (lower number), then 80th isn't second; it's just a specific position. So perhaps the claim is mixing up terminology. But regardless of that, the table clearly shows Durham University as 80th in WUR 2013.\n\nSo the claim states two things: that their rank is 80th and that it's the second-best. From the data, the 80th part is correct. However, if \"second-best\" implies they are in the second position globally, which they aren't, then the claim has an inconsistency. But perhaps the user intended to say that within this specific subset of universities listed, Durham has the best rank (which it does). \n\nBut regardless of that interpretation, the main fact is whether the table supports the numerical rank. Since Durham's wur rank is 80th as per the table, the claim's first part is accurate. The second part about \"second-best\" might be a misstatement because globally, 80th isn't second, but perhaps within this table, it's the best among these listed.\n\nWait, actually, looking at all the WUR ranks:\n\n- Durham: 80th\n- Dartmouth: 126th\n- Queens: 226-250th\n- Otago: same as Queens\n- T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n- Western Australia: 168th\n\nSo within this table, Durham has the highest (best) WUR rank at 80th. So if someone says it's second-best in this category among these universities, that would be incorrect because it's actually the best. But perhaps the claim is referring to a different context outside of this table.\n\nBut sticking strictly to the data provided, the wur rank for Durham is indeed 80th. The claim mentions \"second-best\" which might not align with the table if considering all possible universities globally, but since we only have this subset, it's unclear. However, the numerical value matches, so the main assertion about the rank being 80th is true.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the row for Durham University and the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Durham University is ranked 80th in the WUR 2013 category is accurate as per the table data. \n\n```json\n{\n    \"rank\": \"80th\",\n    \"university\": \"Durham University\"\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe relevant information confirming the rank of Durham University is extracted below.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"world_rank_by_WUR_2013\": \"80th\",\n    \"institution\": \"Durham University\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany have rank the worst in every single ranking.\" \n\nFirst, I'll locate University of T\u00fcbingen in the table. Looking through the rows, I find it's at row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0). \n\nNext, I check each relevant column for this university to see its rankings:\n- **World rank by the - wur, 2013**: 201-225th\n- **World rank by arwu, 2013**: 151-200th\n- **World rank by qs, 2013**: 144th\n\nI'll compare these ranks with those of other universities in the same columns to see if T\u00fcbingen is indeed the worst. \n\nLooking at the wur rankings:\n- Dartmouth: 126th\n- Durham: 80th\n- Queens: 226-250th\n- Otago: 226-250th\n- T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n- UWA: 168th\n\nT\u00fcbingen's wur rank is better than Queens and Otago but worse than Dartmouth, Durham, and UWA.
