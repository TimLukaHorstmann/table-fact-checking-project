Let me find his row in the table. Scanning through the ranks, I see Kyle Beckerman is ranked 3rd. The relevant columns here are 'player', 'nation', and 'goals'. For Kyle, under 'goals' it says 21.

Looking at the table, row index 8 has \"fabi\u00e1n esp\u00edndola\" in the player column.\n- Checking the nation for this row: it says \"arg\", which stands for Argentina. So that part matches.\n- The years for Fabian are listed as \"2007 - 2012\". The claim mentions exactly those years, so that's correct.\n\nNext, Javier Moralez:\n- The claim refers to \"javier morale\" but in the table, it's spelled as \"javier morales\". I need to confirm if this is a typo or if it's the same person. Given that the last name in the table ends with 'es', it might be a slight misspelling, so I'll proceed.\n- The nation for Javier Moralez (row index 5) is also \"arg\", confirming he's from Argentina as per the claim.\n- His years are listed as \"2007 - present\", which matches the claim.\n\nSo both players are indeed from Argentina and their respective year ranges are correct.

The task is to determine if the claim about three players having the same years of \"2007 - present\" is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the table and identify the relevant rows for each player mentioned in the claim. The players are Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Javier Moralez.\n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman: Looking at the table, he's ranked 3rd. His years are listed as \"2007 - present.\" That matches the claim exactly. So, I note that down as a relevant cell for row 2 (since counting starts from 0) under the 'years' column.\n\nNext up is Chris Wingert: He's in rank 4. Checking his years, it also says \"2007 - present.\" That's another match. This means row 3 and the 'years' column are relevant here as well.\n\nNow for Javier Moralez: His rank is 6th. Looking at his years, it's stated as \"2007 - present.\" So that's a third match. I'll add row 5 (again, counting from zero) under the 'years' column to my list of relevant cells.\n\nWait a minute, did I get all three players correctly? Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything or misread their years. \n\nKyle Beckerman: Correct, \"2007 - present.\" Chris Wingert: Also correct. Javier Moralez: Yep, same as the others.\n\nSo, all three players have the exact same years listed in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"player ned grabavoy from the usa have 8 goal while player tony beltran have 0 goal.\" So, it's making two statements about these players\u2014Ned Grabavoy and Tony Beltran\u2014and their respective number of goals.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table to find information about these players. The table has columns: rank, player, nation, caps, goals, years.\n\nI'll start with Ned Grabavoy. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see his name in row 8 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or one-indexed? Wait, the first row after the header is row 1, so let me count: row 8 would be the ninth entry if starting from 1, but looking at the HTML, each <tr> inside tbody starts at index 0 in programming terms. But perhaps it's better to look for the exact names.\n\nLooking through the players:\n\nRow indices (as per HTML structure):\n- Row 0: Nick Rimando\n- Row 1: Andy Williams\n- Row 2: Kyle Beckerman\n- Row 3: Chris Wingert\n- Row 4: Nat Borchers\n- Row 5: Javier Morales\n- Row 6: Tony Beltran\n- Row 7: Ned Grabavoy\n- Row 8: Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola\n- Row 9: Robbie Findley\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the HTML provided, each <tr> within tbody is a row. So the first player (Nick Rimando) is in the first data row, which would be index 0 if we consider zero-based indexing.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 7 is Ned Grabavoy because counting from 0:\n- Row 0: Nick\n- Row 1: Andy\n- ...\n- Row 7: Ned\n- Row 8: Fabian\n- Row 9: Robbie\n\nWait, no, looking at the HTML, each <tr> in tbody is a row. So let me count:\n\nRow 0: Nick Rimando\nRow 1: Andy Williams\nRow 2: Kyle Beckerman\nRow 3: Chris Wingert\nRow 4: Nat Borchers\nRow 5: Javier Morales\nRow 6: Tony Beltran\nRow 7: Ned Grabavoy\nRow 8: Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola\nRow 9: Robbie Findley\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, Ned Grabavoy is in row 7.\n\nNow, checking the 'goals' column for Ned Grabavoy:\n\nIn row 7 (Ned), the goals are listed as 8. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking Tony Beltran. He's in row 6.\n\nLooking at the 'goals' column in row 6: it says 0, which also matches the claim.\n\nAdditionally, both players are from the USA, which is correct according to their respective nation columns.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that Ned Grabavoy has 8 goals and Tony Beltran has 0 goals as per the table data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:** The claim mentions two players\u2014Ned Grabavoy and Tony Beltran.\n2. **Locate in Table:**\n   - Ned Grabavoy is found in row 7 (assuming zero-based index), with goals listed as 8.\n   - Tony Beltran is found in row 6, with goals listed as 0.\n3. **Verify Goal Counts:** Both goal counts match the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has a column named \"nation\" which indicates the country of each player.\n\nStarting with Nick Rimando. Looking at row 0 (since tables usually start indexing at 0), under the 'player' column, it's him. The 'nation' is listed as 'usa'. So, according to the table, he is from the USA. That already contradicts the claim which says he's not.\n\nNext, Kyle Beckerman is in row 2. His nation is also 'usa', so again, this supports that he is from the USA, conflicting with the claim.\n\nChris Wingert is in row 3. His nation is 'usa' as well, meaning he's American, which doesn't align with the claim stating he isn't.\n\nLastly, Nat Borchers is in row 4, and his nation is listed as 'usa'.

Therefore, both players are actually from the USA, which contradicts the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, regarding the goals:\n\nFor Kyle Beckerman: The claim says he has more than 21 goals. However, the table shows exactly 21 goals. So this is not true either since \"more than\" implies over 21, and here it's exactly 21.\n\nNat Borchers is said to have only 4 goals in the claim.

For Tony Beltran, it's his row (index 6) and the \"goals\" column as well.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players in Claim:**\n   - Ned Grabavoy\n   - Tony Beltran\n\n2. **Locate Data for Each Player:**\n   - **Ned Grabavoy:** Row index 7, Goals = 8\n   - **Tony Beltran:** Row index 6, Goals = 0\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim Statements:**\n   - Ned has less than 8 goals? \u2192 No (He has exactly 8)\n   - Tony has 5 goals? \u2192 No (He has 0)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Both statements in the claim are incorrect, so the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"kyle beckerman , chris wingert  , and javier morale have different year.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions three players: Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Javier Morale (I think it's a typo for Morales). The claim is about their years being different.\n\nLooking at the table, each player has a \"years\" column that shows when they were active. My task is to check if these three players have different years listed.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one.\n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman: His row in the table (row index 2) says his years are from 2007 to present. So he's been playing since 2007 up until now.\n\nNext, Chris Wingert: He's on row index 3. His years are also listed as 2007 - present. That's the same as Kyle Beckerman.\n\nThen, Javier Morale (assuming that's a typo for Morales): Looking at row index 5, his years are from 2007 to present as well. So he shares the same time period with both Kyle and Chris.\n\nWait, but all three have the exact same \"years\" value: \"2007 - present\". That means their years aren't different; they're actually the same.\n\nThe claim states that these three have different years, but according to the table, they all started in 2007 and are still active. So the claim is incorrect because their years are identical, not different.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check each relevant cell:\n\n- Kyle Beckerman: row 2, column \"years\" \u2192 2007 - present\n- Chris Wingert: row 3, column \"years\" \u2192 2007 - present\n- Javier Morales: row 5, column \"years\" \u2192 2007 - present\n\nAll three have the same value in the years column. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Javier Morales have different years. However, all three players share the same year range of \"2007 - present,\" indicating their years are not different.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
