    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an HTML table and a claim about the data in that table. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information presented.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. There are six rows of data corresponding to different schools.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"there be 2 school who have a location of greensburg\". So I need to check how many schools have their location listed as Greensburg.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Eastern Hancock**: Located in Charlottesville.\n2. **Indian Creek**: Located in Trafalgar.\n3. **Knightstown**: Located in Knightstown.\n4. **Milan**: Located in Milan.\n5. **North Decatur**: Located in Greensburg.\n6. **South Decatur**: Also located in Greensburg.\n\nFrom this, I can see that both North Decatur and South Decatur have their locations listed as Greensburg. That makes two schools meeting the condition specified in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to map these findings back to the table structure provided. The \"location\" column is one of the headers, so each school's location is in that column. Therefore, for both North Decatur and South Decatur, their respective rows under the \"location\" column are relevant.\n\nIn terms of row indices, assuming the first data row is index 0 (since HTML tables typically start counting from 0), the rows with Greensburg as the location would be:\n\n- North Decatur: Row index 4\n- South Decatur: Row index 5\n\nEach of these entries falls under the \"location\" column.\n\nTo summarize, I've identified two schools that meet the condition. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are in rows 4 and 5, specifically the \"location\" column for each.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** We need to verify if exactly two schools are located in Greensburg.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row's Location Column:**\n   - Eastern Hancock: Charlottesville\n   - Indian Creek: Trafalgar\n   - Knightstown: Knightstown\n   - Milan: Milan\n   - North Decatur: Greensburg\n   - South Decatur: Greensburg\n\n3. **Count Matches:** Two schools (North Decatur and South Decatur) have \"Greensburg\" as their location.\n\n4. **Determine Answer:** Since there are two schools, the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. **List Relevant Cells:** Extract rows 4 and 5 from the \"location\" column.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"there be more school whose primary conference be mid  - hoosier , than any other conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that there are more schools with the primary conference as 'mid-hoosier' compared to any other conference. So, essentially, we need to count how many schools are in the mid-hoosier conference and compare it to the number of schools in all other conferences.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant column for this claim is the \"primary conference\" column. Each row under this column indicates which conference the school belongs to. My plan is to go through each row, check the primary conference, count how many times 'mid-hoosier' appears, and then see if that number exceeds the counts of all other conferences combined.\n\nLet's examine each row one by one:\n\n1. **Eastern Hancock**: Primary conference is 'mid-hoosier'. Count this as 1.\n2. **Indian Creek**: Also 'mid-hoosier'. Now count is 2.\n3. **Knightstown**: Again, 'mid-hoosier'. Count increases to 3.\n4. **Milan**: The primary conference here is 'ohio river valley'. This is a different conference, so I'll note that as another category but not increase the mid-hoosier count.\n5. **North Decatur**: Back to 'mid-hoosier', bringing the count up to 4.\n6. **South Decatur**: Also in 'mid-hoosier', making the total 5.\n\nNow, let's look at the other conference mentioned: 'ohio river valley' with just one school (Milan). \n\nSo, we have:\n- Mid-Hoosier Conference: 5 schools\n- Ohio River Valley Conference: 1 school\n\nSince 5 is more than 1, the mid-hoosier conference indeed has more schools than any other conference listed in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other conferences besides these two. Looking through all the rows, only 'mid-hoosier' and 'ohio river valley' are mentioned. There's no mention of a third conference. Therefore, mid-hoosier is the dominant one with the highest number of schools.\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed anything, I'll recount:\n\n- Eastern Hancock: mid-hoosier (1)\n- Indian Creek: mid-hoosier (2)\n- Knightstown: mid-hoosier (3)\n- North Decatur: mid-hoosier (4)\n- South Decatur: mid-hoosier (5)\n- Milan: ohio river valley (1)\n\nYes, that's correct. No other conferences are present, so the claim holds true.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary steps. The relevant cells are each row's \"primary conference\" to check which conference they belong to and count accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because five schools are in the mid-hoosier conference, while only one school is in another conference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, I need to look at the 'enrollment' column for each school and find out which one has the maximum value.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's an HTML table with several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference.

South Decatur: 316\n\nNow, comparing these numbers:\n\n- The highest enrollment is 598 (Indian Creek).\n- Next is 417 (Milan), followed by two schools with 397 each.\n- Then 348 and the lowest at 316.\n\nSo, Indian Creek indeed has the highest enrollment of 598 students.

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"north decatur have an enrollment that be 81 student higher than south decatur\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. The claim revolves around the 'enrollment' numbers for two specific schools: north decatur and south decatur.\n\nI need to find the rows corresponding to these two schools.

To verify this, I'll subtract south decatur's enrollment from north decatur's: 397 - 316 = 81. This calculation matches the claim exactly.\n\nSince the numbers support the statement, the claim is TRUE.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Indian Creek is one of three schools located in Greensburg. So, I need to check how many schools are listed as being in Greensburg and see if Indian Creek is among them.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"location\". The rows will be checked for the location Greensburg and then count how many schools are there.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Eastern Hancock - Located in Charlottesville. Not Greensburg.\n2. Indian Creek - Located in Trafalgar. Hmm, that's not Greensburg either. Wait a minute, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The location for Indian Creek is Trafalgar. So, it's not in Greensburg.\n3. Knightstown - Location is Knightstown. Not Greensburg.\n4. Milan - Located in Milan. No match here.\n5. North Decatur - Located in Greensburg. Okay, this one counts.\n6. South Decatur - Also located in Greensburg.\n\nSo, looking at the table, only North Decatur and South Decatur are listed as being in Greensburg. That makes two schools, not three. Indian Creek is in Trafalgar, so it's not part of the Greensburg schools according to this data.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something? Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Eastern Hancock - Charlottlestown\n- Row 1: Indian Creek - Trafalgar\n- Row 2: Knightstown - Knightstown\n- Row 3: Milan - Milan\n- Row 4: North Decatur - Greensburg\n- Row 5: South Decatur - Greensburg\n\nYes, only rows 4 and 5 are in Greensburg. So that's two schools, not three. Therefore, the claim is false because there aren't three schools listed as being in Greensburg, let alone Indian Creek being one of them.\n\nI think I got it right.

So my task is to check each row in the table and see if their 'primary conference' matches this value.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"indian creek have the least enrollment of all the school\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It states that Indian Creek has the lowest enrollment among all the listed schools. To verify this, I should look at the 'enrollment' column for each row and compare them.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, primary conference.\n- There are six rows: Eastern Hancock, Indian Creek, Knightstown, Milan, North Decatur, South Decatur.\n\nI'll go through each school's enrollment:\n\n1. **Eastern Hancock**: Enrollment is 348.\n2. **Indian Creek**: Enrollment is 598.\n3. **Knightstown**: Enrollment is 397.\n4. **Milan**: Enrollment is 417.\n5. **North Decatur**: Enrollment is 397.\n6. **South Decatur**: Enrollment is 316.\n\nNow, comparing all these numbers: 348, 598, 397, 417, 397, 316. The smallest number here is 316 (South Decatur). Indian Creek has 598, which is actually the highest enrollment in this list.\n\nSo, the claim that Indian Creek has the least enrollment is incorrect because South Decatur has fewer students enrolled.\n\nTo support my conclusion, I need to note the relevant cells:\n- For each school, their enrollment numbers are important. So, for all rows (indexes 0 through 5), the 'enrollment' column needs to be considered.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Indian Creek does not have the least enrollment; South Decatur has fewer students.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
