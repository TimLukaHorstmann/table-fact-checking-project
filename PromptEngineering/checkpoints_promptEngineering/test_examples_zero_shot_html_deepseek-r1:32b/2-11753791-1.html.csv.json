    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that for any team that has exactly 3 losses, they also have 0 ties. So I need to check each team in the table and see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's an HTML table with columns: team, games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for, goals against. Each row represents a different team's statistics.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all teams and their corresponding loss and tie counts:\n\n1. Montreal Hockey Club:\n   - Losses: 3\n   - Ties: 0\n\n2. Ottawa Hockey Club:\n   - Losses: 3\n   - Ties: 0\n\n3. Montreal Victorias:\n   - Losses: 3\n   - Ties: 0\n\n4. Quebec Hockey Club:\n   - Losses: 3\n   - Ties: 0\n\n5. Montreal Crystals:\n   - Losses: 8 (so not relevant since we're looking for teams with exactly 3 losses)\n\nSo, all teams except Montreal Crystals have exactly 3 losses. Now, checking the ties column for these four teams, each has 0 ties.\n\nTherefore, every team with 3 losses indeed has 0 ties. There are no exceptions in this case.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this would be the 'losses' and 'ties' columns for all rows except the last one (since it's the only one with a different number of losses). So I'll note each row index from 0 to 3, both for their 'losses' and 'ties'.\n\nSo compiling the relevant cells:\n\nFor each team from row 0 to 3:\n- Losses: \"losses\" column\n- Ties: \"ties\" column\n\nThat makes four rows (indices 0,1,2,3) each contributing two cells. However, since all these teams meet the condition without any exceptions, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because every team with exactly 3 losses has 0 ties.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
