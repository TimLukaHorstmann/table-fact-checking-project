    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"in karachi, mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 437 run\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components:\n\n1. **Location**: Karachi\n2. **Battling Partners**: Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera\n3. **Runs Scored**: 437\n\nNow, I need to check each of these elements against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: wicket, runs, battling partners, battling team, fielding team, venue, and season. There are 10 rows of data.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Karachi\" in the venue column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Chittagong\n- Row 1: Colombo\n- Row 2: Colombo\n- Row 3: Karachi\n- Rows 4 to 9: Other venues\n\nSo, the only relevant row is row 3 where the venue is Karachi.\n\nNext, I'll check the battling partners in this row. The cell says \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera,\" which matches exactly with the claim. So that's a match.\n\nNow, checking the runs column for this row: it shows 437, which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I can verify other details to ensure consistency:\n\n- **Battling Team**: Sri Lanka\n- **Fielding Team**: Pakistan\n- **Season**: 2008 / 09\n\nAll these details fit within the context provided by the table and don't contradict the claim. There's no conflicting information that would suggest the runs were different or the partners weren't as stated.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows where Mahela Jayawardene is involved, but looking through them:\n\n- Row 2: He's partnered with Kumar Sangakkara in Colombo.\n- Rows 5 and 6: Also involve him, but in Ahmedabad and Colombo respectively, not Karachi.\n\nThus, row 3 is the only one that matches all parts of the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, every part of the claim is accurately represented in the table. The venue is correct, the partners are correctly listed, and the runs scored match. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 195 run together, in karachi\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two players: Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera. They supposedly scored 195 runs together at a venue called Karachi. So I need to check each part of this statement against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows indexed from 0 to 9 (since it's zero-based). Each row contains information about a specific wicket, runs, batting partners, teams, venue, and season. My task is to find if there's a row where both Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera are the batting partners, they scored 195 runs, and the venue was Karachi.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row for the batting partners column. Let me go one by one:\n\n- Row 0: gc smith and neil mckenzie. Not our guys.\n- Row 1: roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuriya. Nope.\n- Row 2: mahela jayawardene and kumar sangakkara. Close, but not Thilan Samaraweera.\n- Row 3: mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera. Wait, that's exactly the pair we're looking for! So let me check the other details in this row.\n\nIn row 3:\n- Runs: 437\n- Venue: Karachi\n\nBut wait, the claim says they scored 195 runs together in Karachi. According to row 3, the runs are 437, not 195. So that's a discrepancy. \n\nLet me check if there's another occurrence of this pair elsewhere. Continuing through the table:\n\n- Row 4: donald bradman and sid barnes. No.\n- Row 5: mahela jayawardene and prasanna jayawardene. Different partner.\n- Rows 6 to 9 don't have both names mentioned together.\n\nSo, Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera are only listed once as batting partners in row 3. However, the runs there are 437, not 195, and the venue is Karachi. The claim states 195 runs, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if another row mentions 195 runs. Let me look through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: 415\n- Row 1: 576\n- Row 2: 624\n- Row 3: 437\n- Row 4: 405\n- Row 5: 351\n- Row 6: 347\n- Row 7: 332\n- Row 8: 195\n- Row 9: 163\n\nAh, row 8 has runs equal to 195. Let me check who the batting partners are in that row. It says \"pat symcox and mark boucher.\" So they scored 195 runs together at venue Nottingham.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n- The pair Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera scored 437 runs in Karachi (row 3).\n- The 195 runs were by a different pair in Nottingham (row 8).\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly attributes 195 runs to the wrong pair and wrong venue. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 3: batting partners, runs, venue.\n- Row 8: runs and batting partners where 195 is mentioned.\n\nBut since the question asks for the cells that support or refute the claim, focusing on row 3 because it's the only occurrence of the specific pair. The 195 in row 8 doesn't involve them but shows that 195 exists elsewhere.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"batting partners\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"in 1997, roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuira do not battle\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and comparing it against the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that in the year 1997, Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya did not battle. So, I need to check if these two players were batting partners in any match during 1997 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different wicket with details like runs, batting partners, teams, venue, and season. The relevant columns for this claim are 'season' and 'battling partners'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Season is 2008. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Season is 1997. The batting partners here are Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya. So, in 1997, they did battle together as per this row. That seems to contradict the claim that they do not battle in 1997.\n- Rows 3 to 10: Seasons after 1997 or different years, so they don't affect this specific claim.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"do not battle\" in 1997. But according to row 2, they did bat together that year. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's evidence in the table showing they were batting partners in 1997.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row 2, specifically the 'battling partners' and 'season' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the table shows Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya as batting partners in 1997.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
