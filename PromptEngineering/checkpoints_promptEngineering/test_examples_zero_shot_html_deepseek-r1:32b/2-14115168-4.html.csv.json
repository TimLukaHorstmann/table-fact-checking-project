    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and check each part of the claim against it. The table has columns for school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded year. So, the relevant information here is about the mascots and their respective conferences.\n\nThe first part of the claim mentions the Bellevue Bruins. I'll search the table for \"bellevue bruins\" under the mascot column. Looking through the rows, the first row has \"bellevue university\" as the school and \"bellevue bruins\" as the mascot. The conference listed there is \"midlands.\" So, that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim talks about the York Panthers. I'll search for \"york panthers\" in the mascot column. Scanning down, the last row has \"york college\" with the mascot \"york panthers,\" and their conference is also listed as \"midlands.\" So both mascots are indeed in the midland conference.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says \"midland conference,\" but in the table, it's written as \"midlands.\" Is that a typo? Or maybe \"midlands\" refers to the Midlands conference. I think sometimes names can have slight variations or plural forms, so \"midlands\" might be correct. Since both teams are listed under the same conference name \"midlands,\" which is close enough to midland, it's safe to assume they're in the same conference.\n\nSo, both Bellevue Bruins and York Panthers play in the Midlands conference as per the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both the Bellevue Bruins and the York Panthers are part of the Midland Conference. Checking the table:\n\n- Bellevue University (Bellevue Bruins) is in the 'midlands' conference at row index 0.\n- York College (York Panthers) is also in the 'midlands' conference at row index 8.\n\nSince both mascots are listed under the 'midlands' conference, which aligns with the claim's reference to the midland conference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"accord to date of founding, peru state college be the oldest\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's trying to say that according to the founding dates in the table, Peru State College is the oldest institution.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the \"founded\" column in the table because the claim is about the founding date. The relevant cells are in the \"founded\" column for each school.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University: Founded in 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: Founded in 1923\n3. Concordia University: Founded in 1894\n4. Doane College: Founded in 1872\n5. Hastings College: Founded in 1882\n6. Midland University: Founded in 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: Founded in 1887\n8. Peru State College: Founded in 1865\n9. York College: Founded in 1890\n\nNow, I'll compare the founding years to find out which is the oldest. The earliest year listed here is 1865 for Peru State College. Let's check if any other school has an earlier date than that. Scanning through the founded column again:\n\n- The next earliest after 1865 is Doane College in 1872, followed by Concordia University in 1894, and so on.\n\nSo Peru State College was indeed founded in 1865, which is earlier than all other entries. Therefore, the claim that Peru State College is the oldest according to the founding dates is correct.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"founded\" column for each school to compare their founding years. Specifically, I need to note the row index and column name for each of these comparisons.\n\nRow indices start at 0, so:\n\n- Bellevue University: Row 0\n- College of Saint Mary: Row 1\n- Concordia University: Row 2\n- Doane College: Row 3\n- Hastings College: Row 4\n- Midland University: Row 5\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: Row 6\n- Peru State College: Row 7\n- York College: Row 8\n\nEach of these rows has a \"founded\" column value that I checked to determine the oldest. Therefore, each row's \"founded\" cell is relevant because it contributes to identifying the earliest founding year.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE since Peru State College was founded in 1865, which is the earliest among all listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Peru State College is the oldest based on the founding dates. By examining each school's \"founded\" year, we find that Peru State College was established in 1865, which is earlier than all other entries. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"with a total of 0, the lowest number of national titles belongs to the college of saint mary.\" So, I'm looking for two things here: whether College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles and if that is indeed the lowest among all schools listed.\n\nLooking at the table, there are nine rows. Each row represents a different school with details about their mascot, conference, number of national titles, and founding year. The columns I need to focus on are \"school\" and \"national titles.\"\n\nI'll start by finding the row for College of Saint Mary. Scanning through the schools, I see it's in the second row (row index 1). In that row, under the \"national titles\" column, the value is 0. So, College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is the lowest number across all schools. Let me go through each school:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles.\n3. Concordia University: 1 title.\n4. Doane College: 10 titles.\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles.\n6. Midland University: 2 titles.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles.\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles.\n9. York College: 28 titles.\n\nLooking at all the \"national titles\" values, the numbers are 14, 0, 1, 10, 3, 2, 19, 2, 28. The smallest number here is 0, which belongs to College of Saint Mary. \n\nTherefore, the claim that College of Saint Mary has the lowest number of national titles with a total of 0 is correct.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 1 (College of Saint Mary) under \"national titles\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"only 1 school, york college, have win more than 20 title.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's stating that York College is the only school with over 20 national titles.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school and includes details like mascot, conference, number of national titles, etc. The key column here is \"national titles\" because it directly relates to the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check the number of national titles:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles \u2013 not more than 20.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles \u2013 way below.\n3. Concordia University: 1 title \u2013 nope.\n4. Doane College: 10 titles \u2013 still under 20.\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles \u2013 definitely not over 20.\n6. Midland University: 2 titles \u2013 also below.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles \u2013 oh, that's just one less than 20. So, still doesn't meet the claim's threshold of more than 20.\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles \u2013 no.\n9. York College: 28 titles \u2013 yes, this is over 20.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says that only York has more than 20. But looking at Nebraska Wesleyan University, they have 19, which is close but not over 20. So, does any other school besides York have more than 20? Let me double-check all the numbers again to be sure.\n\nBellevue: 14 \u2013 no.\nSaint Mary: 0 \u2013 no.\nConcordia: 1 \u2013 no.\nDoane:10 \u2013 no.\nHastings:3 \u2013 no.\nMidland:2 \u2013 no.\nNebraska Wesleyan:19 \u2013 close, but not over.\nPeru State:2 \u2013 no.\nYork:28 \u2013 yes.\n\nSo, only York College has more than 20 national titles. The claim is correct in stating that York is the sole school with over 20 titles. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI need to list the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. Each row's \"national titles\" column is relevant because it directly verifies whether a school meets the threshold of more than 20. Additionally, since the claim specifically mentions York College, their corresponding cell in the \"school\" column should also be included.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all rows' \"national titles\" and the specific row for York's \"school\" name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It claims that Bellevue University is the youngest school in terms of its founding date. So, I need to find out which school was founded most recently because a younger school would have been founded later.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'founded' column which indicates the year each school was established. The schools and their founding years are:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary - 1923\n3. Concordia University - 1894\n4. Doane College - 1872\n5. Hastings College - 1882\n6. Midland University - 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887\n8. Peru State College - 1865\n9. York College - 1890\n\nNow, I'll list the founding years to identify the youngest (most recent) one:\n\n- 1865 (Peru State College)\n- 1872 (Doane College)\n- 1882 (Hastings College)\n- 1883 (Midland University)\n- 1887 (Nebraska Wesleyan University)\n- 1890 (York College)\n- 1894 (Concordia University)\n- 1923 (College of Saint Mary)\n- 1966 (Bellevue University)\n\nLooking at these, 1966 is the most recent founding year. So, Bellevue University was founded in 1966, which makes it the youngest school among those listed.\n\nI should also check if any other school has a later founding date than 1966. Scanning through all the 'founded' years confirms that none are after 1966. Therefore, Bellevue University is indeed the youngest.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are all the rows under the 'founded' column because we need to compare each school's founding year to determine which is the most recent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bellevue University is the youngest school based on its founding date.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that Peru State College was the last institution founded in the 19th century among those listed in the table. To verify this, I need to check the founding years of all institutions and see if Peru State College has the latest (i.e., closest to 1900) year within the 1800s.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists a school along with its founding year under the \"founded\" column. My plan is to go through each institution's founding year and identify which ones were founded in the 19th century (i.e., between 1801 and 1900). Then, among these, I'll find out which one was founded last, meaning it has the highest year.\n\nLet me list out all the schools and their founding years:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: 1923\n3. Concordia University: 1894\n4. Doane College: 1872\n5. Hastings College: 1882\n6. Midland University: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n8. Peru State College: 1865\n9. York College: 1890\n\nNow, focusing only on the 19th century (1801-1900), I'll exclude any institutions founded in or after 1901:\n\n1. Concordia University: 1894\n2. Doane College: 1872\n3. Hastings College: 1882\n4. Midland University: 1883\n5. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n6. Peru State College: 1865\n7. York College: 1890\n\nWait, I should also include Bellevue University and College of Saint Mary if their founding years fall within the 19th century. But looking at their years:\n\n- Bellevue University was founded in 1966, which is well into the 20th century.\n- College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923, also 20th century.\n\nSo they're out of consideration for this claim since we're only focusing on institutions founded in the 19th century.\n\nNow, among the remaining schools:\n\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nTo find the last institution founded in the 19th century, I need to identify which of these has the highest founding year. Let's list them in order:\n\n1865 (Peru), 1872 (Doane), 1882 (Hastings), 1883 (Midland), 1887 (Nebraska Wesleyan), 1890 (York), 1894 (Concordia).\n\nFrom this, Concordia University was founded in 1894, which is the latest among all. Therefore, it would be the last institution founded in the 19th century.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check if I missed any institutions or made an error in the years. \n\nLooking back:\n\n- Peru State: 1865\n- Doane: 1872\n- Hastings: 1882\n- Midland: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan: 1887\n- York: 1890\n- Concordia: 1894\n\nYes, that's correct. So the latest is Concordia in 1894.\n\nThe claim says Peru State College was the last one. But according to this, it's actually Concordia University. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because another institution (Concordia) was founded later than Peru State within the 19th century.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for this conclusion:\n\nI need to list all the rows where the founding year falls in the 19th century and identify their \"founded\" column. So that's rows 2 (Concordia), 3 (Doane), 4 (Hastings), 5 (Midland), 6 (Nebraska Wesleyan), 7 (Peru State), and 8 (York). Each of these has the \"founded\" year in their respective cells.\n\nWait, but according to the initial table structure, let me confirm the row indices:\n\nLooking back at the HTML table provided, each <tr> corresponds to a row. The first data row is Bellevue University, which would be index 0 if starting from 0. But perhaps in programming terms, they might start counting from 1. However, since the user didn't specify, but in typical programming contexts, it's zero-based.\n\nWait, actually, for clarity, let me map each school to their row index as per HTML structure:\n\n- Index 0: Bellevue University (founded 1966)\n- Index 1: College of Saint Mary (1923)\n- Index 2: Concordia University (1894)\n- Index 3: Doane College (1872)\n- Index 4: Hastings College (1882)\n- Index 5: Midland University (1883)\n- Index 6: Nebraska Wesleyan University (1887)\n- Index 7: Peru State College (1865)\n- Index 8: York College (1890)\n\nSo the relevant rows for 19th century are indices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these has their \"founded\" column.\n\nThus, when responding to the user, I should list all these row indices along with the \"founded\" column as they were necessary in determining that Concordia University was founded later than Peru State College within the 19th century.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. Among the institutions listed, Concordia University was founded in 1894, which is later than Peru State College's founding year of 1865. Therefore, Concordia University was the last institution founded in the 19th century.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row 2 (Concordia University): Founded in 1894\n- Row 3 (Doane College): Founded in 1872\n- Row 4 (Hastings College): Founded in 1882\n- Row 5 (Midland University): Founded in 1883\n- Row 6 (Nebraska Wesleyan University): Founded in 1887\n- Row 7 (Peru State College): Founded in 1865\n- Row 8 (York College): Founded in 1890\n\nEach of these rows under the \"founded\" column was examined to determine the latest founding year within the 19th century.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"only 2 school, york college and peru state college, have won more than 20 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. Looking at the HTML, it's a table with columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The key information for verifying the claim will be in the \"school\" and \"national titles\" columns.\n\nThe claim states that only York College and Peru State College have more than 20 national titles each. So I should look at each row's \"national titles\" value to see which schools meet this criterion.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles. That's less than 20, so it doesn't count.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles. Definitely not relevant here.\n3. Concordia University: 1 title. Still below 20.\n4. Doane College: 10 titles. Also under 20.\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles. Nope.\n6. Midland University: 2 titles. Still less than 20.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles. Close, but not more than 20.\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles here? Wait, that's what the table says. But the claim mentions Peru State having won more than 20 times. That contradicts the data. \n9. York College: 28 titles. This is above 20.\n\nWait a minute, I thought Peru State had 2, but according to the claim, they should have over 20. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking back at Peru State's row: \"national titles\" column says 2. So that doesn't fit the claim. But the claim includes them as having more than 20.\n\nMeanwhile, York College has 28 national titles, which is indeed more than 20. However, the claim mentions only two schools, but according to the table, only York College meets the condition of having more than 20 national titles. Peru State has only 2, so it shouldn't be included.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it includes Peru State when they don't meet the criteria, and there's only one school (York) with over 20 titles. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the college of saint mary hold the highest number of national titles\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. So the relevant information here is in the \"school\" and \"national titles\" columns.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"college of saint mary.\" I need to find their row in the table. Scanning through the schools listed:\n\n- Bellevue University\n- College of Saint Mary\n- Concordia University\n- Doane College\n- Hastings College\n- Midland University\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University\n- Peru State College\n- York College\n\nOkay, college of saint mary is the second row (index 1). Now, looking at their national titles: it's 0. That seems low compared to other schools.\n\nNext step is to check the \"national titles\" column for all rows to see if any have a higher number than 0. Let me go through each:\n\n- Bellevue University: 14\n- College of Saint Mary: 0\n- Concordia University: 1\n- Doane College: 10\n- Hastings College: 3\n- Midland University: 2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19\n- Peru State College: 2\n- York College: 28\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest is 28 held by York College. So college of saint mary has 0, which is definitely not the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they hold the highest number is FALSE. The relevant cells are the ones in row 1 under \"national titles\" because that's where their count is shown. Additionally, to confirm it's the lowest or not the highest, I should note the maximum value elsewhere, which is in York College's cell (row index 8).\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE as the college of saint mary has 0 national titles, while others have higher numbers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"bellevue university be the first college found in the 20th century.\" I need to verify if this statement is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which columns are relevant for checking this claim. The key points here are the founding year of Bellevue University and whether it was indeed the first college established in the 20th century among the listed schools.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row contains information about a school, including when it was founded (the 'founded' column). So, I need to check the founding years for all colleges and specifically look at Bellevue University's year.\n\nBellevue University is in the first row. According to the table, it was founded in 1966. Now, considering the 20th century spans from 1901 to 2000, so any founding year within that range would qualify as a 20th-century college.\n\nNext, I'll check the founding years of all other colleges in the table to determine if Bellevue University is indeed the first one established in the 20th century. Here are the schools and their founding years:\n\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894 (This is actually late 19th century, so it doesn't count for the 20th century)\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nWait, I just realized that the 'College of Saint Mary' was founded in 1923, which is within the 20th century. So if we're looking for the first college established in the 20th century among these, the earliest founding year would be the one with the smallest number after 1900.\n\nLooking back, the colleges founded in the 20th century in this table are:\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n\nBetween these two, 1923 is earlier than 1966. Therefore, College of Saint Mary was established before Bellevue University.\n\nSo, if the claim says that Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century among these schools, that's not accurate because there's another school (College of Saint Mary) with an earlier founding year within the same century.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century. However, upon examining the table, it's evident that College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923, which is before Bellevue University's founding year of 1966. Thus, Bellevue isn't the first.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}",
