    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"rob thomas write the song , credit where credit 's due.\" I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems to say that Rob Thomas wrote a song named \"Credit Where Credit's Due.\" So, my task is to check if in the table there's an entry where the song title matches \"credit where credit 's due\" and the writer is listed as Rob Thomas.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like Title, Director, Writer(s), etc. Each row represents a specific episode or work with details filled under these columns.\n\nI'll start by searching through each row to find if any of them have \"credit where credit 's due\" as the title. Scanning down the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Title is \"pilot\"\n- Row 1: Title is \"credit where credit 's due\"\n  \nAh, here it is. The second row (index 1) has the title matching exactly what's in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check who wrote this episode or song. In column C of the table, which is labeled as Writer(s), Row 1 lists \"rob thomas.\" So, Rob Thomas is indeed listed as the writer for that entry.\n\nWait a second. The claim says \"write\" while the table uses \"Writer(s).\" Are these equivalent? Yes, in this context, both refer to the person who wrote the content, whether it's a song or an episode script. So, the verb tense doesn't affect the meaning here; both indicate authorship.\n\nTherefore, since the title matches and Rob Thomas is listed as the writer for that title, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n\nTo summarize my findings:\n\n- Relevant Cells:\n  - Row Index 1, Column Name: Title (to confirm the song's name)\n  - Row Index 1, Column Name: Writer(s) (to verify Rob Thomas as the author)\n\nBoth pieces of information are present and align with the claim. Hence, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rob Thomas wrote the song \"Credit Where Credit's Due.\" By examining row 1 of the table, we find the title matches exactly and lists Rob Thomas as the writer.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Writer(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"in only 1 case be there 2.76 million us viewer\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that there is exactly one instance where the number of US viewers is 2.76 million. To verify this, I'll look at each row in the table and check the 'US Viewers (million)' column for any entries matching 2.76.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: 1.89 million\n- Row 1: 1.54 million\n- Row 2: 2.76 million \u2192 This matches.\n- Rows 3 to 20: The values are all different, none matching exactly 2.76.\n\nI found that only one row (row index 2) has a US viewers count of 2.76 million.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"nick marck directed the title with the production code 2t5710\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: It states that Nick Marck directed a specific episode identified by the production code 2t5710. So, I need to check two things in the table:\n1. Does an entry with production code 2t5710 exist?\n2. For that entry, is the director column filled with Nick Marck?\n\nLooking through the table, each row has a Production Code and Director column.\n\nI'll start by searching for the production code 2t5710. Scanning down the Production Code column:\n- Row 3: 2t5704\n- Row 4: 2t5705\n...\nWait, I'm not seeing 2t5710 immediately. Let me go through each row systematically.\n\nRow 0: Production Code is 2t5700. Not matching.\nRow 1: 2t5701.\nRow 2: 2t5702.\nRow 3: 2t5704.\nRow 4: 2t5705.\nRow 5: 2t5706.\nRow 6: 2t5707.\nRow 7: 2t5708.\nRow 8: 2t5709.\nRow 9: 2t5710. Ah, here it is.\n\nNow, looking at Row 9 (index starts at 0), Production Code is 2t5710. The Director for this row is Diane Ruggiero. So Nick Marck isn't listed as the director here.\n\nWait a second, maybe I missed another row with 2t5710? Let me double-check. Scanning from top to bottom again:\nRow 9: 2t5710\nNo other rows have this code. Therefore, only one entry for 2t5710 exists.\n\nSince the director is Diane Ruggiero and not Nick Marck, the claim isn't supported by the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out step by step. The claim is about the episode \"Like a Virgin\" having more than 2.76 million US viewers. So I need to check if the table supports this claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row that corresponds to the episode titled \"Like a Virgin.\" Scanning down the rows, I see that at row index 10 (since we start counting from 0), there's an entry for \"like a virgin.\" The columns include things like Episode Name and US Viewers.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant column, which is \"US Viewer\" (assuming this refers to the number of viewers). For that specific episode, the value under \"US Viewer\" is listed as 2.76 million. \n\nThe claim states that it has more than 2.76 million viewers. But according to the table, it's exactly 2.76 million. So does that mean it's equal or not more? The wording says \"more than,\" so technically, it doesn't exceed\u2014it just meets that number.\n\nTherefore, since the episode didn't have a viewer count higher than 2.76 million, the claim isn't fully supported. It only matches exactly, which doesn't satisfy \"more than.\"\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the answer should be FALSE because the viewers are exactly 2.76 million, not more.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"US Viewer\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"guy bee direct the production code 2t5710\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main components: who directed (Guy Bee) and which production code (2T5710). So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the Director is Guy Bee and the Production Code is 2T5710.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode or some kind of production with various details. The columns are: No., Title, Directed by, Written by, Original air date, Prod. code, US viewers (million).\n\nSo I need to check two things for each row:\n1. Does \"Directed by\" say \"Guy Bee\"?\n2. Does the \"Prod. code\" column have \"2T5710\"?\n\nLet me go through the rows one by one.\n\nRow 0: Title is \"You're Welcome, Dormouse\", Directed by is Nick Marck, Prod. code is 2t5701. Not matching.\nRow 1: Title is \"P.S., I Love You...\", Directed by is John Kretchmer, Prod. code is 2t5702. No match.\nRow 2: Title is \"Bait and Switch\", Directed by is Steve Gomer, Prod. code is 2t5703. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Title is \"The Bait's Me...\", Directed by is Michael Fields, Prod. code 2t5704. No.\nRow 4: Title is \"I Am So Smart\", Directed by is John Kretchmer again, Prod. code 2t5705. Still no match.\nRow 5: Title is \"No Place Like Veronica's\", Directed by is Nick Marck, Prod. code 2t5706. Not it.\nRow 6: Title is \"The Betty\", Directed by is Michael Fields, Prod. code 2t5707. No.\nRow 7: Title is \"Chop 'em Down\", Directed by is John Enbom, Prod. code 2t5708. Doesn't fit.\nRow 8: Title is \"The Big Trip\", Directed by is Steve Gomer, Prod. code 2t5709. Close to the target code but not exactly 2t5710 yet.\n\nWait, row 8's production code is 2t5709, which is just before 2t5710. Let me continue checking further rows.\n\nRow 9: Title is \"I Never Promised You a Perfect Season\", Directed by is Nick Marck, Prod. code 2t5710. Oh, here we go! The production code matches the claim. Now, who directed this? It says Nick Marck, not Guy Bee. So even though the production code is correct, the director isn't Guy Bee.\n\nContinuing further to see if any other row has Prod. code 2t5710 with Guy Bee as director:\nRow 10: Title is \"The One with the Cat\", Directed by is John Kretchmer, Prod. code 2t5711.\nRow 11: Title is \"The Boyfriend\", Directed by is Michael Fields, Prod. code 2t5712.\nRow 12: Title is \"Kanes and Abel's\", Directed by is Nick Marck again, Prod. code 2t5713? Wait no, looking back, I think row indices might have skipped some numbers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the rows in the table start at No. 1 up to No. 20, but when presented, they seem to be listed from index 0 (No. 1) up. So row 8 is No.9, row 9 is No.10, etc.\n\nLooking back, row 8 has production code 2t5709, and row 9 has 2t5710 with Nick Marck directing. Then row 14 (No.15) has Prod. code 2t5714 directed by Guy Bee. So that's a different production code.\n\nWait, so the claim is about production code 2t5710 being directed by Guy Bee. From what I see, production code 2t5710 is in row 9 (No.10) and was directed by Nick Marck. There's no other instance of Prod. code 2t5710 in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Guy Bee directed the production code 2t5710\" isn't correct because it was actually directed by Nick Marck.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. Production code 2T5710 was directed by Nick Marck, not Guy Bee.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Identify the target production code: 2T5710.\n2. Locate the row with Prod. code 2T5710 in the table. It's found in row 9 (No.10).\n3. Check who directed that episode. The director is listed as Nick Marck, not Guy Bee.\n4. Conclude that the claim is false since the actual director doesn't match.\n\nAnswer: False\n\nThe production code 2T5710 was directed by Nick Marck, not Guy Bee. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer**\n\nTo verify the claim \"Guy Bee directed the production code 2T5710,\" we examine each row of the table:\n\n1. **Locate Production Code 2T5710:**\n   - Found in row corresponding to No. 10 (Title: \"I Never Promised You a Perfect Season\").\n\n2. **Check Director for That Row:**\n   - Directed by Nick Marck.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the director is Nick Marck, not Guy Bee, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false. Production code 2T5710 was directed by Nick Marck.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to evaluate the claim: \"the production of the title with 2.76 million viewer be 2t5707\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, it's a list of TV show episodes or possibly movie titles with various details like Episode No., Title, Director, Writer(s), Air Date, Production Code (Prod. Code), and Viewer(s) in millions.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: \n1. A title that has 2.76 million viewers.\n2. The production code being \"2t5707\".\n\nI'll need to check if these two pieces of information correspond correctly within the table.\n\nStarting with the number of viewers, I'll scan through the \"Viewer(s) (million)\" column for any value matching exactly 2.76 million. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: 3.04 million\n- Row 2: 2.97 million\n- Row 3: 2.78 million\n- Row 4: 2.34 million\n- Row 5: 2.33 million\n- Row 6: 2.78 million\n- Row 7: 2.30 million\n- Row 8: 2.48 million\n- Row 9: 3.04 million\n- And so on for other rows.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted the rows because in the provided table, some rows are missing (like row 14 is skipped). Let me recount properly.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow indexes from 1 to 20, but in the given data, it seems that row indices are not explicitly numbered. Alternatively, perhaps each <tr> represents a row, so I'll index them starting at 0 for easier reference.\n\nWait no, looking back, the table is presented with rows and columns, so each <tr> corresponds to a row, and within each <tr>, there are <td>s representing each column's data. The claim refers to \"2t5707\", which I can see in the Prod. Code column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Title is \"You're Welcome, Vietnam\", Viewer(s) is 3.04 million\n- Row 1: Title is \"The Day of the Locusts\", Viewer(s) is 2.97 million\n- Row 2: Title is \"Kanes and Abel's\", Viewer(s) is 2.78 million\nWait, no, that's row index 13? Let me check.\n\nActually, looking at the table structure, each row has data like:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>...</td>\n   <td>...</td>\n   ...\n</tr>\n\nEach of these represents a row in the table. So starting from row index 0 to maybe 20 or so.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the user provided an HTML snippet, but in reality, each row is within <tr>, and each cell is within <td>. The first row after the header (thead) starts with Episode No., which is 1. Then it goes up to Episode No. 20.\n\nSo, for clarity, let me list out the relevant data:\n\nEpisode No. | Title                     | ... | Viewer(s) (million) | Prod. Code\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1          | You're Welcome...         |     | 3.04                | 2T5701\n2          | The Day of the Locusts    |     | 2.97                | 2T5702\n...\nLooking through each, I need to find where Viewer(s) is exactly 2.76 million.\n\nWait, in the table provided, let's look for 2.76 million viewers. Scanning down:\n\n- Row with Episode No. 13: Title \"Lord of the Bling\", Viewers 2.97 million.\n- Then Episode No. 15: Title \"Ruskie Business\", Viewers 2.34 million.\nWait, that's lower.\n\nHold on, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nLooking at each Viewer(s) value:\nRow with Prod. Code 2T5707 is the one we need to check. So first, find which row has Prod. Code \"2t5707\".\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Episode No.1: 2T5701\n- Episode No.2: 2T5702\n- Episode No.3: 2T5703\n...\nContinuing:\nLooking at each Prod. Code, I need to find where it's \"2t5707\".\n\nIn the table, let's check:\n\nRow index (assuming starting from 1) for the rows provided:\n\nRow with Title \"Kanes and Abel's\" has Prod. Code 2T5706.\nNext row: Title \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", Prod. Code 2T5707.\n\nSo, that row is:\n\nTitle: The Last Temptation of Christ\nViewer(s): Looking at the data, for that row, what's the Viewer count?\n\nLooking back to the table structure, each row has Episode No., Title, Director, Writer(s), Air Date, Prod. Code, and Viewer(s). So in the row where Prod. Code is 2T5707, let me check the Viewer(s) column.\n\nIn that specific row, Viewer(s) is listed as \"3.04\". Wait, no\u2014let me double-check:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting because of missing rows or confusion in the HTML structure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that the claim says 2.76 million viewers for Prod. Code 2t5707.\n\nLooking again: Is there any row where Viewer(s) is exactly 2.76 million?\n\nGoing through each Viewer(s):\n\n- 3.04\n- 2.97\n- 2.78\n- 2.34\n- 2.33\n- 2.78\n- 2.30\n- 2.48\n- 3.04\n\nWait, I don't see a row with exactly 2.76 million viewers in the provided data. The closest is 2.78 million for two different episodes.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the title corresponding to Prod. Code 2t5707 has 2.76 million viewers doesn't align with the table, because that Prod. Code's Viewer count is 3.04 million, and there's no entry with exactly 2.76 million.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error in associating the Prod. Code with the Viewer count. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row where Prod. Code is 2T5707: Title \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", Air Date Aug 23, 1988, Viewer(s) is 3.04 million.\nNo other rows have 2t5707; that's unique.\n\nSo the claim says \"the title with 2.76 million viewers has production code 2t5707\". But in reality, the title with Prod. Code 2t5707 has 3.04 million viewers, and there is no title with exactly 2.76 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the production of the title with 2.76 million viewers corresponds to production code \"2T5707\" is **incorrect** based on the provided data.\n\n- The production code \"2T5707\" corresponds to the episode titled \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" which has 3.04 million viewers.\n- There is no entry in the table with exactly 2.76 million viewers.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**False**\n\nThe title associated with production code 2T5707 does not have 2.76 million viewers; it has 3.04 million viewers.",

It seems like there are some typos or grammatical issues here. \"be\" might mean \"is equal to.\" So, rephrasing: \"1 is the total number of production codes where US viewers are 3.04.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense because 3.04 doesn't seem like a count but perhaps a rating or some numerical value.\n\nLooking at the table columns: Production Code and US Viewers. The US Viewers column has values like 2.97, 3.04, etc. So, the claim is probably asking how many production codes have a US Viewer rating of exactly 3.04, and if that count is 1.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find where US Viewers equals 3.04.\n\nRow 20: US Viewers is 3.04.

So:\n\nRow 0: Rank 1\nRow 1: Rank 2\nRow 2: Rank 3\n\nSo \"no 3\" would correspond to Row 2 (Rank 3).\n\nLooking at Row 2, the Writer(s) column says Rob Thomas &amp; John Enbom.
