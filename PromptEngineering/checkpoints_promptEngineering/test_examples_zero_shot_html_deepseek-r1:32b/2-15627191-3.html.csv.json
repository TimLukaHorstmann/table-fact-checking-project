The recipient is Dylan Sprouse and the result is \"won\". So that's a win in 2010.\n\n- Row 8: For 2011 Kids' Choice Awards, same category, Favorite TV Actor. Recipient is Dylan Sprouse and the result is \"won\" again. \n\nSo both years, Dylan won in that category. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 3 has Dylan's win in 2010, so the columns are year (2010), award (Kids' Choice), category (Favorite TV Actor), recipient (Dylan), and result (won).\n\n- Similarly, row 8 for 2011.\n\nSo relevant cells would be the rows where Dylan won in both years, specifically looking at year, award, category, recipient, and result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"recipient\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"recipient\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"both the 2010 and 2011 kids' choice award nominate cole sprouse for the favorite tv actor category.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Year 2010**: Check if Cole Sprouse was nominated in the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards under \"favorite tv actor.\"\n2. **Year 2011**: Similarly, check for a nomination in the same category.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: year, award, category, recipient, result.\n- Each row represents an award entry with specific details.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries related to the Kids' Choice Awards and \"favorite tv actor\" category.\n\nStarting with 2010:\n- Rows 1 and 2 fall under the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards.\n   - Row 1: Favorite TV Show, recipient is \"the suite life on deck,\" result is nominated.

The claim says: \"Neither the 2010 nor the 2011 kids' choice award nominate cole sprouse for the favorite tv actor category.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It's saying that in both 2010 and 2011 Kids' Choice Awards, Cole Sprouse wasn't nominated for \"Favorite TV Actor.\" So I need to check each year (2010 and 2011) under the \"Kids' Choice Awards\" category, specifically looking at the \"favorite tv actor\" category.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor 2010:\n- There are two entries under \"2010 kids' choice awards.\"\n  - One is for \"favorite tv show,\" but that's not relevant.\n  - The other two rows are both in the \"favorite tv actor\" category. One has recipient Cole Sprouse and result 'nominated', and another with Dylan Sprouse who won.\n\nSo, in 2010, Cole was nominated.\n\nFor 2011:\n- Similarly, there's an entry for \"2011 kids' choice awards.\"\n  - Under \"favorite tv actor,\" both Cole and Dylan are listed. Cole is 'nominated', Dylan 'won'.\n\nTherefore, in both years, Cole Sprouse was nominated for Favorite TV Actor at the Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nThe claim says that neither year had him nominated, which contradicts what's in the table.
