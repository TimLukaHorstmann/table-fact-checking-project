    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Between May 20 and August 12 of the 2006 season, the Philadelphia Barrage win 10 games.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check the dates in the table to see if they fall within this timeframe. The earliest date is May 20, which matches exactly, and the latest is August 12, also matching. So all rows are relevant.\n\nNext, I need to count how many wins the Barrage had during this period. Looking at each row's 'result' column:\n\n- Row 0: W 12-11 \u2192 Win\n- Row 1: W 18-6 \u2192 Win\n- Row 2: W 16-15 \u2192 Win\n- Row 3: W 13-12 OT \u2192 Win\n- Row 4: W 13-12 \u2192 Win\n- Row 5: L 15-16 \u2192 Loss\n- Row 6: L 5-16 \u2192 Loss\n- Row 7: W 17-7 \u2192 Win\n- Row 8: W 10-8 \u2192 Win\n- Row 9: W 22-11 \u2192 Win\n- Row 10: W 18-13 \u2192 Win\n- Row 11: W 20-12 \u2192 Win\n\nCounting the wins: rows 0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11 are wins. That's 10 wins in total.\n\nThe claim mentions \"win 10 games,\" which aligns with what I've counted. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the philadelphia barrage lose 1 home game and 1 away game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions that Philadelphia Barrage lost one game at home and one game away.\n\nFirst, I should check each row in the table to see if there are any losses (denoted as 'l') for both home and away games. The team in question isn't explicitly named in the table, but from the context of the claim, it's referring to Philadelphia Barrage. However, looking at the table, the opponent column lists teams like Rattlers, Riptide, Pride, Machine, Lizards, Cannons, Bayhawks, etc. So I assume that each row represents a game where the team (presumably Philadelphia) played against these opponents.\n\nNow, let's go through each row to count the losses at home and away:\n\n1. May 20: Opponent Rattlers, Home, Result W 12-11 \u2192 Win, so no loss.\n2. May 27: Opponent Riptide, Home, Result W 18-6 \u2192 Win.\n3. June 3: Opponent Pride, Home, Result W 16-15 \u2192 Win.\n4. June 10: Opponent Machine, Away, Result W 13-12 OT \u2192 Win.\n5. June 17: Opponent Lizards, Away, Result W 13-12 \u2192 Win.\n6. June 24: Opponent Cannons, Away, Result L 15-16 \u2192 Loss (Away). So that's one away loss.\n7. June 29: Opponent Cannons, Home, Result L 5-16 \u2192 Loss (Home). That's one home loss.\n8. July 8: Opponent Pride, Away, Result W 17-7 \u2192 Win.\n9. July 20: Opponent Lizards, Home, Result W 10-8 \u2192 Win.\n10. July 27: Opponent Bayhawks, Home, Result W 22-11 \u2192 Win.\n11. August 5: Opponent Rattlers, Away, Result W 18-13 \u2192 Win.\n12. August 12: Opponent Bayhawks, Away, Result W 20-12 \u2192 Win.\n\nSo looking at the results, there are two losses in total:\n- One home loss on June 29 against Cannons (row index 6).\n- One away loss on June 24 against Cannons (row index 5).\n\nSince both a home and an away loss exist exactly once each, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the 'result' column for these two rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the philadelphia barrage play the rattler 1 time more than they play the riptide.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the opponent column in the table to count how many times each team played against the Rattlers and the Riptide.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- On May 20, the opponent is Rattlers (row index 0).\n- On May 27, the opponent is Riptide (row index 1).\n- June 3: Opponent is Pride.\n- June 10: Machine.\n- June 17: Lizards.\n- June 24: Cannons.\n- June 29: Cannons again.\n- July 8: Pride.\n- July 20: Lizards.\n- July 27: Bayhawks.\n- August 5: Rattlers (row index 10).\n- August 12: Bayhawks.\n\nSo, counting the opponents:\n- Rattlers appear twice (rows 0 and 10).\n- Riptide appears once (row 1).\n\nThe claim says they play Rattlers one time more than Riptide. Since Rattlers are played twice and Riptide once, that's exactly one more time. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the largest margin of victory for the Philadelphia Barrage be 12 points\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions that the largest margin of victory (difference between the team's score and their opponent's score) was 12 points. So, my task is to go through each game in the table, calculate the point difference for each win, and see if 12 points is indeed the largest.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: date, opponent, home/away, field, result. The 'result' column shows the score as \"w\" or \"l\" followed by two numbers separated by a dash. I need to extract these numbers for each row where the result is a win (\"w\") because margins of victory only apply to wins.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **May 20 vs Rattlers**: Result is \"w 12-11\". The margin here is 1 (12-11). I note this as a possible candidate.\n2. **May 27 vs Riptide**: Result is \"w 18-6\". Margin is 12 points. This is higher than the previous one.\n3. **June 3 vs Pride**: Result is \"w 16-15\". Margin is 1 point.\n4. **June 10 vs Machine**: Result is \"w 13-12 OT\". The margin is 1, even though it went into overtime.\n5. **June 17 vs Lizards**: Result is \"w 13-12\". Again, a 1-point margin.\n6. **June 24 vs Cannons**: This was a loss (\"l 15-16\"), so I can ignore this as we're only looking at wins.\n7. **June 29 vs Cannons (home)**: Another loss (\"l 5-16\"). Ignore.\n8. **July 8 vs Pride (away)**: Result is \"w 17-7\". Margin here is 10 points, which is less than the previous highest of 12.\n9. **July 20 vs Lizards**: Result is \"w 10-8\". Margin is 2 points.\n10. **July 27 vs Bayhawks**: Result is \"w 22-11\". The margin here is 11 points, still less than 12.\n11. **August 5 vs Rattlers (away)**: Result is \"w 18-13\". Margin of 5 points.\n12. **August 12 vs Bayhawks (away)**: Result is \"w 20-12\". Margin is 8 points.\n\nAfter reviewing all the wins, I see that the largest margin was indeed 12 points in the game on May 27 against Riptide. The next highest margins were 11 and 10 points, which are both less than 12. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here about the Philadelphia Barrage's games in the 2006 season, and a claim that between May 20 and August 12, they won 8 games. I need to figure out if that's true or false.\n\nFirst off, I should look at the dates in the table. The earliest date is May 20, which fits the start of the period mentioned. The last game listed is on August 12, so that covers the end of the claim as well.\n\nNow, counting the wins. Each row in the table has a result column. I'll go through each one:\n\n1. May 20: Result is W 12-11 \u2192 That's a win.\n2. May 27: W 18-6 \u2192 Win again.\n3. June 3: W 16-15 \u2192 Another win.\n4. June 10: W 13-12 OT \u2192 Okay, that's an overtime win.\n5. June 17: W 13-12 \u2192 Yet another win.\n6. June 24: L 15-16 \u2192 Loss here, so not a win.\n7. June 29: L 5-16 \u2192 Another loss.\n8. July 8: W 17-7 \u2192 Win.\n9. July 20: W 10-8 \u2192 Win.\n10. July 27: W 22-11 \u2192 Win.\n11. August 5: W 18-13 \u2192 That's a win.\n12. August 12: W 20-12 \u2192 And another win.\n\nWait, let me recount the wins:\n\nFrom May 20 to August 12, I see 11 games in total because June 24 and June 29 are losses, so that's two losses within the period. So the number of wins would be 11 total games minus 2 losses = 9 wins? Hmm, but let me check each one again.\n\nWait no, actually, from May 20 to August 12, looking at all the rows:\n\n- May 20: Win\n- May 27: Win\n- June 3: Win\n- June 10: Win\n- June 17: Win\n- June 24: Loss\n- June 29: Loss\n- July 8: Win\n- July 20: Win\n- July 27: Win\n- August 5: Win\n- August 12: Win\n\nSo that's 10 wins and 2 losses. Wait, but the claim says 8 wins between May 20 and August 12. But according to this count, it's actually 10 wins.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\nRow indices from 0 (May 20) to 11 (August 12):\n\n- Row 0: Win\n- Row 1: Win\n- Row 2: Win\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 4: Win\n- Row 5: Loss\n- Row 6: Loss\n- Row 7: Win\n- Row 8: Win\n- Row 9: Win\n- Row 10: Win\n- Row 11: Win\n\nSo that's from row 0 to 11, which is 12 games. Out of these, rows 5 and 6 are losses (June 24 and June 29), so the wins are in rows 0-4,7-11 \u2192 that's 10 wins.\n\nWait, but the claim says they won 8 games between May 20 and August 12. But according to this, it's actually 10 wins. So why does the user think it's 8? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the period. The claim is \"between May 20 and August 12,\" but does that include both dates?\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- May 20: included\n- August 12: included\n\nSo yes, all games from May 20 through August 12 are considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me list each game's result:\n\n1. May 20 - Win (Row 0)\n2. May 27 - Win (Row 1)\n3. June 3 - Win (Row 2)\n4. June 10 - Win (Row 3)\n5. June 17 - Win (Row 4)\n6. June 24 - Loss (Row 5)\n7. June 29 - Loss (Row 6)\n8. July 8 - Win (Row 7)\n9. July 20 - Win (Row 8)\n10. July 27 - Win (Row 9)\n11. August 5 - Win (Row 10)\n12. August 12 - Win (Row 11)\n\nSo that's 10 wins and 2 losses within the period. Therefore, the claim says 8 wins, but according to this, it's actually 10 wins. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm including games after August 12? No, because August 12 is included in the table as row 11. So all games up to and including August 12 are considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the period is May 20 to August 12 exclusive? That would mean up to August 11. In that case, looking at the last date before August 12:\n\n- The game on August 5 is row 10: Win\n- Next is August 12: row 11: included or not?\n\nIf exclusive of August 12, then only up to August 5. So from May 20 to August 5:\n\nThat's rows 0 (May 20) to 10 (August 5).\n\nIn that case, how many wins? Let's count:\n\nRows 0-4: 5 wins\nRow 6: Loss (June 29)\nRow 7: Win (July 8)\nRow 8: Win (July 20)\nRow 9: Win (July 27)\nRow 10: Win (August 5)\n\nSo that's rows 0-4 (5 wins), row 7 (win), row 8 (win), row 9 (win), row 10 (win). Total of 5 + 4 = 9 wins. Still not matching the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting again. Let me list each win:\n\nRows with 'W' in result column within May 20 to August 12 inclusive:\n\nRow 0: W\nRow 1: W\nRow 2: W\nRow 3: W\nRow 4: W\nRow 5: L\nRow 6: L\nRow 7: W\nRow 8: W\nRow 9: W\nRow 10: W\nRow 11: W\n\nThat's rows 0-4 (5 wins), row 7 (win 6), row 8 (7), row 9 (8), row 10 (9), row 11 (10). So that's 10 wins.\n\nSo the claim says 8, but it's actually 10. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm including the August 12 game when the claim is up to August 12? Or maybe the user meant from May 20 to August 12, not including August 12?\n\nWait, looking back at the claim: \"between May 20 and August 12\". The word \"between\" can sometimes be ambiguous. Does it include both endpoints or just in between? If it includes both, then as per the table, there are 10 wins.

Each of these rows contributes to the count.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because they won more than 8 games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that between May 20 and August 12, the Philadelphia Barrage won 8 games.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the philadelphia barrage lose 2 home game and 3 away game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are date, opponent, home/away, field, and result. Each row represents a game with details about whether they were home or away and the result of that game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"philadelphia barrage,\" but looking through the opponents column, I don't see any mention of Philadelphia Barrage. All opponents listed are teams like Rattlers, Riptide, Pride, Machine, Lizards, Cannons, Bayhawks. So it seems like the team in question isn't explicitly named here; maybe they're the home team based on \"home\" entries.\n\nNext, I'll check for losses. The result column shows 'w' for wins and 'l' for losses. Let me count the number of losses when playing at home (home games) and away (away games).\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. May 20: Home vs Rattlers - Result is W, so no loss.\n2. May 27: Home vs Riptide - Result is W.\n3. June 3: Home vs Pride - Result is W.\n4. June 10: Away vs Machine - Result is W (they won in OT).\n5. June 17: Away vs Lizards - Result is W.\n6. June 24: Away vs Cannons - Result is L. So this is an away loss.\n7. June 29: Home vs Cannons - Result is L. This is a home loss.\n8. July 8: Away vs Pride - Result is W.\n9. July 20: Home vs Lizards - Result is W.\n10. July 27: Home vs Bayhawks - Result is W.\n11. August 5: Away vs Rattlers - Result is W.\n12. August 12: Away vs Bayhawks - Result is W.\n\nSo, counting the losses:\n\n- Home games with loss: Only June 29 (row index 6).\n- Away games with loss: Only June 24 (row index 5).\n\nThat means there's only 1 home loss and 1 away loss. The claim says they lost 2 home games and 3 away games, which doesn't match the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are the two losses found in the result column at row indices 5 and 6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the philadelphia barrage play the rattler 1 time more than they play the cannon\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It says that the Philadelphia Barrage plays the Rattlers one time more than they play the Cannons. So I need to count how many times each opponent (Rattlers and Cannons) appears in the \"opponent\" column of the table for the Philadelphia Barrage.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, all the rows are about different opponents. The team's name isn't explicitly stated here, but from context clues like \"home\" or \"away,\" it seems that this is the schedule of a particular team, probably the Philadelphia Barrage, since some fields are in Villanova Stadium which is near Philadelphia.\n\nSo, assuming each row represents a game played by the Philadelphia Barrage, I can count how many times they played against Rattlers and Cannons.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- May 20: Opponent Rattlers (row index 0)\n- June 24: Opponent Cannons (row index 5)\n- June 29: Opponent Cannons again (row index 6)\n- August 5: Opponent Rattlers again (row index 10)\n\nSo, counting the Rattlers games: May 20 and August 5 \u2013 that's two times.\nCounting the Cannons games: June 24 and June 29 \u2013 that's two times as well.\n\nWait, so both opponents are played twice. The claim says they play Rattlers one time more than Cannons. But according to my count, it's equal\u2014both played twice.\n\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Rattlers \u2013 yes.\nRow 5: Cannons\nRow 6: Cannons (so that's two for Cannons)\nRow 10: Rattlers (that's two for Rattlers)\n\nNo other rows mention Rattlers or Cannons. So total is two each.\n\nSo the claim says they play Rattlers one more time than Cannons, but in reality, it's the same number of games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that show this. The cells are from the \"opponent\" column where opponent is either Rattlers or Cannons.\n\nFor Rattlers:\n- Row 0: opponent\n- Row 10: opponent\n\nFor Cannons:\n- Row 5: opponent\n- Row 6: opponent\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row indices 0,5,6,10 with column name \"opponent\".\n\nWait, but let me confirm if there's any other mention of Rattlers or Cannons elsewhere. Scanning through all rows:\n\nRow 0: Rattlers\nRow 1: Riptide \u2013 not relevant\nRow 2: Pride\nRow3: Machine\nRow4:Lizards\nRow5:Cannons\nRow6:Cannons\nRow7:Cannons? No, row7 is Cannons on June 24 and again June 29.\nThen rows beyond that: Rattlers only in May and August.\n\nSo yes, the counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, with relevant cells as listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the philadelphia barrage score less points against the riptide than they do against the machine.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing the points scored by Philadelphia Barrage when playing against two different opponents: Riptide and Machine. Specifically, it claims that their score was lower (they scored fewer points) against the Riptide compared to when they played the Machine.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all the games where the opponent is either \"Riptide\" or \"Machine.\" Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. The first row has \"Rattlers\" as the opponent. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: Opponent is Riptide. Date May 27. They played at home on Villanova Stadium, result W 18-6. So, the Barrage scored 18 points here.\n3. Third row: Pride. Not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Machine. Away game at Sports Complex. Result W 13-12 OT. So, the Barrage scored 13 points.\n5. Fifth row: Lizards. Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: Cannons. Loss, so not needed for this claim.\n7. Seventh row: Cannons again, home loss.\n8. Eighth row: Pride away. Result W 17-7. But opponent isn't Riptide or Machine.\n9. Ninth row: Lizards at home, W 10-8. Not relevant.\n10. Tenth row: Bayhawks, not relevant.\n11. Eleventh row: August 5 vs Rattlers away, result W 18-13. Rattlers aren't in the claim.\n12. Twelfth row: August 12 vs Bayhawks away, W 20-12. Not relevant.\n\nSo, only two games are relevant here: against Riptide and Machine. Against Riptide, they scored 18 points (row index 1), and against Machine, they scored 13 points (row index 3). \n\nWait a minute, the claim says that they scored less against Riptide than against Machine. But according to these numbers, 18 is more than 13. So actually, they scored more points against Riptide than against Machine. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the largest margin of victory for the philadelphia barrage be 42 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the data it contains. The table has columns: date, opponent, home/away, field, result. Each row represents a game with details about when it was played, who they played against, whether it was home or away, where it was held, and the result of the game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the largest margin of victory\" for the Philadelphia Barrage being 42 points. So I need to find out if any of their games had a margin of 42 points.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. May 20: Result is w 12 - 11. The margin here is 1 point.\n2. May 27: Result is w 18 - 6. Margin is 12 points.\n3. June 3: Result is w 16 - 15. Margin is 1 point.\n4. June 10: Result is w 13 - 12 OT. That's a 1-point win in overtime.\n5. June 17: Result is w 13 - 12. Again, 1 point.\n6. June 24: They lost, so no margin of victory here.\n7. June 29: Lost again, so not relevant for largest margin.\n8. July 8: Won 17-7. Margin is 10 points.\n9. July 20: Won 10-8. Margin is 2 points.\n10. July 27: Won 22-11. That's an 11-point margin.\n11. August 5: Won 18-13, a 5-point margin.\n12. August 12: Won 20-12, which is an 8-point margin.\n\nSo the margins of victory in their wins are:\n\n- 1, 12, 1, 1, 1, 10, 2, 11, 5, 8.\n\nLooking for the largest among these. The highest I see is 12 points (on May 27) and then 11 on July 27. So the maximum margin is 12 points.\n\nThe claim says the largest margin was 42 points. That's way higher than what's in the table. There's no game where they won by even close to 42 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because none of their games had a margin of victory anywhere near 42 points. The relevant cells are all the result columns since each shows the score difference. So I'll list all the rows and highlight the 'result' column for each.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not show any game where the Philadelphia Barrage won by 42 points; their largest margin was 12 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
