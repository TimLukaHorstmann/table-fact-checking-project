    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. **No defensive end pick**: This means that in the entire table, there should not be any player with the position of defensive end.\n2. **An overall smaller than 2**: This implies that at least one player has an 'overall' value less than 2.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking for \"defensive end\" as a position. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1 (index 0): Position is linebacker.\n- Row 2 (index 1): Position is defensive end. Oh, so there's at least one player picked as a defensive end. That means the first condition of the claim isn't met.\n\nMoving to the second part: finding if any 'overall' value is less than 2. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0 has overall = 2.\n- All other rows have higher overall numbers (33, 60, etc.).\n\nSo, no player's overall pick is smaller than 2.\n\nSince the claim requires both conditions to be true simultaneously\u2014no defensive end and at least one overall less than 2\u2014but in reality, there is a defensive end pick (Tony Brackens) and no overall less than 2. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported; it's FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for checking would be:\n\n- For \"defensive end\": row index 1 under 'position'.\n- For 'overall' < 2: all rows under 'overall', but particularly looking at row 0 where overall is exactly 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}",
