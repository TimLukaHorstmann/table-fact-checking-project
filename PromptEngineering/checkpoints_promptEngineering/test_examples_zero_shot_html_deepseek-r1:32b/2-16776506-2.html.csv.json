    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"mirielle dittmann be the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n1. Opponent's name is mirielle dittmann.\n2. The match was on a hard surface.\n3. The date was 6 February 2000.\n4. The location was Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table to see if they align with any row in the data.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Winner on 2 May 1999 in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Surface is hard, opponent is Candice Jairala. The date and location don't match, so this isn't relevant.\n\nRow 1: Winner on 11 July 1999 in Felixstowe, England. Surface is grass. Again, doesn't fit the claim's details.\n\nRow 2: Runner-up on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand. Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann. The surface here is hard. This seems to match all parts of the claim except that the outcome was runner-up instead of a win. But the claim doesn't specify if it's a win or loss, just that she was the opponent.\n\nRow 3: Runner-up on 28 May 2000 in El Paso, Texas, USA. Surface is hard. Opponent is Erin Burdette. Doesn't match the claim details.\n\nRows 4-9: These have different dates and opponents. For example, row 4 mentions Mirielle Dittmann again but on a different date and as the winner.\n\nSo focusing back on Row 2, it has the correct opponent, date, location, and surface. The only difference is that the outcome was runner-up instead of a win, but since the claim doesn't specify the outcome, just the details about the match setup, this should suffice.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by Row 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an HTML table and a claim they want me to verify as TRUE or FALSE. My goal is to check the claim against the data in the table accurately.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim: \"on 2 may 1999, the surface be hard\". This means I need to find the row where the date is \"2 may 1999\" and then check what the surface was on that day.\n\nLooking at the HTML table structure, I see it has columns for outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. Each row represents a different match or event with specific details filled in each column.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find the relevant data. Starting from the top:\n\n- The first row has \"2 may 1999\" as the date. Let's check the surface here. It says 'hard', which matches the claim.\n  \nTo ensure accuracy, I'll verify if there are any other rows with the same date, but skimming through the rest of the table, all other dates are different from \"2 may 1999\". So, this is the only relevant row.\n\nNow, confirming the columns: the 'date' column in that row is exactly what the claim refers to, and the 'surface' column confirms it was indeed hard. There's no discrepancy here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because on May 2, 1999, the surface used was hard.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the opponent in final on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand on hard surface be katerina kramperov\u00e1\". Let me break down each part of this claim and check against the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries that match all these criteria: date is 6 February 2000, location is Wellington, New Zealand, surface is hard, and opponent in final is Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows are indexed starting from 0. Let me go through each row one by one.\n  \nRow 0: Date is 2 May 1999, location Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Date 11 July 1999, Felixstowe, England. No match.\nRow 2: Runner-up on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand. Surface is hard. Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann. So the date and location match, but opponent is not Katerina Kramperov\u00e1. Also, the outcome is runner-up here, so it's a final but she lost.\nRow 3: Runner-up on 28 May 2000 in El Paso, Texas. Not matching date or location.\nRow 4: Runner-up on 14 September 2003 in Spoleto, Italy. Doesn't match.\nRow 5: Winner on 6 February 2005 in Wellington. Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann again. Date doesn't match the claim (2000 vs 2005).\nRow 6: Winner on 28 August 2005 in Jesi, Italy. Doesn't fit.\nRow 7: Winner on 5 February 2006 in Taupo, New Zealand. Opponent is Natsumi Hamamura. Not the same as Katerina.\nRow 8: Winner on 12 February 2006 in Wellington. Opponent is Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 here. But date is 12 Feb 2006, not 6 Feb 2000.\nRow 9: Winner on 20 April 2008 in Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico. Not relevant.\n\nSo the claim mentions 6 February 2000 in Wellington. The only row that matches this date and location is Row 2. In Row 2, opponent is Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because while there's a match on date, location, and surface (hard), the opponent was someone else.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The surface in row 2 is hard. Opponent is Dittmann. So all conditions except opponent are met, but the opponent doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states that Katerina was the opponent on that specific date and location.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a final against Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand on a hard surface. However, according to Row 2 of the table, the opponent on that date and location was Mirielle Dittmann.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim \"the surface be grass on 2 may 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are 'outcome', 'date', 'location', 'surface', 'opponent in final', and 'score'. Each row represents a different match or event with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions two key pieces of information: the date \"2 may 1999\" and the surface type being \"grass\". So, I need to find the row where the date is \"2 may 1999\" and check what the surface was on that day.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- The first row has the date \"2 may 1999\". Let's look at that row. Under 'surface', it says \"hard\". Hmm, so the surface here isn't grass.\n  \nWait a minute, the claim is that the surface was grass on that date. But according to this row, the surface is hard. That suggests the claim might be false.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me scan through all rows:\n\n- Second row: 11 July 1999, surface grass.\n- Third row: 6 February 2000, surface hard.\n- Fourth row: 28 May 2000, surface hard.\n- Fifth row: 14 September 2003, surface clay.\n- Sixth row: 6 February 2005, surface hard.\n- Seventh row: 28 August 2005, surface hard.\n- Eighth row: 5 February 2006, surface hard.\n- Ninth row: 12 February 2006, surface hard.\n- Tenth row: 20 April 2008, surface hard.\n\nSo the only date close to May 1999 is the first and second rows. The first row is May 2nd with a hard surface, and the second is July 11th with grass. Therefore, on 2 May 1999, the surface was indeed hard, not grass.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the surface was grass on that date is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table entry for 2 May 1999 shows a 'hard' surface, contradicting the claim of it being grass. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
