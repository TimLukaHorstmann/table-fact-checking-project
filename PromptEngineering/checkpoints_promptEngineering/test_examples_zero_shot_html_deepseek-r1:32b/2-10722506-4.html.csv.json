    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim about the hosts in the West region. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states that for the West region, the hosts are University of Oklahoma, Rutgers University, University of Florida, and Duke University. So, I'm looking for all rows where the 'region' column is 'west' and checking if their 'host' matches these four universities.\n\nI'll start by examining each row in the table to see which ones belong to the West region. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. The first few rows are under 'east', so I can skip those.\n2. Then there are some under 'mideast' and 'midwest'; again, these aren't relevant for this claim.\n3. When I reach the 'west' region, I see four entries:\n   - University of Oklahoma\n   - Rutgers University\n   - University of Florida\n   - Duke University\n\nComparing these to the claim, it's an exact match. Each host listed in the claim is present in the table under the West region. There are no additional hosts in the West region beyond these four, and none are missing.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, I'll double-check each row index for the West region:\n- Row 12: University of Oklahoma\n- Row 13: Rutgers University\n- Row 14: University of Florida\n- Row 15: Duke University\n\nEach corresponds correctly. Therefore, the claim accurately reflects the hosts in the West region as per the table.\n\nNow, I need to structure my answer according to the instructions. The answer should be \"TRUE\" since all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Additionally, I must list each relevant cell with their row index and column name.\n\nSo, for each host in the West region:\n- University of Oklahoma is at row 12, 'host' column.\n- Rutgers University is at row 13, 'host'.\n- University of Florida is at row 14, 'host'.\n- Duke University is at row 15, 'host'.\n\nThese are all the relevant cells that verify each part of the claim. There's no discrepancy here; everything lines up perfectly.\n\nI should also remember to format my response as a JSON object with \"answer\" and \"relevant_cells\".

The claim states: \"the midwest region host be university of notre dame, vanderbilt university, iowa state university, and university of utah.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's saying that these four universities are hosts in the Midwest region. So, I need to check each of these universities in the table under the 'region' column to see if they're all listed as being in the Midwest.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: region, host, venue, city, state. The relevant parts for this claim are the 'host' and 'region' columns. \n\nI'll go through each of the four universities mentioned:\n\n1. **University of Notre Dame**: I scan down the 'host' column. I find University of Notre Dame in row 8. Checking the 'region' column in that same row, it says Midwest. So this one is correct.\n\n2. **Vanderbilt University**: Next, I look for Vanderbilt in the 'host' column. It's in row 9. The region here is also Midwest. Correct again.\n\n3. **Iowa State University**: Scanning further down, Iowa State appears in row 10. Its region is Midwest as well. That matches the claim.\n\n4. **University of Utah**: Finally, I look for University of Utah. It's in row 11. The region listed is Midwest. So that's correct too.\n\nSince all four universities are indeed hosts in the Midwest region according to the table, the claim is fully supported. \n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells: each university's row and their respective 'region' column entries.

The claim states: \"the city and state for the midwest region be salt lake city utah, ames iowa, nashville tennessee, and notre dame indiana.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's asserting that in the Midwest region of the table, the cities and their corresponding states are Salt Lake City, Utah; Ames, Iowa; Nashville, Tennessee; and Notre Dame, Indiana.\n\nTo verify this, I should look at the table entries where the 'region' column is 'midwest'. Let me scan through the table rows:\n\nLooking at each row in order:\n1. The first four rows are under the 'east' region, so they don't apply here.\n2. Rows 4 to 7 are under 'mideast', which I'll ignore since we're focusing on 'midwest'.\n3. Starting from row 8, it's the 'midwest' region. Let me list out each entry in this section:\n   - Row 8: University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana\n   - Row 9: Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee\n   - Row 10: Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa\n   - Row 11: University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nSo the cities and states for the midwest region are:\n- Notre Dame, IN\n- Nashville, TN\n- Ames, IA\n- Salt Lake City, UT\n\nComparing these to the claim, it lists all four correctly: Salt Lake City, UT; Ames, IA; Nashville, TN; and Notre Dame, IN. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this check. For each of the midwest region entries, I should look at both the 'city' and 'state' columns:\n- Row 8: city is \"notre dame\", state is \"indiana\"\n- Row 9: city is \"nashville\", state is \"tennessee\"\n- Row 10: city is \"ames\", state is \"iowa\"\n- Row 11: city is \"salt lake city\", state is \"utah\"\n\nSo each of these rows, columns 'city' and 'state' are relevant.

Salt Lake City, Utah\n2. Ames, Iowa\n3. Nashville, Tennessee\n4. Notre Dame, Indiana\n\nI need to check each of these against the table's west region rows. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with \"salt lake city utah.\" I'll look for a row in the west region where the city is Salt Lake City and the state is Utah. Scanning the table, I find that under the midwest region, there's a university of utah in Salt Lake City, UT. But wait, that's in the midwest, not the west. So this doesn't fit the claim since it's supposed to be part of the west region.\n\nNext is \"ames iowa.\" Again, looking through the west rows. The table has an entry for iowa state university in Ames, IA under the midwest region, not the west. So that's another mismatch.\n\nThen there's \"nashville tennessee.\" Checking the west region rows, I don't see any entries with Nashville, TN. Instead, Vanderbilt University is listed under the midwest region, which again doesn't fit because the claim attributes it to the west.\n\nLastly, \"notre dame indiana\" should be in the west region according to the claim. However, Notre Dame is listed under the midwest region in the table, not the west. So this also doesn't match.\n\nSince all four of these entries are actually in different regions (midwest or east) rather than the west, as per the table, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"state\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the city and state for the midwest region be norman oklahoma, piscataway new jersey, gainesville florida, and durham north carolina.\"\n\nI should check each of these cities and their corresponding states to see if they belong to the Midwest region in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: region, host, venue, city, state. Each row corresponds to a different university with details about their location.\n\nThe claim lists four entries:\n1. Norman Oklahoma\n2. Piscataway New Jersey\n3. Gainesville Florida\n4. Durham North Carolina\n\nI need to find each of these in the table and check if they are under the Midwest region.\n\nStarting with Norman Oklahoma: Let's scan through the rows. I see a row where city is Norman, state Oklahoma. Looking at the region column for that row. Row index 13 (since counting starts from 0) has region 'west'. So this entry belongs to the West region, not Midwest. That already might make the claim false.\n\nNext, Piscataway New Jersey: Checking the table, I find a row with city Piscataway and state New Jersey. Looking at its region, it's under 'west' as well (row index 14). So again, this is part of the West region, not Midwest.\n\nGainesville Florida: In the table, Gainesville is listed in the West region too (row index 15). The claim says it should be in Midwest, but according to the table, it's under West. Another discrepancy.\n\nDurham North Carolina: Checking this one, I find it in row index 16, which is also under the West region. The claim associates Durham with Midwest, but the table shows it as part of the West.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made an error because looking back at the Midwest section (rows 8-11), none of these cities are listed there. All four mentioned in the claim are actually in the West region (rows 12-15). \n\nSo each city and state pair in the claim is incorrectly assigned to Midwest, when they're all under West in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists cities that belong to the West region but incorrectly attributes them to the Midwest. None of these entries are found in the Midwest section of the table. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"region\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
