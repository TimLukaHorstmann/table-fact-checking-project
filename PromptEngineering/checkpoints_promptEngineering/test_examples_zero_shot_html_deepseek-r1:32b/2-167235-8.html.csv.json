    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row corresponds to a different prime minister with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is comparing two individuals: bashkim fino and vilson ahmeti. Specifically, it's stating that bashkim fino's term started after vilson ahmeti's term started. To verify this, I need to find the term start dates for both individuals in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. The first row seems to be a header or maybe just a general title and doesn't contain any specific data about a prime minister.\n2. The second row is fatos nano's first term.\n3. The third row is ylli bufi, but that's not relevant here.\n4. The fourth row mentions vilson ahmeti with the term start date of 10 december 1991.\n5. Continuing down, bashkim fino is listed in the sixth row, with a term start date of 11 march 1997.\n\nNow, comparing the two term start dates: 10 December 1991 for vilson ahmeti and 11 March 1997 for bashkim fino. Clearly, 11 March 1997 comes after 10 December 1991.\n\nTo ensure I'm accurate, I'll cross-check the rows:\n\n- vilson ahmeti's row: term start is 10 december 1991.\n- bashkim fino's row: term start is 11 march 1997.\n\nSince 1997 is after 1991, and within that, March comes after December in the same year, it confirms that bashkim fino started his term later than vilson ahmeti. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

That's one correct point.\n\nNext, \"bashkim fino\" is mentioned in row 5. The 'political party' here also says \"socialist party of albania,\" confirming bashkim fino as a member.\n\nThen, \"ylli bufi\" is listed in row 2. Checking the same column, it's indeed under the socialist party, so ylli bufi is accounted for.\n\nLastly, \"pandeli majko (1st time)\" appears in row 7.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the term end for vilson ahmeti be after the term end for ylli bufi\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant rows and columns in the table that contain the information about the term ends of Vilson Ahmeti and Ylli Bufi. Looking at the table structure, each row represents a prime minister with details including their name, born-died years, term start, term end, and political party.\n\nI'll start by identifying the rows for both individuals. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Ylli Bufi's row is the second one in the tbody, with row index 1 (since HTML tables are typically zero-indexed, but looking at the structure, it seems like the first data row after the header is index 0). Wait, actually, let me double-check. The first data row is index 0: fatos nano (1st time), then Ylli Bufi would be index 1.\n\nWait no, wait\u2014the HTML table shows that the first row under tbody is the headers again, but looking at the structure, it's more likely that each row in tbody corresponds to a prime minister. So:\n\n- The first data row (index 0) is \"prime ministers 1991 onwards\" \u2013 which seems like a header or perhaps an error.\n- Then index 1: fatos nano (1st time)\n- Index 2: ylli bufi\n- Index 3: vilson ahmeti\n\nSo, Vilson Ahmeti is in row index 3, and Ylli Bufi is in row index 2.\n\nNow, looking at the columns. The claim concerns the term end dates of these two individuals. So I need to check the \"term end\" column for both rows.\n\nFor Ylli_bufi (row index 2), the term end is listed as \"10 december 1991\". For Vilson Ahmeti (row index 3), the term end is \"13 april 1992\".\n\nNow, comparing these two dates. December 1991 comes before April 1992. Therefore, Vilson Ahmeti's term ended after Ylli Bufi's.\n\nSo the claim states that Vilson Ahmeti's term end is after Ylli_bufi's, which is correct based on the table data.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by comparing the term end dates of the two prime ministers.

The claim states: \"Sali Berisha be the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi, to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that Sali Berisha was the first person after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected from the Democratic Party of Albania (DP). So, I should check if there were any other DP members elected between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and Sali Berisha.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the relevant rows. Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi is listed in row 4 with term start on April 13, 1992, and end on March 11, 1997. His political party is the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nNow, I need to look for the next person from DP after Meksi's term ended. Let's go through the subsequent rows:\n\n- Row 5: Bashkim Fino, Socialist Party, so not relevant.\n- Row 6: Fatos Nano (2nd time), Socialist Party.\n- Row 7: Pandeli Majko (1st time), Socialist.\n- Row 8: Ilir Meta, Socialist.\n- Row 9: Pandeli Majko (2nd time), Socialist.\n- Row 10: Fatos Nano (3rd time), Socialist.\n- Row 11: Sali Berisha, Democratic Party.\n\nSo between Meksi's term ending in March 1997 and Berisha's start in September 2005, all the prime ministers were from the Socialist Party. Therefore, Sali Berisha is indeed the first DP member elected after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.\n\nThe relevant cells are Meksi's row (row 4) for his party, and Berisha's row (row 11) to confirm he's the next DP leader. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It seems to say that only one person has been both a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and elected as prime minister. So I need to check how many prime ministers are from this party.\n\nLooking at the table's column \"political party,\" each row lists the party of each prime minister. Let me go through each entry:\n\n1. The first row is just a header, so I can skip that.\n2. The second row is about fatos nano (1st time). His political party is listed as \"party of labour of albania.\" So this is one person from that party who was elected.\n3. The third row is ylli bufi with the socialist party. Not relevant here.\n4. Fourth row: vilson ahmeti, non-party. Doesn't apply.\n5. Aleksand\u00ebr meksi is with the democratic party.\n6. Bashkim fino is also socialist.\n7. fatos nano (2nd time) is again socialist.\n8. pandeli majko (1st time), ilir meta, and pandeli majko (2nd time) are all socialist.\n9. fatos nano (3rd time) is still socialist.\n10. sali berisha is democratic.\n11. edi rama is socialist.\n\nSo in the entire table, only fatos nano's first term is with the Party of Labour. All other terms either belong to the Socialist Party or the Democratic Party. Therefore, only one person from that party has been elected as prime minister.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Fatos nano served three times but was only with the Party of Labour in his first term. The rest were under the socialist party. So yes, just one instance where a member of the Party of Labour became PM.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because only fatos nano (1st time) fits both conditions: being a member of that party and being elected.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Fatos Nano (1st time) is the sole prime minister from the Party of Labour of Albania. All other entries are from different parties, confirming that only one person meets the claim's criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"ilir meta be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi, to be elect as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It's saying that Ilir Meta was elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania (DP), and he's the first one after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi who also was in DP. So I need to check if Ilir Meta is part of DP, and then see if there were any other members from DP between Meksi and Meta.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find both individuals. \n\nAleksand\u00ebr Meksi is listed on row index 4 (since rows start at 0). His term started in April 1992 and ended in March 1997. His political party is DP of Albania. So he was a member of DP.\n\nNow, let's look for Ilir Meta. He is on row index 8. His term started in October 1999 and ended in February 2002. The political party listed is SP of Albania. Wait, that's the Socialist Party, not Democratic. So Ilir Meta was part of the Socialist Party, not DP.\n\nThe claim says he was elected as a member of DP. But according to the table, his party affiliation is SP. That means he wasn't with DP; instead, someone else from DP would have been between Meksi and another DP prime minister.\n\nWait, let me check other entries in the DP column after Meksi. After Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi (DP), the next PMs are:\n\n- Bashkim Fino: SP\n- Fatos Nano 2nd time: SP\n- Pandeli Majko 1st and 2nd times: SP\n- Ilir Meta: SP\n- Then Sali Berisha comes in September 2005 as DP.\n\nSo the next DP PM after Meksi was Sali Berisha. Therefore, Ilir Meta wasn't a member of DP; he's with SP. So the claim that Meta is the first since Meksi for DP is incorrect because there were no DP members between them except Berisha later on. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ilir Meta was elected as a member of the Democratic Party (DP) after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are 'name', 'born - died', 'term start', 'term end', and 'political party'. So each row represents a prime minister with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about how many people were members of the Socialist Party of Albania. To check this, I need to go through each row and see who belongs to that party.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first row seems like a header or a placeholder since all cells say \"prime ministers 1991 onwards\". Not relevant for checking specific members.\n\n2. Second row: Fatos Nano (1st time) - his political party is 'party of labour of albania'. So he's not from the Socialist Party.\n\n3. Third row: Ylli Bufi - his party is 'socialist party of albania'. That's one person.\n\n4. Fourth row: Vilson Ahmeti - non-party, so no.\n\n5. Fifth row: Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi - democratic party, not socialist.\n\n6. Sixth row: Bashkim Fino - socialist party. That's the second person.\n\n7. Seventh row: Fatos Nano (2nd time) - again, his party is socialist. Third person.\n\n8. Eighth row: Pandeli Majko (1st time) - socialist. Fourth person.\n\n9. Ninth row: Ilir Meta - socialist. Fifth person.\n\n10. Tenth row: Pandeli Majko (2nd time) - socialist. Sixth person.\n\n11. Eleventh row: Fatos Nano (3rd time) - socialist. Seventh person.\n\n12. Twelfth row: Sali Berisha - democratic party.\n\n13. Thirteenth row: Edi Rama - socialist. Eighth person.\n\nSo, counting all these, I see that multiple people are listed as members of the Socialist Party of Albania. Each occurrence in the 'political party' column for socialist adds to the count.\n\nThe claim says \"only 1 person\" which is clearly not true because there are at least eight individuals who were part of that party according to the table.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss any, I'll go through each row again:\n\n- Rows 3,6,7,8,9,10,11,13: all have 'socialist party of albania' listed. That's eight different names. \n\nSo, the claim is false because there are multiple people who were members.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. Each row where the political party is socialist should be included. So rows 3 to 13 (excluding those not in socialist) have their 'political party' column as relevant.\n\nWait, but let me check which exact rows:\n\nRow indices are from 0 (header) up. So looking back:\n\nRow index starts at 0, which is the header row with \"prime ministers...\" Not needed.\n\nThen row 1: Fatos Nano (1st time) - not socialist.\n\nRow 2: Ylli Bufi - yes, so row 2.\n\nRow3: Vilson Ahmeti - no.\n\nRow4: Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi - no.\n\nRow5: Bashkim Fino - yes, row5.\n\nRow6: Fatos Nano (2nd time) - yes, row6.\n\nRow7: Pandeli Majko (1st time) - yes, row7.\n\nRow8: Ilir Meta - yes, row8.\n\nRow9: Pandeli Majko (2nd time) - yes, row9.\n\nRow10: Fatos Nano (3rd time) - yes, row10.\n\nRow11: Sali Berisha - no.\n\nRow12: Edi Rama - yes, row12.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 2,5,6,7,8,9,10,12 under the 'political party' column. That's eight entries, each showing that multiple people were in the socialist party.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table lists multiple individuals who were members of the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
