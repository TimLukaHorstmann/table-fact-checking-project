    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is provided in HTML format, and the claim is about a specific qualifier being played at a certain venue.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. Looking at the HTML, the table has five columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. There are 16 rows of data under these headers.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field , yona\"\n\nI need to parse this claim carefully. It seems like the user is saying that the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier was played at the Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona.\n\nSo, my approach should be to look through each row of the table and check two things: \n1. Does the competition column mention \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\"?\n2. If it does, what venue is associated with that competition?\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\"? No, it's for the 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier.\nWait, actually, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 14 (index 13 if starting from 0) has competition as \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\". Let me confirm that. \n\nYes, row index 13: date is July 20, 2012; venue is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona; score is 4-1; result is 5-1; competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\".\n\nWait, but the date is 2012. So the qualifier for the 2013 cup was held in 2012? That seems a bit odd because qualifiers are usually held before the main event. But regardless of that, the key point here is whether the competition matches and the venue.\n\nIn row index 14 (date July 20, 2012), competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" with venue Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona.\n\nSo, according to this, yes, that qualifier was played at that venue. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are other rows for 2013 qualifiers as well. Let me look through all the competitions:\n\n- Rows 0: 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier\n- Row 1: same as row 0?\n- Wait, looking again, actually in the table provided, each row is a separate entry.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the rows. Let me recount from index 0 to 15:\n\nRow 0: 2013 eaff qualifier? No, it's \"2012 eaff east asian cup qualifier\".\nWait no, actually looking at the data again, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking back, in the table provided, rows go up to index 15. Let me look specifically for \"2013 eaff\" in competition:\n\nRow index 13: Competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\". So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd the venue for that row is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona.\n\nSo the claim states that the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier was played at that venue, which matches exactly with what's in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nAdditionally, checking other relevant cells: date is July 20, 2012, but since the claim only mentions the competition and venue, those are sufficient to validate the claim.\n\nSo, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is row index 13 (assuming rows start at 0) in the competition column. But wait, each row has multiple columns. The user's example shows that for each relevant condition, we list the cells. So perhaps I need to check both the competition and venue.\n\nWait, the claim says two things: that it was a qualifier for 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup, and that it was played at Leo Palace Resort in Yona. Therefore, both the 'competition' and 'venue' columns are relevant.\n\nLooking back, row index 13 has competition \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" and venue \"leo palace resort soccer field , yona\". So both columns (competition and venue) in that row support the claim.\n\nTherefore, I should include both column names for that row in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table. The 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier was indeed played at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona as per the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in rizai memorial stadium, manila.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key components of the claim:\n- Competition: 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\n- Venue: Rizai Memorial Stadium, Manila\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to see if there's a match.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 16: Date is 25 September 2012. Venue is Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila. Competition is 2012 Philippine Peace Cup. This doesn't match because the competition isn't the EAFF qualifier and the date is different.\n\nRow 17: Wait, actually checking each row:\n\nWait, in the table provided, the last row (index starting from 0) is at row index 15:\n- Date: 25 September 2012\n- Venue: Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila\n- Competition: 2012 Philippine Peace Cup\n\nThis doesn't match the claim's competition.\n\nLooking for any other rows with \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\":\n\nRows 12 and 13 have competitions like 2012 EAFF qualifier, 2013 qualifiers in different venues. \n\nRow 14: Date 25 September 2012, venue Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila, competition is 2012 Philippine Peace Cup.\n\nNo rows mention \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" at Rizal Memorial Stadium. The closest is row 16 (but in the given data, it's actually row 15), which is a different competition and date.\n\nTherefore, there's no support for the claim in the table. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
