    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"each time minnesota be the home team, the attendance be the same\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that whenever Minnesota is the home team in a game, the attendance number should be the same every time. So my task is to check all the rows where \"home\" is \"minnesota\" and see if the \"attendance\" column has consistent values.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns for date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The relevant information here is in the 'home' and 'attendance' columns.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to identify where Minnesota is the home team:\n\n1. Row 0: Home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568.\n2. Row 1: Home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568.\n3. Row 2: Home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568.\n4. Rows 3,4,5, etc., I need to check each row.\n\nWait, actually, the table has multiple rows where 'home' is \"minnesota.\" Let me list all such rows:\n\n- Row 0: date october 4, home minnesota, attendance 18568\n- Row 1: date october 6, home minnesota, attendance 18568\n- Row 2: date october 10, home minnesota, attendance 18568\n- Row 7: date october 21, home minnesota, attendance 18568\n\nWait, let me check all rows. Sometimes it's easy to miss a row.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 rows in total). Let me list each row and note if 'home' is 'minnesota':\n\n- Row 0: home minnesota\n- Row 1: home minnesota\n- Row 2: home minnesota\n- Row 3: home phoenix \u2192 not minnesota\n- Row 4: home anaheim \u2192 not minnesota\n- Row 5: home los angeles \u2192 no\n- Row 6: home st louis \u2192 no\n- Row 7: home minnesota\n- Rows 8,9,10,11: visitor is minnesota in some, but 'home' is colorado or pittsburgh. So only rows 0,1,2,7 have 'home' as minnesota.\n\nNow checking their attendance:\n\nRow 0: 18568\n\nRow 1: same, 18568\n\nRow 2: same, 18568\n\nRow 7: again, 18568.\n\nSo in all cases where Minnesota is the home team, the attendance is 18568. That means every time they are the home team, attendance is consistent at that number.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because all relevant attendances are the same whenever Minnesota hosts a game.\n\nSo I can conclude that the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are those in rows where 'home' is minnesota, specifically their attendance columns. So each of these rows (0,1,2,7) have their 'attendance' column checked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim holds true as all attendances when Minnesota is home are consistent.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the highest number of attendee at a game be on october 24 , with 19289 crowd attendance.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what needs to be verified. The claim mentions two things:\n1. October 24th had the highest attendance.\n2. That attendance was 19,289.\n\nI'll start by locating all the rows in the table that have an \"attendance\" column value equal to or higher than 19,289. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0 (October 4): Attendance is 18,568 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 1 (October 6): 18,568 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 2 (October 10): 18,568 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 3 (October 13): 12,088 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 4 (October 14): 17,174 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 5 (October 16): 14,239 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 6 (October 20): 19,150 \u2192 Higher than 18k but lower than 19,289.\n- Row 7 (October 21): 18,568 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 8 (October 24): 19,289 \u2192 This is the number mentioned in the claim. So it's a candidate for highest.\n- Row 9 (October 25): 16,839 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 10 (October 28): 17,041 \u2192 Lower.\n- Row 11 (October 30): 18,568 \u2192 Lower.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I see that the highest attendance is indeed on October 24th with 19,289 attendees. The next highest was 19,150 on October 20th, which is less than 19,289. So, the claim correctly identifies both the date and the attendance number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because October 24th had the highest attendance as per the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"minnesota play more games away than at home during the 2007 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. It seems to list hockey games for Minnesota, with each row representing a game. The columns include date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim is about whether Minnesota played more games away (as the visiting team) than at home during 2007. So, I need to count how many times Minnesota was the visitor versus when they were the home team.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. October 4: Visitor is Chicago, Home is Minnesota. So, Minnesota is at home.\n   - Relevant cells: row 0, columns 'visitor' and 'home'.\n2. October 6: Visitor is Columbus, Home is Minnesota. Minnesota at home.\n   - Row 1.\n3. October 10: Visitor Edmonton, Home Minnesota. At home.\n   - Row 2.\n4. October 13: Visitor Minnesota, Home Phoenix. So, away game.\n   - Row 3.\n5. October 14: Visitor Minnesota, Home Anaheim. Away.\n   - Row 4.\n6. October 16: Visitor Minnesota, Home Los Angeles. Away.\n   - Row 5.\n7. October 20: Visitor Minnesota, Home St Louis. Away.\n   - Row 6.\n8. October 21: Visitor Colorado, Home Minnesota. At home.\n   - Row 7.\n9. October 24: Visitor Minnesota, Home Calgary. Away.\n   - Row 8.\n10. October 25: Visitor Minnesota, Home Edmonton. Away.\n    - Row 9.\n11. October 28: Visitor Minnesota, Home Colorado. Away.\n    - Row 10.\n12. October 30: Visitor Pittsburgh, Home Minnesota. At home.\n    - Row 11.\n\nCounting away games:\n- Rows where visitor is Minnesota: rows 3,4,5,6,8,9,10. That's 7 games.\n\nHome games:\n- When home is Minnesota: rows 0,1,2,7,11. That's 5 games.\n\nSo, Minnesota played 7 away games and 5 home games. Therefore, they played more games away than at home.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the 'visitor' and 'home' columns for each row to determine their status as visitor or home.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the average attendance at a game during the 2007-2008 season be 18568 crowd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the average attendance per game in the 2007-2008 season was 18,568 people. So, my task is to calculate the average attendance from the data given and see if it matches this number.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The column we're interested in is \"attendance.\" Each cell under this column contains the number of people who attended that particular game.\n\nNow, to find the average attendance, I'll need two things: the total attendance across all games and the number of games played. Let's go through each row and collect the attendance numbers.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. October 4: 18568\n2. October 6: 18568\n3. October 10: 18568\n4. October 13: 12088\n5. October 14: 17174\n6. October 16: 14239\n7. October 20: 19150\n8. October 21: 18568\n9. October 24: 19289\n10. October 25: 16839\n11. October 28: 17041\n12. October 30: 18568\n\nSo, there are 12 games in total. Now, I'll add up all these attendance numbers.\n\nLet's start adding:\n\n- First three rows: 18568 each.\n  - 18568 * 3 = 55704\n- October 13: 12088 \u2192 Total so far: 55704 + 12088 = 67792\n- October 14: 17174 \u2192 Total: 67792 + 17174 = 84966\n- October 16: 14239 \u2192 Total: 84966 + 14239 = 99205\n- October 20: 19150 \u2192 Total: 99205 + 19150 = 118,355\n- October 21: 18568 \u2192 Total: 118,355 + 18568 = 136,923\n- October 24: 19289 \u2192 Total: 136,923 + 19289 = 156,212\n- October 25: 16839 \u2192 Total: 156,212 + 16839 = 173,051\n- October 28: 17041 \u2192 Total: 173,051 + 17041 = 190,092\n- October 30: 18568 \u2192 Total: 190,092 + 18568 = 208,660\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAdding them again:\n\n1. 18568\n2. 18568 \u2192 Total: 37136\n3. 18568 \u2192 Total: 55704\n4. 12088 \u2192 Total: 67,792\n5. 17174 \u2192 Total: 84,966\n6. 14239 \u2192 Total: 99,205\n7. 19150 \u2192 Total: 118,355\n8. 18568 \u2192 Total: 136,923\n9. 19289 \u2192 Total: 156,212\n10. 16839 \u2192 Total: 173,051\n11. 17041 \u2192 Total: 190,092\n12. 18568 \u2192 Total: 208,660\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nNow, the total attendance is 208,660 over 12 games. To find the average, I'll divide this total by the number of games:\n\nAverage = Total Attendance / Number of Games\nAverage = 208,660 / 12\n\nCalculating that:\n\n208,660 \u00f7 12 = 17,388.33...\n\nSo, approximately 17,388 people per game on average.\n\nThe claim states the average was 18,568. However, our calculation shows an average of about 17,388, which is lower than 18,568.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are all the attendance figures from each game, so their row indices and column name \"attendance\" should be listed.\n</think>\n\nThe average attendance calculated from the provided data does not match the claimed figure of 18,568. Hence, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Wait no:\n\nWait the table rows after index 7 are:\n\nRow 8 (index 7): Visitor is Colorado, Home is Minnesota on October 21.\n\nThen:\n\nRow 9 (index 8): Visitor is MN, Home Calgary.\n\nRow 10 (index 9): Visitor MN, Home Edmonton.\n\nRow 11 (index 10): Visitor MN, Home Colorado? Wait no, looking at the data: row index 10 is visitor as Colorado on October 21. Then rows after that:\n\nWait in the given table, let me list all rows with either home or visitor as Minnesota and opponent as Colorado.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 8 (index 7): Visitor is Colorado, Home MN \u2192 Game 1.\n- Any other instances? Let's check the rest of the rows beyond index 8.\n\nRow 9: Visitor MN vs Calgary \u2192 Opponent Calgary.\nRow 10: Visitor MN vs Edmonton \u2192 Opponent Edmonton.\nRow 11: Visitor MN vs Colorado? Wait no, looking at row 10 (index 9), visitor is MN and home is Edmonton. Row 11 (index 10): visitor is MN vs Colorado on October 28? Let me check the data again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe table has rows from index 0 to 12.\n\nLooking at each row for either team being Minnesota or Colorado:\n\n- Index 7: Visitor Colorado, Home MN \u2192 Game 1.\n- Index 10: Visitor MN vs Colorado on October 28? Let me check the data again. The visitor is MN and home is Colorado? Or vice versa?\n\nWait in row index 10 (row number 11), it's:\n\nVisitor: Minnesota\n\nHome: Colorado\n\nYes, that would be another game between them. So Game 2.\n\nSo I found two instances where they played each other:\n\n1. October 21: Visitor Colorado vs Home MN.\n2. October 28: Visitor MN vs Home Colorado.\n\nWait no, row index 10 is visitor as MN and home as Colorado on October 28? Let me check the data again carefully.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indexes are from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows including header).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's list all rows where either team is Minnesota or Colorado:\n\n- Row index 7: Visitor Colorado, Home MN \u2192 Game 1.\n- Row index 10: Visitor MN vs Colorado? Let me check the actual row.\n\nLooking at row index 10 (which would be the 11th row if starting from 0):\n\nVisitor: Minnesota\n\nHome: Colorado\n\nYes, that's a second game. So two instances where they played each other.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there are two games between MN and Colorado in this season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Minnesota played Colorado twice during the 2007-2008 season. By examining the table, we find two relevant matches: one on October 21 where Colorado visited Minnesota (row index 7), and another on October 28 where Minnesota visited Colorado (row index 10). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the highest number of attendee at a game was on october 30, with 18568 fans present\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the maximum attendance occurred on October 30th, and that there were 18,568 attendees on that day. To verify this, I'll need to look at each row in the table and check the 'date' and 'attendance' columns.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows from October 4 to October 30. The relevant columns are 'date', 'visitor', 'score', 'home', 'decision', 'attendance', and 'record'. For this claim, I'm only concerned with 'date' and 'attendance'.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **October 4**: Attendance is 18568.\n2. **October 6**: Attendance is also 18568.\n3. **October 10**: Again, 18568 attendees.\n4. **October 13**: The attendance drops to 12088, which is lower than 18568.\n5. **October 14**: Attendance increases but only to 17174, still below 18568.\n6. **October 16**: It's 14239, which is also less.\n7. **October 20**: Attendance jumps to 19150. Hmm, that's higher than 18568.\n8. **October 21**: Back to 18568 again.\n9. **October 24**: It's 19289, which is even higher than October 20th.\n10. **October 25**: Attendance decreases to 16839.\n11. **October 28**: Drops further to 17041.\n12. **October 30**: The claim says 18568, which is the same as earlier dates.\n\nWait a minute, so on October 24th, the attendance was 19289, which is higher than 18568. That means the highest attendance wasn't on October 30th but on October 24th. Therefore, the claim isn't correct because there's a higher number of attendees on another date.\n\nTo be thorough, I should list all rows where attendance was 18568 or more to ensure no higher numbers exist beyond what I noticed. Scanning again:\n\n- The highest is indeed 19289 on October 24th. Other high attendances include 19150 on October 20th and multiple instances of 18568.\n\nSo, the claim that the highest was on October 30 with 18568 isn't accurate because higher numbers occurred before that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance was on October 30 with 18,568 attendees. However, reviewing the table shows that there were higher attendances on other dates (e.g., October 24: 19,289). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the attendance vary each time minnesota be the home team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that whenever Minnesota was the home team, the attendance figures were different each time. So I need to check all the rows where \"home\" is Minnesota and see if their attendances are all unique or if there are any duplicates.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here are \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", \"attendance\". Specifically, for each row where \"home\" is Minnesota, I need to note down the attendance number. Then, I'll check if these numbers vary or if some are the same.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. October 4: Home is Minnesota? No, visitor is Chicago, home is Minnesota. Wait, no\u2014looking at the table structure, \"visitor\" and \"home\" are separate columns. So for this row, visitor is Chicago, home is Minnesota. So I should include this row.\n\nWait a second, actually, in the first row, visitor is Chicago, so the home team is Minnesota. Therefore, attendance here is 18568.\n\nNext rows:\n\n- October 6: Visitor is Columbus, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568 again.\n- October 10: Visitor is Edmonton, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568.\n- October 13: Now, visitor is Minnesota, so home is Phoenix. So this row isn't relevant since the home team isn't Minnesota.\n- October 14: Visitor is Minnesota, home is Anaheim. Not relevant.\n- October 16: Visitor is Minnesota, home is Los Angeles. Not relevant.\n- October 20: Visitor is Minnesota, home is St. Louis. Not relevant.\n- October 21: Visitor is Colorado, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568 again.\n- October 24: Visitor is Minnesota, home is Calgary. Not relevant.\n- October 25: Visitor is Minnesota, home is Edmonton. Not relevant.\n- October 28: Visitor is Minnesota, home is Colorado. Not relevant.\n- October 30: Visitor is Pittsburgh, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568.\n\nWait a minute\u2014so all the rows where home is Minnesota have attendance as 18568. That means every time Minnesota was the home team, the attendance was exactly the same number each time. Therefore, the attendance didn't vary; it remained consistent.\n\nSo the claim says that attendance varied each time Minnesota was the home team. But in reality, the attendance was the same (18568) for all those instances. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. I need to look at every row where \"home\" is Minnesota and check their \"attendance\". Those rows are:\n\nRow 0: home is Minnesota, attendance 18568.\nRow 1: same as above.\nRow 2: same.\nRow 7: visitor is Colorado, home is Minnesota. Attendance 18568 again.\nWait, no\u2014the row indexes might be different. Let me recount the rows.\n\nLooking back at the table structure:\n\n- The first row (row index 0) has home as Minnesota, attendance 18568.\n- Row 1: same as above, attendance 18568.\n- Row 2: same, attendance 18568.\n- Then, rows where visitor is Minnesota are not relevant until row 7 (October 21). Here, home is Minnesota again, so attendance is 18568. Wait no\u2014looking at the data:\n\nWait, in row index 7, which is October 21: visitor is Colorado, home is Minnesota, attendance 18568.\n\nBut actually, looking back, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all rows where \"home\" is Minnesota:\n\n- Row 0: October 4, home MN, attendance 18568\n- Row 1: October 6, home MN, attendance 18568\n- Row 2: October 10, home MN, attendance 18568\n- Row 7: October 21, home MN, attendance 18568 (wait no\u2014the data in row 7 is October 21, visitor Colorado, home MN. So yes, same as others.\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 12.\n\nLet me list each relevant row:\n\n- Row 0: Oct 4, home MN, attendance 18568\n- Row 1: Oct 6, home MN, attendance 18568\n- Row 2: Oct 10, home MN, attendance 18568\n- Row 7: Oct 21, visitor Colorado, home MN, attendance 18568? Wait no\u2014the data shows that in row 7 (index 7), the date is October 21. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRow indices start from 0.\n\nRow 0: Oct 4\nRow 1: Oct 6\nRow 2: Oct 10\nRow 3: Oct 13 (visitor MN, home Phoenix)\nRow 4: Oct 14 (visitor MN, home Anaheim)\nRow 5: Oct 16 (visitor MN, home LA)\nRow 6: Oct 20 (visitor MN, home St. Louis)\nRow 7: Oct 21 (visitor Colorado, home MN)\u2014yes\nRow 8: Oct 24 (visitor MN, home Calgary)\nRow 9: Oct 25 (visitor MN, home Edmonton)\nRow 10: Oct 28 (visitor MN, home Colorado)\nRow 11: Oct 30 (visitor Pittsburgh, home MN)\n\nSo rows where \"home\" is Minnesota are:\n\n- Row 0\n- Row 1\n- Row 2\n- Row 7\n- Row 11\n\nWait no\u2014let me correct. For each row:\n\nRow index 0: visitor Chicago, home MN \u2192 include\nindex 1: visitor Columbus, home MN \u2192 include\nindex 2: visitor Edmonton, home MN \u2192 include\nindex 3: visitor MN, home Phoenix \u2192 exclude\nindex 4: visitor MN, home Anaheim \u2192 exclude\nindex 5: visitor MN, home LA \u2192 exclude\nindex 6: visitor MN, home St. Louis \u2192 exclude\nindex 7: visitor Colorado, home MN \u2192 include\nindex 8: visitor MN, home Calgary \u2192 exclude\nindex 9: visitor MN, home Edmonton \u2192 exclude\nindex 10: visitor MN, home Colorado \u2192 exclude\nindex 11: visitor Pittsburgh, home MN \u2192 include\n\nSo the relevant rows are indexes 0, 1, 2, 7, 11.\n\nWait no\u2014row index 7 is October 21, which has home as Minnesota. So that's another row where attendance is 18568 again. Similarly, row 11 (Oct 30) also has home MN and same attendance.\n\nSo all these rows have the same attendance number. Thus, in each case where \"home\" was MN, attendance was 18568.\n\nHence, for the claim to be true, we would expect varying numbers, but instead they are all the same. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining if the attendance varied each time Minnesota (MN) was the home team. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Rows where MN was the home team:** Rows 0, 1, 2, 7, and 11.\n- **Attendance in these rows:** Each shows an attendance of 18568.\n\nSince the attendance did not change across these instances, the claim that it varied is false.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{False}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"minnesota play more home than away game in the 2007 season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"play more home than away games\" implies that Minnesota had more games where they were the home team compared to when they were the away team during the 2007 season. So I need to count how many times Minnesota was the home team and how many times they were the away team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, etc. The relevant columns here are 'visitor' and 'home'. If Minnesota is listed under 'home', that means they're playing at home; if they're in 'visitor', they're the away team.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. October 4: Visitor is Chicago, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Home game.\n2. October 6: Visitor is Columbus, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Home game.\n3. October 10: Visitor is Edmonton, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Home game.\n4. October 13: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Phoenix \u2192 Away game.\n5. October 14: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Anaheim \u2192 Away game.\n6. October 16: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Los Angeles \u2192 Away game.\n7. October 20: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is St. Louis \u2192 Away game.\n8. October 21: Visitor is Colorado, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Home game.\n9. October 24: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Calgary \u2192 Away game.\n10. October 25: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Edmonton \u2192 Away game.\n11. October 28: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Colorado \u2192 Away game.\n12. October 30: Visitor is Pittsburgh, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Home game.\n\nNow, counting the home games: rows 0,1,2,7,11 \u2192 that's 5 home games.\n\nCounting away games: rows 3,4,5,6,8,9,10 \u2192 that's 7 away games.\n\nWait a minute, so according to this count, Minnesota played more away games (7) than home games (5). That would mean the claim is false because they didn't play more at home; instead, they played more on the road.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Going through each row again:\n\nRows where Home is Minnesota: 0,1,2,7,11 \u2192 5 games.\nRows where Visitor is Minnesota: 3,4,5,6,8,9,10 \u2192 7 games.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim says they played more home games, but actually, they had fewer home games than away games in this table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by counting Minnesota's home and away games from the provided data.
