I need to determine whether the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see where Ken Irvin is listed. Scanning through the rows, I find that Ken Irvin is in row 4 (row index 3 since indexing starts at 0). The columns we need to check are \"round\" and \"player\".\n\nLooking at the claim, it says Ken Irvin was drafted in the fourth round. Checking the table, under the \"round\" column for his row, I see that he is indeed in round 4.\n\nWait a minute, the wording of the claim uses \"be drag,\" which might be a typo or incorrect phrasing. It's more likely they meant \"was drafted.\" Assuming that's the case, since Ken Irvin was picked in round 4, the claim holds true.\n\nI don't see any other relevant cells beyond his row for \"round\" and \"player,\" so those are the only ones needed to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ken Irvin was drafted in the fourth round. Checking the table, we find Ken Irvin in row 4 (row index 3), where the \"round\" is listed as 4. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"in 1st round , ken irvin be draft\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that Ken Irvin was drafted in the first round. So, I should check if there's a player named Ken Irvin and whether he was picked in the 1st round according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different draft pick with details like round, pick number, player name, position, and school/club team. The rounds go from 1 to 7, and within each round, there are multiple picks.\n\nI'll scan through the \"player\" column to find Ken Irvin. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Ruben Brown - not him.\nRow 1: Todd Collins - nope.\nRow 2: Marlon Kerner - no.\nRow 3: Damien Covington - no.\nRow 4: Ken Irvin! Yes, here he is. Now I need to check the round for this row.\n\nLooking at the \"round\" column in Row 4, it says 4. So Ken Irvin was drafted in the 4th round, not the 1st.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he was drafted in the first round is incorrect.\n\nI'll collect the relevant cells to support my conclusion. The row where Ken Irvin is listed is row index 4 (since HTML tables start at 0). The columns I need are \"round\" and \"player\".\n\nSo, relevant_cells will include:\n- {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n- {\"row__index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n\nSince the round is 4, not 1, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ken Irvin was drafted in the first round. Checking the table, Ken Irvin appears in row 4 with a round value of 4, indicating he was picked in the fourth round, not the first. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 4th round player from michigan select\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems like it's saying that in the 4th round, a player who attended Michigan was selected. So, I need to check if there's any entry in the 4th round where the school/club team is Michigan.\n\nLooking at the table structure: each row has 'round', 'pick', 'player', 'position', and 'school / club team'. The claim specifically mentions two conditions:\n1. Round 4.\n2. School/Club Team as Michigan.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check these conditions.\n\nStarting with the first few rows, round numbers are 1, 2, 3, etc. I'm looking for any row where 'round' is 4 and 'school / club team' is Michigan.\n\nLooking at the fourth round entries:\n- Row index 5: Round 4, pick 109, player Ken Irvin from Memphis.\n- Row index 6: Round 4, pick 113, Justin Armour from Stanford.\n- Row index 7: Round 4, pick 131, Tony Cline also from Stanford.\n\nWait, none of these have Michigan as their school. Let me double-check in case I missed any rows. \n\nGoing through all the rows again:\n- The second row (index 1) is round 2, player Todd Collins from Michigan. But that's not the fourth round.\n  \nSo, in round 4, there are no players listed from Michigan. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant to my check. The relevant columns are 'round' and 'school / club team'. I checked each row for round 4 and then looked at their school/club teams.\n\nSo, compiling this, since there's no player from Michigan in the 4th round, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a player from Michigan was selected in the 4th round. Reviewing all rows where the round is 4, none of them list Michigan as the school or club team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
