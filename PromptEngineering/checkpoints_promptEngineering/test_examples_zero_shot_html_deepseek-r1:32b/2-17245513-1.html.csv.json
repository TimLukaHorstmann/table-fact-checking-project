    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"t7 be the place of peter oosterhuis, who win 7500\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It has two parts: one about Peter Oosterhuis being in position t7 and another about him winning $7500.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective details. The relevant columns for this claim are \"place\" and \"money\".\n\nI'll start by searching for Peter Oosterhuis in the \"player\" column. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 6: Jack Nicklaus\n- Row 7: Peter Oosterhuis, England\n\nSo, Peter is in row index 7 (assuming starting from 0). Now, checking his \"place\": it's t7. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check the \"money\" column for Peter Oosterhuis. In row 7, under \"money\", it says 7500. So he won $7500, which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis, who have 10875\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Peter Oosterhuis is in position t7.\n2. Peter Oosterhuis has a money value of 10875.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan for the player \"Peter Oosterhuis\". From the HTML, I see that Peter Oosterhuis is listed in row index 6 (since rows start from 0). \n\nIn that row:\n- The place is t7.\n- His country is England.\n- His score is 289.\n- To par is +5.\n- Money is 7500.\n\nNow, checking the claim's first part: yes, his place is t7. So that's correct.\n\nThe second part of the claim states he has 10875 in money. However, according to the table, his money is listed as 7500. This doesn't match the claim.\n\nTherefore, while Peter Oosterhuis is indeed placed at t7, the money amount he earned does not match the claimed value of 10875. Hence, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where Peter Oosterhuis's place and money are listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
