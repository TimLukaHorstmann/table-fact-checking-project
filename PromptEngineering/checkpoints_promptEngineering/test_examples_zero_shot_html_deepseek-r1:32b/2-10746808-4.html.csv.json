It says that on May 22, 1926, there were three matches where the crowd exceeded 19,000 people each.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows, each representing a different match on that date. The relevant columns are \"crowd\" and \"date\".\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Crowd is 15,000. That's below 19,000.\n2. Row 1: Crowd is 25,000. This surpasses 19k.\n3. Row 2: Crowd is 14,000. Below.\n4. Row 3: Crowd is 14,000. Also below.\n5. Row 4: Crowd is 22,000. Surpasses 19k.\n6. Row 5: Crowd is 20,000. That's just above 19k.\n\nSo, how many matches meet the condition? Let's count:\n- Row 1: Yes\n- Row 4: Yes\n- Row 5: Yes\n\nThat makes three matches where the crowd was over 19,000. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on May 22, 1926, three matches had a crowd surpassing 19,000 each.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first match has a crowd of 15,000 (Row 0).\n- The second match has a crowd of 25,000 (Row 1) - surpasses.\n- Third: 14k (Row 2), fourth: 14k (Row3), fifth: 22k (Row4) - surpasses, sixth: 20k (Row5) - surpasses.\n\nThree matches meet the condition.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim is about the venues for all 6 matches being different from each other.\n\nI'll start by listing out the venues for each match. There are six rows in the tbody section of the table, so I'll go through each one:\n\n1. First row: venue is Victoria Park.\n2. Second row: venue is Princes Park.\n3. Third row: venue is Punt Road Oval.\n4. Fourth row: venue is Arden Street Oval.\n5. Fifth row: venue is Junction Oval.\n6. Sixth row: venue is Western Oval.\n\nNow, I'll check if any of these venues are the same across all six matches. Looking at each venue:\n\n- Victoria Park (Row 0) doesn't appear again.\n- Princes Park (Row 1) isn't listed elsewhere.\n- Punt Road Oval (Row 2) is unique.\n- Arden Street Oval (Row 3) appears only once.\n- Junction Oval (Row 4) is unique.\n- Western Oval (Row 5) doesn't repeat.\n\nSince each venue is distinct and none are repeated, the claim that all six venues are different holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nTo provide the relevant cells, I'll list each row's index with the \"venue\" column since each of these entries contributes to verifying that all venues are unique.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"richmond defeat hawthorn by 12 point at punt road oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where Richmond and Hawthorn are playing against each other. Scanning down, I see that in the third row (row index 2), the home team is Richmond and the away team is Hawthorn. That's the match we're interested in.\n\nNext, I need to check the scores. The home team score is \"16.16 (112)\", and the away team score is \"14.16 (100)\". In Australian rules football, scores are typically represented as Goals.Behinds (Total Points), where each goal is 6 points and each behind is 1 point. So, to find the total points, I can either add them up or refer to the numbers in parentheses.\n\nFor Richmond: 16 goals * 6 = 96, plus 16 behinds * 1 = 16, totaling 112 points (which matches the number in the parentheses). For Hawthorn: 14 goals * 6 = 84, plus 16 behinds * 1 = 16, totaling 100 points. The difference is 112 - 100 = 12 points. So, Richmond did defeat Hawthorn by 12 points.\n\nNow, checking the venue: the cell under \"venue\" for this row says \"punt road oval\", which matches the claim. \n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are the home team (Richmond), away team (Hawthorn), their respective scores, and the venue.\n\nI should make sure to note the correct row index for these cells. Since the first row is index 0, Richmond vs Hawthorn is at row index 2. The columns involved are \"home team\", \"away team\", \"home team score\", \"away team score\", and \"venue\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include all those mentioned for that specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Richmond defeated Hawthorn by 12 points at Punt Road Oval. Checking the table:\n\n- **Richmond** is the home team (row index 2).\n- Their score is 16.16 (112), and **Hawthorn** scored 14.16 (100). The difference is 12 points.\n- The venue is listed as Punt Road Oval.\n\nAll details in the claim match the table entries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"collingwood defeat melbourne by 5 points in front of 15000\" is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and find where the relevant information is located. The table has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a match between two teams on a specific date.\n\nThe claim mentions \"collingwood\" as the home team and \"melbourne\" as the away team. I'll start by locating the row where the home team is collingwood. Looking through the rows, the first row has \"collingwood\" as the home team and \"melbourne\" as the away team.\n\nNext, I need to check if collingwood defeated melbourne. To do this, I'll compare their scores. The home team score for collingwood is listed as 12.12 (84), and the away team score is 12.7 (79). In Australian football scoring, each 'dot' represents a goal, which is worth six points, and behinds are one point each. However, sometimes scores are simplified to just total points in parentheses.\n\nLooking at the scores: Collingwood has 84 points, Melbourne has 79 points. The difference is 5 points. So collingwood did win by 5 points.\n\nNow, checking the crowd size. In the same row, under the \"crowd\" column, it says 15000. This matches the claim that the game was in front of 15,000 people.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the data: collingwood defeated melbourne by 5 points with a crowd of 15,000. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to note which cells were relevant for this verification. The row index is 0 (since it's the first row in the tbody). The relevant columns are \"home team score\", \"away team score\", and \"crowd\". So the relevant_cells list will include these three with row_index 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all conditions are supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"st kilda defeat fitzroy by 11 point at junction oval on 22 may 1926.\" The key pieces of information here are the teams involved (St Kilda and Fitzroy), the venue (Junction Oval), the date (May 22, 1926), and the margin of victory (11 points).\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. Each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Collingwood vs Melbourne at Victoria Park on May 22, 1926. Doesn't involve St Kilda or Fitzroy.\n2. **Second Row**: Carlton vs South Melbourne at Princes Park. Again, not relevant.\n3. **Third Row**: Richmond vs Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval. Not relevant either.\n4. **Fourth Row**: North Melbourne vs Geelong at Arden Street Oval. Doesn't match the claim.\n5. **Fifth Row**: St Kilda vs Fitzroy at Junction Oval on May 22, 1926. This is the row we need to focus on.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval. Not relevant.\n\nSo, the fifth row is the one that pertains to our claim. Now, let's extract the necessary details from this row.\n\n- **Home Team**: St Kilda\n- **Away Team**: Fitzroy\n- **Venue**: Junction Oval\n- **Date**: 22 May 1926\n\nNow, checking the scores:\n\nSt Kilda: 9.8 (62)\nFitzroy: 7.9 (51)\n\nIn Australian rules football, the score is calculated as goals.times(6) + behinds. So, St Kilda's total points are 9*6 + 8 = 54 + 8 = 62 points. Fitzroy's total is 7*6 + 9 = 42 + 9 = 51 points.\n\nThe difference in points: 62 - 51 = 11 points. So, St Kilda did defeat Fitzroy by exactly 11 points at Junction Oval on May 22, 1926.\n\nI should also ensure that all other details match. The venue is correct as per the claim (Junction Oval), and the date matches as well (22 May 1926).

The claim says, \"the crowd be unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match on 22 may 1926.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim correctly. It mentions that three matches had a crowd count that did not exceed 19,000. So I need to check each row in the table where the date is May 22, 1926, and look at the 'crowd' column.\n\nLooking at the table, all rows have the same date: 22 May 1926. So there are six matches in total on that day. The crowd numbers for each match are as follows:\n\n1. Collingwood vs Melbourne: 15000\n2. Carlton vs South Melbourne: 25000\n3. Richmond vs Hawthorn: 14000\n4. North Melbourne vs Geelong: 14000\n5. St Kilda vs Fitzroy: 22000\n6. Footscray vs Essendon: 20000\n\nNow, let's identify which of these are below or equal to 19,000:\n\n- Collingwood: 15,000 (<=19k)\n- Carlton: 25,000 (>19k)\n- Richmond: 14,000 (<=19k)\n- North Melbourne: 14,000 (<=19k)\n- St Kilda: 22,000 (>19k)\n- Footscray: 20,000 (>19k)\n\nSo the matches where the crowd did not surpass 19,000 are Collingwood, Richmond, and North Melbourne. That's three matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed three matches where the crowd was unable to exceed 19,000 on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three matches had a crowd of 19,000 or less on May 22, 1926.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"in 6 match, only 1 venue be use more than 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions that in six matches, only one venue was used more than once. So, my goal is to check if among these six games listed in the table, there's exactly one venue that appears at least twice, and all others appear just once.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, venue, etc. The relevant column here is \"venue\". I'll go through each row to list out the venues used.\n\nLet me extract the venues from each row:\n1. Victoria Park\n2. Princes Park\n3. Punt Road Oval\n4. Arden Street Oval\n5. Junction Oval\n6. Western Oval\n\nNow, I need to see if any of these venues repeat. Scanning through the list: Victoria Park appears once, Princes Park once, Punt Road Oval once, and so on. Each venue is unique in this context.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the claim says only one venue was used more than once. But from my analysis, all six matches were held at different venues. That means no venue was repeated. Therefore, the number of venues used more than once is zero, not one as the claim states.\n\nSo, since the claim asserts that exactly one venue was used multiple times but in reality none were, this makes the claim FALSE.\n\nTo support my conclusion, I'll identify the relevant cells.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given an HTML table with information about several football matches from May 22, 1926. Each row in the table provides details such as home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe claim to verify is: \"collingwood lose to melbourne by 5 points in front of 15000 spectators.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of the claim against the data in the table. Let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Teams Involved**: The home team is Collingwood, and the away team is Melbourne.\n2. **Outcome**: Collingwood loses to Melbourne by 5 points.\n3. **Crowd Size**: There were 15,000 spectators present.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part to check against the table.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Relevant Row**\n\nLooking at the table, the first row contains data about Collingwood vs. Melbourne:\n\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Away team: melbourne\n- Crowd: 15000\n\nSo, this is the relevant row (row_index = 0).\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Outcome**\n\nNext, I need to check who won and by how many points.\n\nThe scores are given as:\n- Collingwood: 12.12 (84)\n- Melbourne: 12.7 (79)\n\nIn Australian Rules Football, scores are calculated as Goals.Behinds (Total Points). Each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is worth 1 point.\n\nLet's calculate the total points for both teams:\n\n- Collingwood:\n  - Goals: 12 \u00d7 6 = 72\n  - Behinds: 12 \u00d7 1 = 12\n  - Total: 72 + 12 = 84\n\n- Melbourne:\n  - Goals: 12 \u00d7 6 = 72\n  - Behinds: 7 \u00d7 1 = 7\n  - Total: 72 + 7 = 79\n\nSo, Collingwood scored 84 points, and Melbourne scored 79 points. That means Collingwood won by 5 points (84 - 79 = 5).\n\nBut the claim states that Collingwood lost to Melbourne by 5 points. This is incorrect because Collingwood actually won the match.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Crowd Size**\n\nThe crowd size in the table for this match is listed as 15000, which matches the claim.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the crowd size mentioned in the claim is accurate (15,000 spectators), the outcome of the game is not. Collingwood did not lose; they won by 5 points against Melbourne. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Collingwood lost to Melbourne by 5 points. According to the table, Collingwood actually won with a score of 84 to 79. The crowd size part is correct.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"fitzroy lose to st kilda by 11 points at junction oval on 22 march 1926.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this statement against the data in the HTML table. The table has multiple rows, so I should look through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All the games seem to be on the same date mentioned in each row: 22 May 1926. Wait a minute, the claim says March instead of May, so that's something I need to note.\n\nNow, let's look for the game involving Fitzroy. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The first row is Collingwood vs Melbourne.\n- Second: Carlton vs South Melbourne.\n- Third: Richmond vs Hawthorn.\n- Fourth: North Melbourne vs Geelong.\n- Fifth: St Kilda vs Fitzroy at junction oval.\n- Sixth: Footscray vs Essendon.\n\nAh, here's the relevant row (the fifth one). So, the home team is St Kilda with a score of 9.8 (62), and the away team is Fitzroy with 7.9 (51). The venue is junction oval, and the date is 22 May 1926.\n\nLet's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Teams**: Claim says Fitzroy loses to St Kilda. In the table, St Kilda is the home team, and their score is higher than Fitzroy's (62 vs 51), so that part checks out.\n\n2. **Score Difference**: The claim states a loss by 11 points. Calculating the difference: 62 - 51 = 11 points. So that's correct.\n\n3. **Venue**: Both the claim and the table mention junction oval, which matches.\n\n4. **Date**: The claim says 22 March 1926, but the table shows 22 May 1926. This is a discrepancy because March vs May are different months, so this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nSince one of the key details (date) doesn't match, even though other parts do, the entire claim can't be true. Therefore, it should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has inaccuracies regarding the date and possibly the point difference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
