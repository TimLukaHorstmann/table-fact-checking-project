The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do' be the imperative and \u0917\u0930\u093fs gari 'you did' be the past habitual.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the two parts of the claim.\n\n1. **Imperative Part:** The claim says that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is the imperative form meaning 'may you do'. Looking at the table, the imperative column is under each row. Let's check each relevant row.\n\n   - For second person singular low-grade (row index 2), the imperative cell is \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares with the translation 'may you do'. This matches the claim.\n   \n   So, this part seems correct.\n\n2. **Past Habitual Part:** The claim mentions \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" as past habitual meaning 'you did'. I'll check the past habitual column for second person singular low-grade (row index 2). \n\n   - In row index 2 under 'past habitual', it's \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis, which translates to 'you did'. This also matches the claim.\n   \nBoth parts of the claim are correctly supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll note the relevant cells:\n\n- For the imperative: row 2, column 'imperative'.\n- For past habitual: row 2, column 'past habitual'.\n\nSo, the JSON will reflect these two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states two things:\n1. \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual\"\n2. \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does' be the probable future\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first part: is \"garyo\" the past habitual form for 'he did'? \n\nLooking at the table, the columns are:\n- simple present / future\n- probable future\n- simple past\n- past habitual\n- injunctive\n- imperative\n\nI need to find where \"garyo\" is mentioned. Scanning through the rows:\n\nIn row 5 (third person singular low-grade), under the 'simple past' column, I see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". So according to the table, this is the simple past form for he, not the past habitual.\n\nWait, but the claim says it's the past habitual. Let me check the past habitual column. For third person singular low-grade, in the past habitual column, I see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\". So garyo is simple past, not past habitual.\n\nNow for the second part: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does' be the probable future.\"\n\nLooking at row 5 again, under 'simple present / future', I see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\". But the claim says it's the probable future. The probable future column for third person singular low-grade has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e garl\u0101 'he will probably do'\".\n\nSo according to the table, \"garcha\" is in the simple present/future, not the probable future. Therefore, the claim misidentifies both forms.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are where \"garyo\" and \"garcha\" are located.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly assigns grammatical tenses to the verbs based on the table's structure. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. For \"garyo\":\n   - Located in row 5 under 'simple past'.\n   - The past habitual for third person singular is 'garthyo'.\n\n2. For \"garcha\":\n   - Found in row 5 under 'simple present / future'.\n   - Probable future is listed as 'garl\u0101' in the same row.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are incorrect according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"simple present / future\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states two things: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the past habitual and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the probable future.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down each part of the claim. I'll look at each verb form mentioned and see where they appear in the table.\n\nStarting with \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". The claim is saying this is the past habitual tense. Looking at the table's columns, there's a column named \"past habitual.\" So I need to find if \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" appears under that column for the appropriate person.\n\nNext, the second part: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the probable future.\" The claim is stating this form is in the \"probable future\" column. I'll check if \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is listed under that column for the corresponding person.\n\nNow, examining the table row by row:\n\n1. The first row is about the first person singular. That's not relevant here since we're talking about second person forms.\n2. Second row: First person plural \u2013 also not relevant.\n3. Third row: Second person singular low-grade. Here, under \"simple past\", I see \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" meaning 'you did'. So that matches the first part of the claim.\n4. Looking at the same row for \"probable future,\" it's actually in a different column. Wait, no \u2013 the columns are \"simple present / future\", \"probable future\", etc. For this row (second person singular low-grade), under \"simple past\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". \n\nWait, but the claim says \"past habitual.\" Let me check where \"past habitual\" is for second person singular. In the third row (second person singular low-grade), the \"past habitual\" column has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\". So that's not matching the claim which says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'you did' is past habitual.\" Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, in the table:\n\n- The third row (second person singular low-grade) has under \"simple past\": \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\" meaning 'you did'. \n\nAnd under \"past habitual\" for that same row is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\".\n\nSo according to the claim, \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" is supposed to be past habitual. But in reality, it's under \"simple past.\" Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow checking the second part: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\". The claim says this is the probable future. Looking at the third row, under \"probable future\" it should be something else. Wait, no \u2013 let me see:\n\nIn the table's columns, the first column after row index 0 is \"simple present / future\", then \"probable future\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the columns. Let me list out the columns in order for clarity:\n\nColumns are:\n1. simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. past habitual\n4. ... etc., but looking back at the table structure:\n\nLooking at the table again, each row has entries under \"simple present / future\", \"probable future\", \"past habitual\", and so on.\n\nWait, in the third row (second person singular low-grade), under \"simple present / future\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\". The probable future for that row is a different form. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no \u2013 actually, looking at the table:\n\nIn the third row (row index 2, assuming starting from 0), which is second person singular low-grade, the columns are as follows:\n\n- simple present / future: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\"\n- probable future: I think that's not a separate column but perhaps another tense.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is different. Let me recount the columns in order:\n\nLooking at the table headers:\n\nThe columns are:\n1. simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. past habitual\n\nSo for each row, these three columns apply.\n\nNow, looking back:\n\nIn row 2 (second person singular low-grade), under \"simple present / future\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\", which matches the claim's second part, but the claim says it's in probable future. Wait no, the claim says \"garchas is probable future.\" But according to the table, it's under simple present/future.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading this. Let me check:\n\nIn row 2, column names are:\n- simple present / future: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\"\n- probable future: what is that? Wait, in the same row (row index 2), under \"probable future\" column, I don't see a form. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are arranged as follows:\n\nThe first three columns after the person specification might be:\n1. simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. past habitual\n\nSo in row 2 (second person singular low-grade):\n\n- simple present/future: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\"\n- probable future: I'm not sure, perhaps the next column is \"past\", but looking at the table structure:\n\nWait, the table's columns are:\n1. simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. past habitual\n4. ... other tenses?\n\nWait, in the given table, each row has multiple cells beyond these three. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back at the table, it seems that for each row, after the person specification, there are several columns:\n\nFrom the HTML structure, the headers are: \"simple present / future\", \"probable future\", \"past habitual\", and others like \"past\", \"future\", etc., but perhaps I need to get this right.\n\nWait, in the table provided, for each row, after the person specification (like \"second person singular low-grade\"), there are multiple columns. Let me list all the columns:\n\nThe headers in order are:\n1. simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. past habitual\n4. past\n5. future\n6. ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index them as per their positions.\n\nBut regardless, for each row, the first three columns after the person are likely:\n\n- simple present/future\n- probable future\n- past habitual\n\nSo in row 2 (second person singular low-grade), under \"simple present / future\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\". Under \"past\", it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f garis 'you did'\". Under \"past habitual\" in the same row, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f garthis\".\n\nSo according to this:\n\n- \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is under simple present/future (column 1)\n- \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" is under past (column 4?), not past habitual.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back at the table structure in HTML:\n\nThe tbody has rows with multiple tds. Each row starts with the person specification, then several columns for different tenses.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps it's better to consider that each row after the first (headers) is structured as follows:\n\nRow structure (from HTML):\n\nEach tr contains tds starting from the person, followed by the verb forms in order. The headers are: simple present / future, probable future, past habitual, past, future.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me look at the exact HTML code provided in the initial problem statement.\n\nThe user provided:\n\n\"You are tasked with... [then the rest of the query]\"\n\nBut looking back, it's clear that each row in the table has multiple columns beyond just simple present/future and probable future.\n\nBut for the purpose of this task, I need to figure out which column is which.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first three columns correspond to:\n\n1. simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. past habitual\n\nAnd then more columns follow.\n\nAssuming that, in row 2 (second person singular low-grade):\n\n- Column 1: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\" under simple present/future\n- Column 2: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d garyas 'you would do'\" perhaps under probable future\n- Column 3: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f garie 'you used to do'\" under past habitual\n\nThen, in the same row:\n\n- Column 4 might be simple past: \"\u0917\u0930\u0940 gari 'you did'\"\n- Column 5: future perfect or something else.\n\nBut regardless, according to this structure:\n\n- The form \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\" is under simple present/future (column 1)\n- The form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f garis\" is under past (column 4 perhaps)\n\nSo according to the table:\n\nFor row 2 (second person singular low-grade):\n\n- simple present/future: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas 'you will do'\"\n- probable future: perhaps another form, but it's not clear without seeing all columns.\n\nBut regardless, for this problem:\n\nThe user is asking to create a multiple-choice question about the verb forms in this table. So the correct answer would be based on identifying which column each form belongs to.\n\nSo if \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\" is under simple present/future (column 1), and \"\u0917\u0930\u093f garis\" is under past (column 4?), then:\n\nThe question could be: Which of the following correctly identifies the verb forms in the table?\n\nOptions would include matching each form to its column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to structure the question as: Identify the correct tense for the verb form \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\".\n\nBut given that the user wants a multiple-choice question and answer, I'll proceed accordingly.\n</think>\n\nHere is a well-structured multiple-choice question based on the provided table:\n\n**Question:**  \nIn the context of the given verb forms, which tense does the form \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d (garchas)\" belong to?\n\n**Options:**\nA) Simple Present/Future  \nB) Probable Future  \nC) Past Habitual  \nD) Simple Past  \n\n**Answer:**  \nA) Simple Present/Future\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**  \nIn the table, the verb form \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d (garchas)\" is listed under the column labeled \"simple present / future,\" indicating that it corresponds to this tense.",

Scanning through the rows, I see that the third person singular low-grade row has entries for each tense. The injunctive column for this row lists \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos.\" However, in another part of the table, specifically under the third person middle-grade/plural masculine row, the injunctive form is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe,\" but that's not our focus here.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the rows, there's a row labeled \"third person singular low-grade\" which has in the injunctive column: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos. But the claim mentions \"garthyo.\" Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- The high grade row has an injunctive form of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d garnuhos.\n- The third person middle-grade/plural masculine row has \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe in the past habitual and \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d garun\" in the imperative.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me go through each row's injunctive column:\n\n1. First person singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\n2. First person plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\n3. Second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\n4. Second person middle-grade/plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094c garthyau\n5. High grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d garnuhos\n6. Third person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\n7. Third person middle-grade/plural masculine: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe\n\nSo, the claim mentions \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo\" as the injunctive for 'he used to do.' Looking through the injunctive column, I don't see \"garthyo.\" Instead, in the past habitual column for third person singular low-grade, it's listed as \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo. \n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm mixing up columns. The claim is saying that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo\" is the injunctive and \"garyo\" is the past habitual. But according to the table:\n\n- In the third person singular low-grade row:\n  - Past habitual column: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\n  - Injunctive column: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\n\nSo, the claim states that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive and \"garyo\" is the past habitual. But in the table, for third person singular low-grade:\n\n- The past habitual (column name 'past habitual') has garyo.\n- The injunctive has garos.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly assigns \"garthyo\" as the injunctive form when it's not present there. Instead, \"garthyo\" appears in the past habitual column of another row? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- Third person singular low-grade: past habitual is garyo.\n- High grade: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe?\nWait, no. The high grade's past habitual isn't directly clear because it's under a different subject.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check each row and column:\n\nLooking at each row, the columns are: You are task, but let me see the table structure again.\n\nThe table has columns as follows (from the headers):\n\n- \"You are tasked\" seems to be a typo; actually, looking back, the columns are labeled as follows based on the provided table:\n\nWait, no. The original table's column names are: \n\nLooking at the user's message, after the table, it shows columns like \"injunctive\" and \"past habitual.\" Let me confirm.\n\nThe table has the following columns (from the HTML structure):\n\n- First column seems to be the subject, e.g., \"first person singular,\" etc.\n- The other columns are labeled as: injunctive, past habitual? Or perhaps I misread. Wait, no, in the user's message, after the table is presented, it says:\n\n\"Claim: '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do' be the injunctive and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual'\"\n\nSo, the columns are \"injunctive\" and \"past habitual.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each row's \"injunctive\" and \"past habitual\" entries.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the third person singular low-grade row (row 6 if we start counting from 0):\n\n- The injunctive form is \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos.\n- The past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo.\n\nSo, according to the table, \"garyo\" is correctly assigned as the past habitual for 'he did' in third person singular low-grade. However, the claim says that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive. But in this row, the injunctive is \"garos,\" not \"garthyo.\"\n\nLooking through other rows to see where \"garthyo\" appears:\n\nIn the second person middle-grade/plural row (row 4), the past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094c garthyau.\n\nWait, but that's plural. The claim refers to 'he,' which is singular.\n\nAnother possibility: in the third person middle-grade/plural masculine row (row 7):\n\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d garun.\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe.\n\nSo, \"garthyo\" doesn't appear here either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a row. Let me list all rows with their indexes:\n\n0: first person singular\n1: first person plural\n2: second person singular low-grade\n3: second person middle-grade/plural\n4: high grade\n5: third person singular low-grade\n6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nWait, so row 5 is third person singular low-grade. \n\nLooking at the past habitual column for each row:\n\n- Row 0 (first person singular): past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd.\n- Row 1 (first person plural): past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169.\n- Row 2 (second person singular low-grade): past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u093f garthi?\nWait, looking at row 2's past habitual: in the user's table, it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f garthi\" perhaps?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me recount each row's past habitual and injunctive forms.\n\nRow 0:\n- Subject: first person singular\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\n- Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\n\nWait, no, perhaps the columns are different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe table is presented as HTML, but in the user's message, it's written as:\n\n<the table is presented here with rows and columns>\n\nBut due to markdown limitations, I can't see the exact structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row has multiple forms: present, past, etc., but since the claim refers specifically to injunctive and past habitual, let me focus on those two columns per row.\n\nSo, for each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\n- Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the table has more columns but only two relevant ones.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that each row corresponds to a subject (like first person singular), and for each such subject, there are forms in different tenses/moods: present, past, injunctive, etc.\n\nBut since I can't see the exact table structure, perhaps the key is:\n\nThe claim says \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of 'he use to do' (i.e., third person singular) and \"garyo\" is the past habitual. But according to row 5 (third person singular low-grade), injunctive is garos, past habitual is garyo.\n\nThus, the claim incorrectly states that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive when it should be \"garos.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in another row or form. Maybe the user intended to refer to a different grammatical number or form?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the rows. Let me list all rows with their indexes and relevant columns:\n\nAssuming each row has two key forms: injunctive and past habitual.\n\nRow 0:\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901\n- Past Habitual: ?\n\nRow 1:\n- Injunctive: ?\n- Past Habitual: ?\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Perhaps the main point is that in the row corresponding to third person singular, the past habitual is \"garyo\" and injunctive is \"garos,\" not \"garthyo.\" Therefore, the claim swaps them or assigns incorrectly.\n\nThus, the task is to correct this claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garthyo)\" is the injunctive form meaning 'he use to do' and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b (garyo)\" is the past habitual form meaning 'he did.' However, according to the table:\n\n- For the third person singular low-grade:\n  - The **past habitual** form is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b (garyo),\" which correctly corresponds to 'he did.'\n  - The **injunctive** form is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d (garos),\" not \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garthyo).\"\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly identifies \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u094d\u092f\u094b (garthyo)\" as the injunctive. The correct injunctive form for 'he use to do' in this context is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d (garos).\" \n\n**Correct Answer:**\n\nThe correct forms are:\n- **Injunctive:** \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d (garos) \u2013 meaning 'he use to do'\n- **Past Habitual:** \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b (garyo) \u2013 meaning 'he did'\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"the imperative of the past habitual \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". \n\nFirst, I'll identify each part of the claim in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two forms:\n1. The past habitual form is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (gari) which translates to 'you did'.\n2. It states that the imperative form corresponding to this past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d (gares), meaning 'may you do'.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I need to find where these two forms are located.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"past habitual\" and \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\". The columns in the table include \"past habitual\", so that's a key column. Scanning through each row under \"past habitual\", I look for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" or \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\".\n\nLooking at Row 2 (second person singular low-grade): Under \"past habitual\", it's \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (garis) meaning 'you did'. So that matches the first part.\n\nNext, the claim refers to the imperative form being \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d. The column for \"imperative\" is another key. In the same row (Row 2), under \"imperative\", it's \u0917\u0930\u0947s (gares) with the meaning 'may you do'. \n\nSo both forms are present in Row 2: \"past habitual\" and \"imperative\". Therefore, the claim correctly states that the imperative corresponding to the past habitual form is indeed \u0917\u0930\u0947s.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately references the imperative form of the past habitual tense for the second person singular low-grade in the table. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Terms:** The claim connects \"past habitual\" (\u0917\u0930\u093fs) and its corresponding \"imperative\" (\u0917\u0930\u0947s).\n2. **Locate in Table:** \n   - Look for \"past habitual\" column.\n   - Find \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" under Row 2 (second person singular low-grade).\n   - Check the same row's \"imperative\" column, which shows \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\".\n3. **Verify Claim:** The imperative form matches as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you do , ' be the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the components of the claim. It's suggesting that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is the past habitual form corresponding to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\", which is the simple present/future form for second person singular low-grade.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different grammatical person (like first person singular, plural, etc.), and each column corresponds to a verb tense or mood. The columns are: !simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nI need to find where \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" is located because that's the starting point of the claim. Let me scan through the table rows for \"garchas\". I see it in row index 2 (since counting starts at 0), which is labeled as \"second person singular low-grade\". The cell under the \"!simple present / future\" column has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\".\n\nNow, according to the claim, the past habitual form should be \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" (gari). In the same row (row 2), I check the \"past habitual\" column. The entry there is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\". Wait, that's not exactly \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\"; it ends with 's' instead of being just 'i'. \n\nSo the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\", but the table shows \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" as the past habitual for this row. Therefore, the form in the table is different from what the claim states. This suggests that the claim is incorrect because it doesn't match the data provided.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other rows or columns. Scanning through all rows, especially those related to second person, but no other row has \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" as a past habitual form. The only occurrence of \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" is in row 2 under past habitual.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is the past habitual form of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" is not supported by the table; instead, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\". Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is the past habitual form of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d\", but according to the table, the correct form is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"!simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that \"garyo\" (which is written as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\") is the past habitual form of \"garcha\" (written as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\"). The claim translates to English as: \"he do\" being the past habitual of \"he does\". \n\nLooking at the table, I need to check where these terms appear. Let's start by identifying the columns and rows related to each verb form.\n\nThe columns in the table are:\n1. !simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. simple past\n4. past habitual\n5. injunctive\n6. imperative\n\nNow, looking for \"garcha\" which is given as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\". In the table, under the first column (!simple present / future), in the row where the subject is \"third person singular low-grade\", I see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\". So that's correct.\n\nNext, for \"garyo\" which is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\". The claim says this is the past habitual form of \"garcha\". Let me check the past habitual column. For the same subject, \"third person singular low-grade\", under the past habitual column, I see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\". Wait, that's not matching. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should look elsewhere. The claim says \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\". Let me check if there's a row where \"garyo\" appears under past habitual.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- First person singular: Under past habitual, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\".\n- First person plural: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\".\n- Second person singular low-grade: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\".\n- Second person middle-grade/plural: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau\".\n- High grade: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garnuhunthyo\".\n- Third person singular low-grade: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" under past habitual.\n- Third person middle-grade/plural masculine: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe\".\n\nWait, I'm looking for \"garyo\". Hmm. Let me check the third person singular low-grade row again. In that row, under the simple past column, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". But in the past habitual column, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\".\n\nSo according to the table, \"garyo\" is in the simple past tense for third person singular low-grade, not the past habitual. The past habitual is \"garthyo\".\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\" is incorrect because \"garyo\" is actually the simple past form, while the past habitual is \"garthyo\". So the claim is false.\n\nNow, to collect the relevant cells:\n\n- The row for third person singular low-grade (row index 6) under simple present/future shows \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\".\n- The same row, under past habitual column (column name 'past habitual') has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\", which is the correct past habitual form.\n- Also, in that same row, under simple past (column 3), it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u094b garyo\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n1. Row index 6, column 'past habitual' to show what the actual past habitual is.\n2. Row index 6, column '!simple present / future' for \"garcha\".\n3. Maybe also row index 6, column 'simple past' to show where \"garyo\" comes from.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to check each part of the claim against the table. The claim is about whether \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\". So in the table, under the same subject (third person singular low-grade), \"garcha\" is in column 1 (!simple present / future). The past habitual for this subject is in column 4 and is \"garthyo\", not \"garyo\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For \"garcha\": row index 6, column '!simple present / future'.\n- For \"garyo\" as simple past: row index 6, column 'simple past'.\n- The correct past habitual \"garthyo\": row index 6, column 'past habitual'.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is only about whether \"garyo\" is the past habitual. So checking the columns for that subject and form.\n\nSo I'll include those three cells to show where each part is located.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"!simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do , ' be the injunctive of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The claim is about Nepali verbs and their forms. Specifically, it's saying that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive form of \"garyo\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: \"simple present / future\", \"probable future\", \"simple past\", \"past habitual\", \"injunctive\", and \"imperative\". The rows correspond to different persons (first, second, third) in singular or plural forms.\n\nI should find where \"garyo\" is listed. Scanning through the table, I see that in the row labeled \"third person singular low - grade\", under the column \"simple past\", there's an entry: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". So that's correct for \"garyo\".\n\nNow, the claim says that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\". To check this, I need to look at the \"injunctive\" column. In the same row (third person singular low - grade), the injunctive form is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\". \n\nSo, in the table, \"garthyo\" is indeed under the \"injunctive\" column for that row. That matches the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- The row where \"garyo\" is found: third person singular low - grade.\n- The columns involved: \"simple past\" and \"injunctive\".\n\nSo, in terms of indexes:\n- The row index for \"third person singular low - grade\" is 5 (assuming rows start from 0).\n- Columns are \"simple past\" and \"injunctive\", which correspond to the third and fifth columns.\n\nWait, let me double-check the row indices. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: first person singular\nRow 1: first person plural\nRow 2: second person singular low-grade\nRow 3: second person middle-grade/plural\nRow 4: high grade\nRow 5: third person singular low-grade\nRow 6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nYes, row 5 is the correct one. So, relevant cells are in row 5 for both \"simple past\" and \"injunctive\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive form of \"garyo\". From the table, in row 5 (third person singular low-grade), \"garyo\" is under \"simple past\", and \"garthyo\" is under \"injunctive\". Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'you did' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim refers to. The main verb forms involved are \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d (garchas), which is in the \"simple present / future\" tense, and \u0917\u0930\u093f (gari), which is supposed to be its simple past.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"!simple present / future\", \"probable future\", \"simple past\", etc. Each row represents different persons and numbers. \n\nI need to find where \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d (garchas) appears in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The third row (index 2, since counting starts at 0?) has \"second person singular low-grade\" with \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\" under the \"!simple present / future\" column.\n- For its simple past form, I should check the same row's \"simple past\" column. In that cell, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'you did'\".\n\nThe claim mentions \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\", but in the table, it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\". The difference is a 's' at the end. This suggests a possible typo or mistake in the claim.\n\nMoreover, looking at other rows for consistency, like the second row (first person plural), their simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garyau\", which doesn't have an ending similar to \"gari\". \n\nTherefore, since the table shows \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\" as the correct form under the same row and column, but the claim uses \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" without the 's', this discrepancy makes the claim incorrect. Additionally, \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" doesn't appear in the relevant cell for the simple past of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" is the simple past form of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093fs gari 'you did'\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It's asserting that the word \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" (gares) in the injunctive form means 'may you do', and it's related to \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" (gari), which is given as 'you did'. So I need to check if gares is indeed the injunctive for gari.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to different grammatical persons and forms. The columns are labeled with tenses or moods: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nThe claim mentions two words: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" (gares) and \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" (gari). I need to find these in the table and see their corresponding columns.\n\nStarting with \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" (gares). I'll scan each row's injunctive column because that's what the claim is about. \n\nLooking at row 2, which is second person singular low-grade, under the injunctive column, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\". So that seems to fit: gares is in the injunctive form and means 'may you do'.\n\nNow for \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" (gari). I'm looking for this word in one of the other columns. Let's check each row.\n\nIn row 2, second person singular low-grade, under simple past, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you did'\". So gari is the simple past form meaning 'you did'.\n\nSo now, according to the claim, gares (injunctive) should be related to gari (simple past). But in the table, these are both in row 2. The injunctive for gari would imply that they are different forms of the same root verb.\n\nWait, but looking at the structure, each row has a person and number, and under each tense/mood, there's a corresponding form. So row 2's simple past is gari (you did), and its injunctive is gares (may you do). That seems correct because in some languages, the injunctive can be derived from the past forms.\n\nBut I need to confirm if \"gares\" is indeed the injunctive form corresponding to \"gari\". In row 2, under injunctive, it's listed as gares. So yes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because in the table, for second person singular low-grade, the simple past is gari (you did) and the injunctive is gares (may you do). Thus, gares is the injunctive form related to gari.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" (gares) is the injunctive form of \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" (gari), meaning 'you did'. Checking row 2 of the table, under the simple past column, we find \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you did'\". In the same row, the injunctive column lists \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\". This confirms that gares is indeed the injunctive form corresponding to gari.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's saying that the past habitual form corresponding to \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (which is the simple past for second person singular low-grade) should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u094d\", and it's suggesting that the translation or meaning of this is 'may you do'.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go step by step. The claim mentions two main points: the verb form and its corresponding part in another tense.\n\n1. **Identifying the Row for Simple Past (\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d):**\n   - I see that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is mentioned in the simple past column under the second person singular low-grade row (row index 2). The entry here is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'you did'\". So this is correct.\n\n2. **Checking the Past Habitual for the Same Row:**\n   - In the same row (row index 2), I look at the \"past habitual\" column. It shows \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f garthi 'you used to do'\". The claim, however, says it should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\". That doesn't match.\n\n3. **Looking for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d:**\n   - Now, I check where \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" appears in the table. Looking through each row's past habitual column:\n     - Row 2 (second person singular low-grade): \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f garthi\"\n     - Row 3 (second person middle-grade/plural): \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094c garthyau\"\n     - Row 4 (high grade): \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo\"\n     - Row 5 (third person singular low-grade): \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\"\n     - Row 6 (third person middle-grade/plural masculine): \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0947 garthe\"\n\n   - It seems that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" isn't present in any of the past habitual columns.\n\n4. **Checking the Imperative Form:**\n   - The claim also mentions 'may you do', which is an imperative form.\n   - In row 2, under the imperative column, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 gare\". But the claim uses \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\", which doesn't appear here either.\n\n5. **Potential Confusion Between Columns:**\n   - Perhaps there's a mix-up between past habitual and another tense? Let me check other columns.\n   - For row 2, the imperative is \"\u0917\u0430\u0440\u0947 gare\" (not gares). The past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f garthi\". So neither matches the claim.\n\n6. **Double-Checking Other Rows:**\n   - I look through all rows to see if any have \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" in their cells.\n   - It's not present anywhere, so it seems like this form isn't listed in the table at all.\n\n7. **Conclusion on Claim Accuracy:**\n   - The claim states that the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d, but according to the table, the past habitual for that row is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f. Additionally, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" doesn't appear in any relevant cells.\n   - Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE because the information provided in the claim doesn't align with what's presented in the table. The past habitual form for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is different, and \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" isn't listed as a past habitual anywhere.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly identifies the past habitual of \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" as \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\", which doesn't match the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in HTML format and a claim about it. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information presented in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The table has several columns: \"simple present / future,\" \"probable future,\" \"simple past,\" \"past habitual,\" \"injunctive,\" and \"imperative.\" Each row corresponds to different grammatical persons and numbers, such as first person singular, plural, etc., including some specific grades for second and third persons.\n\nThe claim is: \"the probable future of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'.\" \n\nBreaking this down, the claim is asserting that the form corresponding to \"probable future\" for the verb \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" (garchas), which means 'you (will) do', is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" (garis), meaning 'you did'. \n\nNow, I need to verify this by looking into the table. Let's identify where in the table we can find these forms.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first row is for the first person singular.\n2. The second row is for the first person plural.\n3. The third row is for the second person singular low-grade, which includes \"garchas\" in the \"simple present / future\" column.\n4. The fourth row is for the second person middle-grade/plural.\n5. The fifth row is labeled \"high grade.\"\n6. The sixth and seventh rows are for third persons.\n\nThe claim mentions \"you (will) do,\" which corresponds to the second person singular low-grade, found in the third row under the \"simple present / future\" column. So that's our starting point.\n\nNext, we need to check what the \"probable future\" form is for this verb. In the same row, under the \"probable future\" column, the entry is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s\" with the meaning 'you will (probably) do'. \n\nHowever, the claim states that the probable future should be \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d gari 'you did'.\" Wait a minute, looking at the same row under the \"simple past\" column, we find \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d garis,\" which indeed means 'you did'.\n\nSo there's a confusion here. The claim is mixing up two different tenses: it's stating that the probable future form of \"garchas\" is \"garis\", but according to the table, \"garis\" is actually in the simple past column, not the probable future.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the probable future form for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s,\" not \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d garis.\" The latter is the simple past tense. \n\nTo summarize:\n- The subject in question is \"you (will) do\" from the third row.\n- Its probable future form should be found in the \"probable future\" column of that same row, which is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d.\"\n- However, the claim refers to \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d,\" which is listed under the simple past.\n\nThis discrepancy means the claim is not supported by the table data. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst part: \"the phrase \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do' in simple past be...\"\nSo they're saying that the phrase \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e is in the simple past tense.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a column named \"simple past\". Let me check which row has \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e. Scanning through, I find it in the first row under \"simple present / future\" as \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do'\". Wait, but that's actually under the \"probable future\" column? Hmm.\n\nWait no, looking again: The table has columns: !simple present / future, probable future, simple past, etc. So in the first row for \"first person singular\", under \"probable future\" is \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do'. Under \"simple past\" it's \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd 'i did'. So the phrase \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e isn't in the simple past; it's in the probable future.\n\nSo that part of the claim is incorrect. The claim says that \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e is in the simple past, but according to the table, it's in the probable future column for first person singular.\n\nNow the second part: \"be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you use to do' in the injunctive\".\n\nSo they're saying that in the injunctive tense, the phrase is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b. Let's check the \"injunctive\" column.\n\nLooking at the rows, I see:\n\n- For first person singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd 'i used to do'.\n- Second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis 'you used to do'.\n- High grade row: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you used to do'.\n\nSo in the high grade row, under injunctive, it's \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b with the meaning 'you used to do'. So that part is correct.\n\nBut wait, the claim connects these two parts. It says that \"the phrase [gar\u0169l\u0101] in simple past be [garnuhunthyo] in injunctive.\" But since gar\u0169l\u0101 isn't in the simple past, but in probable future, the first part of the claim is wrong.\n\nSo overall, the claim is incorrect because it misplaces the tense for gar\u0169l\u0101. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like there might be a mix-up here because the first part talks about \"probable future\" and the second about \"imperative\". Let me parse it carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll identify each phrase mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 is given as 'we (will) do' under \"probable future\".\n2. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo is given as 'he used to do' under \"imperative\".\n\nI need to check the table for these phrases and their respective categories.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The columns are: !simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n  \nStarting with \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169. Let's search through each row under \"probable future\":\n\nRow 0 (first person singular): Probable future is \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101.\nRow 1 (first person plural): Probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0932\u093e gara\u0169l\u0101.\nWait, no. Let me check the \"probable future\" column:\n\nLooking at each row in \"probable future\":\n\n- Row 0: first person singular: \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101\n- Row 1: first person plural: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0932\u093e gara\u0169l\u0101\n- Row 2: second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s\n- Row 3: second person middle-grade/plural: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0932\u093e garaul\u0101\n- Row 4: high grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0932\u093e garnuhola\n- Row 5: third person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e garl\u0101\n- Row 6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0928\u094d garl\u0101n\n\nI'm looking for garcha\u0169 in the probable future. Wait, that's not matching any of these entries. The phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" is present in row 1 under \"!simple present / future\", where it means 'we (will) do'. But according to the claim, it's supposed to be under probable future as 'we will probably do', but that's not correct because in the table, it's in the first column. So the claim incorrectly associates garcha\u0169 with probable future when it's actually in simple present/future.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo is given as 'he used to do' in imperative.

Looking at the table:\n\nIn the \"imperative\" column for each row:\n\nRow 0: Not present\n\nRow 1: imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\n\nRow 2: Not present\n\nRow 3: Not present\n\nRow 4: high grade - Not present\n\nRow 5: third person singular low-grade - Not present\n\nRow 6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine - imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo as being in imperative. Looking for that phrase:\n\nLooking through all cells under \"imperative\" column, I don't see garthyo anywhere. Instead, garthyo appears under \"past habitual\" (third person middle-grade/plural masculine). Wait no\u2014let me check each row's past habitual:\n\nRow 0: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\nRow 1: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901\nWait, looking at the \"past habitual\" column for each row:\n\n- Row 0: first person singular: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\n- Row 1: first person plural: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901\n- Row 2: second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b\n- Row 3: second person middle-grade/plural: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e\n- Row 4: high grade: Not present\n- Row 5: third person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b\n- Row 6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0909\u0901\u0926\u0948\u091b\u0928\u094d\n\nWait, I don't see garthyo in the table. So perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo to recap:\n\nThe claim states that garchau (\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c) is in simple present/future for first person plural and is correctly categorized. However, the imperative form of first person plural is \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d, not garthyo.\n\nWait no\u2014the user's question is about verifying if the given data is correct or incorrect. The task was to check whether garchau (\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c) is in simple present/future and if garthyo (\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b) is in imperative for first person plural. Based on the table, garchau is correctly in simple present/future, but garthyo is not found under imperative; instead, the imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d.\n\nTherefore, the initial claim that garthyo is the imperative form of first person plural is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe assertion that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\" (garchau) is correctly placed in the simple present/future tense for the first person plural is accurate. However, the statement claiming that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (garthyo) serves as the imperative form for the first person plural is incorrect. According to the provided table, the correct imperative form for the first person plural is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\" (garun), not garthyo.\n\n**Answer:** The claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" is the imperative form of the first person plural is incorrect; the correct form is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d.\" Thus, the initial assertion is partially accurate but contains an error regarding the imperative form.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to suggest that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" in the context of the future tense is the simple past form corresponding to \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\", which is an injunctive or imperative mood meaning 'may you do'. So, essentially, the claim is claiming a grammatical relationship between these two forms.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: \"!simple present / future\", \"probable future\", \"simple past\", \"past habitual\", \"injunctive\", and \"imperative\". Each row corresponds to different pronouns or persons, like first person singular, plural, second person singular low-grade, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific forms: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d (garchas) under the future tense and \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d (gares) as an injunctive. I need to check where these appear in the table and see if they are related as simple past and present/future forms.\n\nLet me look through each row:\n\n1. **First person singular**: The future tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941\" and the simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e\". The injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901\", which doesn't match gares.\n2. **First person plural**: Future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u094c\u0901\", past is \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0932\u093e\", and injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901\". Again, no gares here.\n3. **Second person singular low-grade**: Here, the future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" (garchas), which matches the claim. The simple past for this row should be under the \"simple past\" column. Looking at that cell, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (garis). The injunctive here is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938\" (I think it says gares in the table? Let me check again: yes, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938\" but perhaps a typo. Wait, looking back, I see that in this row under \"injunctive\", it's written as \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938, which might be intended to be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938 or maybe it's supposed to be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938 for some grade. Alternatively, perhaps the table has a typo.\n\nWait, no: looking at the row in question:\n\nIn the second person singular low-grade row, under \"injunctive\" it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938 gares 'may you do'\". So the injunctive form is gares. The future tense for this same row is garchas.\n\nSo, the claim states that garchas (future) is the simple past of gares (injunctive). But according to the table, in the second person singular low-grade row, the future is garchas and the injunctive is gares. The simple past for this row is garis.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that the future form garchas is the simple past of the injunctive gares. But from the table, the simple past under the same row (second person singular low-grade) is garis, not garchas. So, the simple past would be garis for this pronoun.\n\nTherefore, the claim that garchas is the simple past form corresponding to gares isn't accurate based on the table. The simple past should be garis, and garchas is the future tense form.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in the second person singular low-grade row:\n\n- Future tense: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d\" (garchas)\n- Simple past: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" (garis)\n- Injunctive: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0938\" (gares)\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that garchas is the simple past for gares, but according to the table, the simple past of gares would actually be garis. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"!simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
