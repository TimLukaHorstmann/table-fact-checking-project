    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"when there be 14 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 7\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into two separate conditions connected by 'and'.\n\nCondition 1: When points are 14, the point difference is 41-07 and games are 7.\nCondition 2: When points are 10, the point difference is 26-16 and games are 7.\n\nI'll check each condition separately in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are games, drawn, lost, points difference, points.\n- There are 8 rows (indexes 0 to 7).\n\nStarting with Condition 1: Points = 14, point difference = 41 - 07, games = 7.\n\nI'll scan each row for a 'points' value of 14. Looking at the 'points' column:\n- Row 0 has points 14. Let's check other values in this row.\nGames: 7 (matches)\nPoint difference: 41 - 07 (matches). So condition 1 is satisfied by row 0.\n\nNow Condition 2: Points = 10, point difference = 26-16, games=7.\n\nLooking for points =10 in the 'points' column. Scanning rows:\n- Row 1 has points 10.\nCheck games: 7 (matches)\nPoint difference: 26 -16 (matches). So condition 2 is satisfied by row 1.\n\nBoth conditions are met, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow I'll list the relevant cells for each condition.\n\nFor Condition 1:\n- Row 0, column 'games' has value 7.\n- Row 0, column 'points difference' is 41 - 07.\n- Row 0, column 'points' is 14.\n\nBut according to the claim's structure, it's \"when there be 14 points and point difference... game be 7.\" So for condition 1, we need to check where points=14 and see if games=7 and point diff=41-07. So relevant cells are row 0 for all three columns.\n\nFor Condition 2:\n- Row 1 has points=10.\nCheck point difference:26 -16 and games=7.\nSo relevant cells are row 1 for 'games', 'points', and 'point difference'.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's structured as two separate conditions connected by 'and'. So each condition needs to be verified.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0: games (value 7), points difference (41 -07), points(14)\n- Row 1: games(7), points difference(26 -16), points(10)\n\nBut looking at the output example, it's a list of objects each with row index and column name. So I need to collect all cells that were checked.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include:\nFrom row 0:\n- \"games\"\n- \"points difference\"\n- \"points\"\n\nFrom row 1:\n- \"games\"\n- \"points difference\"\n- \"points\"\n\nBut looking at the initial example, it's possible that only the specific columns that match are considered. Alternatively, perhaps each condition is checked independently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each part of the claim, we check whether such a row exists.\n\nSo for condition 1: points=14, point diff=41-07, games=7. So all three in row 0 are relevant.\n\nFor condition 2: points=10, point diff=26-16, games=7. All three in row 1 are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0, \"games\"\nRow 0, \"drawn\" (not needed)\nWait no, perhaps just the columns that were part of the condition. So for each row checked, we look at 'points', 'point difference', and 'games' since those are the parts mentioned in the claim.\n\nThus, for each condition, the relevant cells are:\n\nCondition 1: points=14 (row0), so check games, point diff, and points.\n\nSimilarly for Condition2: points=10 (row1), check games, point diff, and points.\n\nSo compiling the list:\n\n- row0, \"games\"\n- row0, \"points difference\"\n- row0, \"points\"\n\n- row1, \"games\"\n- row1, \"points difference\"\n- row1, \"points\"\n\nWait, but in the output example, each object is just a row index and column name. So for each of these six cells, we have an entry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to list all the cells that were checked during verification. Since both conditions are satisfied by rows 0 and 1 respectively, the relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0: games (7), points difference (41-07), points(14)\nRow 1: games (7), points difference(26-16), points(10)\n\nSo each of these columns for their respective rows.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells array will have entries for row0 with 'games', 'points difference', 'points'; and same for row1.\n\nBut in terms of code, perhaps it's easier to collect all cells that are part of any condition.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the user is only to provide the final answer in the specified format. So I think I've done enough analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking two conditions separately in the table. Both conditions are satisfied by their respective rows, confirming the claim as true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{True}",

    "claim": "there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this a bit. It seems like it's saying two main things:\n\n1. There are exactly 7 games in total across all entries.\n2. There were draws on 4 occasions, but each time only one game was drawn.\n\nWait, actually reading again: \"only 7 game in all the game\" \u2014 perhaps meaning that each team played 7 games? Because looking at the table, each row has 'games' as 7. So maybe the claim is about each team having played 7 games.\n\nThe second part says, \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" This could mean that in total, across all teams, there were 4 draws, and each of those draws involved only one game (i.e., no two or more games drawn for a single team).\n\nWait, but the table's 'drawn' column shows how many games each team drew. So I need to look at each row's 'drawn' value.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: drawn=0\nRow 1: drawn=0\nRow 2: drawn=1\nRow 3: drawn=1\nRow 4: drawn=1\nRow 5: drawn=0\nRow 6: drawn=1\nRow 7: drawn=0\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML table provided, there are 8 rows. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: drawn=0\n- Row 1: drawn=0\n- Row 2: drawn=1\n- Row 3: drawn=1\n- Row 4: drawn=1\n- Row 5: drawn=0\n- Row 6: drawn=1\n- Row 7: drawn=0\n\nWait, that's only 8 rows. Wait, let me recount correctly.\n\nLooking at the HTML table:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>...7 times.\n\nNo, wait, the tbody has 8 tr elements. So each team played 7 games? Or is it per team?\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about the total number of games across all teams, but that would be more complex because each game involves two teams. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to each team having only 7 games.\n\nBut the first part says \"only 7 game in all the game\" \u2014 perhaps meaning that each row (each team) has played 7 games. Looking at the 'games' column: every row has 7, so that's correct.\n\nThe second part is about draws. The claim states there are 4 occasions where a draw occurred, and each time only one game was drawn. So across all teams, how many total drawn games are there?\n\nEach team's drawn count:\n\n- Row 0: 0\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 5: 0\n- Row 6: 1\n- Row 7: 0\n\nSo adding up the 'drawn' column: 0+0+1+1+1+0+1+0 = 4. So total of 4 drawn games across all teams.\n\nBut in reality, each draw is a single game involving two teams. So if a team has 1 drawn game, it's because they drew against another team once. Therefore, the total number of draws would be half the sum since each draw is counted twice (once for each team). Wait no, that's not correct because in the table, each row represents a single team's record, so if two teams drew, each would have 1 draw. So the total number of actual drawn games is equal to the sum divided by 2.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Each drawn game affects two teams. So for example, if Team A and Team B draw, then both Team A and Team B have a 'drawn' count incremented by 1 each. Therefore, the total number of drawn games in the league would be sum of all 'drawn's divided by 2.\n\nIn our case, sum is 4 (from rows 2,3,4,6). So 4 /2 = 2 actual drawn games.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw\", which suggests four drawn games. That contradicts because according to the table, it's only two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim might be saying that across all teams, there were four instances where a team had at least one draw, and in each case, no team had more than one draw.\n\nLooking back: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" So maybe it's saying that on four different games (or occasions), draws occurred, and in none of those did any team have more than one draw. But given that each drawn game is between two teams, the 'drawn' column counts how many times a team was involved in a draw.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is misinterpreted. The original wording: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Only 7 games total? But each row has 7 games, but the table shows multiple teams, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps meaning each team played 7 games.\n\nSo first part is correct: each team has 7 games.\n\nSecond part: \"on 4 occasion be there draw\" \u2014 meaning four instances where a game was drawn.\n\nAnd \"never more than 1 game drawn\" \u2014 meaning no single team had more than one draw in their record.\n\nLooking at the table, which teams have 'drawn' >0:\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo four teams have exactly one draw each. Therefore, there are four drawn games (since each involves two teams). Wait no, because each drawn game would increment two teams' 'drawn' count by 1.\n\nTherefore, if four teams each have one draw, that implies two actual drawn games (because each contributes to two teams).\n\nBut the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw\", which suggests four separate drawn games. So this would mean eight team-draw instances. But in our table, we only have four, implying two actual draws.\n\nSo perhaps my initial interpretation is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that across all teams, four of them had one draw each (totaling four 'drawn' counts). In reality, since each draw involves two teams, this would mean two actual drawn games. But the claim states \"on 4 occasion be there draw\", which might refer to four instances where a team drew a game, not accounting for the fact that each draw affects two teams.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with real-world meaning because in sports leagues, when you say \"number of draws,\" it's the count of games that ended in a draw, not the sum across all teams. So if two games were drawn, each involving two teams, then 'drawn' column would have four entries of 1.\n\nTherefore, in our table, since we have four '1's in the 'drawn' column, that implies two actual draws (each contributing to two teams). But the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw\", which could mean four draws. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of rows with 'drawn'=1.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRows:\n\n0: drawn=0\n\n1: drawn=0\n\n2: drawn=1\n\n3: drawn=1\n\n4: drawn=1\n\n5: drawn=0\n\n6: drawn=1\n\n7: drawn=0\n\nSo rows 2,3,4,6 have 'drawn'=1. So four teams each have one draw. Therefore, that implies two actual draws because each draw affects two teams.\n\nBut the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw\", which would imply four draws, meaning eight team-draws (since each draw is between two teams). But in our case, we only have four team-draws, implying two actual draws. Therefore, the claim's statement about four draws is incorrect based on the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the claim is simply stating that across all teams, there were four instances where a draw occurred (i.e., four drawn games), each involving only one game per team (so no team drew more than once). But given that each drawn game involves two teams, having four drawn games would require eight team-draws. However, in our table, we have only four team-draws, meaning two actual draws.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement about four occasions with draws is incorrect because according to the table, there are only two actual draws (since each contributes two team-draws). So this would mean that the claim is false based on the data provided.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"on 4 occasion be there draw\". Maybe it means that four teams had at least one draw in their record. That would fit because we have four rows with 'drawn'=1. But then the second part says \"never more than 1 game drawn\", meaning no team drew more than once, which is true because all are 0 or 1.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is that across all teams, there were four instances where a draw occurred (i.e., four teams had at least one draw), and in each case, no team drew more than once. That would make sense.\n\nBut if the claim is interpreted as four actual drawn games (each contributing two team-draws), then our table only shows two such games because four team-draws correspond to two actual draws.\n\nTherefore, there's a discrepancy depending on interpretation. But given that each row represents a team, perhaps the claim refers to team-level data rather than game-level.\n\nIn any case, based on the data:\n\n- Each team played 7 games: correct.\n\n- Across all teams, four teams had one draw each (so 'drawn' sum is 4). Whether this implies four actual drawn games or two depends on interpretation.\n\nIf the claim is that there were four draws (actual games), then it's incorrect because only two such games occurred. If the claim is that four teams had at least one draw, then it's correct but perhaps misleading without context.\n\nBut assuming the claim meant four actual drawn games, which would require eight team-draws, our table doesn't support that.\n\nTherefore, to answer the question: Based on the data provided, the claim about four occasions with draws is incorrect because only two actual drawn games occurred (four team-draws). Alternatively, if considering teams, four had one draw each.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves verifying a claim based on data from a table. The claim states that there were four instances of drawn games and that no team drew more than once.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n1. **Each Team Played 7 Games**: This is correct as per the table.\n2. **Four Teams Had One Draw Each**: Correct, with rows 2,3,4,6 showing one draw each.\n3. **Interpretation of Four Occasions**:\n   - If \"four occasions\" refers to four actual drawn games, this is incorrect because only two such games occurred (resulting in four team-draws).\n   - If it means four teams had at least one draw, then the claim holds true.\n\nIn conclusion, depending on interpretation, the claim's accuracy varies. However, if considering actual drawn games, the claim is incorrect as there were only two.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim that there were four occasions with draws is not accurate based on the data provided because only two actual drawn games occurred (each involving two teams). Therefore, while four teams had one draw each, this does not equate to four separate drawn games. The correct number of drawn games is two.\n\n$\\boxed{2}$",

Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 9 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 -15 and 26-21\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the points column is 9. Scanning through the points column:\n\n- Row 2 has points = 10\n- Row 3: points=9 (row index 2)\n- Row 4: points=9 (row index 3)\n- Other rows have different point values.\n\nSo, there are two occasions where points are 9.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The table has columns named games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. So, \"points\" must refer to the last column. The claim is making a statement about when the points are 0, what the values for drawn and lost should be.\n\nLooking at the claim: When points (the 'points' column) are 0, then the number of drawn games (from the 'drawn' column) should be 0, and the number of lost games (from the 'lost' column) should be 7. \n\nNow, I'll check each row in the table to see if there's a case where points are 0.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n- Row 0: Points =14\n- Row 1: Points=10\n- Row2:9\n- Row3:9\n- Row4:7\n- Row5:4\n- Row6:3\n- Row7:0\n\nSo, only the last row (row index 7) has points equal to 0. Now, I need to check what drawn and lost are in that same row.\n\nLooking at row 7:\n- Drawn =0\n- Lost=7\n\nYes, exactly as the claim states. So when points are 0, drawn is 0 and lost is 7. Therefore, the claim holds true for this case.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where points are 0 to ensure that all such cases meet the condition. But in this table, only row 7 has points=0, so I don't need to look further beyond that.\n\nThus, since the claim is fully supported by the data in row 7, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no draw more than 1 and no loss more than 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two conditions:\n\n1. No draw more than 1: This means that in every row of the table, the number of draws (from the 'drawn' column) shouldn't exceed 1.\n2. No loss more than 7: Similarly, the number of losses (from the 'lost' column) in each row should not be more than 7.\n\nMy task is to check each row against these two conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several rows. Each row represents a team or participant with their performance statistics across different matches. The columns are:\n\n- games: number of games played\n- drawn: number of games that ended in a draw\n- lost: number of games lost\n- points difference: difference in points between wins and losses\n- points: total points accumulated\n\nI need to focus on the 'drawn' and 'lost' columns for each row.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row (Row 0):**\n   - Drawn: 0 \u2192 This is \u22641, so it's okay.\n   - Lost: 0 \u2192 This is \u22647, also fine.\n\n2. **Second Row (Row 1):**\n   - Drawn: 0 \u2192 Okay.\n   - Lost: 2 \u2192 Still within the limit.\n\n3. **Third Row (Row 2):**\n   - Drawn: 1 \u2192 Exactly at the limit of 1, which is acceptable.\n   - Lost: 2 \u2192 Fine.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (Row 3):**\n   - Drawn: 1 \u2192 Okay.\n   - Lost: 2 \u2192 Within limits.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (Row 4):**\n   - Drawn: 1 \u2192 Good.\n   - Lost: 3 \u2192 Still under 7.\n\n6. **Sixth Row (Row 5):**\n   - Drawn: 0 \u2192 Fine.\n   - Lost: 5 \u2192 Under 7, so it's okay.\n\n7. **Seventh Row (Row 6):**\n   - Drawn: 1 \u2192 Exactly at the limit.\n   - Lost: 5 \u2192 Still within limits.\n\n8. **Eighth Row (Row 7):**\n   - Drawn: 0 \u2192 Okay.\n   - Lost: 7 \u2192 This is exactly at the upper limit of 7, which is acceptable as per the claim.\n\nWait a minute, in the last row (Row 7), the 'lost' value is 7. The claim says \"no loss more than 7,\" meaning losses can be up to and including 7. So having 7 losses doesn't violate the condition; it's allowed.\n\nNow, I need to check if any row has drawn >1 or lost >7. From the above analysis:\n\n- All 'drawn' values are either 0 or 1. None exceed 1.\n- All 'lost' values range from 0 to 7. None go beyond 7.\n\nTherefore, every row satisfies both conditions of the claim. \n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, let me quickly scan again:\n\n- Row 0: 0 draws, 0 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 1: 0 draws, 2 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 2: 1 draw, 2 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 3: 1 draw, 2 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 4: 1 draw, 3 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 5: 0 draws, 5 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 6: 1 draw, 5 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 7: 0 draws, 7 losses \u2192 Exactly at the limit but still acceptable.\n\nSo there are no instances where either condition is violated. Hence, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there should be no more than one draw and no more than seven losses in any row of the table. Upon examining each row, all entries for 'drawn' are 0 or 1, and all entries for 'lost' do not exceed 7. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\"\n\nHmm, breaking this down, it seems like there are two main parts:\n\n1. There are only 7 games in total across all entries.\n2. On four occasions, there were draws, but no single occasion had more than two drawn games.\n\nWait, let me make sure I parse that correctly. The first part is clear: the claim states that each team played exactly 7 games. Now, looking at the table, each row represents a different team's performance, and in each row under the \"games\" column, it says '7'. So every team played 7 games. That seems to support the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, the second part is about draws. The claim mentions that there were four occasions with draws, but never more than two drawn games on any single occasion. I think this might be a bit confusing because each row in the table represents a team's performance for all 7 games they played. So each row isn't an individual game but rather summarizes a team's entire season or series of games.\n\nLooking at the \"drawn\" column, which indicates how many games that particular team drew. The values are as follows:\n\n- Row 0: 0 draws\n- Row 1: 0 draws\n- Row 2: 1 draw\n- Row 3: 1 draw\n- Row 4: 1 draw\n- Row 5: 0 draws\n- Row 6: 1 draw\n- Row 7: 0 draws\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me recount the rows because sometimes I might miscount. The table has 8 rows (indices 0 to 7). Each row's \"drawn\" column:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 1\nRow 7: 0\n\nSo, adding up the draws across all teams: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. So there are four instances where a team drew at least one game. But wait, each row is a team's total games, so if a team has 1 draw in their 7 games, that means they drew once.\n\nBut the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw.\" That could mean that across all teams, there are four draws in total or four occasions where a game was drawn. However, each row represents a team's season, not individual game outcomes. So if two teams drew against each other, that would count as one drawn game for each team.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim might be referring to the number of draws per team across all their games. Let me think again.\n\nThe table lists 8 teams, each having played 7 games. Each team's \"drawn\" column shows how many games they drew in those 7 games. So for the entire dataset, the total number of drawn games would be:\n\nSum of all \"drawn\" columns: 0 + 0 +1 +1 +1 +0 +1 +0 = 4.\n\nBut wait, each draw involves two teams. So if a game is drawn between Team A and Team B, both will have that as a draw in their respective records. Therefore, the total number of unique drawn games would be half of the sum because each game is counted twice (once for each team).\n\nSo, with 4 total draws across all teams, there must have been 2 actual drawn games (since 4 / 2 = 2). This aligns with the second part of the claim which mentions \"never more than 2 game draw.\" So the maximum number of drawn games per occasion is 2.\n\nBut wait, the claim says on four occasions there were draws. That might be a misinterpretation because in reality, each draw involves two teams and thus counts as one game. So if there are two unique drawn games, that's two occasions where a draw happened. The claim mentions four occasions, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach team plays 7 games. Each row represents a team's performance across those 7 games. If a game is drawn between Team A and Team B, both teams will have that game counted as a draw in their respective \"drawn\" columns.\n\nSo the total number of draws from all teams' perspectives would be twice the actual number of drawn games because each drawn game affects two teams. Therefore:\n\nTotal draws across all teams = 4\nTherefore, actual drawn games = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nThis means there were only two instances where a game was drawn between two teams.\n\nThe claim states that \"on 4 occasion be there draw,\" which implies four separate drawn games, but according to the table, there are only two. Therefore, the first part of the claim about having only 7 games is correct because each team played exactly 7 games. However, the second part about four occasions with draws is incorrect; instead, there were only two unique drawn games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me re-read it: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is about each team having played 7 games (which they do), and then across all these games, there were four occasions where a game was drawn. But according to my calculation, since the sum of draws is 4 across all teams, that translates to 2 actual drawn games because each draw affects two teams.\n\nSo if there are only 2 unique drawn games, then the claim's mention of four occasions with draws is incorrect. Therefore, the second part of the claim isn't accurate based on the table data.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"occasion.\" Perhaps it refers to the number of times a team drew in their own games, not the total unique drawn games. In that case, each of those four teams (rows 2,3,4,6) had one draw each. So from the perspective of all teams, there are four instances where a team drew a game. But this counts each draw twice because each drawn game involves two teams.\n\nSo in reality, how many unique drawn games are there? Each time a team draws, it's part of a single game with another team. So if four teams have one draw each, that would imply two unique drawn games (since each draw is between two teams). Therefore, the actual number of drawn games is 2.\n\nThus, the claim says on four occasions there were draws, but actually, there are only two. Hence, the second part of the claim isn't correct according to the data provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let's try a different approach: Each team has their own set of games. If a game is drawn between Team A and Team B, both will have a draw in their respective \"drawn\" columns. So each drawn game contributes +1 to two teams' totals.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSum of draws across all teams = number of drawn games \u00d7 2\n\nIn the table, sum of draws = 4 (rows 2,3,4,6). Therefore, actual number of drawn games is 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nSo there were only two instances where a game was drawn. The claim mentions four occasions with draws, which doesn't align with this data.\n\nThus, the first part of the claim is correct (each team played exactly 7 games), but the second part about four draws isn't accurate; it should be two unique drawn games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"4 occasion\" refers to four teams that had at least one draw each. In that case, rows 2,3,4,6 have 1 draw each, so four teams experienced a draw in their games. But this doesn't directly translate to four separate drawn games; it just means four teams were involved in draws.\n\nIn that interpretation, the claim might be misleading because it could imply four instances of drawn games, which isn't accurate. There are only two unique games that ended in a draw.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Each team played 7 games: Correct (first part of the claim is true).\n- Across all these games, there were four occasions with draws: Incorrect because there were actually two unique drawn games.\n- Additionally, never more than two games drawn on any single occasion: This part is a bit unclear. If it means that in any set of games (perhaps per team), no more than two draws occurred, which is true since each team has at most one draw.\n\nWait, but looking back, the \"never more than 2 game draw\" could mean that across all teams, there aren't four drawn games, so the maximum number of unique draws is two. So in this case, it's correct because only two games were drawn.\n\nBut wait, if the claim says on four occasions (i.e., four separate instances) where a game was drawn, but according to the data, there are only two such instances, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- Each team played 7 games: True.\n- There were four drawn games across all teams' games: False; there were two unique drawn games (each involving two teams, hence four entries in the \"drawn\" column).\n- No more than two games drawn on any occasion: This could be interpreted as no single game had more than two draws (which doesn't make sense because a game can only have one result: win, loss, or draw for each participant). So perhaps it means that across all teams' games, there were never four draws in total; which is true because we only had two.\n\nAlternatively, the phrasing might be confusing. If \"on 4 occasion\" refers to four separate game instances where a draw occurred, but in reality, there are only two such instances (since each draw affects two teams), then the claim's first part about having four draws is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThe claim says: Each team played exactly 7 games (True). There were four occasions where a game was drawn (False; actual number is two). Never more than two games drawn on any occasion (True, since only two unique drawn games exist).\n\nTherefore, the claim has inaccuracies regarding the number of drawn games.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"on 4 occasion\". Maybe it means that four teams each had at least one draw in their games. In that case:\n\n- Four teams (rows 2,3,4,6) each had one draw: True.\n- Thus, there were four instances where a team drew a game: This is technically true from the perspective of individual teams but doesn't accurately represent the number of unique drawn games.\n\nBut I think the intended meaning was that four games ended in a draw. In reality, only two games did so.\n\nSo overall, the claim has inaccuracies regarding the number of drawn games.\n</think>\n\nThe first part of the claim is correct: each team played exactly 7 games. However, the second part stating there were four occasions with draws is incorrect; there were actually two unique drawn games. The third part about never having more than two games drawn on any occasion is true since only two games ended in a draw.\n\n**Answer:** Only the first and third parts of the claim are correct. There were not four, but two unique drawn games.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. There are 8 rows of data.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n\n1. \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7\"\n2. \"and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6\"\n\nWait, hold on. The claim mentions two scenarios:\n- In the first scenario, 10 points and a point difference of 41-07 should correspond to 7 games.\n- In the second part, when there are 10 points, the point difference is 26-16 with 6 games.\n\nBut looking at the table, all rows have 7 games. So any row that has 10 points must have 7 games, not 6. That seems contradictory right away.\n\nLet me check each condition:\n\nFirst part: 10 points and point difference of 41-07 with 7 games.\nLooking at the table, let's find where points are 10. Scanning through the points column:\nRow 0: 14\nRow 1: 10\nRow 2:9\nRow3:9\nRow4:7\nRow5:4\nRow6:3\nRow7:0\n\nSo only row 1 has 10 points. Let's check the point difference for row 1: \"26 - 16\". The claim says it should be 41-07, but in reality, it's 26-16. So this part is already false because the point difference doesn't match.\n\nSecond part of the claim: when points are 10, the point difference is 26-16 with 6 games.\nBut row 1 has 10 points, and indeed, the point difference is 26-16. However, the number of games is 7, not 6. So even though the point difference matches for 10 points, the games are still 7, which contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the second part. Let me parse it again: \"when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6\". So when points are 10, they're saying that the point difference is 26-16 and games are 6. But in our table, the only row with 10 points has games as 7, not 6.\n\nSo both parts of the claim don't hold true because:\n\n1. The first condition expects a point difference of 41-07 for 10 points, but it's actually 26-16.\n2. The second condition says that when there are 10 points, the game count should be 6 with a certain point difference, but in reality, games are 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because neither of the conditions holds as per the table data.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor the first part of the claim (10 points and 41-07):\n- Points column for row 1: value 10\n- Point difference for row 1: \"26 - 16\"\nBut since it's looking for 41-07, which isn't present, we can note that row.\n\nFor the second part (10 points and point difference 26-16 with 6 games):\n- Points column for row 1: 10\n- Point difference column for row 1: \"26 - 16\"\nBut the games are 7 in row 1, so that's relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, points (value 10)\n- Row 1, point difference (26-16)\n- Also, since it mentions games=7 and 6, we need to check all rows for points=10. Only row1 has 10 points.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row 1: \"points\" and \"point difference\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because neither condition matches the table data. The relevant cells show that at 10 points, the point difference is 26-16 with 7 games, not 41-07 or 6 games.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"point difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"there be 10 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. There are two occasions where the points are 10.\n2. On those same occasions, the point differences are 30-15 and 26-21.\n\nI'll start by checking each row of the table to find instances where the \"points\" column is 10.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 0: points = 14 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 1: points = 10 \u2192 Relevant. Point difference is 26 - 16. This doesn't match either of the specified differences (30-15 or 26-21).\n- Row 2: points = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 3: points = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 4: points = 7 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 5: points = 4 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 6: points = 3 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 7: points = 0 \u2192 Not relevant.\n\nWait, the table has 8 rows (indices 0 to 7). From the above, only row 1 has 10 points. So there's only one occasion with 10 points, not two as claimed. \n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is false because there's only one instance of 10 points, not two.\n\nAdditionally, even if we were to check for point differences, looking at all rows:\n- Row 0: 41 - 07 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 1: 26 - 16 \u2192 Doesn't match the claim.\n- Row 2: 30 - 15 \u2192 This is one of the claimed differences but has points =9, not 10. So it's a different row.\n- Row 3: 26 - 21 \u2192 Another claimed difference with points=9.\n\nSo, even though the point differences 30-15 and 26-21 exist in rows 2 and 3 respectively, they are not associated with points=10. The claim links these specific differences to the occasions of 10 points, which isn't accurate.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim aren't met. There's only one occasion with 10 points, and the point differences mentioned don't correspond to that occasion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is only one instance where the points are 10, and neither of the specified point differences occur on that occasion.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"point difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"point difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So I need to check if there's any row where points equal 0, and see what the corresponding values for drawn and lost games are.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: points = 14 \u2192 Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: points = 10 \u2192 Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: points = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n4. Row 3: points = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n5.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems to state two conditions:\n1. There should not be a number of drawn games exceeding 3.\n2. There should not be a number of lost games exceeding 7.\n\nSo, my goal is to check each row in the table for these two metrics: 'drawn' and 'lost'. \n\nLooking at the table structure provided in HTML format, I can see that it has columns named \"games\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", \"points difference\", and \"points\". Each row represents a team's performance with specific values under each column.\n\nI'll need to examine each row's 'drawn' and 'lost' values. \n\nStarting with the first condition: no draw more than 3.\n- I'll go through each row and check the value in the 'drawn' column.\n- The possible values for 'drawn' across all rows are 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1. \n- None of these exceed 3, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, for the second condition: no loss more than 7.\n- Again, I'll check each row's 'lost' column.\n- The values here are 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5. \n- All of these are below or equal to 7. \n\nWait a minute, looking back at the last row, it has a 'lost' value of 7. Oh, but wait\u2014the claim says \"no loss more than 7,\" which means losses should not exceed 7. Since 7 is allowed (as in \"not more than\"), this is still within the limit.\n\nSo both conditions are met across all rows. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells that were checked. For each row, I looked at the 'drawn' and 'lost' columns. So for every row index (0 through 7), both 'drawn' and 'lost' are relevant.\n\nIn summary, since all drawn values are \u22643 and all lost values are \u22647, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}]}",
