    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. Each row represents a match that Galina voskoboeva played in.\n\nThe claim mentions three games on hard courts. So, I need to check how many times 'hard' appears in the 'surface' column and whether those correspond to matches where she played.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: surface is \"hard (i)\". That's a hard court.\n2. Second row: surface is \"hard (i)\" again.\n3. Third row: surface is \"clay\" \u2014 not hard, so ignore.\n4. Fourth row: surface is \"hard\".\n5. Fifth row: surface is \"clay\" \u2014 again, not relevant.\n\nWait, but the claim says three games on a hard court. Let's count:\n\n- Row 0 (index starts at 0): Hard\n- Row 1: Hard\n- Row 3: Hard\n\nThat's three instances where the surface was hard. Now, each row represents one game, right? So she played in three matches on hard courts.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should also check if all these surfaces are indeed hard and if each row is a separate game. The opponent names are different each time, so they're distinct games.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where 'surface' is 'hard'. That's rows 0,1,3 under the surface column. Each of those counts as one game on a hard court.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she played three games on hard courts is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Galina Voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. There's no mention of Galina Voskoboeva in the table; instead, the opponents listed are Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. So, maybe the player we're looking at is someone else? Wait, perhaps the claim refers to Galina Voskoboeva as one of these players or opponents.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Galina Voskoboeva play,\" so I assume she's the one whose games are being counted. But in the table, there's no row where she is the player; instead, she isn't listed at all. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to someone else's games, but that seems unlikely. Wait, looking again, the opponents are different each time, so Galina Voskoboeva might not be present in this table. That could mean that there's no data about her here, making it impossible to verify the claim. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look at each row:\n\nRow 0: Runner-up against Matea Mezak on a hard court.\nRow 1: Winner against Oleksandra Kravets on hard (i).\nRow 2: Runner-up against Roberta Vinci on clay.\nRow 3: Runner-up against Lilia Osterloh on hard.\nRow 4: Winner against Alice Canepa on clay.\n\nSo, in the table, there are two matches played on clay (rows 2 and 4) out of a total of five matches. That's 40%, not 20%. But wait, does this relate to Galina Voskoboeva? Because none of these rows mention her as the player; she's only mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the table is about Galina Voskoboeva's matches, but the opponent column lists who she played against. So, if that's the case, then Galina has five matches in total: two on clay (rows 2 and 4) and three on hard court (rows 0,1,3). So, out of five games, two were on clay.\n\nSo, the percentage would be 2/5 = 40%, not 20%. Therefore, the claim that she played 20% of her games on clay is false. The correct percentage is 40%.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because according to the table, Galina Voskoboeva (assuming this table is about her) played in five matches, two of which were on clay courts.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the rows where the surface is clay. That would be row 2 and row 4. So, I'll list those as relevant_ cells with their respective column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva played 20% of her games on clay courts.

The claim mentions Galina Voskoboeva, but looking at the table, I don't see her name in any of the rows under the 'opponent' column. Instead, the opponents listed are Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. \n\nSince Galina isn't listed as an opponent or participant in any of these matches, it seems she's not part of the data provided here. Without any entries for her outcomes on clay or hard courts, I can't calculate her win rates on either surface.\n\nThe claim requires comparing win rates between two surfaces (clay and hard court). To do that, there should be at least one match result where Galina participated on each surface type. However, the table doesn't include any of her matches, so there's no data to support or refute the claim about her performance.\n\nTherefore, without relevant data for Galina Voskoboeva in the provided table, it's impossible to verify if her win rates are equal on both surfaces.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court, and 1 on clay\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the table structure. It has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a match that Galina Voskoboeva played in.\n\nThe claim mentions two surfaces: hard court with 3 games and clay with 1 game. So, I need to check how many times each of these surfaces appears in the table where she was involved.\n\nLooking at the 'surface' column:\n\n1. First row (row index 0): surface is \"hard (i)\".\n2. Second row (row index 1): surface is \"hard (i)\".\n3. Third row (row index 2): surface is \"clay\".\n4. Fourth row (row index 3): surface is \"hard\".\n5. Fifth row (row index 4): surface is \"clay\".\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\n- Hard court: rows 0, 1, and 3. That's three instances.\n- Clay: rows 2 and 4. Wait, that's two instances, but the claim says only one.\n\nHmm, this discrepancy suggests an issue with the claim. The table shows two clay surfaces, not one as claimed. Therefore, the total number of games on hard is correct (3), but the clay count is off by one.\n\nAdditionally, each row represents a single match or game outcome, so each surface entry corresponds to one game.

My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. It looks like it's an HTML table with headers: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row under these headers represents a match that Galina Voskoboeva played. \n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"on average, galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 point.\" Hmm, I need to parse this carefully. The user is saying that on average, Galina loses matches with her score being around 4 points.\n\nWait a second, but in tennis scoring, each set has games, not points. So the \"score\" column shows sets and games, not points. For example, in the first row, the score is \"6-4, 4-6, 4-6.\" That means she won 6 games to 4 in the first set but lost the next two sets.\n\nSo the claim seems a bit off because it's talking about points when the table provides game scores. Points are not directly available here. Maybe the user is making an assumption that a certain number of points per game translates into total points, but without knowing how many games she played or how each game was scored in terms of points, we can't calculate her average points lost.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n1. Runner-up: score 6-4,4-6,4-6. She won one set and lost two.\n2. Winner: 6-4,6-2. She won both sets.\n3. Runner-up: 3-6,4-6. Lost both sets.\n4. Runner-up: 6-7,4-6. Lost both sets.\n5. Winner: 6-1,6-2. Won both sets.\n\nIn the rows where she's a runner-up (lost the tournament), her scores vary. For example, in row 0 and 2, she lost some games but not all points. \n\nBut since the claim is about average points lost per match, which isn't directly given because each game could have varying points. Without knowing how many points were played in each game, we can't compute an average.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. The relevant cells would be the score column where she was a runner-up (rows 0,2,3). \n\nSo my answer is FALSE because the table doesn't provide enough information about points, only games in sets.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Galina Voskoboeva's average points lost per match.

Each row includes information about the outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI need to check each row for the surface type because that's what the claim is about. The surfaces mentioned in the table are: hard (i), hard, clay, hard, and clay.\n\nWait, let me list them out:\n\n1. Tipton - hard (i)\n2. Mont-de-Marsan - hard (i)\n3. Latina - clay\n4.

Galina Voskoboeva has an equal win rate on both clay and hard courts.\n2.

Cuneo, Italy on 6 June 2006: Opponent is Alice Canepa.\n\nNow, I'll check each opponent to see if they appear more than once:\n\n- Matea Mezak appears only in the first row.\n- Oleksandra Kravets appears only in the second row.\n- Roberta Vinci is unique to the third row.\n- Lilia Osterloh is listed in the fourth row only.\n- Alice Canepa is in the fifth row, and I don't see her anywhere else.\n\nWait a minute\u2014looking closely, all opponents are different. There's no instance where Galina played the same opponent more than once. So, even on June 6, 2006, she played against Alice Canepa only once. The claim mentions an exception for June 6, 2006, but in reality, there was no repeat opponent that day either.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that Galina never played the same opponent more than once except on June 6, 2006. However, since she didn't play any opponent twice at all, including that date, the exception part is incorrect because it's implying a second match which doesn't exist. So, the claim isn't fully supported; in fact, the exception clause is unnecessary and makes the statement false.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"except in 6 June 2006.\" But if she didn't play anyone twice on that date either, then the entire condition holds true because she never played any opponent more than once. So maybe I was overcomplicating it. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe claim is saying she never played any opponent more than once except possibly in one instance on June 6, which would mean she might have played someone twice that day. But looking at the data, all her opponents are unique across all matches. So, there's no case where she played the same opponent multiple times, including on June 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is actually true because she didn't play any opponent more than once, so the exception part doesn't apply since there were no repeats. Or wait\u2014is the claim stating that the only time she might have played someone twice was on June 6? But in reality, she didn't play anyone twice at all.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim is: \"Galina Voskoboeva never played the same opponent more than once except in 6 June 2006.\" So it's suggesting that except for one instance on June 6, she never had a repeat opponent. But in the data, all her opponents are unique, so there was no repeat on June 6 either.\n\nTherefore, since the claim implies that there was at least one repeat (on June 6), but the data shows no repeats at all, the claim is false because it's asserting an exception where none exists.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva never played any opponent more than once except possibly on June 6, 2006. However, upon examining the table, all opponents are unique across all matches. Therefore, there were no instances of playing the same opponent twice, including on June 6. This means the claim is false because it incorrectly suggests a repeat that didn't occur.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"on average, Galina Voskoboeva lose with only 4 points against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table to find any matches involving these opponents. The table has five rows, each representing a match outcome.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is Matea Mezak. Outcome is runner-up. Score: 6-4, 4-6, 4-6. So Galina lost here but against someone else.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets. Outcome is winner. Wait, that's a win for Galina, so she didn't lose this one. The score was 6-4, 6-2. She won both sets, so she didn't lose to Kravets.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is Roberta Vinci. Outcome is runner-up. Score: 3-6, 4-6. So a loss here, but against someone else.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is Lilia Osterloh. Outcome is runner-up. Score: 6-7, 4-6. Another loss, but not against the mentioned opponents.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is Alice Canepa. Outcome is winner. The score was 6-1, 6-2. So Galina won this match too; she didn't lose to Canepa.\n\nWait a minute, in the claim, it's said that Galina lost against Kravets and Canepa on average with only 4 points. But looking at the data:\n\n- Against Kravets (Row 1), Galina actually won.\n- Against Canepa (Row 4), she also won.\n\nSo both times, she didn't lose; she won. Therefore, the claim that she lost against these two opponents is incorrect. \n\nAdditionally, even if I were to consider points per set or overall points, since in the matches where she did lose, like Row 0 and Row 2, her scores don't involve exactly 4 points on average. But in this case, it's clear that she won those specific matches, so the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells here are:\n\n- For Kravets: Outcome (row 1) as \"winner\" which shows she didn't lose.\n- For Canepa: Outcome (row 4) as \"winner\", again showing a win instead of a loss.\n\nSo these two rows directly contradict the claim, hence the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
