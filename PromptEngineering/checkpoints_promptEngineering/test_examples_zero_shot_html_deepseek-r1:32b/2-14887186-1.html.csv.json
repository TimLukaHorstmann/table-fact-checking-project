Once I locate their rows, I'll check the \"school\" column for both to see if it says \"south carolina.\"\n\nStarting with Kirk Phares: Scanning the table, I see a row where the player is listed as Kirk Phares. Looking at that row, under the \"school\" column, it's listed as South Carolina. So Kirk Phares does come from South Carolina.\n\nNext, for Joe Gomes: Continuing through the table, I find another row with Joe Gomes as the player. Checking his school, it also says South Carolina. Therefore, Joe Gomes is from South Carolina too.\n\nSince both players are indeed from South Carolina according to the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Kirk Phares and Joe Gomes come from South Carolina. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- Kirk Phares is listed under row 6 with school \"south carolina.\"\n- Joe Gomes is in row 17, also from \"south carolina.\"\n\nThus, the relevant cells confirm the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"mike wright and frank brixius come from the same state\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: round, pick, player, position, school. So each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Mike Wright and Frank Brixius. My goal is to find out where each of them went to school because that should indicate their state origin.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- For Mike Wright: I scan the rows until I find his name. He's in row 3 (index starts at 0). The details are:\n   - round: 6\n   - pick: 65\n   - player: mike wright\n   - position: tackle\n   - school: minnesota\n\n- For Frank Brixius: I continue scanning until I find his name in row 6 (index 6, but wait, let me recount. The rows are from 0 to 20-something). Wait, no, the table has multiple rows. Let's see:\n\nRow indices start at 0 for the first data row. So:\n\n- Row 3: mike wright\n- Then I continue looking and find frank brixius in row 8 (index 8). His details are:\n   - round: 9\n   - pick: 101\n   - player: frank brixius\n   - position: tackle\n   - school: minnesota\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check because the rows go from 0 to 20? No, actually, looking back:\n\nThe table has 20 rounds, each as a row. So Mike Wright is in round 6, which would be row index 5 (since the first data row is index 0). Wait no, let me recount:\n\nWait the initial rows are from 1 to 20? No, looking at the HTML, the tbody has 20 tr elements, so each player is a separate row. So:\n\nRow indexes go from 0 to 19.\n\nSo Mike Wright: in round 6, which would be the 6th data row (index 5). Let me verify:\n\n- Row 0: round 1\n- Row 1: round 2\n- Row 2: round 5\nWait no, looking back at the HTML structure, each tr is a player. So each row represents one player.\n\nSo Mike Wright is in the fourth data row (since after the header). Let me list them:\n\nRow index 0: round 1, Tom Moore\nRow 1: round 2, Bob Jeter\nRow 2: round5, Dale Hackbart\nWait no, that can't be. Wait looking back at the HTML tbody:\n\nThe first tr is round 1, pick 5, tom moore.\n\nSo row index 0 is Mike Wright? No, wait:\n\nNo, the rows are as follows:\n\n- Row 0: Tom Moore (round 1)\n- Row 1: Bob Jeter (round2)\n- Row 2: Dale Hackbart (round5)\nWait no, that's not right. Wait, looking at the tbody in HTML:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>...</tr> for each player.\n\nSo row index starts from 0. So Mike Wright is in round6, which would be the sixth data row? Let me count:\n\nRow 0: round1\nRow1: round2\nRow2: round5 (Dale Hackbart)\nWait that can't be. Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting because the rounds aren't sequential.\n\nLooking back at the HTML table body, the first tr is round1, pick5, Tom Moore.\n\nThen next rows are:\n\nround2, Bob Jeter\n\nthen round5? Or wait, maybe each row is just a player regardless of round order. Let me check:\n\nThe tbody has 20 tr elements:\n\nLooking at the structure:\n\n<tr> for round1 (row0)\n<tr> round2 (row1)\n<tr> round5 (row2) ? No, that can't be.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's list all players with their row indices to make it clear.\n\nEach tr is one player, so the rows are:\n\nRow 0: Tom Moore\nRow1: Bob Jeter\nRow2: Dale Hackbart (round5)\nRow3: Mike Wright (round6)\nWait no, that can't be because after round2 comes round5? That seems odd. Wait perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rounds are not in order. Let me look at all the rounds:\n\nLooking through each tr:\n\n- Row0: round1\n- Row1: round2\n- Row2: round5\n- Row3: round6 (Mike Wright)\n- Row4: round19\nWait that can't be right because row indices should go from 0 upwards, but the rounds are in order. Wait no, perhaps the table is ordered by rounds from 1 to 20.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nAfter round2 comes round5? That doesn't make sense. So I think perhaps the rows are in the order of rounds 1 to 20, each as a separate tr. But that's not matching because row indices would be up to 19 (for 20 players). Let me recount.\n\nWait the tbody has 20 tr elements, so each represents a player from round1 to round20? Or perhaps each is just one player regardless of the round number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Instead, I'll search for Mike Wright and Frank Brixius by their names in the table.\n\nLooking for \"mike wright\": found in row3 (index 3) because:\n\n- Row0: Tom Moore\n- Row1: Bob Jeter\n- Row2: Dale Hackbart\n- Row3: Mike Wright\n\nWait no, looking at the HTML tbody:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>tom moore</td>\n<td>end</td>\n<td>purdue</td>\n</tr>\n\nThen next rows:\n\nRow1: round2, pick7, Bob Jeter, end, purdue.\n\nWait no, perhaps the rounds are in order from 1 to 20, each as a separate tr. So Mike Wright is in row5 (index5) because:\n\nLooking at the tbody's first few rows:\n\n- Row0: round1\n- Row1: round2\n- Row2: round3? Or maybe not. Wait perhaps each tr represents one pick, so the rounds are sequential.\n\nBut regardless, to find Mike Wright and Frank Brixius, I can scan through the table.\n\nMike Wright is in row3:\n\nLooking at each player's name:\n\nRow0: Tom Moore\nRow1: Bob Jeter\nRow2: Dale Hackbart (round5)\nRow3: Mike Wright (round6)\n\nWait no, perhaps not. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to note that Mike Wright is in the 4th row (index3) as per the initial data:\n\nThe first tr after header is Tom Moore, then Bob Jeter, then Dale Hackbart (row2), then Mike Wright (row3).\n\nSo school for Mike Wright is Minnesota.\n\nThen Frank Brixius: I look further down the table.\n\nContinuing from row4 onward:\n\nRow4: Gilmer Lewis? No. Let me check:\n\nAfter Mike Wright in row3, next rows are:\n\nRow4: royce whittington (round19)\nWait no, perhaps not. Alternatively, looking for Frank Brixius.\n\nI think he is in row6: round9, pick something, school?\n\nLooking through the tbody:\n\n- Row0: Tom Moore\n- Row1: Bob Jeter\n- Row2: Dale Hackbart\n- Row3: Mike Wright (school Minnesota)\n- Row4: someone else\n...\nRow6: Frank Brixius? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that both players are from the same school.\n\nBut regardless, after locating them:\n\nMike Wright's school is Minnesota\n\nFrank Brixius' school is also Minnesota.\n\nSo they attend the same university.\n</think>\n\nBoth Mike Wright and Frank Brixius attended the University of Minnesota. \n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{University of Minnesota}}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"green bay pick the running back at the first round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to see if there's a row for round 1. Scanning the 'round' column, I find that the first row has 'round' = 1. That's where the first-round pick would be. The player picked in this round is \"tom moore\" from Vanderbilt. His position is listed as \"running back\". \n\nNow, the claim mentions \"green bay\", but looking at the table, there isn't a column for team or any mention of Green Bay in the data provided. The table only includes information about the round number, pick number, player name, position, and school. So while we can confirm that a running back was picked in the first round, we don't have information about which team (like Green Bay) made that pick.\n\nSince the claim specifically attributes the pick to \"green bay\", but there's no data in the table linking any team to these picks, I can't verify if Green Bay indeed picked that player. Therefore, without evidence supporting that it was Green Bay, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because while a running back was picked in the first round, there's no information about Green Bay making that pick.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in round 1, a player named Tom Moore was picked as a running back. However, there is no information indicating that this pick belongs to the Green Bay team.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Check rows where 'round' is 1.\n2. **Check for Team Information:** Look for any mention of \"green bay\" in the relevant row; it's not present.\n3. **Determine Position:** Confirm that Tom Moore was picked as a running back, which matches part of the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 2 defensive in the team green bay\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"defensive,\" which probably refers to players who play defensive positions. Looking at the table, there's a column called \"position.\" So I need to check each player's position and count how many are defensive.\n\nThe table has multiple rows with different players. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Tom Moore: Running back \u2013 that's an offensive position.\n2. Bob Jeter: Cornerback \u2013 defensive.\n3. Dale Hackbart: Defensive back \u2013 defensive.\n4. Mike Wright: Tackle \u2013 tackle can be both offense and defense, but in this context, since it's listed under \"position,\" I think it refers to a defensive tackle. So defensive.\n5. Kirk Phares: Guard \u2013 offensive position (offensive guard).\n6. Don Hitt: Center \u2013 offensive position.\n7. Frank Brixius: Tackle \u2013 likely defensive tackle again. Defensive.\n8. Ron Ray: Tackle \u2013 same as above, defensive.\n9. Harry Ball: Tackle \u2013 defensive.\n10. Paul Winslow: Defensive back \u2013 defensive.\n11. Jon Gilliam: Center \u2013 offensive.\n12. Garney Henley: Back \u2013 could be running back or defensive back. The term \"back\" is a bit ambiguous here. If it's a running back, then offensive; if it's a defensive back, then defensive. But since the position is just listed as \"back,\" I might need to infer based on other data or assume it's not defensive unless specified.\n13. John Littlejohn: Back \u2013 same ambiguity as above.\n14. Joe Gomes: Back \u2013 same again.\n15. Royce Whittington: Tackle \u2013 defensive.\n16. Rich Brooks: End \u2013 in football, ends are usually defensive (defensive end). So defensive.\n17. Gilmer Lewis: Tackle \u2013 defensive.\n\nWait, let me recount the defensive players:\n\n- Bob Jeter: Cornerback (defensive) \u2192 Row 2\n- Dale Hackbart: Defensive back \u2192 Row 3\n- Mike Wright: Tackle (likely defensive) \u2192 Row 4\n- Frank Brixius: Tackle \u2192 Row 7\n- Ron Ray: Tackle \u2192 Row 8\n- Harry Ball: Tackle \u2192 Row 9\n- Paul Winslow: Defensive back \u2192 Row 10\n- Royce Whittington: Tackle \u2192 Row 15\n- Rich Brooks: End (defensive) \u2192 Row 16\n- Gilmer Lewis: Tackle \u2192 Row 20\n\nThat's more than two defensive players. The claim says only two, but according to the table, there are at least 9 or 10 defensive players.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Bob Jeter (Row 2)\n2. Dale Hackbart (Row 3)\n3. Mike Wright (Row4) - tackle\n4. Frank Brixius (Row7) - tackle\n5. Ron Ray (Row8) - tackle\n6. Harry Ball (Row9) - tackle\n7. Paul Winslow (Row10) - defensive back\n8. Royce Whittington (Row15) - tackle\n9. Rich Brooks (Row16) - end\n10. Gilmer Lewis (Row20) - tackle\n\nThat's 10 defensive players, not two. So the claim is definitely false.\n\nNow, regarding \"team green bay,\" I don't see any information about teams in the table. The table only lists players and their positions but doesn't specify which team they are from. Therefore, we can't confirm if these players belong to Green Bay or another team. However, since the claim is that there are only two defensive players in Green Bay's team, and our count shows more than two, regardless of the team context, it's false.\n\nWait a second, maybe \"there be only 2 defensive\" refers to defensive positions, but the table has multiple entries for defensive positions. So regardless of the team, the number isn't two. Or if the claim is about Green Bay having only two, then without knowing which players are on Green Bay, we can't verify it fully. But perhaps the assumption is that all these players are part of Green Bay.\n\nBut given the table doesn't specify teams, I think the key issue here is the number of defensive players, which is way more than two. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are only 2 defensive players on the team, but the table shows multiple defensive positions beyond that count.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a table in HTML format and a claim about the Green Bay team having six tackles in 1960. My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim entails. The claim mentions \"green bay\" but looking at the table, there's no column for team names\u2014it only lists players with their positions and schools. So, I can't directly tie these players to a specific team like Green Bay unless I infer it from other data.\n\nNext, the claim refers to having six tackles in 1960. The table doesn't have a year column either, so there's no way to confirm that all these players were on the team in 1960. Without knowing the year each player was drafted or joined the team, I can't verify their presence in 1960.\n\nLooking at the positions, I see multiple entries for 'tackle' and other positions like 'guard', 'center', etc. However, without information on which team these players were part of or their years with that team, it's impossible to count how many tackles Green Bay had specifically in 1960.\n\nI also considered if the schools listed could indicate any relation to Green Bay, but schools don't necessarily correlate directly with professional teams like the Packers. The draft picks might give some clues about when they were selected, but without knowing their team assignments after being drafted, that's not helpful either.\n\nIn summary, the table lacks essential information\u2014specifically, team names and years\u2014which are crucial to validate the claim. Therefore, based on the given data, I can't confirm or deny the claim, leading me to conclude it as FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: round, pick, player, position, school. The players in question are Mike Wright and Harry Ball. \n\nI need to find their respective rows in the table. Scanning through the players:\n\n- Mike Wright is listed in row 6 (since counting starts from 0, but wait, no, looking at the HTML, each <tr> is a row, starting with round=1 as the first data row. Let me recount: \n\nRows are:\n1. tom moore\n2. bob jeter\n3. dale hackbart\n4. mike wright (row 3)\n...\n8. harry ball (row 11)\n\nWait, actually, in the HTML, the first <tr> after thead is round=1, so that's row index 0? Or does it start at 1? Hmm, perhaps I should count them as per their order.\n\nLooking back: The table has a thead with one row, then tbody starts. Each player is in a tr under tbody. So the first data row is for tom moore (round=1), which would be row index 0. Then next rows increment from there.\n\nSo Mike Wright is in the fourth row of data, which is row index 3: because counting starts at 0. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: tom moore\nRow 1: bob jeter\nRow 2: dale hackbart\nRow 3: mike wright (position tackle, school minnesota)\nRow 4: kirk phares\n...\nRow 8: harry ball\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML:\n\n<tr> for tom moore is first data row: that's row index 0.\nThen bob jeter: row index 1.\ndale hackbart: row 2.\nmike wright: row 3.\n\nContinuing down to find Harry Ball. Let me count each <tr> under tbody:\n\n1. tom moore (row 0)\n2. bob jeter (row 1)\n3. dale hackbart (row 2)\n4. mike wright (row 3) - his school is minnesota\n5. kirk phares (row 4)\n6. don hitt (row 5)\n7. frank brixius (row 6)\n8. ron ray (row 7)\n9. harry ball (row 8) - school is boston college\n\nWait, no: the rows are as follows:\n\nLooking at the tbody, each <tr> represents a player:\n\n1. tom moore\n2. bob jeter\n3. dale hackbart\n4. mike wright\n5. kirk phares\n6. don hitt\n7. frank brixius\n8. ron ray\n9. harry ball (this would be row index 8)\n10. royce whittington\n11. rich brooks\n12. gilmer lewis\n\nWait, actually, the tbody has 20 rows? No, looking back, the tbody has multiple <tr>s:\n\nLooking at the HTML provided, under tbody, there are 20 <tr> elements (from round=1 to round=20). So each player is in their own row.\n\nSo Mike Wright is in row where round=4 (looking at the data):\n\nWait no, let's check the exact rows. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: round=1, pick=3, player=tom moore, position=QB, school=michigan\n\nRow 1: round=2, pick=8, bob jeter, DB, michigan state\n\nRow 2: round=3, pick=15, dale hackbart, RB, nebraska\n\nRow 3: round=4, pick=20, mike wright, tackle, minnesota\n\n...\n\nLooking for Harry Ball. Let's go down the rows:\n\nRow 8: round=9, pick=76, harry ball, tackle, boston college.\n\nSo Mike Wright is in row index 3, school minnesota.\n\nHarry Ball is in row index 8, school boston college.\n\nWait, but the claim is about their states. The 'school' column gives us the state? Because the schools are from different states: minnesota and massachusetts (boston college is in MA). So Mike Wright's school is Minnesota (state MN), Harry Ball's school is Boston College (state MA).\n\nTherefore, they come from different states.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The 'school' column shows the university, which is located in a specific state.

Each row corresponds to a different player selected in the 1960 Green Bay Packers draft or something similar since all the schools are from that era.\n\nThe claim is about whether there was only one defensive back on the team that year. To verify this, I need to check how many players were drafted as \"defensive backs\" in that season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'position' column which indicates the player's role. So, I'll go through each entry and count how many times \"defensive back\" appears.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Round 1: Tom Moore is a running back.\n2. Round 2: Bob Jeter is a cornerback.\n3. Round 5: Dale Hackbart is a defensive back. That's one.\n4. Round 6: Mike Wright is a tackle.\n5. Round 7: Kirk Phares is a guard.\n6. Round 8: Don Hitt is a center.\n7. Round 9: Frank Brixius is a tackle.\n8. Round 11: Ron Ray is a tackle.\n9. Round 12: Harry Ball is a tackle.\n10. Round 13: Paul Winslow is a defensive back. That's two.\n11. Round 14: Jon Gilliam is a center.\n12. Round 15: Garney Henley is a back.\n13. Round 16: John Littlejohn is a back.\n14. Round 17: Joe Gomes is a back.\n15. Round 18: Royce Whittington is a tackle.\n16. Round 19: Rich Brooks is an end.\n17. Round 20: Gilmer Lewis is a tackle.\n\nSo, I found two defensive backs: Dale Hackbart in round 5 and Paul Winslow in round 13. That means there are at least two players who were drafted as defensive backs for the team that year.\n\nWait, but does this table represent all the draft picks or just some of them? The claim is about the entire 1960 Green Bay team, so if the table only includes a portion of the draft, maybe there are more defensive backs elsewhere. However, since I don't have access to other data, I can only go by what's provided.\n\nGiven that, according to this table, there are two defensive backs. Therefore, the claim that there was only one is false.\n\nSo, my answer should be FALSE because there are two defensive backs listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists two players with the position \"defensive back\": Dale Hackbart (row 4) and Paul Winslow (row 12). Since the claim states there was only one, this makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"green bay pick the run back in the third round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand each part of the claim:\n1. \"Green Bay\" refers to a team, likely the Green Bay Packers.\n2. \"Pick the run back\" suggests they selected a running back player.\n3. This selection was made in the third round.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll check each row for relevant information. The columns are 'round', 'pick', 'player', 'position', and 'school'. \n\nI should look for any entries where:\n- The round is 3 (third round).\n- The position is \"running back\".\n\nLet's go through the rows one by one.\n\nRow 0: Round 1, pick 5. Player Tom Moore, position running back from Vanderbilt. So this is a running back, but it's in the first round, not third.\n\nNext rows:\nRound 2: Bob Jeter, cornerback.\nRound 5: Dale Hackbart, defensive back.\nRound 6: Mike Wright, tackle.\nRound 7: Kirk Phares, guard.\nRound 8: Don Hitt, center.\nRound 9: Frank Brixius, tackle.\nRound 11: Ron Ray, tackle.\nRound 12: Harry Ball, tackle.\nRound 13: Paul Winslow, defensive back.\nRound 14: Jon Gilliam, center.\nRound 15: Garney Henley, back.\nRound 16: John Littlejohn, back.\nRound 17: Joe Gomes, back.\nRound 18: Royce Whittington, tackle.\nRound 19: Rich Brooks, end.\nRound 20: Gilmer Lewis, tackle.\n\nI don't see any row where the round is 3. The rounds go from 1 to 20, but there's a jump from round 2 to 5 in the table, skipping round 3 and 4. This means that either those rounds aren't listed or perhaps only specific picks are shown.\n\nSince there's no data for the third round, I can't confirm whether Green Bay picked a running back then. The claim might be FALSE because either they didn't pick a running back in the third round, or the information isn't available. But based on the table provided, there's no third-round pick listed at all.\n\nTherefore, since the third round isn't present and no relevant cells support the claim, I have to conclude it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided an HTML table with information about players, their positions, schools, and the rounds/picks they were selected in. The claim is that \"green bay have 7 tackle on their team in 1960.\" I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each column represents. The columns are: round, pick, player, position, and school. So for each row, we have details about a player's draft information.\n\nThe claim mentions Green Bay having 7 tackles. I'm assuming this refers to the Green Bay Packers, an NFL team. Now, in 1960, the Packers were part of the NFL, so it makes sense that they would be selecting players through the draft.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check for all entries where the position is \"tackle\" and see how many such players there are. Each row represents a player selected, possibly by different teams, but the table doesn't specify which team selected each player\u2014only their details like school and position. So, without knowing who picked whom, it's tricky to say if all these tackles went to Green Bay.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is that in 1960, through the draft rounds shown here (which go up to round 20), Green Bay selected seven tackles. But the problem is that the table doesn't mention which team picked each player. It only lists players, their positions, and schools.\n\nSo, without information about which team each player was drafted by, I can't directly link these players to the Green Bay Packers. Therefore, it's impossible to verify whether all seven tackles in this table were indeed selected by Green Bay or if they went to other teams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that there are seven tackles available for selection in 1960, but that doesn't seem right because the table lists specific players and their draft positions. So each row is a player who was drafted in those rounds, possibly by different NFL teams.\n\nTherefore, since I can't determine which team selected these tackles, I can't confirm if Green Bay has seven of them. The claim isn't supported by the given data because there's no information about the teams that picked these players.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't specify which team drafted each player, so we can't verify how many tackles went to Green Bay.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
