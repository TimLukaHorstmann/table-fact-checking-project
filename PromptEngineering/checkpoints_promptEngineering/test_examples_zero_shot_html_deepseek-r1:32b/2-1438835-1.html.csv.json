The claim states: \n\n\"When the home score be 0 - 1 in the 2001 - 02 uefa cup the club be st gallen and when the away score be 0 - 1 also in the 2001 - 02 uefa cup the club be feyenoord.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. When the home score is 0-1 in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, the club is St Gallen.\n2. When the away score is 0-1 in the same competition and season, the club is Feyenoord.\n\nI need to verify each part against the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on rows where the season is \"2001 - 02\" and the competition is \"uefa cup.\" There are three such rows:\n\n- Row 1: Round 1, Club matador p\u00fachov\n- Row 2: Round 2, Club st gallen\n- Row 3: Round 3, Club feyenoord\n\nFor the first part of the claim, checking where the home score is 0-1. I'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1 (matador p\u00fachov): Home score is 2 - 1. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2 (st gallen): Home score is 0 - 1. This matches the first condition, and the club is indeed st gallen. So this part holds true.\n\nNow for the second part: when the away score is 0-1 in the same season and competition, does the club become Feyenoord?\n\nLooking at each row again:\n\n- Row 1 (matador p\u00fachov): Away score is 0 - 0. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2 (st gallen): Away score is 4 - 1. Close but not exactly 0-1.\n- Row 3 (feyenoord): Home score is 2 - 2, away score is 0 - 1. This matches the second condition, and the club is feyenoord as stated.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied based on rows 2 and 3 of the table.

I'll start by carefully reading the claim and then cross-verifying each part against the provided HTML table.\n\nThe claim states: \"sc freiburg play in the uefa europe league competition 3 times in 2013 - 14 all in the group h round against club sevilla, estoril, and slovan liberec.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of this claim:\n\n1. **Team Name**: The club mentioned is \"sc freiburg.\" I need to check if \"sc freiburg\" appears in the table.\n2. **Competition**: It's stated that they play in the \"uefa europe league competition.\"\n3. **Season**: The season in question is 2013 - 14.\n4. **Number of Times Participated**: They claim to have played three times.\n5. **Round Details**: All participations are in the \"group h\" round.\n6. **Opponents**: The clubs they played against are sevilla, estoril, and slovan liberec.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. Let's analyze each row to see if it matches these criteria.\n\nThe table has 7 rows:\n\n- Row 0: 1995 - 96 season, uefa cup\n- Row 1: 2001 - 02 season, uefa cup\n- Row 2: 2001 - 02 season, uefa cup\n- Row 3: 2001 - 02 season, uefa cup\n- Row 4: 2013 - 14 season, uefa europa league, group h, sevilla\n- Row 5: 2013 - 14 season, uefa europa league, group h, estoril\n- Row 6: 2013 - 14 season, uefa europa league, group h, slovan liberec\n\nLooking at the \"club\" column:\n\n- Rows 4, 5, and 6 have clubs sevilla, estoril, and slovan liberec respectively.\n- There is no mention of \"sc freiburg\" in any row. The closest is \"slavia prague,\" \"matador p\u00fachov,\" \"st gallen,\" \"feyenoord,\" \"sevilla,\" \"estoril,\" and \"slovan liberec.\"\n\nSince \"sc freiburg\" isn't listed as a club in the table, especially not in the 2013-14 season, this raises a red flag. The claim mentions that sc freiburg played three times against these clubs, but the table doesn't include them at all.\n\nAdditionally, even if we were to consider the competitions and opponents:\n\n- The season is correct (2013 - 14) for rows 4,5,6.\n- The competition is \"uefa europa league,\" which aligns with the claim's \"uefa europe league\" (though there's a slight name variation).\n- All three rows are in \"group h.\"\n- The opponents mentioned in the claim match the clubs listed in these rows.\n\nHowever, without sc freiburg being present as a club in any of these rows, the core assertion about their participation is unsupported. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions that \"sc freiburg\" plays three times against specific clubs in the 2013-14 season's group h round of the uefa europa league.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step and check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim has three main points:\n\n1. The highest away score is 4-1 in the 2001-02 season.\n2. The lowest away score is 0-0 on two occasions: once in the 1995-96 season and again in the 2001-02 season.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the relevant cells that pertain to the away scores for each season mentioned.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor the 2001-02 season:\n- Row 1: Club is matador p\u00fachov. Away score is 0-0.\n- Row 2: Club is st gallen. Away score is 4-1 (since it's listed as \"away\" column here, but wait, actually looking back, the columns are \"home\" and \"away.\" So for row 2, which is st gallen, home is 0-1, away is 4-1. Wait, no\u2014actually, in row 2, the club is st gallen, round is second round. The away score would be when they played as the away team. Looking at the structure: each row represents a match where the club is either home or away? Or does each row represent their performance both home and away?\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how the table is structured. Each row likely represents a single match or a set of matches for a particular round. The columns \"home\" and \"away\" probably denote the scores when they played at home versus away.\n\nSo for st gallen in 2001-02, second round: their home score is 0-1, and their away score is 4-1. So that's a significant away win with a high score.\n\nFor matador p\u00fachov in the same season (row 1): home score is 2-1, away is 0-0.\n\nThen for feyenoord in row 3: home is 2-2, away is 0-1. So their away score was lower.\n\nNow, checking other rows:\n\nIn the 1995-96 season (row 0): club slavia prague. Home score is 1-2, away is 0-0.\n\nAnd in the 2013-14 season: looking at row 4, 5, 6\u2014away scores are 0-2 and 2-2 for slovan liberec. But these aren't part of the claim.\n\nSo focusing on the seasons mentioned:\n\nFor 2001-02:\n- matador p\u00fachov: away score 0-0.\n- st gallen: away score 4-1 (since in row 2, \"away\" column is 4-1).\nWait no\u2014wait, each row represents a match. For st gallen in second round, their away game was 4-1. So that's the away score for them.\n\nSo the highest away score would be 4-1 from st gallen in 2001-02 season.\n\nNow, checking if there are any higher away scores elsewhere:\n\nLooking at row 3: feyenoord, away is 0-1. Lower than 4-1.\n\nIn the other seasons:\nRow 0 (1995-96): away score 0-0.\nRow 4,5,6: 2013-14 season, but not relevant to the claim.\n\nSo highest away is indeed 4-1 in 2001-02. That checks out.\n\nNext part of the claim: lowest away score is 0-0 on two occasions\u2014once in 1995-96 and once in 2001-02.\n\nLooking at the 1995-96 season (row 0): club slavia prague, away score is 0-0.\n\nIn 2001-02: matador p\u00fachov's away score is 0-0. That's one instance.\n\nAdditionally, st gallen in second round has a home score of 0-1 and away 4-1\u2014so their away game isn't 0-0. Feyenoord in third round has an away score of 0-1. So only two instances where the away score is 0-0: row 0 (1995-96) and row 1 (2001-02).\n\nWait, but let's count:\n\nRow 0: away 0-0.\n\nRow 1: away 0-0.\n\nSo that's two occasions. Therefore, the claim states that the lowest away score is 0-0 on two occasions\u2014one in each of these seasons. So yes, that's accurate.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are correct based on the table.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is analyzed as follows:\n\n1. **Highest Away Score**: The highest away score of 4-1 occurs for st gallen in the 2001-02 season (row 2).\n\n2. **Lowest Away Score**: The lowest away score of 0-0 happens twice\u2014once for slavia prague in 1995-96 (row 0) and once for matador p\u00fachov in 2001-02 (row 1).\n\nBoth parts of the claim are verified against the table data, confirming the claim as TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}",

The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then return the relevant cells from the table that support our conclusion.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"when the club be estoril the season be 2013-14 and when the club be slavia prague the season be 1995-96.\" So, this claim is making two separate statements:\n\n1. Whenever the club is Estoril, the season should be 2013-14.\n2. Whenever the club is Slavia Prague, the season should be 1995-96.\n\nI need to check both parts of this claim against the provided table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the table structure: It has columns for season, competition, round, club, home, and away. There are six rows in total.\n\nLet's break down each part of the claim.\n\n**Part 1: Estoril Club Season**\n\nI'll search the 'club' column for entries where the club is \"estoril.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: slavia prague\n- Row 1: matador p\u00fachov\n- Row 2: st gallen\n- Row 3: feyenoord\n- Row 4: sevilla\n- Row 5: estoril\n- Row 6: slovan liberec\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the table has seven rows because it's in HTML and the tbody has seven tr elements. Let me recount correctly:\n\n1. Row 0: slavia prague (Season 1995-96)\n2. Row 1: matador p\u00fachov (Season 2001-02)\n3. Row 2: st gallen (Season 2001-02)\n4. Row 3: feyenoord (Season 2001-02)\n5. Row 4: sevilla (Season 2013-14)\n6. Row 5: estoril (Season 2013-14)\n7. Row 6: slovan liberec (Season 2013-14)\n\nWait, actually, in the given HTML table, the tbody has six tr elements:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 5.\n\nSo let me list them correctly:\n\n- Row 0: slavia prague, season 1995-96\n- Row 1: matador p\u00fachov, 2001-02\n- Row 2: st gallen, 2001-02\n- Row 3: feyenoord, 2001-02\n- Row 4: sevilla, 2013-14\n- Row 5: estoril, 2013-14\n- Wait, that's six rows. So the last row is index 5.\n\nWait no, in the provided HTML, after row 4 comes:\n\n<tr> (index 4): sevilla, season 2013-14\n\n<tr> (index 5): estoril, season 2013-14\n\n<tr> (index 6): slovan liberec, 2013-14.\n\nWait, no, the tbody has seven tr elements? Let me check again. The original HTML shows:\n\n<tbody>\n <tr> ... </tr>  // row 0\n <tr> ... </tr>  // row 1\n <tr> ... </tr>  // row 2\n <tr> ... </tr>  // row 3\n <tr> ... </tr>  // row 4\n <tr> ... </tr>  // row 5\n</tbody>\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\n<tbody>\n     <tr> ... 1995-96 ... </tr> (row 0)\n     <tr> ...2001-02... </tr> (row1)\n     <tr>...2001-02...</tr> (row2)\n     <tr>...2001-02...</tr> (row3)\n     <tr>...2013-14</tr> (row4)\n     <tr>...2013-14</tr> (row5)\n     <tr>...2013-14</tr> (row6)\n</tbody>\n\nWait, no. The tbody in the HTML provided has 7 tr elements? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the original HTML code:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr> 1995-96...</tr>\n<tr> 2001-02...</tr>\n<tr>2001-02...</tr>\n<tr>2001-02...</tr>\n<tr>2013-14...</tr>\n<tr>2013-14...</tr>\n<tr>2013-14...</tr>\n</tbody>\n\nYes, that's seven rows. So row indices 0 to 6.\n\nSo now:\n\nRow 0: club = slavia prague, season=1995-96\n\nRow1: matador p\u00fachov, 2001-02\n\nRow2: st gallen, 2001-02\n\nRow3: feyenoord, 2001-02\n\nRow4: sevilla, 2013-14\n\nRow5: estoril, 2013-14\n\nRow6: slovan liberec, 2013-14.\n\nSo in row5, club is estoril and season is 2013-14. Now, the claim says that whenever the club is estoril, the season should be 2013-14.\n\nIs there only one occurrence of estoril? Yes, it's in row5. So in this table, every time the club is estoril (which is once), the season is indeed 2013-14. Therefore, the first part of the claim holds true for this data.\n\n**Part 2: Slavia Prague Club Season**\n\nNow, checking when the club is slavia prague, does it always have the season 1995-96?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow0: club = slavia prague, season=1995-96\n\nIs there any other row where the club is slavia prague? Let me check all rows.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: yes, slavia prague, 1995-96\n\nRows1 to 6: other clubs. No other occurrence of slavia prague.\n\nTherefore, in this table, whenever the club is slavia prague (only once), the season is 1995-96. So the second part of the claim also holds true for this data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince both parts of the claim are satisfied by the provided data, the overall statement is correct based on this specific table. Therefore, we can confirm that:\n\n- Whenever the club is estoril, the season is 2013-14.\n- Whenever the club is slavia prague, the season is 1995-96.\n\nThus, the claim is accurate for the given data.\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\nTo ensure I haven't made a mistake:\n\n1. Checked all rows to confirm estoril appears only once with the correct season.\n2. Verified that slavia prague appears only once and with the correct season.\n3. Confirmed there are no other entries for these clubs in different seasons within the table.\n\nEverything seems consistent, so I'm confident in my conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two conditions about specific clubs and their corresponding seasons:\n\n1. Whenever the club is Estoril, the season should be 2013-14.\n2. Whenever the club is Slavia Prague, the season should be 1995-96.\n\nBy examining the table provided:\n\n- **Estoril** appears once in row 5 with the season 2013-14.\n- **Slavia Prague** appears once in row 0 with the season 1995-96.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied within the given data. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on this table.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claims hold true for the provided table. Whenever Estoril is the club, the season is 2013-14, and whenever Slavia Prague is the club, the season is 1995-96.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Both statements in the claim are accurate based on the given data.}}",

The main points are:\n\n1. Club involved: sc freiburg\n2. Competition: uefa cup\n3. Round: first round\n4. Seasons: 1995-96 and 2001-02\n\nI'll check the table for any mention of \"sc freiburg.\" Looking through each row, I see the clubs listed are:\n\n- slavia prague (Row 0)\n- matador p\u00fachov (Row 1)\n- st gallen (Row 2)\n- feyenoord (Row 3)\n- sevilla (Row 4)\n- estoril (Row 5)\n- slovan liberec (Row 6)\n\nI don't see \"sc freiburg\" in any of these rows. That's a red flag because if the claim is about sc freiburg playing, but they aren't listed in the table at all, then that part isn't supported.\n\nNext, let's look at the competitions and rounds to see if the other parts hold up, even though the club name isn't present. The competition mentioned is \"uefa cup,\" which appears in rows 0-3 (seasons 1995-96 and 2001-02). \n\nFor season 1995-96: Only row 0 mentions uefa cup, first round. But the club there is slavia prague.\n\nIn season 2001-02: Rows 1-3 are in the uefa cup, with rounds first, second, and third. The clubs here are matador p\u00fachov (first round), st gallen (second), and feyenoord (third). None of these are sc freiburg.\n\nAdditionally, in season 2013-14, the competition is uefa europa league, which doesn't apply to the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The table does have entries for uefa cup competitions in both 1995-96 and 2001-02 seasons, but sc freiburg isn't listed as playing in any of those. Therefore, the claim can't be true because the key piece of information (the club's participation) isn't supported by the table.\n\nLooking at relevant cells: For each season mentioned, I should check the competition and round. So for 1995-96, row 0 has uefa cup and first round; but club is slavia prague.

The claim suggests that sc freiburg played twice against these three clubs in group h during 2013-14, but the data provided only lists matches for sevilla, estoril, and slovan liberec without any mention of sc freiburg.\n\nTherefore, since there's no entry for sc freiburg in the table, especially not in the 2013 - 14 season or group h round, the claim cannot be supported by the given data. \n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the home score be 0 - 1 in the 2001 - 02 uefa cup the club be st gallen and when the away score be 1 - 1 also in the 2001 - 02 uefa cup the club be feyenoord\"\n\nFirst, I'll split this into two parts to check each condition separately.\n\nPart 1: When home score is 0-1 in 2001-02 UEFA Cup, club is St. Gallen.\nLooking at the table for the 2001-02 season and UEFA Cup:\n- Row 2 (third row) has round \"second round\", club \"st gallen\", home score \"0 - 1\". So this matches. Club is indeed St. Gallen here.\n\nPart 2: When away score is 1-1 in the same competition, club is Feyenoord.\nLooking at the same season and competition:\n- Row 3 (fourth row) has round \"third round\", club \"feyenoord\". The home score is \"2 - 2\" and away is \"0 - 1\". Wait, but the claim mentions an away score of 1-1. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking through all rows for away scores:\n- Row 0: away 0-0\n- Row 1: away 0-0\n- Row 2: away 4-1 (st gallen's home is 0-1)\n- Row 3: away 0-1 (feyenoord's home is 2-2)\n- Rows 4,5,6 are for 2013-14 season.\n\nSo in the 2001-02 season, I don't see any row where the away score is exactly 1-1. The closest is Row 3: away score is 0-1. Therefore, there's no instance where away score is 1-1 for Feyenoord or any other club in that season.\n\nWait, did I misread? Let me check again. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong columns. Home and away scores are separate. So \"home\" column is home team's score, and \"away\" is away team's score. The claim mentions when the away score is 1-1. So in any row for 2001-02, is there an away score of 1-1? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: home 1-2, away 0-0\nRow 1: home 2-1, away 0-0\nRow 2: home 0-1, away 4-1 (st gallen's home is 0-1)\nRow 3: home 2-2, away 0-1\n\nNo rows have an away score of 1-1. So the second part of the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, since both conditions need to be true for the overall claim to be TRUE, and the second condition fails, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: one correctly identifies St. Gallen with a home score of 0-1, but the other incorrectly states an away score of 1-1 for Feyenoord which doesn't exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim states three things:\n1. The highest away score is 3-1 in the 2001-02 season.\n2. The lowest away score is 0-0 on two occasions: one in the 1995-96 season and another in the 2001-02 season.\n\nFirst, let's look for all the \"away\" scores in each relevant row of the table.\n\nStarting with the 2001-02 season:\n- Row index 1: Competition is UEFA Cup, round first, club matador p\u00fachov. Away score is 0-0.\n- Row index 2: Competition is UEFA Cup, round second, club st gallen. Away score is 4-1. Wait, but this seems like a high away score, so maybe it's the highest?\n- Row index 3: Competition is UEFA Cup, round third, club feyenoord. Away score is 0-1.\n\nSo in the 2001-02 season, the away scores are:\n- matador p\u00fachov: 0-0\n- st gallen: 4-1 (away team scored 1)\n- feyenoord: 0-1\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the table, each row represents a match where the club is either home or away? Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the columns:\nEach row has 'club', 'home', and 'away'. So for example, in row 2 (index starting at 0?), it's 2001-02 season, first round, matador p\u00fachov. The home score is 2-1, away score is 0-0.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify what each cell represents. Each row might be a match where the club listed is the 'home' team, and their score is in 'home', while the opponent's (away) score is in 'away'. Or perhaps it's the other way around? Alternatively, maybe 'home' is the result when they played at home, and 'away' is when they were away.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\nEach row seems to represent a particular match for the club in that season. For example, Slavia Prague in 1995-96 season: their home game was 1-2 (so opponent scored 2), and their away game was 0-0.\n\nWait no, maybe 'home' and 'away' are the results of the home and away legs? Because it's a two-legged match, like in cup competitions. So each row represents a club's participation in a round, showing both legs: home and away.\n\nSo for example, Slavia Prague in 1995-96 season, first round: their home game was 1-2 (they lost 1-2), and their away game was 0-0. So the total score would be 1-2 plus 0-0, but perhaps that's not relevant here.\n\nNow, for the claim:\nHighest away score is 3-1 in 2001-02 season.\n\nLooking at the 'away' column for each row in the 2001-02 season:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): matador p\u00fachov's home game was 2-1, and their away game is 0-0. So as an away team, they scored 0.\n\nRow 2: st gallen's home game was 0-1, but wait, no\u2014looking at the row with index 2 (third row), it's 2001-02 season, second round, club st gallen. Their home score is 0-1 (they lost 0-1) and their away score is 4-1 (so as an away team, they scored 4? Wait, no\u2014away score is the result when they were playing away. So if a row's 'club' is st gallen, their home game was 0-1 (they lost at home), and their away game against someone else was 4-1 (so as an away team, they scored 4? Or perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row represents a particular match for the club in that season. The 'home' column is their score when playing at home against another club, and 'away' is their score when they played away against another club.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents both legs of a two-legged tie. For example, Slavia Prague in first round had home game 1-2 and away game 0-0. So the total is 1+0 vs 2+0? But that's maybe not relevant here.\n\nBut for our purposes, we need to look at all the 'away' scores (i.e., when the club was playing away) in the 2001-02 season and see what the highest and lowest are.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: matador p\u00fachov's away score is 0-0. So as an away team, they scored 0.\nRow 2: st gallen's away score is 4-1? Wait, no\u2014the 'away' column in this row would be the result when st gallen was playing away against someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a single match, with 'home' being their home game and 'away' being their away game in that round. So for example:\n\nRow 2: st gallen's home score is 0-1 (they lost at home), and their away score is 4-1 (they won 4-1). But does that make sense? Or perhaps each row represents a particular tie, so they have both legs in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 'home' and 'away' refers to the two legs of the same tie. For example, Slavia Prague's first-round tie: home game was 1-2 (they lost at home), and away game was 0-0. So their total score is 1+0 vs 2+0, but perhaps that's a different matter.\n\nBut for our claim, we're looking for the highest and lowest 'away' scores in the entire season. So any time a club from 2001-02 played away, what were their scores.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): matador p\u00fachov's home game is 2-1, away game is 0-0. So when they played away, the score was 0-0 (they didn't score any goals). As an away team, their score is 0.\n\nRow 2: st gallen's home game is 0-1 (lost at home), and their away game is 4-1. Wait, but in that case, when they played away, the result was 4-1, which would mean they scored 4 goals as the away team. So their away score is 4.\n\nRow 3: feyenoord's home game is 0-1 (lost at home), and their away game is 0-1 again. Wait, no: the row says 'away' is 0-1? Or maybe I'm misreading it.\n\nWait the columns are:\n\nFor each row:\nSeason | Round | Club | Home | Away\n\nSo for Row 2 (index 2):\nSeason: 2001-02\nRound: second round\nClub: st gallen\nHome: 0-1\nAway: 4-1\n\nWait, that might not make sense. If st gallen's home game was 0-1, they lost at home. Then their away game was 4-1\u2014so when they went to play away, they won 4-1.\n\nSo as an away team in the second round, they scored 4 goals (away score is 4).\n\nWait no\u2014the 'Away' column shows the result of their away match. So if it's 4-1, that means when st gallen played away, they scored 4 and the opponent scored 1? That would be a high away score.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Row 3:\nSeason: 2001-02\nRound: third round\nClub: feyenoord\nHome: 0-1 (lost at home)\nAway: 0-1 again? Or is it that they lost both legs?\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the data:\n\nRow 3 has 'away' as 0-1. So when feyenoord played away in the third round, their score was 0-1\u2014they scored 0 goals.\n\nSo compiling all 'Away' scores for 2001-02 season:\n- matador p\u00fachov: 0-0 (away)\n- st gallen: 4-1 (away)\n- feyenoord: 0-1 (away)\n\nWait, but in Row 3, the away score is 0-1. So as an away team, they scored 0.\n\nSo from these three rows, the 'Away' scores for the 2001-02 season are:\n- matador p\u00fachov: 0\n- st gallen: 4 (since 4-1 means they scored 4)\n- feyenoord: 0\n\nSo in this case, the highest away score is 4 goals (st gallen's 4-1 win). But the claim says the highest was 3. So that contradicts.\n\nWait perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check:\n\nIn Row 2:\nAway column is '4-1'. Does that mean st gallen scored 4, or did their opponents? Because in football (soccer), the away team's score is usually written first if it's a home game for the other team.\n\nWait no\u2014in a match where team A is at home against team B, the result would be shown as Home: Team A Score - Team B Score. So if st gallen were playing away, their score would be the second number in that match.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because each row represents a club's performance in a round, showing both home and away games.\n\nWait perhaps 'Home' is the result when they played at home, and 'Away' is when they played away. So for st gallen:\n\n- Home: 0-1 (they lost at home)\n- Away: 4-1 (they won away)\n\nSo in their away game, they scored 4 goals.\n\nSimilarly, matador p\u00fachov's away game was 0-0\u2014so they didn't score any goals.\n\nFeyenoord's away game was 0-1\u2014they lost and scored 0.\n\nThus, the highest away score for 2001-02 is 4 (st gallen). So if the claim says \"the highest away score in the competition this season was 3,\" that would be incorrect because we have a 4 here.\n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the data again:\n\nLooking at each row's 'Away' column:\n- Row 1: matador p\u00fachov - Away: 0-0 (so they scored 0)\n- Row 2: st gallen - Away: 4-1 (they scored 4)\n- Row 3: feyenoord - Away: 0-1 (they scored 0)\n\nThus, the maximum away score is indeed 4. Therefore, if the claim is that the highest was 3, it's false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misreading the 'Away' column as goals for or against. Let me clarify:\n\nIn football results, the format is Home team - Away team. So in a match where st gallen are away, their score would be the second number if written as [Home team score] - [Away team score]. But in the table, each row represents a club's perspective.\n\nSo for Row 2: st gallen's home game was 0-1 (they lost at home to whoever they were playing against), and their away game was 4-1\u2014meaning when they went away, they scored 4 goals and the opponent scored 1. So yes, their away score is 4.\n\nThus, if someone claims that the highest away score in the competition was 3, it's incorrect because st gallen had a 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be: No, the claim is false. The highest away score was 4, achieved by st gallen.\n</think>\n\nThe highest away score in the 2001-02 season was 4 goals, scored by st gallen. Therefore, the claim that the highest was 3 is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** No, the claim is false. The highest away score was 4 goals, achieved by st gallen during the 2001-02 season.",

The claim is: \"when the club be st gallen the season be 2013-14 and when the club be slavia prague the season be 1995-96.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim is saying. It seems like there are two conditions here connected by \"and.\" The first condition is that if the club is st gallen, then the season should be 2013-14. The second condition is that if the club is slavia prague, then the season should be 1995-96.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to see where \"st gallen\" and \"slavia prague\" appear as clubs and check their corresponding seasons.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Club is slavia prague, season is 1995-96. That matches the second condition in the claim. So that part seems correct.\n\nNext, for st gallen: I look through each row. In Row 2, the club is st gallen and the season is 2001-02. Wait, but the claim says when the club is st gallen, the season should be 2013-14. That doesn't match because it's actually 2001-02 here.\n\nSo that means the first part of the claim isn't true for this row. There are no other rows with st gallen in the table except Row 2, so I don't have another data point to check. \n\nTherefore, since one part of the claim is correct (slavia prague in 1995-96) and the other is incorrect (st gallen's season isn't 2013-14 but earlier), the overall claim must be FALSE.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, I need to identify which ones were checked.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"sc freiburg play in thesecond round on 2 occasion in the uefa cup competition in season 1995 - 96 and 2001 - 02.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim against the table data. The table has several columns: season, competition, round, club, home, away.\n\n1. **Competition**: The claim mentions \"uefa cup\" specifically. Looking at the table, I see that in the years 1995-96 and 2001-02, the competitions are indeed labeled as \"uefa cup.\" So far, so good.\n\n2. **Seasons Mentioned**: The seasons given are 1995-96 and 2001-02. In the table, both these seasons appear under the \"season\" column with the correct competition (UEFA Cup).\n\n3. **Round**: The claim refers to the \"second round.\" I'll check each season for any entries where the round is second.\n\n   - For 1995-96: Scanning through, the first row has \"first round,\" but there's no entry for \"second round\" in that season.\n   \n   - For 2001-02: The third row shows \"second round.\" So, there is one occurrence of sc freiburg playing in the second round during this season.\n\n4. **Club Name**: The claim mentions \"sc freiburg,\" but looking at the table's \"club\" column for both seasons:\n\n   - In 1995-96: The club listed is \"slavia prague.\"\n   \n   - In 2001-02: The clubs are \"matador p\u00fachov,\" \"st gallen,\" and \"feyenoord.\" There's no mention of \"sc freiburg\" in either season.\n\n5. **Occasion Count**: The claim says \"on 2 occasion,\" implying two instances where sc freiburg played in the second round during these seasons. However, since sc freiburg isn't listed at all, this part doesn't hold.\n\nPutting it all together: While there is a second-round match in the 2001-02 season (row index 2), the club involved isn't sc freiburg but st gallen. Additionally, there's no entry for sc freiburg in any round during either of the specified seasons.
