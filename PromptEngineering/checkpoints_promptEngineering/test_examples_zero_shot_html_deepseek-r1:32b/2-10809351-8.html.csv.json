Let me check that row. The home team score is indeed 10.17 (77). So, the first part of the claim matches this data.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"south melbourne home team.\" I'll look for a row where South Melbourne is the home team.

That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"During the 1949 VFL season, Prince Park venue recorded the highest crowd participation.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Venue Name**: The claim mentions \"Prince Park\". Looking at the table's venues, one of them is listed as \"princes park\" (with an 's'). This might be a typo, but it's likely referring to the same place. So, I'll consider \"princes park\" as the venue in question.\n\n2. **Crowd Numbers**: The claim is about crowd participation, which in the table corresponds to the \"crowd\" column. I need to find out if princes park had the highest number of attendees on June 4, 1949.\n\nNext, I'll examine each row's data:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is kardinia park with a crowd of 22500.\n- Row 1: Victoria park with 12000.\n- Row 2: Princes park with 29500.\n- Row 3: mcg (Melbourne Cricket Ground) with 11000.\n- Row 4: Lake oval with 12500.\n- Row 5: Western oval with 12500.\n\nLooking at the crowd numbers:\n\n- The highest is 29500 at princes park (row 2).\n- Next is 22500 at kardinia park, followed by 12500 at two venues, and lower numbers elsewhere.\n\nSince 29500 is indeed the highest among all listed crowds, the claim holds true.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"victoria park be 1 of the 6 venue that be in use on 4 june 1949.\" Hmm, there are some grammatical issues here, but I think the intended meaning is to check if Victoria Park was one of six venues used on June 4, 1949.\n\nLooking at the table, it has multiple rows with different matches. Each row represents a game played on that date. The columns include details like home team, away team, venue, etc. My focus should be on the \"venue\" column and the \"date\" column to verify the claim.\n\nI'll start by checking all the venues listed in each row:\n\n1. Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park\n2. Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park\n3. Carlton vs North Melbourne at Princes Park\n4. Melbourne vs Hawthorn at MCG\n5. South Melbourne vs Fitzroy at Lake Oval\n6. Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval\n\nSo, there are six matches listed, each with a different venue. The dates for all these matches are June 4, 1949.\n\nNow, checking if Victoria Park is one of the venues: Yes, it's in row 1 (second row) under the \"venue\" column. So that's correct.\n\nThe claim states there are six venues. Let me count them:\n\n- Kardinia Park\n- Victoria Park\n- Princes Park\n- MCG\n- Lake Oval\n- Western Oval\n\nThat makes six different venues, each hosting a game on June 4, 1949.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Victoria Park was indeed one of the six venues in use that day.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"western oval be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 12500 each.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that Western Oval is one of two venues that had a crowd of exactly 12,500 each on that date. So, I need to check two things: whether there are two venues with a crowd of 12,500 and if Western Oval is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played on June 4, 1949. The relevant columns here are \"venue\" and \"crowd\". I'll go through each row to check these values.\n\nStarting with the first row: Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park had a crowd of 22,500. That's higher than 12,500, so not relevant.\n\nSecond row: Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park had 12,000 attendees. Close but not exactly 12,500.\n\nThird row: Carlton vs North Melbourne at Princes Park attracted 29,500 people. That's much higher than 12,500, so I can skip this one.\n\nFourth row: Melbourne vs Hawthorn at the MCG had a crowd of 11,000. Again, not matching 12,500.\n\nFifth row: South Melbourne vs Fitzroy at Lake Oval had a crowd of 12,500. That's exactly what we're looking for. So, that's one venue meeting the criteria.\n\nSixth row: Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval also had a crowd of 12,500. Perfect, that's the second venue with the exact number mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, I've found two venues\u2014Western Oval and Lake Oval\u2014each with a crowd of exactly 12,500 on June 4, 1949. This matches the claim perfectly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure that there are exactly two venues with this crowd number and that Western Oval is one of them. From the data, it's clear that both Lake Oval and Western Oval had 12,500 attendees each. No other venue in the table has this exact number. \n\nHence, the claim is accurate. I should document which cells were relevant to my analysis.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"during the 1949 vfl season, prince park venue recorded the lowest crowd participation.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The time frame is the 1949 VFL season, which I think refers to the Victorian Football League season in that year. The venue mentioned is Prince Park, and the claim is about it having the lowest crowd participation.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game played on 4 June 1949, as all dates in the 'date' column are that day.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Prince Park. Scanning through the 'venue' column, I see one entry for \"princes park\" (I think it's a typo and should be \"Prince Park\"). That row is the third one: Carlton vs North Melbourne at Princes Park with a crowd of 29500.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the venues are Kardinia Park, Victoria Park, Prince's Park, MCG, Lake Oval, and Western Oval. So only one venue in the table is Prince's Park, which had a crowd of 29,500. \n\nNow, to determine if it's the lowest, I need to compare all the 'crowd' numbers from each game on that date. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park: 22500\n2. Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park: 12000\n3. Carlton vs North Melbourne at Princes Park: 29500\n4. Melbourne vs Hawthorn at MCG: 11000\n5. South Melbourne vs Fitzroy at Lake Oval: 12500\n6. Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval: 12500\n\nNow, looking for the lowest crowd participation, I can see that the lowest number is 11000 at MCG (venue: mcg), followed by Victoria Park with 12000, then Lake Oval and Western Oval both at 12500. Prince's Park has 29500, which is actually higher than several other venues.\n\nSo the claim that Prince Park had the lowest crowd participation isn't correct because MCG had a lower crowd of 11000 compared to Princes Park's 29500. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells here are the 'crowd' numbers for each game and their respective venues.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"princess park be 1 of the 6 venue that be in use on 4 june 1949.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand what data it contains. It looks like the table lists various Australian Rules Football matches with details such as home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date. All entries have the same date: 4 June 1949. So all these games were played on that day.\n\nNow, focusing on the venues. The claim mentions \"princess park.\" Wait a second, I see in the table there's a row with \"Princes Park\" as the venue. But the claim spells it as \"princess park.\" Is that a typo? Maybe they meant Princes Park but misspelled it. That could be an issue because if the names don't match exactly, then the claim might not hold.\n\nNext, let's check how many unique venues are listed on 4 June 1949. Looking at each row:\n\n1. Kardinia Park\n2. Victoria Park\n3. Princes Park\n4. mcg (Melbourne Cricket Ground)\n5. Lake Oval\n6. Western Oval\n\nSo that's six different venues in total, right? Each of these is a unique venue where the matches took place on that day.\n\nNow, checking which row has \"Princes Park\" as the venue. It's the third row: Carlton vs North Melbourne at Princes Park with a crowd of 29500. So that's one venue used on that date.\n\nThe claim says that Princess Park is one of the six venues in use. But wait, I'm noticing the spelling discrepancy again. The table has \"Princes Park,\" not \"Princess Park.\" If the claim uses \"princess park\" with an 's' instead of 'ce,' then it's a different venue name.\n\nSo if we consider exact matches, the claim is incorrect because the venue in the table is spelled as \"Princes Park,\" not \"princess park.\" Therefore, Princess Park isn't listed as a venue on that day. So, the claim would be false based on the spelling difference.\n\nHowever, maybe it's just a typo and they meant Princes Park. If we assume that, then yes, it is one of the six venues used. But since the claim specifically uses \"princess park,\" I think we have to take it as written unless instructed otherwise.\n\nSo considering exact matches, the answer would be FALSE because \"princess park\" isn't listed; instead, it's \"Princes Park.\" Therefore, only five unique venues are actually in use if we exclude that. Wait no, no\u2014wait, the total is six regardless of spelling. The point is whether Princess Park (as spelled) is one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine. The claim says \"princess park be 1 of the 6 venue...\" So if we take it literally, as in exact match, then no, because the table has Princes Park. But maybe the user made a typo and intended to refer to Princes Park.\n\nIn any case, let's go by what's written. The relevant cell is the venue column for row index 2 (third row). So the relevant_cells would include that.\n\nSo in conclusion, since the claim uses \"princess park\" which isn't exactly as per the table, but the correct spelling is present, I think the answer depends on whether we consider it a typo or not. If strictly by what's written, then the answer is FALSE because Princess Park isn't listed; Princes Park is. But if it's a typo, then TRUE.\n\nBut since the instructions say to check each condition against the table as given, without assuming typos, I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"western oval be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 11000 each\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two things:\n1. Western Oval is one of the venues.\n2. Both venues have a crowd participation of 11,000 each.\n\nSo, I should check the table for rows where the venue is \"western oval\" and see if its crowd count matches 11,000. Then, I need to find another venue with the same crowd count.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played on June 4, 1949. The relevant columns are \"venue\" and \"crowd.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is Kardinia Park, Crowd is 22500.\n- Row 1: Venue is Victoria Park, Crowd is 12000.\n- Row 2: Venue is Princes Park, Crowd is 29500.\n- Row 3: Venue is MCG, Crowd is 11000.

The only venue with exactly 11,000 crowd is MCG in row 3. So, there's only one venue (MCG) that had 11,000 attendees.\n\nSince the claim states that Western Oval was one of two venues each recording 11,000, but the data shows Western Oval had a higher attendance and no other venue besides MCG hit exactly 11,000.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"kardinia park venue have a 10000 crowd participant more than that of the lake oval venue.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It's comparing the crowd sizes at two venues: Kardinia Park and Lake Oval. Specifically, it says that Kardinia Park had 10,000 more participants in the crowd than Lake Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details including home team, away team, venue, and crowd numbers. I need to find the rows where the venue is either Kardinia Park or Lake Oval.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n1. The first row lists Kardinia Park as the venue with a crowd of 22500.\n2. Scanning through the other rows:\n   - Victoria Park: 12000\n   - Princes Park: 29500\n   - mcg: 11000\n   - Lake Oval: 12500\n   - Western Oval: 12500\n\nSo, Kardinia Park has a crowd of 22,500 and Lake Oval has a crowd of 12,500. \n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference between these two numbers to see if it's at least 10,000 more as claimed.\n\nSubtracting the crowd at Lake Oval (12500) from Kardinia Park (22500):\n22500 - 12500 = 10000\n\nThe difference is exactly 10,000. The claim states that Kardinia Park has \"a 10000 crowd participant more than\" Lake Oval. Since the calculation shows the exact figure, the claim holds true.\n\nI should also check if there are other instances of these venues in the table to ensure accuracy, but looking through all rows, each venue appears only once. Therefore, there's no ambiguity about which rows to consider for Kardinia Park and Lake Oval.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0 (Kardinia Park) under 'crowd'\n- Row 4 (Lake Oval) under 'crowd'\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
