    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter, with a pick number of 19\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. The table has columns: round, pick, overall, name, position, and college. There are seven rows in total.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. Corey Peters is the only defensive tackle.\n2. He was picked with the number 19.\n\nI need to verify both these points against the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Sean Weatherspoon, position linebacker, pick 19 (round 1). So not a defensive tackle.\n\nRow 1: Corey Peters, position defensive tackle, pick 19 (round 3). This matches the claim's name and position. His pick number is 19 in round 3, but wait, the overall pick is 83. But the claim refers to the \"pick number,\" which I think refers to the round's pick number, not the overall. So yes, his pick number is 19.\n\nRow 2: Mike Johnson, position guard, pick 34 (round 3). Not relevant here.\n\nRow 3: Joe Hawley, position guard, pick 19 (round 4). Also a guard, so not a defensive tackle, and same pick number in another round. Wait, the claim says \"the only defensive tackle,\" but let me check other rows.\n\nRow 4: Dominique Franks, cornerback, pick 4 (round 5). Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Kerry Meier, wide receiver, pick 34 (round 5). No.\n\nRow 6: Shann Schillinger, safety, pick 2 (round 6). Also not a defensive tackle.\n\nSo Corey Peters is indeed the only defensive tackle in the table. His pick number in his respective round is 19. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each cell that supports this conclusion. That includes Corey Peters' row (index 1) with position and pick columns.\n\nSo, compiling that into JSON format as per instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
