    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the match with opponent cleber luciano last 7:57\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two specific pieces of information:\n1. The opponent's name is \"cleber luciano.\"\n2. The time taken for that match was \"7:57.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different match with details like result, record, opponent, method, event, round, and time.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where the opponent is \"cleber luciano\" and the time is \"7:57.\"\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is john cox, time is 0:30. Not matching.\n- Row 1: Opponent flavio troccoli, time 0:53. No match.\n- Row 2: din thomas, time 5:00. Doesn't fit.\n- Row 3: caol uno, 1:48. Nope.\n- Row 4: phil johns, 2:05. Not it.\n- Row 5: daiju takase, 2:24. Still not matching.\n- Row 6: laverne clark, 1:10. No.\n- Row 7: danny bennett, 0:49. Nope.\n- Row 8: dave menne, 5:00. Doesn't match.\n- Row 9: frank trigg, 5:00. Still not.\n- Row 10: laverne clark, 1:31. Not the one.\n- Row 11: cleber luciano, time is 7:57. Yes! This matches both parts of the claim.\n\nSo the row at index 11 has the opponent \"cleber luciano\" and the time \"7:57.\" Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a match with opponent cleber luciano that lasted 7:57. Checking the table:\n\n- **Opponent**: Found in row 11 as \"cleber luciano.\"\n- **Time**: Also found in row 11 as \"7:57.\"\n\nBoth conditions are met.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table in HTML format and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"tko (cut) be the method in round 1 of the ufc 20 event.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Method**: The claim mentions \"tko (cut)\". In the context of fights, \"TKO\" stands for Technical Knockout, which means the fight was stopped by the referee because one fighter couldn't continue due to an injury or other issues.\n\n2. **Round 1**: This refers to the first round of the event.\n\n3. **UFC 20 event**: This is a specific event name in the table.\n\nSo, I'm looking for a row where the method is \"tko (cut)\", the round is 1, and the event is \"ufc 20\".\n\nNow, let's examine the table step by step.\n\nThe table has multiple rows. Each row represents a fight with details like result, record, opponent, method, event, round, and time.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find any matches:\n\n- **Row 0**: Method is \"ko\", not \"tko (cut)\". Event is \"lip 1...\", not UFC. Doesn't match.\n  \n- **Row 1**: Method is submission, event is HFP. No match.\n\n- **Row 2**: Loss via decision at UFC 33. Not relevant since method isn't tko.\n\n- **Row 3**: Loss via KO at UFC 32. Event is different from UFC 20, and method isn't tko (cut).\n\n- **Row 4**: Another loss via submission. Doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 5**: Method is \"tko (cut)\". Wait, here's a potential match. Let me check the details:\n\n   - **Event**: ufc 20\n   - **Round**: 1\n   - **Method**: tko (cut)\n\nYes! This row matches all parts of the claim.\n\nSo, according to this table, there is an event called \"ufc 20\" where the method was indeed \"tko (cut)\" in round 1. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows that might satisfy these conditions, but from a quick glance, row 5 seems to be the only one with the event UFC 20 and tko method. Others have different events or methods.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported as the table contains a row where the method is \"tko (cut)\", round is 1, and the event is \"ufc 20\".\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Components**: The claim specifies three key elements - method (\"tko (cut)\"), round number (1), and event name (\"ufc 20\").\n\n2. **Scan Each Row**: Review each row in the table to find where these conditions intersect.\n\n3. **Row 5 Analysis**:\n   - **Event**: \"ufc 20\"\n   - **Round**: \"1\"\n   - **Method**: \"tko (cut)\"\n   \n   This row satisfies all parts of the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the data matches the claim exactly, it is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_ index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the ufc 20 event end with a method of decision (unanimus)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"ufc 20.\" Looking at the table, I should check if there's an event named \"ufc 20.\" Scanning through the 'event' column:\n\nRow indexes go from 0 to 12. Let me look for \"ufc 20\" specifically.\n\nLooking down the 'event' column:\n- Row 3: ufc 32\n- Row 4: ufc 30\n- Row 5: ufc 29\n- Row 6: ufc 27\n- Row 8: ufc 24\n- Row 10: ufc 20 (found it)\n\nSo the event \"ufc 20\" is in row index 10.\n\nNext, the claim says this event ended with a method of \"decision (unanimus).\" Wait, I think that's a typo. The correct term is probably \"decision (unanimous).\" Let me check if any of the methods match that.\n\nLooking at row 10:\n- 'method' column: tko (cut)\n\nSo the method for ufc 20 was a TKO via cut, not a decision. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it mentions \"decision (unanimus)\" but the actual method was different.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there are no other entries for ufc 20 elsewhere in case of duplicates, but looking through all events, only row 10 has ufc 20.\n\nSo putting it together: The claim is FALSE. The relevant cell to check is row 10, column 'method'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the method for the UFC 20 event was a TKO via cut, not a decision.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
