    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 3 song that be release in 2000, while only 1 song be release in 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is asking.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two specific years: 2000 and 1999. It states that there are three songs released in 2000 and only one song released in 1999. My task is to check these numbers against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for \"song,\" \"release date,\" \"release info,\" \"formats,\" and \"album.\" The relevant column here is the \"release date\" since that's where I can find the year each song was released. \n\nI'll go through each row of the table and extract the release dates to count how many songs were released in 2000 and 1999.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. The first row has a release date of \"2 august 1999.\" That's clearly in 1999.\n2. The second row is \"20 march 2000\" \u2014 so that's 2000.\n3. Third row: \"29 may 2000\" \u2014 another 2000 release.\n4. Fourth row: \"30 october 2000\" \u2014 again, 2000.\n5. Fifth row: \"15 april 2002\" \u2014 that's after 2000, so not relevant here.\n6. Sixth row: \"22 july 2002\" \u2014 same as above.\n7. Seventh row: \"14 october 2002\" \u2014 still in 2002.\n8. Eighth row: \"7 february 2005\" \u2014 moving on.\n9. Ninth row: \"9 may 2005\" \u2014 again, later than 2000.\n10. Tenth row: \"12 september 2005\" \u2014 same as above.\n11. Eleventh row: \"30 march 2009\" \u2014 still not in our target years.\n12. Twelfth row: \"20 july 2009\" \u2014 same here.\n13. Thirteenth row: \"5 april 2010\" \u2014 way beyond 2000 and 1999.\n\nWait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any rows in the target years. The first four rows are from 1999 and 2000. Then starting from row five, it's all 2002 onwards except for a couple of other years later. \n\nSo, how many songs were released in 2000? Let me check:\n- Row 2: March 2000\n- Row 3: May 2000\n- Row 4: October 2000\n\nThat's three songs in 2000. \n\nHow about 1999?\n- Only row 1 has \"august 1999.\"\n\nSo that's one song in 1999.\n\nTherefore, the claim says there are three songs in 2000 and only one in 1999, which matches exactly with what I found. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for this verification, I need to list all the \"release date\" cells that fall into either 2000 or 1999. \n\nLooking back at each row:\n\n- Row 0: release date is 2 august 1999 \u2192 included because it's in 1999.\n- Row 1: 20 march 2000 \u2192 included as 2000.\n- Row 2: 29 may 2000 \u2192 included as 2000.\n- Row 3: 30 october 2000 \u2192 included as 2000.\n\nRows beyond that (starting from row 4) are either in later years or outside the target years, so they don't contribute to the counts for 1999 and 2000.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are all four rows with release dates in 1999 or 2000. Each of these rows' \"release date\" column is what we needed to check.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three songs released in 2000 and one in 1999. By examining the table, I found exactly three releases in 2000 (rows 1-3) and one in 1999 (row 0). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the most song release in a year be 3, which happen in 3 different year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It seems to state that there was a maximum of three song releases in a single year, and this maximum occurred across three distinct years. So, my goal is to check two things:\n\n1. Is the highest number of song releases in any given year equal to 3?\n2. Does this number (three releases) occur in exactly three different years?\n\nTo do this, I'll need to extract the release dates from the table and count how many songs were released each year.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column is \"release date.\" Each row lists a song with its corresponding release date. The format of the release date varies slightly, but it seems consistent enough that I can parse the year out of each date.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the year:\n\n1. \"here it comes\" - 2 august 1999 \u2192 1999\n2. \"the cedar room\" - 20 march 2000 \u2192 2000\n3. \"catch the sun\" - 29 may 2000 \u2192 2000\n4. \"the man who told everything\" - 30 october 2000 \u2192 2000\n5. \"there goes the fear\" - 15 april 2002 \u2192 2002\n6. \"pounding\" - 22 july 2002 \u2192 2002\n7. \"caught by the river\" - 14 october 2002 \u2192 2002\n8. \"black and white town\" - 7 february 2005 \u2192 2005\n9. \"snowden\" - 9 may 2005 \u2192 2005\n10. \"sky starts falling\" - 12 september 2005 \u2192 2005\n11. \"kingdom of rust\" - 30 march 2009 \u2192 2009\n12. \"winter hill\" - 20 july 2009 \u2192 2009\n13. \"andalucia\" - 5 april 2010 \u2192 2010\n\nNow, I'll tally the number of releases per year:\n\n- 1999: 1 release\n- 2000: 3 releases (rows 2,3,4)\n- 2002: 3 releases (rows 5,6,7)\n- 2005: 3 releases (rows 8,9,10)\n- 2009: 2 releases (rows 11,12)\n- 2010: 1 release\n\nFrom this tally:\n\n- The maximum number of releases in a single year is indeed 3.\n- This maximum occurred in three different years: 2000, 2002, and 2005.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true. Each of these years had exactly three song releases, which meets both conditions stated in the claim.\n\nTo compile the relevant cells for this analysis, I'll note the row indices where each of these maximum releases occurred:\n\n- Year 2000: rows 1 (the cedar room), 2 (catch the sun), 3 (the man who told everything)\n- Year 2002: rows 4 (there goes the fear), 5 (pounding), 6 (caught by the river)\n- Year 2005: rows 7 (black and white town), 8 (snowden), 9 (sky starts falling)\n\nEach of these rows has their \"release date\" under the column \"release date,\" which is crucial for determining the year.\n\nSo, compiling all relevant row indices with their respective column names gives me a comprehensive set of data points that support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"there be 11 more song release on heavenly than there be on casino\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are song, release date, release info, formats, and album. The relevant information for this claim will probably be in the \"release info\" column because that's where labels like Heavenly and Casino are mentioned.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"release info\" to count how many songs were released under each label.\n\nLooking at the first row: release info is casino (chip003). So, Casino has 1 song here.\nNext rows:\n- The Cedar Room: heavenly (hvn95) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Catch the Sun: heavenly (hvn96) \u2192 Heavenly\n- The Man Who Told Everything: heavenly (hvn98) \u2192 Heavenly\n- There Goes the Fear: heavenly (hvn111) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Pounding: heavenly (hvn116) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Caught by the River: heavenly (hvn126) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Black and White Town: heavenly (hvn145) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Snowden: heavenly (hvn150) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Sky Starts Falling: heavenly (hvn152) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Kingdom of Rust: heavenly (hvn189) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Winter Hill: heavenly (hvn192) \u2192 Heavenly\n- Andalucia: heavenly (hvn201) \u2192 Heavenly\n\nWait, let me count them. The first row is Casino, so that's 1 song on Casino.\n\nFor Heavenly, I'll count each occurrence:\nFrom row 1 to row 11 (excluding the last row which has a note about releases not charting). So rows 1-12 are actual songs except for the last one which is a note. So rows 0: casino, and rows 1-11 as heavenly?\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nRow indices start at 0.\n\nRow 0: Casino \u2192 1 song\nRows 1 to 12 (indices 1-12): Let's see how many have Heavenly in release info.\nRow 1: Heavenly \u2192 count 1\nRow 2: Heavenly \u2192 count 2\nRow 3: Heavenly \u2192 3\nRow4: Heavenly \u21924\nRow5: Heavenly\u21925\nRow6: Heavenly\u21926\nRow7: Heavenly\u21927\nRow8: Heavenly\u21928\nRow9: Heavenly\u21929\nRow10: Heavenly\u219210\nRow11: Heavenly\u219211\nRow12: Heavenly\u219212\n\nWait, that's 12 songs on Heavenly. Because from row1 to row12 (since there are 13 rows before the note), but row12 is Andalucia, which is heavenly.\n\nSo Casino has 1 song, Heavenly has 12.\n\nThe claim says \"11 more on Heavenly than on Casino\". Let's compute: 12 -1 =11. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"release info\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: song, release date, release info, formats, and album. My focus is on the 'album' column to check how many songs belong to the album \"some cities\".\n\nI'll scan each row in the 'album' column:\n\n1. Row 0: Here It Comes EP \u2013 not some cities.\n2. Row 1: Lost Souls \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: Lost Souls \u2013 same as above.\n4. Row 3: Lost Souls \u2013 still no match.\n5. Row 4: The Last Broadcast \u2013 not matching.\n6. Row 5: The Last Broadcast \u2013 again, no.\n7. Row 6: The Last Broadcast \u2013 same here.\n8. Row 7: Some cities \u2013 that's one.\n9. Row 8: Some cities \u2013 that's two.\n10.

They are on rows 7, 8, and 9. \n\nNext, I need to make sure each row corresponds correctly. Let me list them:\n\n- Row 7: Song is Black and White Town, album some cities.\n- Row 8: Song is Snowden, album some cities.\n- Row 9: Song is Sky Starts Falling, album some cities.\n\nThat's three songs in total from the album \"some cities\". \n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any other rows.

But 1 \u2260 3, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I'll list the relevant cells that were checked:\n- Row 0, 'release date'\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, each under 'release date'\n\nSo the relevant_ cells are at row indices 0,1,2,3 and column 'release date'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"more songs were released through the record label casino than through heavenly.\" So, I need to check how many songs each of these labels released.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, I see that there are multiple rows with data about different songs and their release information. Each row has a 'release info' column which mentions either casino or heavenly.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first song is \"here it comes\" with release info as \"casino (chip003)\". So, that's one for Casino.\n2. Next is \"the cedar room\" released under \"heavenly (hvn95)\", so that's one for Heavenly.\n3. \"catch the sun\" also has \"heavenly (hvn96)\" as release info \u2013 another for Heavenly.\n4. \"the man who told everything\" is under \"heavenly (hvn98)\" \u2013 three now for Heavenly.\n5. Moving on to \"there goes the fear\", it's \"heavenly (hvn111)\" \u2013 that's four.\n6. \"pounding\" has \"heavenly (hvn116)\" \u2013 five.\n7. \"caught by the river\" is under \"heavenly (hvn126)\" \u2013 six for Heavenly.\n8. \"black and white town\" uses \"heavenly (hvn145)\" \u2013 seven.\n9. \"snowden\" is also under Heavenly as \"hvn150\" \u2013 eight.\n10. \"sky starts falling\" with \"hvn152\" \u2013 nine.\n11. \"kingdom of rust\" has \"hvn189\" \u2013 ten.\n12. \"winter hill\" is under \"hvn192\" \u2013 eleven.\n13. \"andalucia\" is listed under \"heavenly (hvn201)\" \u2013 twelve.\n\nWait, that's 12 songs for Heavenly so far. But looking back, the first song was the only one under Casino. There are no other entries in the 'release info' column with Casino except the first row.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Casino: 1 song\n- Heavenly: 12 songs\n\nTherefore, there's definitely more songs released through Heavenly than Casino.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the number of song releases by Dove increase every year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The claim suggests that each subsequent year has more song releases than the previous one. So, I should look at the release dates and count how many songs were released each year to see if there's an increasing trend.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll extract the years from each song's release date. The relevant column is \"release date\". Each row represents a song, so I'll go through each one:\n\n1. \"here it comes\" - 2 August 1999 \u2192 1999\n2. \"the cedar room\" - 20 March 2000 \u2192 2000\n3. \"catch the sun\" - 29 May 2000 \u2192 2000\n4. \"the man who told everything\" - 30 October 2000 \u2192 2000\n5. \"there goes the fear\" - 15 April 2002 \u2192 2002\n6. \"pounding\" - 22 July 2002 \u2192 2002\n7. \"caught by the river\" - 14 October 2002 \u2192 2002\n8. \"black and white town\" - 7 February 2005 \u2192 2005\n9. \"snowden\" - 9 May 2005 \u2192 2005\n10. \"sky starts falling\" - 12 September 2005 \u2192 2005\n11. \"kingdom of rust\" - 30 March 2009 \u2192 2009\n12. \"winter hill\" - 20 July 2009 \u2192 2009\n13. \"andalucia\" - 5 April 2010 \u2192 2010\n\nNow, I'll count the number of releases per year:\n\n- 1999: 1 song\n- 2000: 3 songs\n- 2002: 3 songs\n- 2005: 3 songs\n- 2009: 2 songs\n- 2010: 1 song\n\nWait, I notice that after 2005, the number of releases doesn't keep increasing. In fact, from 2005 to 2009, it decreases from 3 to 2, and then in 2010, it drops further to 1.\n\nSo, looking at the counts: 1 (1999), 3 (2000), 3 (2002), 3 (2005), 2 (2009), 1 (2010). This shows that the number doesn't consistently increase every year. There's a peak in 2005, then it decreases afterward.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the number of song releases does not increase each year\u2014there are years where the count stays the same or even decreases.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the number of song releases increases every year, but upon examining the data, this isn't the case. The number peaks in 2005 and then declines.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"all song except 1 be release on the album some cities\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim correctly. It says that all songs, except one, were released on the album titled \"some cities.\" So, out of the listed songs, only one should not be part of \"some cities.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song with details about its release date, format, etc., and importantly, the album it belongs to.\n\nI'll go through each row's 'album' column:\n\n1. Row 0: Here It Comes EP\n2. Row 1: Lost Souls\n3. Row 2: Lost Souls\n4. Row 3: Lost Souls\n5. Row 4: The Last Broadcast\n6. Row 5: The Last Broadcast\n7. Row 6: The Last Broadcast\n8. Row 7: Some Cities\n9. Row 8: Some Cities\n10. Row 9: Some Cities\n11. Row 10: Kingdom of Rust (Album same as song title)\n12. Row 11: Kingdom of Rust\n13.

The rest are spread across other albums.\n\nWait, that's more than just one exception. There are multiple albums besides Some Cities. So the claim isn't accurate because there are several songs not on \"Some Cities.\"\n\nBut maybe I misunderstood.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"in 2009, doves release more than 5 song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that in the year 2009, Doves released more than five songs. So, my goal is to find out how many songs were released by Doves in 2009 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's an HTML table with columns: song, release date, release info, formats, and album. Each row represents a different song along with its details.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to focus on two main aspects:\n1. The year of release (2009).\n2. Counting how many songs were released that year by Doves.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table and check the \"release date\" column for entries from 2009. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Release date is August 1999 \u2014 too early.\n- Row 1: March 2000 \u2014 still not 2009.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6: All have release dates in 2000 or 2002 \u2014 none are 2009.\n\nRow 7: February 2005 \u2014 nope. Row 8: May 2005. Row 9: September 2005. Still not 2009.\n\nNow, looking further down:\n- Row 10: March 2009.\n- Row 11: July 2009.\n\nRows 10 and 11 both have release dates in 2009. Let's check what they are:\n\nRow 10: Song is \"kingdom of rust\", released on March 30, 2009.\nRow 11: Song is \"winter hill\", released on July 20, 2009.\n\nSo, there are only two songs released in 2009 by Doves according to the table. The claim says more than five, which would mean six or more. However, we only have two entries for that year.\n\nWait a minute \u2014 perhaps I should check if there are any other rows with 2009 dates beyond row 11. Scanning through all rows, after row 11, the next relevant row is row 12: April 2010 \u2014 that's after 2009.\n\nSo, only two songs were released in 2009 by Doves. That means the claim of more than five releases is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are those with release dates in 2009. So, rows 10 and 11 under the \"release date\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
