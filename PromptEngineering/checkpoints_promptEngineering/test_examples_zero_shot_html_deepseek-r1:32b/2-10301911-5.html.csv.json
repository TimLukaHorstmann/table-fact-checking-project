I need to determine whether the claim \"b\u00f6rje jansson from united kingdom have a speed of 90.57 mph\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row with rider \"b\u00f6rje jansson\". Scanning down, I see that at row index 8 (since we start counting from 0), there's a rider named B\u00f6rje Jansson. \n\nNext, checking his country: the 'country' column for this row says Sweden, not United Kingdom. That already suggests something might be wrong with the claim.\n\nNow, looking at the speed: the 'speed' column shows 90.57 mph for B\u00f6rje Jansson. So the speed part of the claim is correct. But since he's from Sweden and not the UK, the entire statement about him being from the United Kingdom is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, even though his speed matches, the country doesn't, making the overall claim false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
