So, the claim states that Montreal was the visitor on March 6, which matches exactly with the table's data.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two key points: the date (before March 6) and that Montreal was the visitor. So I'm looking for any rows where the 'date' is before March 6 and the 'visitor' is Montreal.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has a 'date' column, so I'll check all dates prior to March 6. The dates in the table are from March 1 onwards, so any date before March 6 would be March 1, 2, 4.\n\nNow, I'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is March 1. Visitor is Philadelphia. So not Montreal.\n- Row 1: March 2. Visitor is NY Rangers. Not Montreal.\n- Row 2: March 4. Visitor is Philadelphia again. Still no Montreal.\n- The next date after that is March 6, which isn't before March 6.\n\nWait, let me check if there are any other dates before March 6. The table has rows up to March 28, but I only need to consider those before March 6. So checking each row:\n\nRow indices 0 (March 1), 1 (March 2), 2 (March 4). None of these have Montreal as the visitor.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the table, is there any other date before March 6? Let me count again. The rows are:\n\n0: March 1\n1: March 2\n2: March 4\n3: March 6 (this is the date in question; we need before this)\nSo up to row index 2.\n\nNone of these have Montreal as visitors. So the claim that \"before March 6, Montreal was the visitor\" isn't supported by the table because there's no such entry.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because none of the rows with dates before March 6 list Montreal as the visitor.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}",
