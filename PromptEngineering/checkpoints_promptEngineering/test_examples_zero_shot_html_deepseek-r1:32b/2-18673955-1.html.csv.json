    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no game that be play on october 30  , 1977 that be list greater than week 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It seems a bit ungrammatical, so I'll try to rephrase it for clarity: \"There are no games played on October 30, 1977, listed with a week number greater than 7.\" Alternatively, it might be interpreted as checking if any game on that date is in a week higher than 7.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. I need to check two things: \n\n1. Are there any games played on October 30, 1977?\n2. If such a game exists, what is its week number?\n\nStarting with the first point, I'll scan through each row's \"date\" column. Scanning down, in row index 6 (since rows are zero-indexed), the date is October 30, 1977. So there is indeed a game on that date.\n\nNext, looking at the week number for this game. The \"week\" column for row index 6 shows week 7. The claim states whether any games on that date have a week number greater than 7. Since the only game on October 30, 1977, is in week 7, there are no games listed with a week number higher than 7 on that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because while there's a game on October 30, it's exactly in week 7 and not greater. So there are no games on that date beyond week 7.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 6, column \"date\" (to confirm the date)\n- Row index 6, column \"week\" (to check the week number)\n\nThese two pieces of information confirm that the game in question is exactly in week 7 and there's no entry beyond that for October 30.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n   ]\n}",
