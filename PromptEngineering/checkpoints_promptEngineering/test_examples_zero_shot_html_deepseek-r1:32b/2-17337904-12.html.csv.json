The rows contain information about different sovereigns with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific names: xiong yan the elder and xiong yong.

For xiong yan the elder, that's row index 3, and the column is 'title'.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about two people named Li\u2014 one is a Duke in Song, and the other is a Marquis in Wey. So I need to check if there are entries in the table that match these titles and names.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are 'state', 'type', 'name', 'title', and 'royal house'. The relevant information here will be under the 'name' and 'title' columns for each state (Song and Wey).\n\nI'll start by searching for the state 'song'. Scanning through the rows, I find a row where the state is 'song'. Let's see: \n\n- Row 13 has state 'song', type 'sovereign', name 'li', title 'duke', royal house '-'.\n\nSo yes, there's a Duke named Li in Song. That part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check for the state 'wey' and whether there's a Marquis named Li. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 14 has state 'wey', type 'sovereign', name 'li', title 'marquis', royal house '-'.\n\nSo that's exactly what we're looking for\u2014a Marquis named Li in Wey. \n\nPutting it together, both conditions are satisfied: there is a Duke of Song named Li and a Marquis of Wey also named Li. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to note the relevant cells. For Song's Duke Li, that's row 13 (since counting starts at 0, let me recount). Let's count: first row is 0 (cai), then up to row 13 being song. Yes, so row index 13 for Song and row index 14 for Wey.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Song: row 13, column 'name' as Li, and row 13, column 'title' as Duke.\n- For Wey: row 14, column 'name' as Li, and row 14, column 'title' as Marquis.\n\nWait, but the claim only mentions the names and titles, so I think including both name and title for each relevant row is necessary to confirm that they match the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are two entries in the table where 'li' is the name: one as the Duke of Song (row 13) and another as the Marquis of Wey (row 14). \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's asserting that someone named Wu isn't a Duke in the states of Chen or Lu. So, I should look for entries where the state is either Chen or Lu and check if any of them have \"Wu\" as their name with the title of Duke.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a state, type, name, title, and royal house. The type here is always 'sovereign', so that's consistent across all entries.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row one by one.\n\n1. **State: Chen**\n   - Row index 2.\n   - Name: You\n   - Title: Duke\n   - So the Duke of Chen is named You, not Wu. That matches part of the claim\u2014Wu isn't the Duke here.\n\n2. **State: Lu**\n   - There are two rows for Jin, but none specifically under Lu except row index 7.\n   - Row index 7:\n     - State: Lu\n     - Name: Shen\n     - Title: Duke\n     - So the Duke of Lu is Shen, not Wu either.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any mention of Wu in other states with the title Duke. Scanning through:\n\n- **Row 0**: State Cai, name Wu, title Marquis.\n- **Row 8**: State Qi, name Wu, title Duke.\n\nWait a minute, in row index 8 (state Qi), the name is Wu and the title is Duke. So Wu is the Duke of Qi. But our claim is about Chen or Lu, not Qi. So that doesn't affect the claim.\n\nSince neither Chen nor Lu have Wu as their Duke, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu.\" Checking the table:\n\n- For state 'chen' (row 2), the name is You, title Duke.

So I need to check for each state if their corresponding 'royal house' column is filled or not. If any of them have a '-' or are missing information, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a 'state' column and a 'royal house' column. The rows correspond to different states with various details including the royal house. \n\nLet me go through each state mentioned in the claim one by one:\n\n1. **Cao**: I need to find the row where the state is 'cao'. Scanning the table, I see that row 1 has state 'cao'. Looking at the 'royal house' column for this row, it shows '-'. So there's no royal house listed here.\n\n2. **Chen**: Next, looking for 'chen'. That's row 2. The 'royal house' is also '-', meaning no royal house is specified.\n\n3. **Song**: Now, checking for 'song'. It appears in row 13. Again, the 'royal house' column has a '-', indicating no information available.\n\n4. **Wey**: The state 'wey' is in row 14. Checking its 'royal house', it's also marked as '-'.\n\n5. **Yan**: Finally, looking at 'yan' which is in row 15. Here too, the 'royal house' column has a '-', so no royal house is listed.\n\nSince each of these states (cao, chen, song, wey, yan) does not have a royal house specified\u2014they all have '-'\u2014the claim that the royal house is available for them is FALSE. \n\nTo be thorough, I should also note which cells were checked.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear at first glance because of possible typos or grammatical issues. The phrase \"be not the name\" might mean that \"li\" is not just the name for those two specific titles and states. So, the claim is asserting that the name \"Li\" isn't exclusively used for the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find all instances where the 'name' column has the value \"li\". Let's go through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows (indices 0-2) don't have \"li\" as the name.\n2. Row 4: Chu state, name is Xiong Yan the Elder \u2013 not li.\n3. Rows 5 and 6 are Jin state with names Jing and Xi \u2013 no match.\n4. Row 7: Lu state, name Shen \u2013 not li.\n5. Rows 8-10 are Qin state with names Marquis, Gongbo, Qin Zhong \u2013 none are li.\n6. Row 11: Song state, name Li. This matches.\n7. Row 12: Wey state, name Li. Another match.\n8. Row 13: Yan state, name Hui \u2013 not li.\n\nSo, the only rows where 'name' is \"li\" are rows 11 and 12. Now, checking their 'state' and 'title':\n\n- Row 11: Song state, title Duke\n- Row 12: Wey state, title Marquis\n\nThe claim states that \"li be not the name for only...\" which suggests there are more instances of \"li\" beyond these two. However, in our table, these are the only two entries with 'name' as \"li\". \n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted. The original claim could mean that \"Li is the name for other titles besides Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey.\" But according to the table, \"Li\" is only used in those two contexts. Therefore, the claim might be false because \"Li\" isn't used elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim was meant to say that \"Li is not exclusively the name for these two,\" but since there are no other entries with \"li\", it's exclusive.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin, which do not have either jing and xi.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It seems to have two parts:\n\n1. For the state 'jin', the royal house is NOT 'ji'.\n2. Additionally, it's mentioned that the state 'jin' does NOT have either 'jing' or 'xi'.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I see multiple entries for 'jin'. Let me check each one.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 5: State 'jin', name 'jing', royal house 'ji'.\n- Row 6: State 'jin', name 'xi', royal house 'ji'.\n\nSo both these rows under state 'jin' have the royal house as 'ji'. That immediately tells me that the first part of the claim is incorrect because it states the royal house is not 'ji', but in reality, it's 'ji' for both entries.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that 'jin' does not have either 'jing' or 'xi'. However, in the table, there are entries for both 'jing' and 'xi' under state 'jin'. So this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false, the entire statement must be FALSE. The relevant cells that we checked include the rows where state is 'jin', looking at the 'royal house' column to verify if it's not 'ji' and checking the 'name' column to see if 'jing' and 'xi' are present.\n\nSo compiling all this, the claim is false because both conditions stated are contradicted by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things about state 'jin': the royal house isn't 'ji', and it doesn't have 'jing' or 'xi'. However, the table shows that 'jin' has a royal house of 'ji' and includes both 'jing' and 'xi'.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
