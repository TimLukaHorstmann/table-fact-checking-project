    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in an HTML table. The claim is: \"the building that remain the tallest in montreal today be the 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re.\"\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It says that as of today, the tallest building in Montreal is 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. To verify this, I should look into the table provided and see if there's any information about which building holds the title of being the current tallest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various details like name, address, years it was the tallest, duration of that period, height in meters and feet, and number of floors. The key columns here are \"years as tallest\" and \"height m / ft,\" but more importantly, I should focus on which building is currently holding the record.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Notre Dame Basilica**: It was the tallest from 1829 to 1928. Since that period ended a long time ago, it's not relevant for today's status.\n2. **Royal Bank Building**: Tallest from 1928 to 1931. Again, this is historical and doesn't affect current standings.\n3. **Sun Life Building**: From 1931 to 1962. Also a past title holder.\n4. **Tour CIBC**: Only held the title in 1962 for less than a year, so it's not relevant now.\n5. **Place Ville Marie**: Held from 1962 to 1964. Again, historical.\n6. **Tour de la Bourse**: From 1964 to 1992. This building was the tallest for quite some time but was surpassed later.\n7. **1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re**: The period is listed as \"1992 - present.\" This indicates that since 1992, this building has been the tallest and currently holds that title.\n\nSo, based on the table, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is indeed the current tallest building in Montreal because it's the only one with a period ending at \"present.\" \n\nTo be thorough, I'll check if any other buildings have overlapping periods or could challenge this. Looking through each row, none of the others extend beyond 1992 except for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells in the table: the important information is found in the \"years as tallest\" and \"name\" columns for the row of 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. The other rows don't provide current data, so focusing on this specific entry suffices.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim says, \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for close to a third of the time of the notre dame basilica.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns: \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest.\" For Notre Dame Basilica, under \"of years as tallest,\" it's 99 years. Sun Life Building has \"of years as tallest\" as 31 years.\n\nNow, calculating a third of Notre Dame's time: 99 divided by 3 is 33. The Sun Life was the tallest for 31 years, which is slightly less than a third but close. So the claim that it remained for close to a third seems accurate.\n\nI'll check other columns just in case. Both buildings have different \"height m / ft\" and \"floors,\" so those don't affect this specific claim about duration. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Sun Life Building's years as tallest (31) from row 2.\n- Notre Dame Basilica's of years as tallest (99) from row 0.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because 31 is approximately a third of 99.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year, follow by place ville marie\". \n\nFirst, I should parse the table and understand its structure. Looking at the HTML, the table has columns like 'name', 'street address', 'years as tallest', 'of years as tallest', 'height m / ft', and 'floors'. Each row represents a building with its details.\n\nThe claim is making two points: \n1. Tour CIBC was the tallest for the least amount of time.\n2. Place Ville Marie followed it, meaning it held the title next in terms of duration.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to look at each building's 'years as tallest' and specifically their durations. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Tour CIBC is in row 3 (0-indexed). The 'of years as tallest' column says \"<1 year\", which is clearly the shortest period.\n- Place Ville Marie is in row 4, with \"2 years\" under the same column.\n- Other buildings have longer durations: Notre Dame has 99 years, Royal Bank 3 years, Sun Life 31 years, Tour de la Bourse 28 years, and 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re 21 years.\n\nSo Tour CIBC indeed holds the record for the shortest time as tallest. Next, Place Ville Marie held it for 2 years, which is more than Tour CIBC's less than a year but shorter than others except Royal Bank (3 years) and the next ones. However, in order of when they were tallest, after Tour CIBC came Place Ville Marie, right?\n\nWait, looking at the 'years as tallest' column: Tour CIBC was in 1962, then Place Ville Marie from 1962-1964. So yes, Place Ville Marie followed Tour CIBC and held the title longer than Tour CIBC but shorter than some others.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Tour CIBC was the tallest for the least amount of time (which it was) and Place Ville Marie followed next in terms of duration is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Tour CIBC was the tallest building for less than a year, which is indeed the shortest period.

The claim is about whether Notre Dame Basilica is still the tallest building today.\n\nLooking at the \"years as tallest\" column for each row:\n\n1. **Notre Dame Basilica**: Years as tallest are from 1829 to 1928. So it held that title for 99 years but stopped being the tallest in 1928.\n\n2. The next building, Royal Bank Building, was the tallest from 1928 to 1931.\n\n3. Sun Life Building took over from 1931 until 1962.\n\n4. Tour CIBC was the tallest in 1962 for less than a year.\n\n5. Place Ville Marie held the title from 1962 to 1964.\n\n6.

But according to the table, it stopped being the tallest in 1928. The current tallest building is 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, which started in 1992 and is still ongoing.\n\nSo, checking the relevant cells:\n\n- For Notre Dame Basilica: row index 0, columns \"years as tallest\" (which ends in 1928) and \"height m / ft\" to compare with others.\n- The last entry, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, has a height of 205m which is taller than Notre Dame's 69m.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.

The claim says: \"although place ville marie has more floors than tour de la bourse, tour de la bourse took the title of the tallest building from place ville marie in 1964.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse.\n2. Tour de la Bourse became the tallest building in 1964, taking the title from Place Ville Marie.\n\nLet me check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll find the rows for \"place ville marie\" and \"tour de la bourse.\"\n\nFor \"place ville marie\":\n- Floors: 47\n- Years as tallest: 1962 - 1964\n\nFor \"tour de la bourse\":\n- Floors: 47\n- Years as tallest: 1964 - 1992\n\nWait, both have the same number of floors (47). So the first part of the claim that Place Ville Marie has more floors is not correct. They have equal floors.\n\nBut then why did Tour de la Bourse take over? The height might be the factor instead. Let's check their heights.\n\nPlace Ville Marie: 188m / 617ft\nTour de la Bourse: 194m / 637ft\n\nAh, so Tour de la Bourse is taller in terms of meters and feet. Even though they have the same number of floors, height-wise, Tour de la Bourse is taller.\n\nSo, the claim says Place Ville Marie has more floors, which is incorrect because they're equal. But the second part about taking the title in 1964 is correct because Tour de la Bourse started being the tallest that year when Place Ville Marie's period ended.\n\nBut since the first condition is false (they have the same floors), the entire claim isn't fully accurate. However, the key point is whether Tour de la Bourse became taller in 1964, which it did. So maybe the answer is TRUE because despite the floor count being equal, the height and year make the second part true.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to check each condition. The claim has two conditions: more floors (which isn't true) and taking the title in 1964 (which is true). Since one condition is false, does that mean the whole claim is false?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is only focusing on the year part and not the floors? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the floor count.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nPlace Ville Marie: 47 floors\nTour de la Bourse: 47 floors\n\nSo, same number. Therefore, the first condition of having more floors is false. Hence, the claim is incorrect because it's not true that Place Ville Marie has more floors. Even though Tour de la Bourse did take over in 1964, the part about floors makes the entire statement wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"has more floor than\" which might be a typo and should be \"floors.\" But regardless, they have equal floors, so Place Ville Marie doesn't have more.\n\nSo, because one part of the claim is false (they don't have more floors), the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse and that Tour de la Bourse became the tallest in 1964.

So I need to check if Tour CIBC has the longest duration as the tallest building compared to all others in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with details like name, address, years it was the tallest, duration (of years as tallest), height, and floors.\n\nI'll start by examining the \"years as tallest\" column for each building. \n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 1829 - 1928 \u2192 99 years\n- Royal Bank Building: 1928 - 1931 \u2192 3 years\n- Sun Life Building: 1931 - 1962 \u2192 31 years\n- Tour CIBC: 1962 \u2192 less than 1 year\n- Place Ville Marie: 1962 - 1964 \u2192 2 years\n- Tour de la Bourse: 1964 - 1992 \u2192 28 years\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 1992 - present \u2192 21 years (current)\n\nFrom this, it's clear that Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest for 99 years, which is much longer than any other building listed. Tour CIBC only held the title for less than a year, so they certainly don't have the record for the most years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the actual record holder is Notre Dame Basilica with 99 years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Tour CIBC was only the tallest for less than one year, whereas other buildings held the title longer.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for the same amount of time as the notre dame basilica.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant information from the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. **Notre Dame Basilica**:\n   - Under the column \"years as tallest\": 1829 - 1928.\n   - The duration is listed under \"of years as tallest\" as 99 years.\n\n2. **Sun Life Building**:\n   - Its \"years as tallest\" are from 1931 to 1962.\n   - The duration here is also given as 31 years in the \"of years as tallest\" column.\n\nNow, I compare the durations:\n- Notre Dame: 99 years\n- Sun Life: 31 years\n\nClearly, these are not the same. Therefore, the claim that they remained the tallest for the same amount of time is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are the \"of years as tallest\" column for both buildings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
