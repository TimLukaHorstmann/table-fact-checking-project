    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the number of student enrol at st andrew university be 600\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for St Andrews University in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row with \"st andrews university\". That must be the one we're interested in.\n\nNext, the claim is about the number of student enrolments, so I need to find the column that corresponds to enrollment numbers. Looking at the table headers, I see columns like \"Enrolment\" which likely refers to the number of students enrolled. \n\nNow, checking the row for St Andrews University, under the \"Enrolment\" column, it says 600. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows that might have similar names or data points that could cause confusion. But in this case, only one entry is named St Andrews University and its enrolment is clearly listed as 600.\n\nTherefore, since the data directly supports the claim without any discrepancies, the answer should be \"TRUE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 13,\n       \"column_name\": \"Enrolment\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"the college team whose nickname is blue hose joined the conference in the year 1965.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find a team with the nickname \"blue hose.\" Scanning the Nickname column, I see several options: Braves, Blue Hose, Knights, etc. The team with \"Blue Hose\" is at row index 12 (Presbyterian College).\n\nNext, I need to check when this team joined the conference. Looking at the relevant columns for joining year, there are two possible columns: one for the year they first joined and another for any changes. The table has a column labeled \"Joined Conference,\" which seems appropriate.\n\nIn row 12, under the \"Joined Conference\" column, the value is 1972. This doesn't match the claim of joining in 1965. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe team with nickname \"Blue Hose\" joined in 1972, not 1965.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Nickname\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Joined Conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to verify a claim about a college's nickname, when it joined an organization, and which conference it belongs to. The claim is: \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n1. The college has the nickname \"blue hose.\"\n2. It joined (presumably the SAC) in 1972.\n3. It is currently a member of the SAC.\n\nI need to check each part against the provided table.\n\nLooking through the table rows, I'm scanning for any team with the nickname \"blue hose.\" Scanning down the \"Nickname\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Braves\n- Row 1: Knights (St Andrews)\n- Row 2: Blue Hose (Presbyterian College)\n\nAh, here it is. Presbyterian College has the nickname \"Blue Hose.\"\n\nNext, I need to confirm when they joined the SAC and if they are still members.\n\nThe columns relevant for this would be \"Joined\" and \"Conference.\" For Presbyterian College (row index 14), let's check:\n\n- Joined: The cell shows 1965.\nWait, that doesn't match the claim of joining in 1972. So there's a discrepancy here. The claim says they joined in '72, but according to the table, it's '65.\n\nAdditionally, looking at \"Conference,\" it says Big South (NCAA Division I). SAC isn't listed; instead, they are part of the Big South.\n\nSo two issues here: the joining year is off, and the conference doesn't align with SAC. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe college with the nickname \"Blue Hose\" joined in 1965 according to the table, not 1972, and it's a member of the Big South, not the SAC.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Nickname\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the conference for the college that leave in 1974, and again in 1989, be the aac (naia)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two years, 1974 and 1989, as leaving years for a college. Then it states that the conference they left was the AAC (NAIA). So, my task is to find if there's a college in the table that left in both 1974 and 1989, and whether their conference at those times was indeed AAC (NAIA).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different college with various details. The relevant columns here are \"Left\" which probably indicates when they left a conference, and \"Conference\" which shows which conference they were part of.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any college has left years that include both 1974 and 1989. Then I'll check what their conference was at those times.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **Fayetteville State University**: Left in 2002, so not relevant.\n2. **Presbyterian College**: Left in 1976 and 1992. Doesn't match 1974 or 1989.\n3. **Queens University of Charlotte**: Left in 1995 and 2013. No match.\n4. **St Andrews University**: Left in 1988 and 2012. Close to 1974 but not exactly. Also, their conference is AAC (NAIA) starting from 1988, which doesn't align with the claim's years.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n5. **Western Carolina University**: Left in 1933 and 1976. Doesn't match.\n6. **University of North Carolina at Pembroke**: Left in 1976 and 1992. No.\n7. **Presbyterian College (another entry)**: Wait, actually looking back, maybe I missed a row. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the rows are all listed from 0 to let's say 14 or so. Let me check each one properly.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: Fayetteville State - left 2002\n- Row 1: Presbyterian College - left 1976, 1992\n- Row 2: Queens University - left 1995, 2013\n- Row 3: St Andrews - left 1988, 2012. Conference is AAC (NAIA) starting from 1988.\n- Row 4: Western Carolina - left 1933, 1976\n- Row 5: University of North Carolina at Pembroke - left 1976, 1992\n- Row 6: Presbyterian College (same as row 1?) Wait, no, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows are more than that. Let me recount:\n\nThe table has multiple entries, so let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Fayetteville State University - Left: 2002\n\nRow 1: Presbyterian College - Left: 1976, 1992\n\nRow 2: Queens University of Charlotte - Left: 1995, 2013\n\nRow 3: St. Andrews University - Left: 1988, 2012; Conference: AAC (NAIA) from 1988.\n\nRow 4: Western Carolina University - Left: 1933, 1976\n\nRow 5: University of North Carolina at Pembroke - Left: 1976, 1992\n\nRow 6: Presbyterian College again? Or maybe another college. Wait, let me check the data.\n\nLooking back at the table provided, I see that there are multiple colleges listed. Let's look for any college that left in both 1974 and 1989.\n\nHmm, scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 3: St Andrews University left in 1988 and 2012. Close to 1989 but not exactly.\n- Any other rows? Let me check the \"Left\" column for any entries with 1974 or 1989.\n\nLooking through each row's \"Left\" years:\n\nRow 0: 2002\nRow 1: 1976, 1992\nRow 2: 1995, 2013\nRow 3: 1988, 2012\nRow 4: 1933, 1976\nRow 5: 1976, 1992\nRow 6: Let's see, perhaps another college. Wait, the user provided a table with multiple rows, but I might have missed some.\n\nWait, in the initial data, I think there are more rows beyond what I've listed here. Let me recount:\n\nActually, looking back, the table includes colleges like St Andrews University which left in 1988 and 2012, and their conference is AAC (NAIA) since 1988.\n\nBut none of the colleges have both 1974 and 1989 as leaving years. The closest is St Andrews with 1988 and 2012. So perhaps the claim is about a different college not listed here, or maybe it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again for any \"Left\" years that include 1974 or 1989.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 3: St Andrews - Left 1988 and 2012\n- Any others? No, seems like none have left in those exact years. \n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there is no college that left in both 1974 and 1989. Hence, the claim cannot be supported by the data given.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed a row where the \"Left\" years include both 1974 and 1989. Let me go through each row's \"Left\" column carefully:\n\nRow 0: 2002\nRow 1: 1976, 1992\nRow 2: 1995, 2013\nRow 3: 1988, 2012\nRow 4: 1933, 1976\nRow 5: 1976, 1992\nRow 6: Maybe another college. Wait, let me check all rows.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- **Fayetteville State University**: Left 2002\n- **Presbyterian College**: Left 1976 and 1992\n- **Queens University of Charlotte**: Left 1995 and 2013\n- **St. Andrews University**: Left 1988 and 2012\n- **Western Carolina University**: Left 1933 and 1976\n- **University of North Carolina at Pembroke**: Left 1976 and 1992\n- **Presbyterian College (another entry?)** Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting rows.\n\nWait, maybe the table has more rows beyond what I've listed. Let me check again:\n\nUpon reviewing all the rows in the table provided, none of them have both 1974 and 1989 as leaving years. Therefore, the claim cannot be true based on the data given.\n\nAdditionally, even if a college had left in those years, their conference would need to be AAC (NAIA). Looking at St Andrews University, which is the closest with a left year near 1989 (1988), their conference is AAC (NAIA) from that time. But since they didn't leave in 1974 or 1989, it doesn't fit.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there's no college in the table that matches both leaving years and having AAC (NAIA) as their conference at those times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false based on the provided data. There is no college listed in the table that left in both 1974 and 1989 with the AAC (NAIA) conference.\n\n**Answer:** False",
