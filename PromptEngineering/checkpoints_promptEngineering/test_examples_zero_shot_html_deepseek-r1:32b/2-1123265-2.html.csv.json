    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, and grid. The relevant information for the claim will be under the \"laps\" column because that's where the number of completed laps is listed.\n\nNext, I need to find the row corresponding to \"tarso marques.\" Scanning through the table, I see that near the end there's a driver named \"tarso marques.\" Let me check his details. The row shows:\n\n- Driver: tarso marques\n- Constructor: minardi - ford\n- Laps: 0\n- Time / retired: spun off\n- Grid: 21\n\nThe laps column for tarso marques is 0, which indicates that he did not complete any laps in the race. The time / retired column mentions \"spun off,\" suggesting that his participation ended prematurely.\n\nTherefore, since the laps are zero, the claim that he didn't complete any lap is supported by the data. So, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is the one under the \"laps\" column for tarso marques. Looking at the row index, it's the last row in the table, which is row index 35.\n\nSo, compiling this, the answer is TRUE and the relevant cell is row_index 35, column_name \"laps.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "tarso marque start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the claim is: \"tarso marque start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap.\" I need to check if this is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should look for Tarso Marques in the driver column. Scanning through the rows, I find a row with \"tarso marques\" as the driver. Let me note that down. So, the row index for this entry seems to be 35 since counting starts from 0. \n\nNow, checking the grid position for Tarso Marques: the grid column shows '21' in his row. Wait, but the claim says he started at grid 13. That's a discrepancy here because according to the table, his grid number is 21, not 13. So this part of the claim might be false.\n\nNext, looking at the laps completed: the laps column for Tarso Marques shows '0'. The claim says he did not complete any lap, which aligns with this data point. So that part is correct.\n\nPutting it together: the grid number in the table doesn't match the claim, but the laps do. However, since the claim states both conditions, and one of them (grid 13) isn't supported by the data, the entire claim should be considered false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the driver name, grid position, and laps for Tarso Marques.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
