    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license, 2 of which run on window.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the components of this claim.\n\nThe first part says that 'corn' is one of three emulators with a proprietary license. So I need to check how many emulators in the table have a proprietary license. Looking at the 'license' column:\n\n- corn: proprietary\n- sixtyforce: proprietary\n- ultrahle: proprietary\n\nThat's three emulators with proprietary licenses. So far, this part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that two of these run on Windows. I need to check each of the three emulators and see their platform(s). \n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n1. corn (row index 3): platform is 'windows' \u2013 so yes, runs on Windows.\n2. sixtyforce (row index 10): platform is 'os x' \u2013 does not run on Windows.\n3. ultrahle (row index 11): platform is 'windows, xbox' \u2013 runs on Windows.\n\nSo, out of the three, corn and ultrahle run on Windows, making that two. That matches the claim's second part.\n\nWait, let me double-check if there are exactly three emulators with proprietary licenses. Yes, only corn, sixtyforce, and ultrahle have 'proprietary' as their license. So corn is indeed one of them, and among these three, two run on Windows. \n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be accurate based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that there are three emulators with a proprietary license and specifies that two of them (corn and ultrahle) run on Windows.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all rows related to mupen64. Scanning through the table, I see two entries: one for \"mupen64\" and another for \"mupen64plus\". Each has a 'platform' column that lists supported platforms.\n\nFor \"mupen64\", the platform is listed as \"windows  , os x  , gnu  / linux  , freebsd  , qnx beos\". That's five platforms. \n\nNext, I check all other rows to see how many platforms each emulator supports:\n\n- 1964: windows, xbox \u2192 2\n- 1964js: javascript \u2192 1\n- cen64: windows, os x, gnu/linux \u2192 3\n- corn: windows \u2192 1\n- daedalusx64: windows, psp \u2192 2\n- mupen64plus: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd \u2192 4 (since it's a separate entry from mupen64)\n- mupen64plus ae: android \u2192 1\n- n64js: javascript \u2192 1\n- project64: windows, xbox \u2192 2\n- sixtyforce: os x \u2192 1\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox \u2192 2\n\nNow, I compare the number of platforms for each. mupen64 supports 5 platforms. The next highest is mupen64plus with 4 platforms. Since mupen64 has exactly one more platform than any other emulator (since no other has 5 or more), the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" By examining the table, I found that mupen64 supports five platforms. All other emulators support fewer platforms, with the next highest being four.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that exactly three emulators can run on both Windows and Xbox platforms. So my task is to check each row in the table and see how many entries have \"windows\" and \"xbox\" listed under the \"platform\" column. \n\nLooking at the table, there are 12 rows of data, each representing an emulator. The columns we're interested in are \"name\", \"current version\", \"system\", \"platform\", and \"license\". For this claim, I only need to focus on the \"platform\" column because that's where the operating systems and platforms are listed.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: The platform is listed as \"windows , xbox\". This means both Windows and Xbox are supported, so this emulator qualifies.\n2. **Row 1**: Platform is \"javascript\". No mention of Windows or Xbox, so it doesn't count.\n3. **Row 2**: Platforms include \"windows\", \"os x\", and \"gnu / linux\". No Xbox here, so not relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Only \"windows\" is listed. Doesn't have Xbox, so nope.\n5. **Row 4**: Platform includes both \"windows\" and \"psp\". Since it's missing Xbox, this one doesn't count.\n6. **Row 5**: Platforms are extensive: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos. But no mention of Xbox, so not relevant.\n7. **Row 6**: Similar to row 5 but without QNX BeOS. Still no Xbox.\n8. **Row 7**: Platform is \"android\". Doesn't include Windows or Xbox.\n9. **Row 8**: Only \"javascript\", so no.\n10. **Row 9**: Platforms are \"windows\" and \"xbox\". This qualifies as another emulator that runs on both.\n11. **Row 10**: Only \"os x\", so not relevant.\n12. **Row 11**: Platforms are \"windows\" and \"xbox\". Another one that fits the criteria.\n\nWait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\n- Row 0: Yes\n- Row 4: No (only Windows)\n- Row 9: Yes\n- Row 11: Yes\n\nSo that's three emulators: rows 0, 9, and 11. \n\nWait a second, in my initial count I thought there were three, but when recounting, it still comes to three. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: windows and xbox \u2013 yes.\n\nRow 4: windows and psp \u2013 no.\n\nRow 5: No Xbox.\n\nRow 9: Windows and xbox \u2013 yes.\n\nRow 11: Windows and xbox \u2013 yes.\n\nSo that's three rows where the platform includes both Windows and Xbox. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly three emulators (rows 0, 9, and 11) support both platforms.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: name, current version, system, platform, and license. Each row represents a different emulator for Nintendo 64.\n\nThe claim states that \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" is the only emulator that runs on Android. To verify this, I need to check two things:\n1. Does \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" run on Android?\n2. Are there any other emulators in the table that also run on Android?\n\nStarting with the first part: Checking which row corresponds to \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\". Looking through the 'name' column, I find it at row index 7 (since counting starts from 0). The 'platform' for this emulator is listed as 'android', so yes, it runs on Android.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other emulators that support Android. I'll go through each row's 'platform' to see if any others mention Android. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 0: Windows, Xbox\n- Row 1: JavaScript\n- Row 2: Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux\n- Row 3: Windows\n- Row 4: Windows, PSP\n- Row 5: Multiple platforms but not Android\n- Row 6: Same as row 5 but with different version\n- Row 7: Android (the one in question)\n- Row 8: JavaScript\n- Row 9: Windows, Xbox\n- Row 10: OS X\n- Row 11: Windows, Xbox\n\nNone of the other rows have 'android' listed under their platforms except row 7. Therefore, \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" is indeed the only emulator in this table that runs on Android.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" is the sole emulator listed as running on Android according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim about \"corn\" is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license and 1 of 2 which run on window , and also be compatible with javascript.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim to check against the table.\n\nStarting with the first condition: corn is one of three emulators with a proprietary license. Looking at the \"license\" column in the table, let's count how many entries have \"proprietary\". Scanning through:\n\n- corn has \"proprietary\".\n- sixtyforce also has \"proprietary\".\n- ultrahle is another with \"proprietary\".\n\nSo that makes three entries: corn, sixtyforce, and ultrahle. So far, this part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim says corn is one of two which run on Windows. Checking the \"platform\" column for each emulator:\n\nLooking at corn's row, under platform it's listed as \"windows\". Now let's see how many others have windows in their platform list. Scanning through:\n\n- 1964: windows\n- project64: windows, xbox\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nWait, that's three emulators (corn, 1964, project64) listed under Windows? Or does the claim say \"run on window\"? Maybe I misread. Let me count again.\n\nLooking for entries where platform includes \"windows\":\n\nRow 0: name 1964, platform windows\nRow 3: corn, platform windows\nRow 8: project64, platform windows, xbox\n\nSo that's three emulators running on Windows, not two as the claim suggests. This seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 1964 \u2192 windows\n- Row 3: corn \u2192 windows\n- Row 8: project64 \u2192 windows\n\nThat's three entries. So the claim says \"1 of 2 which run on window,\" but according to this, there are three emulators that run on Windows. Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nLastly, the claim mentions that corn is compatible with JavaScript. Checking the platform for corn: it only has \"windows\". There's no mention of JavaScript in its platform column. So corn isn't listed as compatible with JavaScript.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Proprietary license count: correct (corn is one of three).\n- Running on Windows: incorrect, there are three, not two.\n- Compatibility with JavaScript: incorrect, corn doesn't have that.\n\nSince at least one part of the claim is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim makes three assertions about \"corn\": it has a proprietary license (which is correct), runs on Windows among two others (incorrect, there are three), and is compatible with JavaScript (incorrect). Since some conditions are not met, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"there be 6 emulator release under the gpl v2 license, but only sixtyforce be release under the gpl v3 license.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the 'license' column to see how many are GPL v2. Then, I'll check if sixtyforce is under GPL v3.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: GPL v2\n2. Row 1: GPL v2\n3. Row 2: BSD (so notGPLv2)\n4. Row 3: Proprietary\n5. Row 4: GPL v2\n6.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator, include javascript\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that mupen64 runs on one more platform than any other emulator listed, and it specifically mentions including JavaScript as a platform.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an emulator with details like name, current version, system, platform, and license. My focus is on the 'platform' column for each emulator to count how many platforms they support.\n\nI'll start by identifying all emulators in the table:\n\n1. 1964\n2. 1964js\n3. cen64\n4. corn\n5. daedalusx64\n6. mupen64\n7. mupen64plus\n8. mupen64plus, android edition (ae)\n9. n64js\n10. project64\n11. sixtyforce\n12. ultrahle\n\nNext, I'll count the number of platforms each emulator supports.\n\n- **1964**: Platforms listed are \"windows , xbox\". That's 2 platforms.\n- **1964js**: Only \"javascript\", so 1 platform.\n- **cen64**: \"windows  , os x  , gnu / linux\" which totals 3 platforms.\n- **corn**: Just \"windows\", so 1 platform.\n- **daedalusx64**: \"windows  , psp\". That's 2 platforms.\n- **mupen64**: Platforms are \"windows  , os x  , gnu / linux  , freebsd  , qnx beos\". Let me count: Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS. So that's 5 platforms.\n- **mupen64plus**: It has \"windows  , os x  , gnu / linux  , freebsd\", which is 4 platforms.\n- **mupen64plus, android edition (ae)**: Only \"android\", so 1 platform.\n- **n64js**: Just \"javascript\", so 1 platform.\n- **project64**: Platforms are \"windows  , xbox\". That's 2.\n- **sixtyforce**: Only \"os x\", so 1.\n- **ultrahle**: \"windows  , xbox\" \u2013 2 platforms.\n\nNow, according to the claim, mupen64 should have one more platform than any other emulator. Let's see: mupen64 has 5 platforms. The next highest is mupen64plus with 4. That would make mupen64 having just one more platform than mupen64plus.\n\nHowever, the claim also mentions \"include javascript\". Looking at which emulators support JavaScript:\n\n- **1964js**: supports JavaScript.\n- **n64js**: supports JavaScript.\n\nSo, are these counted as separate platforms or included in the existing counts? The 'platform' column for 1964js is just JavaScript, so it's one platform. Similarly for n64js.\n\nBut wait, does including JavaScript affect mupen64's count? Let me check mupen64's platforms again: Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS. No mention of JavaScript. So mupen64 doesn't run on JavaScript as a platform; it only runs on the 5 listed.\n\nThe claim says mupen64 runs one more than any other emulator, including those that include JavaScript. Since mupen64 has 5 platforms, and others have up to 4 (mupen64plus), but there are emulators like 1964js and n64js that only have 1 platform each.\n\nBut the key is whether any other emulator besides mupen64 runs on more than 4 platforms. From the counts above, no other emulator has 5 or more platforms except mupen64. The next highest is mupen64plus with 4.\n\nWait a minute: Is there an emulator that combines multiple platforms beyond what's listed? For example, does any other emulator support JavaScript plus others? Let me check again:\n\n- **1964js**: Only JavaScript.\n- **n64js**: Only JavaScript.\nSo no, they don't have more than one platform.\n\nTherefore, mupen64 indeed runs on 5 platforms, which is one more than the next highest (mupen64plus with 4). However, I need to ensure that when the claim says \"include javascript,\" it's not implying that JavaScript adds an extra count beyond what's already considered. Since JavaScript isn't a platform for mupen64, but others have only one or two platforms, including JavaScript doesn't affect the comparison.\n\nWait again: The claim says mupen64 runs 1 more platform than any other emulator, \"include javascript\". Maybe it's implying that even when considering whether other emulators run on JavaScript as an additional platform. But in reality, no other emulator besides 1964js and n64js runs on JavaScript, and they don't have more platforms than mupen64.\n\nSo, mupen64 has the highest number of platforms (5), with the next being 4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because it has one more platform than any other emulator.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator, include javascript.\" Based on the table analysis:\n\n- mupen64 supports 5 platforms.\n- The next highest is mupen64plus with 4 platforms.\n\nThus, mupen64 runs on one more platform than any other emulator. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only 3 emulator run on both windows and xbox, corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's claiming that exactly three emulators support both Windows and Xbox platforms. Those emulators are listed as corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to check which emulators have both \"windows\" and \"xbox\" in their platform column.\n\n1. **Row 0 (Name: 1964)** - Platforms are windows and xbox. So this emulator supports both.\n2. **Row 1 (Name: 1964js)** - Platform is javascript only, so not relevant here.\n3. **Row 2 (Name: cen64)** - Platforms include windows, os x, gnu/linux. No xbox, so doesn't count.\n4. **Row 3 (Name: corn)** - Platform is windows. Wait, but the claim says it runs on both windows and xbox. Hmm, looking back at row 3, the platform column only has \"windows\". So this emulator might not support xbox as per the table. That's a problem because the claim includes corn.\n5. **Row 4 (Name: daedalusx64)** - Platforms are windows and psp. Oh, wait, the platform is windows and psp, but not xbox. Wait, does it have xbox? Let me check again. The platform is \"windows, psp\". So no xbox here either. This contradicts the claim.\n6. **Row 5 (Name: mupen64)** - Platforms include windows among others, so that's one.\n7. **Row 6 (Name: mupen64plus)** - Also has windows as a platform but let me check if it includes xbox. The platforms listed are windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd. No xbox here. So this doesn't count either.\n8. **Row 7 (Name: mupen64plus, android edition)** - Platform is android only.\n9. **Row 8 (Name: n64js)** - Platform is javascript.\n10. **Row 9 (Name: project64)** - Platforms are windows and xbox. So this emulator supports both.\n11. **Row 10 (Name: sixtyforce)** - Only os x.\n12. **Row 11 (Name: ultrahle)** - Platforms include windows and xbox.\n\nWait, so from my initial scan:\n\n- Row 0: 1964 runs on windows and xbox.\n- Row 3: corn only on windows. So it doesn't run on both.\n- Row 4: daedalusx64 is on windows and psp, not xbox.\n- Row 5: mupen64 is on windows among others but does it have xbox? Let me check again. The platform for mupen64 (row 5) is \"windows , os x  , gnu  / linux  , freebsd  , qnx beos\". No xbox listed, so it doesn't run on xbox.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the table.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: 1964 - windows and xbox.\n- Row 3: corn - only windows.\n- Row 4: daedalusx64 - platforms are \"windows , psp\".\n- Row 5: mupen64 - platforms include windows, but does it have xbox? Let me check the exact text. The platform for row 5 is \"windows , os x  , gnu  / linux  , freebsd  , qnx beos\". No mention of xbox.\n- Row 9: project64 - platforms are \"windows , xbox\".\n- Row 11: ultrahle - platforms are \"windows and xbox\".\n\nSo, emulators that run on both windows and xbox are:\n\n- 1964 (row0)\n- project64 (row9)\n- ultrahle (row11)\n\nThat's three emulators. But the claim lists corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64 as the ones running on both, which according to the table, they don't.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because it mentions the wrong emulators. The correct list should be 1964, project64, and ultrahle. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists three specific emulators but based on the table data, these do not all support both Windows and Xbox. Instead, other emulators are found to meet this condition.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_0\", \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_3\", \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_4\", \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"mupen64plus, android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android and javascript.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems to suggest two things:\n1. mupen64plus Android Edition is an emulator.\n2. It's the only one that runs on both Android and JavaScript.\n\nTo verify this, I'll refer to the provided table. Let's break down each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first point: Is mupen64plus, android edition (ae) an emulator? Looking at the table, under the 'name' column, there is a row named \"mupen64plus, android edition (ae)\". So yes, it's listed as one of the emulators. This checks out.\n\nNow, the second part: Is it the only emulator that runs on both Android and JavaScript? To find this out, I need to look at the 'platform' column for each emulator to see which platforms they support.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 1964: Platforms are Windows and Xbox.\n2. 1964js: Runs on JavaScript.\n3. cen64: Supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux (BSD license).\n4. corn: Only on Windows.\n5. daedalusx64: Available on Windows and PSP.\n6. mupen64: Offers multiple platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS.\n7. mupen64plus: Runs on Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD.\n8. mupen64plus Android Edition (ae): Only listed for Android.\n9. n64js: Runs on JavaScript.\n10. project64: Available on Windows and Xbox.\n11. sixtyforce: Only on OS X.\n12. ultrahle: Runs on Windows and Xbox.\n\nLooking at the platforms, I see that mupen64plus Android Edition (ae) is only listed for Android. The other emulator running on JavaScript is n64js. So, n64js runs on JavaScript, but there's no mention of it supporting Android. Conversely, mupen64plus Android Edition supports Android but not JavaScript.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"mupen64plus, android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android and javascript\" is incorrect because:\n- No emulator in the table runs on both Android and JavaScript simultaneously.\n- There are separate emulators for each platform: mupen64plus ae for Android and n64js for JavaScript.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to check are:\n- For mupen64plus ae: row 8, 'platform' column (only Android).\n- For other possible candidates like n64js: row 9, 'platform' column (JavaScript only).\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are the platform entries for these two emulators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
