    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the team lost 4 more match to the chennai super king than they do to the delhi daredevil.\" \n\nFirst, let me try to parse this sentence correctly. It seems like it's saying that a particular team (maybe the one making the claim) lost 4 more matches against Chennai Super Kings compared to how many they lost against Delhi Daredevils.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an opposition team and their performance stats over certain years. The columns are 'opposition', 'span', 'lost', 'tied', and 'win %'.\n\nI need to find out for a specific team (the one making the claim) how many matches they lost against Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils, then see if the difference is 4.\n\nWait, but the table lists each opposition team's own stats. For example, the first row is about Chennai Super Kings' performance when they were the opposition. So, the 'lost' column here represents how many matches Chennai Super Kings lost against others, not necessarily a specific team losing to them.\n\nHmm, this might be tricky. The claim seems to refer to a single team's losses against two different opponents. However, the table doesn't directly show that because each row is about an opposition team's record, not about another team's performance against them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the 'lost' column represents how many times the opposition lost against all teams combined, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the 'lost' refers to their own losses when they were playing as the opposing team. \n\nLet me check each relevant cell:\n\n- For Chennai Super Kings: The row index is 0. The 'opposition' is Chennai Super Kings, and in that row, under 'lost', it's 8. So, when they played against others, they lost 8 matches.\n\n- For Delhi Daredevils: Row index 1, 'lost' is 4. So, when Delhi Daredevils were the opposition, they lost 4 matches.\n\nWait, but does that mean a particular team (the one making the claim) has lost more to Chennai than Delhi? Or is it about how many times each opposition lost in general?\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. The table seems to represent each team's performance when they were playing as the opposition. So, for example, when Team A plays against Team B (listed as 'opposition'), Team B's own losses are 8 if it's Chennai Super Kings.\n\nBut the claim is about a specific team losing more matches to one opposition than another. Since the table doesn't track each team's performance against every other team, only their overall stats when they were the opposition, I might not have enough information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'lost' column refers to how many times the opposition lost in total during that span, regardless of who they played against. So, if a team (say Team X) played both Chennai and Delhi as opponents, Team X would have some number of wins or losses against each. But this table doesn't track individual matchups; it only shows each opposition's overall performance.\n\nTherefore, without data on specific matchups between teams, I can't determine how many times one team lost to another. The claim is about a difference in the number of losses between two opponents for a particular team, but the table doesn't provide that information per matchup.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'lost' column is how many matches the opposition lost against all other teams combined. So, if Team A played Chennai and Delhi as opponents, their own losses would be against others, not necessarily including these specific opponents.\n\nIn this case, the claim can't be verified because we don't know for a particular team (the one making the claim) how many times they lost to each opposition. The table only gives each opposition's total losses across all their matches, not per opponent.\n\nTherefore, I cannot support or refute the claim with the given data. Since there's no information that directly allows me to compare losses against two specific teams for a single team, the answer must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the highest percentage win % be 80.00 against the opposition pune warriers india.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions that the highest win percentage is 80.00% and this is against Pune Warriors India.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns named 'opposition', 'span', 'lost', 'tied', and 'win %'. So, for each team in the opposition column, there's a corresponding win percentage.\n\nI need to check if Pune Warriors India has a win percentage of 80.00%, and whether this is indeed the highest among all teams listed.\n\nLet me scan through the rows:\n\n1. Chennai Super Kings: 40.00%\n2. Delhi Daredevils: 60.00%\n3. Kings XI Punjab: 55.00%\n4. Mumbai Indians: 20.00%\n5. Pune Warriors India: 80.00% (row index 4)\n6. Rajasthan Royals: 50.00%\n7.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest percentage win % be 0.00 against the opposition kochi tusker kerala\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: opposition, span, lost, tied, and win %. There are multiple rows with different teams listed as opposition. The claim mentions that Kochi Tuskers Kerala have a 0.00% win rate, which is the lowest percentage.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the win % values. Starting from the top:\n\n1. Chennai Super Kings: 40.00%\n2. Delhi Daredevils: 60.00%\n3. Kings XI Punjab: 55.00%\n4. Mumbai Indians: 20.00%\n5. Pune Warriors India: 80.00%\n6. Rajasthan Royals: 50.00%\n7.

So the claim states that this is the lowest and correctly attributes it to them.\n\nNow, checking if any other team has a lower win percentage than 0.00%.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the average win % with all of the match against the opposition chennai super king and delhi daredevil be 50%\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that when you consider all matches against two specific teams\u2014Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils\u2014the average win percentage should be 50%. So, my goal is to verify this by looking at the relevant data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: opposition, span, lost, tied, and win %. Each row corresponds to a different team. For each of these teams, the 'win %' column shows their winning percentage against all opponents during their active years.\n\nThe claim is about the average win percentage when considering only matches against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Delhi Daredevils (DD). However, I notice that in the table, each row represents a team's performance overall, not specifically against each opponent. So, to find the average win % against CSK and DD, we would need data on how each team performed against these specific opponents.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the table provided, each row is about a different opposition team. For example, the first row is about matches against Chennai Super Kings, showing that they lost 8 times with a win percentage of 40%. Similarly, the second row is about Delhi Daredevils, who have a 60% win rate.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"all of the match against the opposition chennai super king and delhi daredevil\". This could be interpreted in two ways: either looking at all matches that these two teams played (as opponents) or considering their performance against each other. However, the table doesn't provide data on how they performed specifically against each other; it only shows their overall win percentages.\n\nBut let's clarify: if the claim is about the average of CSK and DD's own win percentages, then we can calculate that. The first row shows Chennai Super Kings have a 40% win rate, and Delhi Daredevils have a 60% win rate. Averaging these two gives (40 + 60)/2 = 50%. So in this case, the average would be exactly 50%, making the claim TRUE.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that this is the correct interpretation. The wording of the claim says \"the average win % with all of the match against the opposition...\". It might mean that we should consider the performance of other teams when they play against CSK and DD. For example, for each team in the table, we would look at their win % specifically against CSK and DD and then take an average across all such matches.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't provide that level of detail. It only shows each opposition team's overall performance, not how they performed against specific opponents. Therefore, it's impossible to calculate the average win percentage when playing against both CSK and DD for all teams because the data isn't available.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I need to consider which interpretation is more plausible based on the table structure. Since the table lists each opposition team's overall performance, not their head-to-head records, the only way to verify the claim is by averaging the win percentages of CSK and DD themselves, which gives 50%.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim refers to all matches played against both CSK and DD across all teams, but without knowing how many matches each team played against these two, we can't compute a weighted average. For example, some teams might have played more against CSK than DD, affecting the overall average.\n\nGiven that the table doesn't provide enough data on match counts or specific head-to-head results, it's unclear whether the claim is referring to the average of CSK and DD's own win percentages or the combined performance across all teams when playing against these two. However, based on the available data, averaging CSK (40%) and DD (60%) gives 50%, which would make the claim TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other rows that include matches against CSK and DD. For instance, looking at each row's 'opposition', they are different teams. So, the only way to get the average win % when playing against CSK and DD is to consider the win percentages of the teams in those specific opposition columns.\n\nBut in this table, each row represents a team's performance as an opposition. For example, if we're looking at how other teams perform against CSK, that data isn't directly provided because the rows are about each team's own performance when they are the opposition. Therefore, without knowing how many matches were played and the outcomes specifically between CSK and DD against other teams, it's impossible to calculate the required average.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is referring to the average of CSK and DD's own win percentages, which is 50%. In that case, the claim would be TRUE. However, without more context or data on how these two teams performed against each other or against others, it's a bit of an assumption.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the average win percentage when considering all matches against Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils is 50%. Based on the table:\n\n1. **Chennai Super Kings** have a win percentage of 40%.\n2. **Delhi Daredevils** have a win percentage of 60%.\n\nAveraging these two percentages gives (40 + 60) / 2 = 50%, which matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\"row_1\": {\"win %\": 60}, \"row_0\": {\"win %\": 40}}\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe average win percentage for Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils is indeed 50%, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": true,\n  \"average_win_percentage\": 50.0\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the average win % with all of the match against the opposition rajasthan royal and the sunrisers hyderabad be 50%\". So, I need to check what the win percentages are for these two teams and see if their average is exactly 50%.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table. The rows are listed with each team under \"opposition\", along with their stats like span, lost, tied, and win %. \n\nLooking for \"Rajasthan Royals\"\u2014I find that row. The win % is 50.00%. Then, looking for \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\"\u2014their win % is also 50.00%. So both teams have the same win percentage of 50%.\n\nTo find the average, I take (50 + 50) / 2 = 50%.

My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the lowest percentage win % be 80.00 against the opposition pune warriers india\". It seems like there's a typo in \"pune warriers\" which should probably be \"Pune Warriors India\" as it appears in the table. So, the user is claiming that Pune Warriors India had an 80% win rate and that this was the lowest percentage.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are opposition, span, lost, tied, and win %. There are ten rows of data for different teams.\n\nI need to verify two things here:\n1. Does Pune Warriors India have a win % of 80%?\n2. Is that the lowest win percentage in the table?\n\nStarting with the first point: Scanning through the table, I find the row for \"pune warriors india\". The win % column shows 80.00. So yes, they have an 80% win rate.\n\nNow, checking if this is the lowest. I'll go through each team's win percentage:\n- Chennai Super Kings: 40%\n- Delhi Daredevils: 60%\n- Kings XI Punjab: 55%\n- Mumbai Indians: 20%\n- Pune Warriors India: 80%\n- Rajasthan Royals: 50%\n- Royal Challengers Bangalore: ~47.33%\n- Sunrisers Hyderabad: 50%\n- Deccan Chargers: ~77.78%\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala: 0%\n\nWait a minute, Kochi Tuskers Kerala has a win % of 0%, which is clearly the lowest in the table. So Pune Warriors India's 80% isn't the lowest; in fact, it's one of the higher percentages.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while Pune Warriors India does have an 80% win rate, this isn't the lowest percentage.

There are several teams listed with their corresponding stats from 2008 to various years up to 2013.\n\nThe claim states that the highest win percentage is 0.00 against Kochi Tuskers Kerala. So I need to check two things: \n1. What's the win % for Kochi Tuskers Kerala?\n2. Is this the highest (or one of the highest) win percentages in the table?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find \"kochi tuskers kerala\". \n\nFound it! It's the last row before Sunrisers Hyderabad and Deccan Chargers. Let me see its details: opposition is Kochi Tuskers Kerala, span is 2011, lost 2, tied 0, and win % is 0.00.\n\nNow, I need to compare this win percentage with others in the table to check if it's the highest. Scanning through the 'win %' column:\n\n- Chennai Super Kings: 40.00%\n- Delhi Daredevils: 60.00%\n- Kings XI Punjab: 55.00%\n- Mumbai Indians: 20.00%\n- Pune Warriors India: 80.00% (highest so far)\n- Rajasthan Royals: 50.00%\n- Royal Challengers Bangalore: 47.33%\n- Sunrisers Hyderabad: 50.00%\n- Deccan Chargers: 77.78%\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala: 0.00%\n\nWait, so Pune Warriors India has an 80% win rate, which is higher than others.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the team lost 4 more matches to the Chennai Super Kings than they do to the Mumbai Indians.\" Hmm, let me parse this carefully.\n\nFirst, I think the claim is comparing how many losses each of these two teams (Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians) have against some common opponent. Or maybe it's about how many times one team lost more than the other? Wait, actually, re-reading: \"lost 4 more matches to Chennai Super Kings than they do to Mumbai Indians.\" So perhaps a team lost X matches to CSK and Y matches to MI, and X is Y + 4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an opposing team. The columns are 'opposition', 'span', 'lost', 'tied', 'win %'. So for each opposition team, we see how many games they lost against that opponent? Or maybe it's how many times they were defeated by them?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me think: The column headers are 'opposition' (probably the team they're playing against), 'span' (the years they played), 'lost', 'tied', and 'win %'. So each row is a different opposition team that this main team has faced.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to \"the team,\" which suggests there's a specific team we're talking about. But in the table, it's listing multiple teams as oppositions, so perhaps this is data from one particular team's perspective, showing how they fared against each of these oppositions.\n\nBut that might not make sense because all the rows are different oppositions. Alternatively, maybe each row represents a different team, and their performance when opposing others. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look at the data:\n\n- Chennai Super Kings: lost 8, no ties, win % 40.\n- Delhi Daredevils: lost 4, win %60.\n- Kings XI Punjab: lost5, 55% wins.\n- Mumbai Indians: lost10, 20%.\n- Pune Warriors India: lost1, 80%.\n- Rajasthan Royals: lost5, tied1, 50%.\n- Royal Challengers Bangalore: lost6, 47.33%.\n- Sunrisers Hyderabad: lost1, 50%.\n- Deccan Chargers: lost2, 77.78%.\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala: lost2, 0%.\n\nWait, but each row is an opposition team. So perhaps the table shows how many times each of these teams (as opponents) were defeated by another specific team? For example, if we're looking at Team X's performance against all these oppositions.\n\nBut the claim refers to \"the team\" losing matches to CSK and MI. So I think the table is from a particular team's perspective, showing their results when playing against each of these opposition teams.\n\nSo for that specific team (let's say it's not listed here), we have how many times they lost to each opposition:\n\nFor example, when facing Chennai Super Kings, this team lost 8 matches. When facing Mumbai Indians, they lost 10 matches.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lost 4 more matches to CSK than to MI.\" So if the team lost X to CSK and Y to MI, then X = Y +4.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nIf we're looking from this team's perspective, their losses against CSK are 8 and against MI are10. Wait, that can't be right because 8 is less than 10. So 8 -10 = -2. That would mean they lost 2 fewer to CSK than MI.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is comparing how many times these two teams (CSK and MI) have lost against some other common team.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider each opposition's losses as their own statistics. So for example, Chennai Super Kings have 8 losses, Mumbai Indians have10 losses.\n\nBut wait, if we're considering the number of losses each team has overall, then CSK have 8, MI have10. The claim says \"4 more than,\" so is 10 -8=2, which is not 4. So that would make the statement false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the table's structure. Let me think again: each row is an opposition team. For example, if this is a table of how Team X performed against each opponent:\n\n- Against CSK, they lost 8 times.\n- Against MI, they lost10 times.\n\nSo for Team X, their losses are 8 vs CSK and10 vs MI. So Team X's losses to CSK:8, to MI:10. The difference is -2; Team X lost 2 fewer matches to CSK than MI. Therefore, the claim that they lost4 more to CSK than MI is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table shows each team's performance as opponents, meaning how many times they themselves have been defeated by others. So for example, CSK have lost8 games in total against all opponents, and MI have lost10. But then again, comparing those totals doesn't directly relate to a specific team losing more or fewer.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that Team A lost 4 more matches against CSK than against MI. If so, from Team A's perspective, their losses to CSK would be X and to MI Y, with X = Y +4.\n\nBut in our table, if we're looking at another team (say Team B) which has played against both CSK and MI:\n\nIf Team B's losses to CSK are 8, and to MI are10, then 8 is not 4 more than10. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is showing each opposition's performance when facing a particular team. For example, when they played against this main team, how many times they (the opposition) lost.\n\nSo CSK, when playing against Team X, lost8 times. Similarly, MI lost10 times when playing against Team X. So for Team X, their wins would be 8 against CSK and10 against MI.\n\nBut the claim is about \"the team\" losing more to CSK than to MI by4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nThe claim: The team lost 4 more matches to Chennai Super Kings than they did to Mumbai Indians.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\n- L_CSK = number of losses against CSK\n- L_MI = number of losses against MI\n\nThe claim is that L_CSK = L_MI +4.\n\nNow, looking at the table: each row represents a different opposition team. The 'lost' column shows how many times they (the opposition) lost when playing against... who? Maybe the main team we're considering.\n\nSo if this is Team X's performance against various opponents:\n\n- Against CSK: Team X lost 8 matches.\n- Against MI: Team X lost10 matches.\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean that in games between Team X and CSK, Team X lost8. Similarly, in games between Team X and MI, they lost10.\n\nSo for Team X, their losses are 8 vs CSK,10 vs MI.\n\nThen the claim is that \"the team (Team X) lost4 more matches to CSK than to MI.\" So let's check: L_CSK =8, L_MI=10. Is 8 equal to10 +4? No. Because 8 is less than10, so it's actually2 fewer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have the perspective reversed. Maybe the 'lost' column represents how many times the opposition lost, meaning Team X won those matches. So if CSK have 'lost'8, that means Team X beat CSK8 times. Similarly, MI lost10, so Team X beat MI10 times.\n\nBut then the claim is about Team X losing more to CSK than to MI by4. That would mean Team X has L_CSK = L_MI +4. But if L_CSK is the number of losses Team X had against CSK, which in this case would be (total games) -8 wins, but we don't have total games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify:\n\nAssuming that each row represents an opposition team and the 'lost' column is how many times they lost to Team X. So when Team X played against CSK, CSK lost8 games, meaning Team X won8. Similarly, when Team X played MI, MI lost10, so Team X won10.\n\nBut the claim is about losses by \"the team\" (probably Team X) to these oppositions. So if Team X lost L_CSK games against CSK and L_MI against MI, then we need to find if L_CSK = L_MI +4.\n\nBut in the table, 'lost' is how many times the opposition lost to Team X, which would be Team X's wins. Therefore, Team X's losses against these teams would be (total games) minus their wins. But since we don't have total games played or draws/ties, it's hard to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding and 'lost' refers to how many times the main team lost when playing against that opposition. So for example, in matches between Team X and CSK, Team X lost8 times (so they won whatever is left). Similarly, in matches against MI, Team X lost10 times.\n\nSo then:\n\n- L_CSK =8\n- L_MI=10\n\nThen the claim is that 8 =10 +4? No. That's not correct. So perhaps the table shows how many times each opposition team lost when facing Team X, meaning Team X's wins are8 against CSK and10 against MI.\n\nBut then \"the team\" (Team X) didn't lose more to CSK; they actually lost fewer or more?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nAssume that the 'lost' column in the table represents how many times each opposition team lost when playing against Team X. So:\n\n- When Team X played CSK: CSK lost8 games \u2192 Team X won8\n- When Team X played MI: MI lost10 games \u2192 Team X won10\n\nBut we don't know how many games were played in total or how many Team X lost.\n\nHowever, if the 'lost' column is about the main team's losses to these oppositions, then:\n\n- L_CSK =8 (Team X lost8 to CSK)\n- L_MI=10 (Team X lost10 to MI)\n\nThen the claim would be that 8 =10 +4? No. That doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting and 'lost' is how many times the main team lost in general, not specifically against each opposition. But that doesn't make sense because it's per row (per opposition).\n\nWait, perhaps the table is showing for each team (opposition) how many times they have lost in their matches. So:\n\n- CSK have lost8 games overall\n- MI have lost10 games overall\n\nBut then, to find how many times Team X lost against CSK and MI, we would need more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is showing for each opposition team (CSK, MI), how many times they lost when facing Team X. So:\n\n- When playing Team X, CSK lost8 times \u2192 Team X won8\n- When playing Team X, MI lost10 times \u2192 Team X won10\n\nBut then \"the team\" (Team X) has not lost more to CSK; in fact, they've lost fewer or none?\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to look at the numbers:\n\nIf L_CSK =8 and L_MI=10 for Team X's losses, then 8 vs10. The claim is that L_CSK = L_MI +4 \u21928=10+4? No.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the other way around: perhaps 'lost' refers to how many times the main team lost against each opposition. So:\n\n- Against CSK, Team X lost8\n- Against MI, Team X lost10\n\nThen 8 vs10. The claim is that L_CSK = L_MI +4 \u21928=10+4? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the table. Perhaps 'lost' refers to how many times each opposition team has lost overall, not specifically against Team X.\n\nSo CSK have8 losses in total, MI have10 losses in total. Then \"the team\" (could be another team) has lost4 more games against CSK than against MI.\n\nBut without knowing the main team's performance against both, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is showing for each team, their number of losses when facing a specific opponent, but that doesn't make sense as the table would need to have multiple rows per team.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem states: \"You are tasked with determining whether the statement 'the team lost four more games against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) than against Mumbai Indians (MI)' is true or false based on the provided data.\"\n\nAssuming that in the table, each row represents a different team, and the 'lost' column shows how many times they have lost to a specific opponent.\n\nBut without knowing which opponent, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the table lists all losses of \"the team\" against various opponents, so for CSK, they have8 losses, and for MI,10.\n\nWait, but that would mean \"the team\" has lost8 games to CSK and10 to MI, making the difference -2, not +4. So the statement is false.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-express:\n\nIf the table shows how many times each opposition team has defeated \"the team,\" then:\n\n- CSK have beaten \"the team\"8 times\n- MI have beaten \"the team\"10 times\n\nSo \"the team\" lost8 games to CSK and10 to MI. The difference is 10 -8=2, so MI are 2 more than CSK.\n\nThe statement says they lost four more against CSK, which would mean L_CSK = L_MI +4 \u21928=10+4? No, that's not true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table shows how many times each opposition team has lost when playing \"the team.\" So:\n\n- When CSK plays \"the team,\" they lose8 times\n- When MI plays \"the team,\" they lose10 times\n\nWhich would mean \"the team\" beat CSK8 times and MI10 times. Then the losses of \"the team\" against CSK would be whatever is left.\n\nBut without knowing total games, it's impossible to tell. Maybe I'm missing data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table shows \"the team\"'s own record: how many they've lost when facing each opponent.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- Against CSK, \"the team\" has8 losses\n- Against MI, they have10 losses\n\nThen, 8 vs10. The statement claims they lost four more to CSK, but in reality, they lost two fewer. So the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are reversed: maybe it's how many times \"the team\" has beaten each opponent.\n\nSo:\n\n- Against CSK, \"the team\" has8 wins\n- Against MI,10 wins\n\nThen their losses against these teams would depend on total games played. But without knowing that, we can't determine the number of losses.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let's assume that the table lists for each opponent (CSK and MI), how many times \"the team\" lost to them.\n\nSo:\n\n- To CSK:8 losses\n- To MI:10 losses\n\nThen, 8 vs10. The difference is -2, so they lost two more games against MI than against CSK.\n\nThe statement says four more against CSK, which would be L_CSK = L_MI +4 \u21928=10+4? No. So the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the team\" lost four more against CSK than against MI, then:\n\nL_CSK - L_MI=4\n\nBut given L_CSK=8 and L_MI=10, 8-10=-2\u22604. So it's not true.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Maybe the numbers are the total losses of each team (CSK and MI), so CSK have8 losses overall, MI have10 losses overall.\n\nThen \"the team\" could be a third team; if they played against both CSK and MI, we don't know how many times they lost to each unless specified.\n\nBut without that data, it's impossible to answer. So perhaps the table is meant to represent \"the team\"'s record against CSK and MI, with 'lost' indicating their losses to those teams.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Against CSK:8 losses\n- Against MI:10 losses\n\nThus, L_CSK=8, L_MI=10. The statement claims L_CSK = L_MI +4 \u21928=10+4? No. So false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent how many times \"the team\" has defeated each opponent, so:\n\n- Against CSK:8 wins\n- Against MI:10 wins\n\nWhich would mean their losses against these teams could be inferred if we know total games. But without that info, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. The problem mentions only two opponents, CSK and MI, with \"the team\" having certain losses against them.\n\nIf the table shows:\n\n- For CSK:8 losses (against whom?)\n- For MI:10 losses\n\nBut unless we know that these are \"the team\"'s losses when facing CSK and MI, respectively, it's unclear.\n\nAssuming that, then:\n\n- L_CSK=8\n- L_MI=10\n\nThus, 8 vs10. The statement is they lost four more against CSK, which would require L_CSK=L_MI +4 \u21928=10+4? No. So the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the team\" has8 losses overall, and among those, x are against CSK and y against MI, with x - y=4. But without knowing x and y, we can't determine.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the data, \"the team\" has a certain number of losses against CSK and MI, but from the table provided (which isn't shown here), we have to infer.\n\nBut since I don't have the actual table, I'm making assumptions. Based on the user's message, they only mentioned two teams: CSK with 8 and MI with10 in the 'lost' column.\n\nAssuming that \"the team\" has8 losses against CSK and10 against MI, then the statement is false because 8\u226010+4.\n\nAlternatively, if the table shows how many times each opponent lost to \"the team,\" then:\n\n- CSK lost 8 games to \"the team\"\n- MI lost10 games to \"the team\"\n\nWhich would mean \"the team\" has8 wins against CSK and10 against MI. Thus, their losses against these teams would be dependent on total games played.\n\nBut without knowing the total number of games or other results, we can't determine how many times they lost to each opponent.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler: perhaps \"the team\" has a certain number of losses in total, and among those, 8 are against CSK and10 are against MI. That would mean they have more losses against MI than against CSK by 2 games.\n\nThus, the statement that they lost four more against CSK is false because it's actually two fewer.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the assumption that \"the team\" has8 losses to CSK and10 to MI, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that \"the team\" lost four more games against CSK than against MI. Based on the data provided, where \"the team\" has 8 losses against CSK and 10 losses against MI, this claim is not accurate.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Losses Against Each Team:**\n   - Losses against CSK: 8\n   - Losses against MI: 10\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Losses:**\n   - Difference = Losses against CSK - Losses against MI\n   - Difference = 8 - 10 = -2\n\n3. **Interpret the Result:**\n   - A negative difference indicates that \"the team\" lost fewer games against CSK compared to MI.\n   - Specifically, they lost 2 more games against MI than against CSK.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Statement:**\n   - The statement asserts losing four more games against CSK, which would require:\n     - Losses against CSK = Losses against MI + 4\n     - 8 = 10 + 4 \u2192 8 = 14 (False)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because \"the team\" lost two fewer games against CSK than against MI.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe statement that \"the team\" lost four more games against CSK than against MI is false. They actually lost two fewer games against CSK compared to MI.",
