The crowd number is given as 30095.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game on May 15, 1976, so I need to find the row where Carlton is the home team and Richmond is the away team. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The second row has \"carlton\" as the home team and \"richmond\" as the away team. That's the relevant game.\n\nNow, checking the crowd number for this row: the cell under 'crowd' is 30095.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the home team, fitzroy, lose to the away team, south melbourne, 12.15 (87) to 11.22 (88).\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game played on May 15, 1976.\n\nLooking at the first row (row index 0), the home team is Fitzroy with a score of 11.22 (88), and the away team is South Melbourne with 12.15 (87). The claim states that Fitzroy lost to South Melbourne, which would mean South Melbourne's score should be higher than Fitzroy's.\n\nBut wait, in Australian Rules Football, the scores are calculated as goals and behinds. Goals are worth 6 points each, and behinds are 1 point. So, for Fitzroy: 11 goals and 22 behinds. Calculating that, 11 * 6 = 66, plus 22 gives a total of 88 points. For South Melbourne, 12 goals and 15 behinds: 12*6=72 +15=87 points.\n\nSo Fitzroy has 88 points, and South Melbourne has 87. That means Fitzroy actually won the game because their total points are higher than South Melbourne's. Therefore, the claim that Fitzroy lost to South Melbourne is incorrect.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check the relevant cells in the table: row index 0 for both home team score and away team score. \n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the home team (Fitzroy) won with a higher score than the away team (South Melbourne). The claim incorrectly states that Fitzroy lost.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim: \"the crowd for the game on may 15 1976 between melbourne and hawthorn be 25876.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find a match for both the date and the teams involved.\n\nStarting with the first row: Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne on May 15, 1976. The crowd here is 11267, which doesn't match the claim's 25876. So this isn't relevant.\n\nNext, Carlton vs. Richmond on the same date at Princes Park with a crowd of 30095. Again, not matching the claim.\n\nMoving to the third row: Melbourne vs. Hawthorn on May 15, 1976. The venue is the MCG, and the crowd listed is 25876. This exactly matches the claim. So I'll note this row as relevant.\n\nThe fourth row is Geelong vs. Footscray with a crowd of 30395, which doesn't apply. Similarly, the fifth row is St Kilda vs. Essendon at Moorabbin Oval with 19864 attendees\u2014also not matching.\n\nLastly, Collingwood vs. North Melbourne had a crowd of 34051, so that's not relevant either.\n\nSo, the third row is the only one where both teams and date match, and the crowd figure is exactly as stated in the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:** The claim specifies the date (May 15, 1976), the two teams (Melbourne and Hawthorn), and the crowd number (25876).\n\n2. **Scan Each Row for Matching Date:** Look through each row's 'date' column to find May 15, 1976.\n\n3. **Find Correct Teams:** Within the rows with the correct date, locate the one where the home team is Melbourne and the away team is Hawthorn.\n\n4. **Check Crowd Number:** Verify if the crowd figure for that specific game matches 25876.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the crowd for the game on may 15 1976 between geelong and footscray be 30395.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions a specific date, May 15, 1976, and two teams: Geelong and Footscray. The crowd number given is 30,395.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to find the game between these two teams on that date. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Fitzroy vs South Melbourne - not our teams.\nRow 1: Carlton vs Richmond - nope.\nRow 2: Melbourne vs Hawthorn - no match here either.\nRow 3: Geelong vs Footscray - this is the game we're interested in. The date here is May 15, 1976, which matches the claim. Now, checking the crowd column for this row, it's 30395. That exactly matches the number stated in the claim.\nRow 4: St Kilda vs Essendon - not relevant.\nRow 5: Collingwood vs North Melbourne - also not relevant.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are satisfied by Row 3. The crowd figure is correct, and it's for the right game on the specified date. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include the row index 3 and the columns 'crowd', as well as perhaps other columns to confirm teams and date.\n\nWait, actually, in the JSON response, I need to list all the relevant cells that were checked. So for this claim, we're checking three things: the home team (Geelong), away team (Footscray), the date, and the crowd number. Each of these is in row 3, so their respective columns are 'home team', 'away team', 'date', and 'crowd'.\n\nBut looking at the example response, they included only two cells. Hmm. Maybe the minimal required is just the cells that confirm the claim. So for this case, checking the crowd cell would be sufficient once we've found the correct row based on teams and date.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll include all relevant cells checked:\n\n- The home team: Geelong (row 3, 'home team')\n- The away team: Footscray (row 3, 'away team')\n- The date: May 15, 1976 (row 3, 'date')\n- The crowd: 30395 (row 3, 'crowd')\n\nBut perhaps the user expects only the cells that directly support the claim. So if the crowd is correct for that game on that date between those teams, then it's TRUE.\n\nWait, but in the example given, they checked two cells to confirm the answer. In this case, I think including all four relevant columns would be more thorough, but perhaps only the 'crowd' is necessary once we've identified the correct row based on the other criteria.\n\nI think for clarity and to ensure that each part of the claim is verified, listing all four cells makes sense. But perhaps it's sufficient to just include the crowd cell as that directly answers the claim. Alternatively, including all to show how the data was cross-referenced.\n\nHmm, but according to the instructions, I should list which cells are relevant to verify the claim. So each part of the claim needs a corresponding cell check: date, home team, away team, and crowd.\n\nSo in this case, row 3 has:\n\n- 'home team' as Geelong\n- 'away team' as Footscray\n- 'date' as May 15, 1976\n- 'crowd' as 30395\n\nEach of these columns is relevant because the claim specifies all four aspects. Therefore, each cell in row 3 for those four columns should be included.\n\nBut looking back at the example, they only included two cells: Revenue and Employees. So perhaps in this case, I can just include the 'crowd' column since that's what directly answers the claim, but maybe also include the date to confirm it's May 15th, as well as home and away teams.\n\nWait, no. The user says to check each condition against the table. So for each part of the claim:\n\n- Date: May 15, 1976\n- Home team: Geelong\n- Away team: Footscray\n- Crowd: 30395\n\nEach of these has a corresponding cell in row 3.\n\nSo I think the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index 3, column 'home team'\n- row_index 3, column 'away team'\n- row_index 3, column 'date'\n- row_index 3, column 'crowd'\n\nBut perhaps the user expects only the crowd cell. Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to include all four to show that each part of the claim is verified.\n\nIn any case, since the instruction says to check each condition, I think including all four cells is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as the table confirms Geelong vs Footscray on May 15, 1976 had a crowd of 30,395. \n\n```json\n{\n    \"is_claim_true\": true,\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column\": \"home team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column\": \"date\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column\": \"crowd\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the crowd for the game on may 15 1976 between collingwood and north melbourne be 34051\". So, breaking this down, there are three key pieces of information here:\n\n1. The date of the game: May 15, 1976.\n2. The teams involved: Collingwood as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team (or vice versa).\n3. The crowd number: 34051.\n\nMy goal is to check if all these details match exactly with the information in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, I see that it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game on May 15, 1976, involving various teams.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find the specific game between Collingwood and North Melbourne. I'll look at both the home team and away team columns for each row until I locate the relevant match.\n\nUpon examining the last row of the table:\n\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Away team: north melbourne\n\nSo, this is definitely the game in question since it's between Collingwood (home) and North Melbourne (away).\n\nNext, I need to verify the date. The claim specifies May 15, 1976, which matches exactly with the date provided in this row (\"15 may 1976\"). So far, so good.\n\nNow, checking the crowd number for this game. In the same row, under the 'crowd' column, it says 34051. This is exactly the number mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince all three pieces of information (date, teams involved, and crowd number) match perfectly with what's stated in the table, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo summarize my findings:\n\n- The game between Collingwood and North Melbourne on May 15, 1976, indeed took place.\n- The crowd for this particular game was 34051, as recorded in the table.\n\nTherefore, there are no discrepancies or missing pieces that would make the claim false.

So, the claim says: \"the home team, Carlton, lose to the away team Richmond, 9.15 (69) to 21.14 (140)\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The home team is Carlton, and they are losing to the away team Richmond. The scores mentioned are 9.15 for Richmond and 21.14 for Carlton, but wait, that doesn't seem right because usually, in sports like Australian Rules Football, the team with the higher score wins.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find the relevant information. Let's see:\n\n1. The first row is about Fitzroy vs South Melbourne. Not relevant here.\n2. The second row has Carlton as the home team and Richmond as the away team. That matches the claim. Now, let's look at their scores:\n   - Home team score: 21.14 (140)\n   - Away team score: 9.15 (69)\n   \nWait a minute, according to the table, Carlton scored higher (21.14) and Richmond lower (9.15).

That's conflicting.\n\nThe rest of the rows involve other teams like Melbourne vs Hawthorn, Geelong vs Footscray, St Kilda vs Essendon, and Collingwood vs North Melbourne.

It says \"15 may 15,\" which doesn't make much sense because May typically has 31 days, but that might just be a typo or mistake in the claim itself. Also, the team names are spelled as \"melboume\" and \"hawthom,\" which I assume are supposed to be \"Melbourne\" and \"Hawthorn.\" So, I'll proceed with those corrected spellings.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played on 15 May 1976. There are six games listed. My goal is to find the game between Melbourne (home team) and Hawthorn (away team) on that date and check the crowd number.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: Fitzroy vs South Melbourne at Junction Oval with a crowd of 11,267. Not relevant because it's not Melbourne vs Hawthorn.\n2. **Second Row**: Carlton vs Richmond at Princes Park with a crowd of 30,095.

Each row represents a game played on May 15, 1976.\n\nI need to find the specific row where St Kilda is playing against Essendon. Looking through each row:\n\n- The first row: Fitzroy vs South Melbourne.\n- The second row: Carlton vs Richmond.\n- The third row: Melbourne vs Hawthorn.\n- The fourth row: Geelong vs Footscray.\n- The fifth row: St Kilda vs Essendon.\n- The sixth row: Collingwood vs North Melbourne.\n\nSo, the fifth row is the one we're interested in. Let's look at the details in that row:\n\n- Home team: St Kilda\n- Away team: Essendon\n- Date: 15 May 1976 (which matches the claim)\n- Crowd: 19864\n\nThe claim states the crowd was 19,864. According to the table, in that specific row under the 'crowd' column, it's exactly 19864. Therefore, the numbers match.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there are no other rows with the same teams playing on that date because if there were multiple games between St Kilda and Essendon on May 15, 1976, that could complicate things. But in this table, each row is a separate game, and only one row involves both St Kilda and Essendon.\n\nSo, all the relevant information points to the claim being accurate. The crowd size for that particular game was indeed 19,864 as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the fifth row of the table shows the crowd number 19864 for the game between St Kilda and Essendon on May 15, 1976.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the crowd for the game on may 15 1976 between fitzroy and south melbourne be 11267\".\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', 'away team score', 'venue', 'crowd', and 'date'. Each row represents a different game played on May 15, 1976.\n\nI need to find the row that involves both Fitzroy as the home team and South Melbourne as the away team. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Fitzroy, Away team is South Melbourne. This matches the teams mentioned in the claim.\n  \nNext, I'll check the date for this row. The 'date' column shows \"15 may 1976\", which aligns with the claim's date.\n\nNow, looking at the 'crowd' column for this row, it says 11267. That exactly matches the number given in the claim.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the data: correct teams, correct date, and the crowd number is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as the relevant cells confirm all details provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
