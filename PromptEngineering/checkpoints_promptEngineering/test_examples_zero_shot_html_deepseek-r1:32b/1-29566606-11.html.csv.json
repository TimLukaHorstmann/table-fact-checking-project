    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to understand its structure and content. The table has five columns: programme, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, and new channel(s). There are five rows, each corresponding to a different TV show.\n\nThe claim in question is about \"art attack.\" I'll locate the row for \"art attack\" in the table. Scanning through the first column under 'programme,' I find that \"art attack\" is listed as one of the entries.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant columns for this claim: original channel(s). The second column lists the date(s) of original removal, and the third column shows where each programme was originally broadcast. For \"art attack,\" the original channel(s) are specified as 'citv' in the third column.\n\nThe claim states that \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv.\" Based on the information from the table, this is correct because the original channel for \"art attack\" is indeed citv.\n\nNext, I need to verify if there's any other information that might affect this conclusion. The fourth and fifth columns provide details about when and where each programme was returned, but these aren't directly relevant to the claim since it only pertains to the original broadcast.\n\nTherefore, considering all the relevant cells from the table, the claim is supported, making it TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has five columns: programme, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, and new channel(s). There are five rows in total, each corresponding to a different TV show.\n\nThe claim mentions \"big brother,\" so I should find the row where the programme is \"big brother.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- The first row is \"celebrity big brother.\"\n- The second row is \"big brother.\"\n\nSo, row index 1 (assuming we start counting from 0) corresponds to \"big brother.\" Now, checking the columns relevant for the claim. The claim talks about when it will return, which should be in the \"date of return\" column.\n\nIn row 1, under \"date of return,\" it says \"9 september 2011.\" That matches exactly with the date mentioned in the claim: September 9, 2011.\n\nTherefore, since the table states that \"big brother\" returns on September 9, 2011, and the claim is about the same date, the information supports the claim. \n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells to confirm. The original removal date and channels might not directly affect whether the return date is correct, but for thoroughness:\n\n- Original removal dates: \"10 september 2010\" in row 1.\n- Original channel: \"channel 4.\"\n- New channel upon return: \"channel 5.\"\n\nThese details don't conflict with the claim and actually provide context that supports the programme's movement to a new channel, which doesn't impact the return date assertion.\n\nSo, all relevant cells point towards the claim being true. The key cell here is the \"date of return\" in row 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as it accurately reflects the return date for \"big brother.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it mentions \"born to be different\" and a return date of August 18, 2011. My goal is to check if this information matches any data in the table.\n\nI start by scanning the table for the programme named \"born to be different.\" Looking through the rows, I find that on row index 4 (since counting starts at 0), there's a row with the programme \"born to be different.\"\n\nNext, I need to check when this programme returned. The relevant column is \"date of return.\" In the table, for this row, the \"date of return\" is listed as \"9 june 2011.\" \n\nThe claim states that it will return on August 18, 2011, but according to the table, the actual return date was June 9, 2011. These two dates don't match.\n\nI should also check if there's any possibility of multiple return dates or additional information in other columns. However, looking at the \"date(s) of original removal\" for this programme shows multiple dates: 2004, September 13, 2007, and May 5, 2009. But the \"date of return\" is only June 9, 2011, with no mention of August 18, 2011.\n\nTherefore, since the claimed return date isn't present in the table for that programme, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
