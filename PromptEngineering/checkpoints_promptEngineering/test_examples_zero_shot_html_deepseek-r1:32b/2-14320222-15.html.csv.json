    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"player tony horacek be 1 of 2 player from the kelowna wing (whl)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that Tony Horacek is one of two players who came from the Kelowna Wings in the WHL. So I need to check how many players are listed as coming from \"kelowna wings (whl)\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their details. The relevant columns here are \"player\" and \"college / junior / club team (league)\". \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Glen Seabrooke - Peterborough Petes (OH). Not Kelowna Wings.\n2. Row 1: Bruce Rendall - Chatham Maroons (OPJHL). No match.\n3. Row 2: Darryl Gilmour - Moose Jaw Warriors (WHL). Close, but not Kelowna.\n4. Row 3: Shane Whelan - Oshawa Generals (OH). Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Paul Marshall - Northwood School (NY). Different league and team.\n6. Row 5: Daril Holmes - Kingston Canadians (OH). No match.\n7. Row 6: Ken Alexander - Kitchener Rangers (OH). Not applicable.\n8. Row 7: Tony Horacek - Kelowna Wings (WHL). This matches the claim. So that's one player.\n9. Row 8: Mike Cusack - Dubuque Fighting Saints (USHL). Different team and league.\n10. Row 9: Gord Murphy - Oshawa Generals (OH). Not relevant.\n11. Row 10: Rod Williams - Kelowna Wings (WHL). Another match! So that's the second player.\n12. Row 11: Paul Maurice - Windsor Compuware Spitfires (OH). Doesn't fit.\n\nSo, I found two players from Kelowna Wings in WHL: Tony Horacek (Row 7) and Rod Williams (Row 10). Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two players from that team.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two players from the Kelowna Wings (WHL): Tony Horacek at row index 7 and Rod Williams at row index 10. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team (league)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team (league)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"paul marshall be 1 of only 3 united state player list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that Paul Marshall is one of only three United States players listed in the table. So, I need to verify two things: \n\n1. Is Paul Marshall a player from the United States?\n2. How many players in total are from the United States?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying all the rows where the nationality is \"united states\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 5 has Paul Marshall with nationality as United States.\n- Row 6 has Ken Alexander, also from the United States.\n- Row 8 mentions Mike Cusack, who is another player from the United States.\n\nSo, there are three players listed with United States nationality: Paul Marshall, Ken Alexander, and Mike Cusack. \n\nNext, I'll check if Paul Marshall is indeed one of these three. From row 5, yes, he's listed as a United States player. Therefore, the claim that he is one of only three such players holds true.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. For each of these three players, the \"nationality\" column is crucial. Additionally, since Paul Marshall is specifically mentioned, his row should be included as well.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5: nationality (Paul Marshall)\n- Row 6: nationality (Ken Alexander)\n- Row 8: nationality (Mike Cusack)\n\nThis confirms that there are exactly three United States players, and Paul Marshall is one of them.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"ken alexander be 1 of 3 player who play the defense position.\" Wait, there's a typo in the claim\u2014probably meant \"is\" instead of \"be.\" So the correct claim should be that Ken Alexander is one of three players who play the defense position.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find all players with the position \"defense.\" Let me go row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Glen Seabrooke - center\n2. Row 1: Bruce Rendall - left wing\n3. Row 2: Darryl Gilmour - goaltender\n4. Row 3: Shane Whelan - center\n5. Row 4: Paul Marshall - defense\n6. Row 5: Daril Holmes - right wing\n7. Row 6: Ken Alexander - defense\n8. Row 7: Tony Horacek - left wing\n9. Row 8: Mike Cusack - forward\n10. Row 9: Gord Murphy - defense\n11. Row 10: Rod Williams - right wing (Wait, no\u2014looking at the table, the rows go from 0 to 11, but I think the numbering is from 1 to 12 in the HTML. So let me recount properly.)\n\nWait, actually, the table has rows numbered starting from 1 as per the data, but when parsed into a list, they're index 0 to 11.\n\nLooking at each player's position:\n\n- Row 0: Glen Seabrooke - center\n- Row 1: Bruce Rendall - left wing\n- Row 2: Darryl Gilmour - goaltender\n- Row 3: Shane Whelan - center\n- Row 4: Paul Marshall - defense (row index 4)\n- Row 5: Daril Holmes - right wing\n- Row 6: Ken Alexander - defense (row index 6)\n- Row 7: Tony Horacek - left wing\n- Row 8: Mike Cusack - forward\n- Row 9: Gord Murphy - defense (row index 9)\n- Rows 10 and 11 are Rod Williams and Paul Maurice, but their positions are right wing and defense respectively.\n\nWait, let me check each row again:\n\nRow indices 0 to 11 correspond to rounds 1 to 12.\n\nSo checking for \"defense\" in the position column:\n\n- Row 4: Paul Marshall - defense\n- Row 6: Ken Alexander - defense\n- Row 9: Gord Murphy - defense\n\nAdditionally, looking at row 11 (index 10), it's Rod Williams, right wing. Wait no, row 11 is index 10? Let me recount:\n\nThe table has 12 rows in tbody, so indices 0 to 11.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 4: Paul Marshall - defense\nRow 6: Ken Alexander - defense\nRow 9: Gord Murphy - defense\n\nSo that's three players with the position \"defense\": Paul Marshall, Ken Alexander, and Gord Murphy. So the claim is correct\u2014Ken Alexander is one of three defense players.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor each of these three players, we need to note their row index and the column \"position.\"\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 4 (Paul Marshall) - position\n- Row 6 (Ken Alexander) - position\n- Row 9 (Gord Murphy) - position\n\nAdditionally, since the claim mentions Ken Alexander specifically, perhaps his row is also relevant. But according to instructions, we need to check each condition\u2014so verifying that there are exactly three defense players and that Ken is one of them.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows where the position is \"defense.\"\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells include these positions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ken Alexander is one of three defense players. The table shows three defense players: Paul Marshall (row 4), Ken Alexander (row 6), and Gord Murphy (row 9).

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It says that Paul Maurice is one of four defense players listed. So, my task is to check how many defense players are in the table and see if Paul Maurice is included in that count.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with details about their round, position, nationality, and team. The relevant columns here are \"player\" and \"position.\" I need to go through each row and identify all the defense players.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. Glen Seabrooke is a center.\n2. Bruce Rendall plays left wing.\n3. Darryl Gilmour is a goaltender.\n4. Shane Whelan is another center.\n5. Paul Marshall's position is defense. So, that's one defense player.\n6. Daril Holmes is right wing.\n7. Ken Alexander is also listed as defense. That makes two defense players so far.\n8. Tony Horacek plays left wing.\n9. Mike Cusack is a forward.\n10. Gord Murphy is another defense player, bringing the count to three.\n11. Rod Williams is right wing.\n12. Paul Maurice's position is listed as defense.

Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant to determine this. The \"player\" column tells us who each entry is, so I looked at all rows where the position was defense. Each of these entries had their row index noted along with the \"player\" and \"position\" columns. This helps in verifying that Paul Maurice is indeed a defense player and counts towards the four listed.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points.

It says Glen Seabrooke is one of two players who play the center position. So, I need to check how many players in the table have the position as \"center.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their details.

That's two.\n\nRows 5 and 6: Both are defense players. Not center.\n\nRow 7: Tony Horacek, left wing. No.\n\nRow 8: Mike Cusack, forward. Wait, but the claim is about \"center\" specifically, so forward might include centers, but in this table, let me see how it's categorized. Looking back at row 1 and 4, their positions are explicitly listed as center. So Mike Cusack is a forward, which is a broader category than center. The claim specifies \"center,\" so I think only the players with exactly \"center\" count.\n\nRow 9: Gord Murphy, defense.\n\nRow 10: Rod Williams, right wing.\n\nRow 11: Paul Maurice, defense.\n\nSo from rows 1 to 12 (since there are 12 entries), only two players have position as center: Glen Seabrooke and Shane Whelan.

Row 11: Paul Maurice, position is defense.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted the rows because in the HTML, the tbody has 12 tr elements, so indexes are from 0 to 11. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: Glen Seabrooke - center\nRow 1: Bruce Rendall - left wing\nRow 2: Darryl Gilmour - goaltender\nRow 3: Shane Whelan - center\nRow 4: Paul Marshall - defense\nRow 5: Daril Holmes - right wing\nRow 6: Ken Alexander - defense\nRow 7: Tony Horacek - left wing\nRow 8: Mike Cusack - forward (but the position is listed as 'forward', which could be a general term. Does that count as center? The claim specifies \"center\" so unless it's explicitly stated, maybe not.)\nRow 9: Gord Murphy - defense\nRow 10: Rod Williams - right wing\nRow 11: Paul Maurice - defense\n\nSo, in row 3, Shane Whelan is also listed as a center. That means Glen Seabrooke is not the only one; there's at least another player who plays center.\n\nWait, but looking back, Row 7 is Tony Horacek with position left wing, and Row 8 is Mike Cusack as forward. So in positions, only rows 0 (Glen) and 3 (Shane) have the position explicitly stated as 'center'.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Glen Seabrooke is the only player listed who plays center is FALSE because Shane Whelan also plays as a center.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for this determination. I need to look at all rows where the position is 'center'. That would be row 0 and row 3 in the table. Each of these has the column name 'position'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0, column 'position'\n- Row 3, column 'position'\n\nThis shows that there are two players who play center, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Shane Whelan also plays as a center.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
