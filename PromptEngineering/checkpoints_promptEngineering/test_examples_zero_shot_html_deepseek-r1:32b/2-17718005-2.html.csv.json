    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table and a specific claim about the Warrington Town team being in 4th position with 45 goals against. My task is to verify if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It looks like it's an HTML table with several columns. From the column headers, I can identify that the relevant information needed for this claim would be under \"Position\" and \"Goals Against.\"\n\nLooking at the rows, each team is listed with their respective data. Warrington Town is mentioned in one of the rows. Let me check which row it's on. Scanning through, I see that Warrington Town is listed as the 4th position because the row index starts from 0, so the first row is index 3.\n\nNow, checking the \"Position\" column for this team to confirm if it's indeed in 4th place. The claim states they're in 4th, and according to the table, that's accurate.\n\nNext, I need to verify the number of goals against. In the same row where Warrington Town is listed, I look at the \"Goals Against\" column. It shows 45. This matches exactly with the claim made.\n\nSince both conditions\u2014being in 4th position and having 45 goals against\u2014are supported by the data in the table, the claim stands as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Goals Against\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
