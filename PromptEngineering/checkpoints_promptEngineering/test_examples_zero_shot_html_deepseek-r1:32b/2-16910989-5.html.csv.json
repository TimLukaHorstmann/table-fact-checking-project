    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Kristofer Martin's award nominations and wins in 2012 is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"kristofer martin be nominate for 3 act award in 2012, win the german moreno youth achievement award.\"\n\nI'll break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Was Kristofer Martin nominated for 3 acting awards in 2012?\n2. Did he win the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012?\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several entries with details about nominations and wins from different years. The relevant data is from 2012 because that's what the claim specifies.\n\nLet me go through each row for the year 2012:\n\n- **Row Index 3**: Year 2012, Award Giving Body: \"the young critics circle awards\", Category: \"best performance\", Nominated For: \"oros\", Result: \"nominated\". So he was nominated here.\n\n- **Row Index 4**: Year 2012, Award Giving Body: \"28th pmpc star awards for movies\", Category: \"new movie actor of the year\", Nominated For: \"tween academy : class of 2012\", Result: \"nominated\". Another nomination.\n\n- **Row Index 5**: Year 2012, Award Giving Body: \"famas awards\", Category: \"german moreno youth achievement award\", Nominated For: \"n/a\", Result: \"won\". So he won this award.\n\nWait, so in 2012, according to the table:\n\n- He was nominated twice (rows 3 and 4).\n- He won once (row 5).\n\nThe claim says he was nominated for 3 acting awards. But looking at the table, only two nominations are listed for 2012. So that part of the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nHowever, the second part is correct: he did win the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n- The first part of the claim about being nominated for three acting awards is false because there are only two nominations listed.\n- The second part about winning that specific award is true.\n\nSince the claim combines both statements, and one part is incorrect, the entire claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n\nFor the nominations:\n- Row 3 (index 3) in \"result\" column shows a nomination.\n- Row 4 (index 4) in \"result\" column also shows a nomination.\n\nSo two nominations, not three. Hence, the claim is incorrect on that count.\n\nThe win is correctly noted in row 5 (index 5) under the \"german moreno youth achievement award\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"In 2013, Kristofer Martin received only an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in Oros at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at the 10th Golden Screen Award.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"received only an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in Oros at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo.\" \n\nLooking through the table, in row index 1 (since rows start at 0), there's a record from 2013 for the 16th Long Island International Film Expo. The category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" and it's nominated for Oros. The result here is \"won.\" Wait, so according to this row, he won that award. But the claim says he received only an honorable mention, which might imply he didn't win it. That seems contradictory.\n\nNext part: \"...but won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at the 10th Golden Screen Award.\"\n\nLooking at row index 2 (since rows start at 0), there's another 2013 entry for the 10th Golden Screen Awards. The category is \"best actor in a supporting role,\" nominated for Oros, and the result is \"won.\" This matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, so according to the table, he won both awards: one honorable mention as Best Supporting Actor (which seems like it's an award given) and another as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. However, the claim says he received only an honorable mention at the first event but won the other. But in reality, both entries show that he \"won\" those categories.\n\nSo the confusion is whether \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" counts as winning or not. The table lists it as \"won,\" so perhaps in this context, that means he was awarded an honorable mention, which might be a form of recognition without necessarily being the top award. But according to the claim, he only got the honorable mention (implying no win) at the first event and won the second.\n\nBut since the table shows both as \"won,\" the claim is incorrect because it states that at the 16th Long Island Film Expo, he only received an honorable mention (as if not winning), but in reality, he did receive a recognition (honorable mention) which counts as a win according to the table. So the first part of the claim might be misleading or partially correct depending on how \"won\" is interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that at the first event, he got an honorable mention but didn't win the main award, while in the second event, he did win the main category. But according to the table, both entries have a result of \"won,\" so perhaps the claim misrepresents the outcome.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck:\n\nRow 1: 2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo, category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor.\" The result is \"won.\" So this means he was awarded that honorable mention, which might be considered as winning in the table's context.\n\nSo according to the claim, he received only an honorable mention (not winning) at the first event but won at the second. However, both results are \"won,\" so the claim is incorrect because it suggests he didn't win the first award, whereas the table says he did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct if the first award was an honorable mention and not a full win, while the second was a full win. But in the table, both have \"result\" as \"won,\" so they might be considered wins, but maybe the categories are different. The first is for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" which could be a separate award from \"best actor in a supporting role.\" So perhaps he won an honorable mention (a type of recognition) at the first event and then separately won the best supporting actor at the second event.\n\nIn that case, the claim would be correct because both are wins but in different categories. The wording is tricky. The claim says he received only an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor, which might imply that's all he got at that event, but actually, according to the table, he won that award (the honorable mention) and also separately won another award at the Golden Screen Awards.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row represents a separate nomination. So in 2013, he has two entries: one where he won an honorable mention for best supporting actor at Long Island Film Expo, and another where he won best actor in a supporting role at Golden Screen Awards. So both are wins but in different categories.\n\nSo the claim is correct because it states that he received only an honorable mention (which he did) at the first event and then won the other award at the second event. The table supports this, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"only an honorable mention,\" which might suggest that's his sole achievement in 2013 related to Oros. However, looking at the table, there are two rows for 2013: both related to Oros and both wins. So the claim is accurate because it's specifying each award correctly.\n\nSo overall, the claim aligns with the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves verifying whether the given claims about the awards received in 2013 match the information provided in the table.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The first relevant row is at index `1`:\n     ```\n     \"year\": 2013,\n     \"event\": \"16th Long Island International Film Expo\",\n     \"category\": \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\",\n     \"nominee\": \"Oros\",\n     \"result\": \"won\"\n     ```\n   - The second relevant row is at index `2`:\n     ```\n     \"year\": 2013,\n     \"event\": \"10th Golden Screen Awards\",\n     \"category\": \"best actor in a supporting role\",\n     \"nominee\": \"Oros\",\n     \"result\": \"won\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify First Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the individual received an \"honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor\" at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo and that this was a win.\n   - The table confirms that in 2013, the result was \"won\" for the category \"honorable mention for best supporting actor.\" Therefore, the first part of the claim is correct.\n\n3. **Verify Second Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the individual won \"Best Actor in a Supporting Role\" at the 10th Golden Screen Awards.\n   - The table confirms that in 2013, under the same event and category, the result was \"won.\" Thus, the second part of the claim is also correct.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claims are accurate based on the provided information.\n\n**Answer:** The claims are correct as per the information given in the table.",

    "claim": "kristofer martin have be nominate for 7 act award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Kristofer Martin is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"kristofer martin have be nominate for 7 act award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: nominations and wins. The claim says there are 7 acting awards he was nominated for in 2012-2013 and that he won 4 of them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award nomination or win. Let me go through each row to count how many times Kristofer Martin was nominated and how many he won.\n\nStarting with 2013:\n1. The first entry is for the \"stand out season performer\" category in 2013. It says \"nominated.\" So that's one nomination.\n2. Next, in 2013, he was nominated for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" and won it. That's another nomination and a win.\n3. Also in 2013, he was nominated for \"best actor in a supporting role\" and won. Another nomination and a win.\n\nSo for 2013, that's 3 nominations (he was nominated three times) and 2 wins.\n\nNow for 2012:\n4. The first entry is the \"best performance\" category, which he was nominated for but didn't win.\n5. Next, in 2012, he was nominated for \"new movie actor of the year,\" another nomination without a win.\n6. Then, in 2012, he won the \"german moreno youth achievement award.\"\n7. Lastly, in 2012, he won the \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" award.\n\nSo for 2012, that's two nominations and four wins? Wait, no, let me recount. The last two entries are both wins but not necessarily acting awards. Let me check each row again to see if they're all acting-related.\n\nLooking at the \"category\" column:\n- \"stand out season performer\" \u2013 seems acting.\n- \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" \u2013 definitely an acting award.\n- \"best actor in a supporting role\" \u2013 yes, acting.\n- \"best performance\" \u2013 likely acting.\n- \"new movie actor of the year\" \u2013 acting.\n- \"german moreno youth achievement award\" \u2013 not sure if this is specifically acting. It's about youth achievement but might be related to acting since he won it for a specific role (Oros).\n- \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" \u2013 this seems like a popularity award, maybe for being a likable pair rather than an acting award.\n\nSo considering whether all these are acting awards: The first five entries clearly relate to acting. The sixth might be related to his performance in a specific role, so I'll count it as acting. The last one is about being liked as a team, which isn't an acting award per se. So total acting nominations would be 5 (2013: 3, 2012: 2) but the claim says 7 acting awards.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's list all rows:\n\nRows:\n- 2013: 3 entries\n- 2012: 4 entries\n\nTotal of 7 rows, each an award entry.\n\nLooking at the \"category\" in each row:\n\nRow 0: stand out season performer \u2013 acting.\nRow 1: honorable mention for best supporting actor \u2013 acting.\nRow 2: best actor in a supporting role \u2013 acting.\nRow 3: best performance \u2013 acting.\nRow 4: new movie actor of the year \u2013 acting.\nRow 5: german moreno youth achievement award \u2013 possibly related to acting.\nRow 6: most liked loveteam with joyce ching \u2013 not an acting award.\n\nSo Rows 0-5 are acting-related, Row 6 isn't. Therefore, he was nominated for 6 acting awards (since Row 6 is a non-acting category) but the claim says 7. So that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row represents an award nomination or win, regardless of category. The claim refers to \"act awards,\" so perhaps it's referring specifically to acting categories. Therefore, we should count only those where the category is related to acting.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows:\n0: acting \u2013 yes\n1: acting \u2013 yes\n2: acting \u2013 yes\n3: acting \u2013 yes\n4: acting \u2013 yes\n5: possibly acting \u2013 yes\n6: not acting \u2013 no\n\nSo 6 acting-related entries. But the claim says 7. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe all 7 rows are considered acting awards. Let me check each \"nominated for\" column to see if they're related to acting.\n\nRow 0: nominated for none \u2013 maybe a general award.\nRows 1-5: nominated for Oros or others in acting roles.\nRow 6: nominated for n/a, but the category is about being liked as a team with Joyce Ching. So not an acting award.\n\nSo perhaps only Rows 0-5 are acting-related, making 6 nominations and wins. The claim says 7. Therefore, it's incorrect.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nThe \"nominated for\" column in Row 0 is none; perhaps this was a general award without a specific role. So maybe that's not an acting award.\n\nSo acting-related rows would be Rows 1-5 and possibly 6? Wait no\u2014Row 6 isn't acting. So Rows 1-5 are definitely acting (nominated for Oros, which is a film), so five acting nominations. Plus Row 0 might or might not be acting. If it's a general award, maybe not.\n\nSo in that case, the total acting-related nominations would be five, but the claim says seven. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all seven are considered acting awards regardless of specifics, making the count as per rows. Then he was nominated for 7 acting awards and won four (Rows 1,2,5,6? Wait no\u2014Row 6 isn't acting). Let me check wins:\n\nIn 2013: Rows 1 and 2 are wins.\n\nIn 2012: Rows 5 and 6. But Row 6 is a non-acting award. So total wins would be three (Rows 1, 2, 5) in acting categories. The claim says he won four times? Or does the claim say he was nominated seven times and won four?\n\nThe original question is: You are tasked with verifying whether Kristopher Martin was nominated for 7 acting awards and won 4 of them.\n\nSo from the data given:\n\nTotal acting-related nominations: let's consider each row except Row 6 as acting. So Rows 0-5, total 6 acting nominations. Therefore, he was not nominated seven times, making the claim incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"nominated for\" in Row 0 is a category that isn't acting, so maybe it's excluded. Thus, only six acting nominations, and four wins (Rows 1,2,5). Wait, but Row 3 and 4 are nominations without wins. So total acting wins: three.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify whether all the awards were acting or not. The claim is that he was nominated for seven acting awards and won four.\n\nFrom our data:\n\n- Acting-related entries (Rows 0-5) = 6\n- Wins in acting categories: Rows 1,2,5 \u2013 three wins\n\nTherefore, the claim of seven nominations is incorrect; it's six. The wins are three, not four if considering only acting categories.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe all seven entries are considered acting awards regardless of specifics, which would make the count as:\n\nNominations: 7 (all rows except maybe Row 6) and wins: four (Rows 1,2,5,6). But Row 6 is not an acting award.\n\nSo it's a bit unclear. However, based on the data provided, the most accurate count would be six acting nominations and three wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he was nominated for seven acting awards and won four is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the data provided, Kristopher Martin was not nominated for seven acting awards. Instead, he received six acting-related nominations across two years (2013 and 2012). Among these, he won three acting awards. Therefore, the claim that he was nominated for seven acting awards and won four is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. Kristopher Martin was nominated for six acting awards and won three of them.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in 'Oros'\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that three times Kristofer was nominated for awards because of his role in the movie or TV show called \"Oros\". So, my task is to check how many nominations he received where the nominated work is \"Oros\".\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. The relevant columns here are \"nominated for\" because that's where I can see which work each nomination was for.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to count how many times \"Oros\" appears in the \"nominated for\" column.\n\n1. **First Row (2013, 1st Sunday All Stars Awards)**: The \"nominated for\" field is \"none\". So, this isn't for Oros.\n2. **Second Row (2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo)**: Here, it says \"Oros\", so that's one nomination for Oros. Also, he won in this case.\n3. **Third Row (2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards)**: Again, the \"nominated for\" is \"Oros\". That's two nominations now.\n4. **Fourth Row (2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards)**: This also lists \"Oros\", so that's three nominations.\n5. **Fifth Row (2012, 28th PMPA Star Awards for Movies)**: It says \"Tween Academy: Class of 2012\" here, which is a different work, not Oros.\n6. **Sixth Row (2012, FAMAS Awards)**: The \"nominated for\" field is \"N/A\", so that's not applicable.\n7. **Seventh Row (2012, 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards)**: This is about being the most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching, so again, not Oros.\n\nSo, adding up the nominations where he was nominated for \"Oros\": rows 2, 3, and 4. That's three instances.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nomination be for his performance in oros\". But when I look at the table, all three of these entries are actually wins except the first one which was just a nomination without being for Oros. Wait, no: row 2 and 3 both say \"won\", while row 4 says \"nominated\".\n\nSo, row 2: won, row 3: won, row 4: nominated.\n\nBut the claim is about nominations, not wins. So, in the table, only one nomination is for Oros (row 4). Rows 2 and 3 are wins, so they were nominations that resulted in wins, but does that count as a nomination?\n\nHmm, the wording of the claim says \"award nomination\", which refers to being nominated, regardless of whether he won or not. So each entry where \"nominated for\" is Oros counts towards the total number of nominations.\n\nSo rows 2 and 3 were both nominations (as they are entries in the table) that resulted in wins, but they were still nominations. Therefore, all three instances (rows 1: none, row 2: won, row 3: won, row4: nominated) \u2013 wait no, row 1 isn't Oros.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRows with \"nominated for\" as \"Oros\":\n\n- Row 2: 2013, 16th LI IFF Expo \u2192 \"won\"\n- Row 3: 2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards \u2192 \"won\"\n- Row4: 2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards \u2192 \"nominated\"\n\nSo that's three instances where he was nominated for Oros. However, in the table, row 2 and 3 are wins but still nominations, so they count towards the total.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nomination be for his performance in oros\". So the question is whether he had three nominations for Oros, regardless of the result. Since rows 2, 3, and 4 are all nominations (with two resulting in wins), that makes three nominations.\n\nWait no\u2014row4 was a nomination but didn't win. Rows 2 and 3 were nominations that resulted in wins. So total nominations would be three: row2 (nominated, then won), row3 (same), and row4 (nominated, didn't win). So the count is correct at three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows three instances where Kristofer Martin was nominated for awards related to his performance in \"Oros\". \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the given claim about Kristofer Martin's awards between 2012 and 2013 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were not based on a nomination for a specific show.\" So, we're looking for two instances where he won an award without being nominated for a particular show. In other words, in these cases, the \"nominated for\" column should be empty or indicate that it wasn't tied to a specific show.\n\nNext, I'll examine each row of the table one by one:\n\n1. **2013 - 1st sunday all stars awards**: The category is \"stand out season performer,\" and the \"nominated for\" field is listed as \"none.\" This suggests that he was nominated without being tied to a specific show.

So, I need to check two things: how many acting awards he was nominated for in 2013, and whether he won any of those nominations.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, result. Each row represents an award entry. The years mentioned are 2012 and 2013, so I'll focus on 2013 entries related to acting awards.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0 (2013):** Award is \"1st sunday all stars awards\" in the category of \"stand out season performer\". The result is \"nominated\". This seems like an acting award, so this counts as a nomination.\n\n2. **Row 1 (2013):** Award is \"16th long island international film expo\" for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\". Result is \"won\". So, he won this award.\n\n3. **Row 2 (2013):** Award is \"10th golden screen awards\" in the category of \"best actor in a supporting role\". Result is \"won\". Another win here.\n\nSo, in 2013, Kristofer Martin was nominated for at least two acting awards and won both. The claim states he was only nominated once and didn't win any, which contradicts what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because he had more than one nomination and actually won some awards.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false as Kristofer Martin was nominated for multiple acting awards in 2013 and won two of them.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"In 2013, Kristofer Martin received 2 honorable mentions for best supporting actor in Oros at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at the FAMAS Award.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Receiving two honorable mentions in 2013:**\n   - Looking through the table, I see two entries for 2013. The first entry is from \"1st Sunday All Stars Awards\" where he was nominated but didn't win. That doesn't count as an honorable mention.\n   - The second 2013 entry is from the \"16th Long Island International Film Expo.\" The category here is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" and he won it, as indicated by the result column saying \"won.\"\n   - So in 2013, he only has one honorable mention win at this expo. There's no second honorable mention elsewhere in 2013.\n\n2. **Winning Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at FAMAS Award:**\n   - Checking the table for \"FAMAS Awards\" and year 2013, I don't see any entry under FAMAS for 2013. The FAMAS entries are all from 2012.\n   - So in 2013, he didn't win a FAMAS award; the claim is incorrect here.\n\nPutting it together: The claim mentions two honorable mentions and a win at FAMAS in 2013, but the table only shows one honorable mention (which was won) at Long Island Expo and no FAMAS win in 2013. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Kristofer Martin received two honorable mentions in 2013 and won a FAMAS award that year. The table shows only one relevant award in 2013 and none from FAMAS.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"kristofer martin have be nominate for 7 best actor award between 2012 and 2013, win 4 of those award.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the claim is stating. It mentions that Kristofer Martin was nominated for seven Best Actor awards in 2012 and 2013, and he won four of them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award nomination or win. The columns include \"year,\" \"award giving body,\" \"category,\" \"nominated for,\" and \"result.\" \n\nI should go through each row to count how many times Kristofer was nominated for a Best Actor award and how many he won.\n\nStarting with the year 2013:\n- Row 0: Award is \"stand out season performer\" from \"1st sunday all stars awards.\" The category doesn't mention Best Actor, so this might not count.\n- Row 1: \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" at the \"16th long island international film expo.\" This seems like a nomination but in a supporting role, not Best Actor. So maybe it's a nomination but perhaps not counted as Best Actor.\n- Row 2: \"best actor in a supporting role\" from \"10th golden screen awards.\" Again, this is for a supporting role, so not exactly Best Actor. However, the award category mentions \"actor,\" so maybe it's considered here.\n\nNow for 2012:\n- Row 3: \"best performance\" at \"the young critics circle awards.\" This could be similar to Best Actor.\n- Rows 4 and 5: One is about a new movie actor award, which might not specifically be Best Actor. The other is a German Moreno Youth Achievement Award from FAMAS, which doesn't specify acting category directly.\n- Row 6: \"most liked loveteam\" award with Joyce Ching, which isn't an acting award.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"Best Actor awards,\" so I should focus on categories that explicitly say Best Actor or are direct equivalents. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Not a Best Actor category.\nRow 1: Honorable mention for supporting actor \u2013 not exactly Best Actor.\nRow 2: Best Actor in a supporting role \u2013 this is still supporting, but maybe considered as an acting award.\nRows 3: Best performance \u2013 might be similar to Best Actor.\nRows 4 and 5: Not directly Best Actor categories.\n\nSo how many times was he nominated for something that can be considered a Best Actor award?\n\nRow 2: Nominated for best actor in supporting role \u2013 maybe counts as an acting nomination. The result is \"won.\"\nRow 3: Best performance, which could be akin to Best Actor. Result is \"nominated.\"\n\nRows 1 and 4 don't fit the Best Actor category.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me list all the nominations:\n\n2013:\n- Row 0: Standout performer \u2013 not Best Actor.\n- Row 1: Honorable mention for supporting actor \u2013 nomination but not Best Actor.\n- Row 2: Best actor in supporting role \u2013 won.\n\nSo in 2013, he was nominated once (Row 2) and won it.\n\nIn 2012:\n- Row 3: Best performance \u2013 this is a possible Best Actor category. Result is \"nominated.\"\n- Rows 4 and 5 don't fit Best Actor.\n- So only one nomination in 2012 for Best Actor.\n\nSo total nominations for Best Actor awards: 2 (Row 2 as won, Row 3 as nominated). But the claim says 7 nominations. That's way off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe all acting-related categories are considered, not just Best Actor. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1st Sunday All Stars Awards 2013: \"stand out season performer\" \u2013 maybe an acting award but category is different.\nRow 1: Honorable mention for supporting actor \u2013 nomination.\nRow 2: Won best supporting actor.\nRow 3: Nominated for Best Performance (acting).\nRows 4 and 5: Not acting awards specifically.\n\nSo total nominations across both years in any acting category:\n\n- 2013: Row 0 (nominated), Row 1 (won as honorable mention?), Row 2 (won)\nWait, the result column says \"nominated\" for Row 0. So that's a nomination.\nRow 1 result is \"won,\" so that's one win.\nRow 2: \"won.\"\n\nIn 2012:\nRow 3: Nominated\nRows 4 and 5: One nominated (Row 4), one won (Row 5). But the categories are not acting.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me list all rows with their result:\n\nTotal nominations across both years in any category:\n\n2013:\n- Row 0: Nominated\n- Row 1: Won (honorable mention)\n- Row 2: Won\n\n2012:\n- Row 3: Nominated\n- Row 4: Nominated\n- Row 5: Won\n- Row 6: Won\n\nSo that's total of 2 nominations in acting categories? Or are we counting all categories?\n\nThe claim is about Best Actor awards, so I think only the rows where the category is Best Actor or equivalent. So:\n\nRow 0: Not Best Actor.\nRow1: Supporting actor \u2013 different category.\nRow2: Supporting actor \u2013 same.\nRow3: Best performance (could be similar).\nRows4-6: Not acting.\n\nSo only Row3 as a possible Best Actor nomination, which was \"nominated.\" Then Rows2 and1 are supporting roles. So total nominations for Best Actor would be 1 in 2012, but he also won in Row2 (supporting), so that's 1 win.\n\nBut the claim says 7 nominations and some wins. It doesn't add up. Therefore, perhaps I'm miscounting or misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all acting-related categories are considered, regardless of being Best Actor specifically. Then:\n\nIn 2013:\n- Row0: Nominated (standout performer)\n- Row1: Won\n- Row2: Won\n\nTotal in 2013: 2 nominations and 2 wins.\n\nWait, no \u2013 Row0 is \"nominated,\" Rows1 and2 are \"won.\"\n\nIn 2012:\nRow3: Nominated (best performance)\nRow4: Nominated (new movie actor)\nRows5 and6: Won\n\nSo total nominations across both years in acting categories:\n\nNominations: Row0, Row3, Row4 \u2013 that's 3.\nWins: Rows1,2,5,6 \u2013 that's 4.\n\nBut the claim says 7 nominations. So discrepancy here.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and all awards are considered, including non-acting ones. But that doesn't make sense for a Best Actor count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the rows:\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\nEach row represents an award, but not necessarily acting categories. So to count only those in acting categories:\n\nRows with acting-related categories:\n\nRow0: Standout season performer \u2013 acting.\nRow1: Supporting actor \u2013 acting.\nRow2: Best supporting actor \u2013 acting.\nRow3: Best performance \u2013 acting.\n\nOthers are not acting. So total of 4 acting awards, but some are supporting roles, not Best Actor.\n\nSo if we count only Best Actor or equivalent:\n\nOnly Row3's \"best performance\" might be considered as such. The others are in different categories.\n\nThus, he was nominated once for a Best Actor-like award (Row3) and won three times in other acting categories (Rows1,2,5,6). But the claim says 7 nominations, which is more than what's present here.\n\nTherefore, it seems the initial data doesn't support the claim of 7 nominations. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps each year has multiple awards, so in total:\n\n2013: Rows0-2\nRow0: Nominated\nRows1-2: Won\n\nSo 2013: 1 nomination, 2 wins.\n\n2012: Rows3-6\nRow3: Nominated\nRow4: Nominated (new movie actor)\nRow5: Won (youth award)\nRow6: Won (loveteam)\n\nTotal acting nominations in 2012: 2 (Rows3 and4). So overall, across both years, he was nominated 3 times (Row0, Row3, Row4) and won 4 times (Rows1,2,5,6).\n\nBut the claim says 7 nominations. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps each award has multiple categories? For example, in one event, he could be nominated in more than one category. Looking at the data:\n\nRow0: Standout season performer \u2013 single nomination.\nRow1: Honorable mention supporting actor \u2013 another nomination in different category.\nSo in 2013, two acting nominations.\n\nSimilarly in 2012, Row3 and Row4 are separate acting nominations.\n\nThus total acting nominations across both years: 2 (2013) + 2 (2012) = 4. The claim says 7. So discrepancy remains.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial understanding is wrong. Maybe all awards he received or was nominated for, regardless of category, are being counted as Best Actor nominations, which isn't accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data provided is incomplete, and there are more rows beyond what's given, but in this case, we have only 7 rows (0-6). So perhaps each row represents a different award event, but he could have been nominated multiple times at one event. For example, maybe in 2013, he was nominated for two different awards.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow0: Standout season performer \u2013 2013\nRow1: Honorable mention supporting actor \u2013 same year?\nRow2: Best supporting actor \u2013 same year?\n\nSo in 2013, three acting-related awards or nominations. Similarly, in 2012:\n\nRow3: Best performance\nRow4: New movie actor\nRow5: Youth award\nRow6: Loveteam award\n\nThus in 2012, four awards.\n\nSo total across both years: 7 awards (Rows0-6). But not all are acting or Best Actor. So if the claim is that he received 7 nominations for Best Actor, then it's incorrect because only some of these were acting categories and none specifically as Best Actor but more like supporting roles or other acting categories.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the claim is false based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the individual was nominated seven times for Best Actor cannot be supported by the given information. The data indicates nominations and wins in various acting-related categories across two years (2013 and 2012), but none specifically labeled as \"Best Actor.\" Therefore, the statement is false based on the provided details.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is incorrect; there is no evidence of seven Best Actor nominations in the given data.",

Rows 4 and 6 also have nominations or wins not related to \"Oros,\" but the claim is specifically about nominations. So focusing only on rows where the result is 'nominated':\n\nRows:\n- Row 0: Nominated for none.\n- Row 3: Nominated for Oros.\n- Row 4: Nominated for tween academy.\n\nTherefore, not all nominations were for \"Oros.\" Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nEach row where result is 'nominated' and the corresponding 'nominated for' column:\n\n- Row 0, columns 'year', 'award giving body', 'category', 'nominated for', 'result'\n- Row 3, same columns\n- Row 4, same columns\n\nBut since the user's instruction is to list each relevant cell individually, I'll note each row and column name involved in checking the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Row 0: all columns as they show a nomination not for Oros.\n- For Row 3: shows a nomination for Oros.\n- For Row 4: another nomination not for Oros.\n\nThus, compiling these into the JSON structure with row indices and column names, ensuring each relevant cell is included.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that every time Kristofer won an award in those years, he was nominated specifically for a particular TV show or movie.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with results marked as \"won.\" Let me go through each of them:\n\n1. 2013: 16th Long Island International Film Expo - Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor.
