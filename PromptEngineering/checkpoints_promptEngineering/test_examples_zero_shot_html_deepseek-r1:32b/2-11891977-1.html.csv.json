    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula be the nominee for best lead actress\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It's saying that Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula was nominated for Best Lead Actress in 2001 at the TVyNovelas Awards. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table that matches these details.\n\nLooking at the table, all entries are from the year 2001 and under the \"tvynovelas awards\". The relevant categories here would be \"best lead actress\". Let me scan through each row:\n\n- The first row is about \"best telenovela\", which doesn't match.\n- The second row lists Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula in the \"nominee\" column for \"best lead actress\" with a result of \"nominated\".\n- The third row is about best lead actor, so that's not relevant here.\n- Rows four through ten are other categories like best villain and supporting roles, but none of these mention Aracely.\n\nSo focusing on row index 1 (assuming the first data row is index 0?), wait no\u2014actually, in programming, indexes usually start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: year 2001, ceremony TVyNovelas Awards, category best telenovela.\nRow 1: same year and ceremony, category best lead actress, nominee Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula, result nominated.\nSo that's the relevant row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate because in row index 1 under \"nominee\", it shows Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula was indeed nominated for Best Lead Actress. The relevant cells are from row 1, specifically the \"category\" and \"nominee\" columns. \n\nWait, but in the instructions, I need to specify each cell that's relevant. So the row index is 1 (assuming first data row is 0) or maybe it's 2 if counting from HTML structure? Let me check the HTML again.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, the header is followed by 10 data rows starting with year 2001 in each. The second data row (index 1 if starting count after header) is about best lead actress and Aracely being nominated. So in terms of row index for the JSON response, since it's asking for the row index in the table structure provided, I think it starts at 0.\n\nWait no\u2014the first data row after the header is row 0? Or does the first data row count as row 1? Let me clarify: In programming, when we process tables, often the rows are zero-indexed. So the first data row (year 2001, ceremony TVyNovelas Awards, category best telenovela) would be index 0. The next row is index 1, which is about best lead actress and Aracely.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is in row index 1 under \"nominee\" column because that's where Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula is listed as a nominee for best lead actress.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions being a nominee. So I should check both the \"category\" and \"result\" columns to confirm she was nominated. In this case, row 1 has category as best lead actress, nominee as Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula, and result as 'nominated'. \n\nSo the relevant cells would be in row index 1 for both the \"category\", \"nominee\", and \"result\". But according to the instructions, I need to list all cells that are relevant. So I'll include each column name from that row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the columns needed to confirm the claim: \"category\" must be 'best lead actress', \"nominee\" is Aracely, and \"result\" should say 'nominated'. But maybe just checking the nominee and result would suffice, but it's safer to include all relevant cells that verify each part of the claim.\n\nBut in this case, since the claim is about her being a nominee for that specific category, I think including the row index 1 with \"category\", \"nominee\", and \"result\" columns would be appropriate. However, looking back at the example provided, it only included two cells per object, but perhaps each relevant cell can have multiple column mentions? Or maybe each cell is a separate entry in the list.\n\nWait no\u2014each object in the relevant_cells array should have one row_index and one column_name. So for each part of the claim that's verified by a cell, we add an entry. So:\n\n- The \"category\" being 'best lead actress' is in row 1, column \"category\".\n- The \"nominee\" being Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula is in row 1, column \"nominee\".\n\nSo I need to include two entries in the relevant_cells array: one for each of these columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the nominee and result? But the claim doesn't specify she won, just that she was a nominee. So checking her name as nominee and the result being 'nominated' would be sufficient.\n\nBut the table shows \"result\" as 'nominated', which confirms that. Therefore, to fully verify the claim, I need to check:\n\n1. Category is 'best lead actress' (row 1, column category).\n2. Nominee is Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula (row 1, column nominee).\n3. Result is 'nominated' (row 1, column result).\n\nBut maybe just checking the nominee and result would be enough because the claim doesn't specify anything else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all three are relevant to ensure it's the correct category.\n\nIn any case, for the JSON response, I'll include each of these as separate entries in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2001 there be a category of best support actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The table has columns: year, ceremony, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents an award nomination or win from the tvynovelas awards in 2001.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific category: \"best support actress.\" I should check if this exact category exists in the table for the year 2001.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 5 has the category \"best supporting actress\" with nominee Carmen Salinas, and she was nominated. So that's relevant because it shows there was a nomination in that category.\n\nAdditionally, row 6 mentions \"best supporting actor,\" but since the claim is about an actress, I focus on row 5.\n\nThe year for all these entries is 2001, so that matches the claim's timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the table does have a category named \"best supporting actress\" in 2001. The exact wording differs slightly (supporting vs support), but it's clear that the intended category exists.\n</think>\n\nThe table includes a row with the category \"best supporting actress\" from 2001, which supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"nailea norvind be the nominee who win for best male villain\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has columns: year, ceremony, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents a different award or nomination from 2001 TVyNovelas Awards.\n\nThe claim is about Nailea Norvind winning for best male villain. So I need to check two things: did Nailea Norvind win in the best male villain category, and was she nominated for that category?\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 3: \n- year: 2001\n- ceremony: tvynovelas awards\n- category: best female villain\n- nominee: nailea norvind\n- result: won\n\nWait a minute, here Nailea Norvind is listed under the category \"best female villain,\" not male. So she won in the female category, not male.\n\nRow index 4:\n- year: 2001\n- ceremony: tvynovelas awards\n- category: best male villain\n- nominee: c\u00e9sar \u00e9vora\n- result: won\n\nHere, C\u00e9sar \u00c9vora won for best male villain. So the winner in that category is a different person.\n\nSo Nailea Norvind was nominated and won for \"best female villain,\" but she wasn't even in the male category. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because she didn't win for best male villain; instead, someone else did, and she won in a different category altogether.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Nailea Norvind won for best male villain. The table shows she won for best female villain, not male. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the be a tie for best supporting actress in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a tie means in this context. A tie would imply that there are two or more nominees who both won the award in that category. So, I need to check if there's more than one winner listed for \"best supporting actress\" in 2001.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"year\", \"category\", and \"result\". Specifically, I'm focusing on rows where the year is 2001 and the category is \"best supporting actress\".\n\nI scan through each row:\n\n- The first few entries are for other categories like best telenovela, lead actress, etc. \n- Then, at row index 5 (counting from 0), I find the entry:\n  - year: 2001\n  - category: best supporting actress\n  - nominee: carmen salinas\n  - result: nominated\n\nThis means that Carmen Salinas was nominated but did not win. There's only one entry for \"best supporting actress\" in 2001, and it shows she was nominated, not won.\n\nSince there's only one nomination without a win, there can't be a tie because no one actually won the award in this category. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell here is row index 5 under \"result\", which indicates that the result was \"nominated\" and not \"won\".
