    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goal in the league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. Each row represents a player and their respective goals in these categories.\n\nThe claim states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is the only player who scored 8 goals in the league. So, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Does bok\u0161i\u0107 have exactly 8 goals in the league?\n2. Are there any other players with 8 goals in the league?\n\nLooking at the table row by row.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Name: bok\u0161i\u0107\n- League: 8\nSo, yes, bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals in the league.\n\nNow, I need to check all other rows to see if any other player has a 'league' value of 8.\n\nThe next rows are:\n\nwhelan: 4\nn\u00e9meth: 3\nince:2\ncooper:2\nqueudrue:2\nmarinelli:2\nmustoe:2\ndeane:1\njohnston:1\ngreening:1\nstockdale:1\nfesta:1\nwindass:1\nsouthgate:1\ncarbone:1\nehiogu:1\nmurphy:0 (but he has 1 in league cup)\nwilson:0 (with 1 in league cup)\ncambell:0 but has 1 in fa cup\nown goals:1 (league), also 1 in fa cup.\n\nGoing through each of these, none have a 'league' value higher than 8 except bok\u0161i\u0107. The next highest is whelan with 4, then n\u00e9meth with 3. All others are lower or equal to 2. Therefore, no other player has scored 8 goals in the league.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in the fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The columns are 'name', 'league', 'fa cup', 'league cup', and 'total'. Each row corresponds to a player with their respective statistics in these categories.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"whelan\" scoring 3 goals in the FA Cup. So, I need to check two things: does Whelan have 3 goals in the FA Cup, and are there any other players who also scored 3 goals in the FA Cup?\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row for Whelan. Scanning through the names, I see that Whelan is listed as having 4 in 'league', 3 in 'fa cup', 0 in 'league cup', and a total of 7.\n\nNow, to confirm if he is the only one with exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup, I need to check all other rows. Scanning down the 'fa cup' column:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107: 0\n- Whelan: 3\n- N\u00e9meth:1\n- Ince:1\n- Cooper:0\n- Queudrue:0\n- Marinelli:0\n- Mustoe:0\n- Deane:0\n- Johnston:0\n- Greening:0\n- Stockdale:0\n- Festa:0\n- Windass:0\n- Southgate:0\n- Carbone:0\n- Ehiogu:0\n- Murphy:0 (but he scored in league cup)\n- Wilson:0 (same here)\n- Cambell:1\n- Own goals:1\n\nWait, there's another entry: 'own goals' with 1 in FA Cup. But own goals are typically not counted towards a player's goal tally as they're against the team, so I'm not sure if that should be considered for players.\n\nSo, among all the players listed, Whelan is the only one with exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup column. The others either have less or none. There's no other player with 3 goals there.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because Whelan is indeed the sole player who scored 3 goals in the FA Cup as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"marinelli score 1 more total goal than johnston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate both marinelli and johnston in the table. Looking at the name column, I can see marinelli is listed as one of the players. Scanning down, I find a row with \"marinelli\" under the name column. Next, I look for \"johnston\". There's a row named \"johnston\" towards the bottom.\n\nNow, the claim compares their total goals. The table has a column named \"total\", which should indicate the number of goals each player scored in total across all competitions.\n\nFor marinelli: I check the row where name is marinelli and look at the 'total' column. The value there is 2.\n\nFor johnston: In his row, the 'total' column shows 1.\n\nThe claim states that marinelli scored 1 more goal than johnston. Since marinelli has 2 goals and johnston has 1, this means marinelli indeed scored one additional goal compared to johnston. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells used to verify this:\n- marinelli's total: row index for marinelli is 8 (if starting count from 0), but looking back, let me recount the rows correctly. The first data row after the header is bok\u0161i\u0107 at index 0, then whelan 1, n\u00e9meth 2, ince 3, cooper 4, queudrue 5, marinelli 6, mustoe 7, deane 8, johnston 9, etc. So marinelli is row index 6, column 'total'. Johnstone is at row index 9, same column.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n- marinelli's total: row_index 6, column_name \"total\"\n- johnston's total: row_index 9, column_name \"total\"\n\nThis confirms the calculation and supports the claim being TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because marinelli has a total of 2 goals while johnston has 1.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the rows for both cambell and ehiogu in the table. Looking through the table, I see a row with \"cambell\" and another with \"ehiogu\". \n\nFor cambell: The relevant columns are 'league' and 'total'. In the league column, cambell has 0 goals. The total is 1, but that includes other competitions like FA Cup or League Cup. Since the claim specifically mentions the league, I should focus on the 'league' column.\n\nFor ehiogu: Similarly, looking at his row, the 'league' column shows he scored 1 goal. His total is also 1, which aligns with the information in the 'league' column since there are no goals from other competitions mentioned for him.\n\nThe claim says that cambell scored 1 less than ehiogu in the league. So, if ehiogu has 1 goal and cambell has 0, then yes, cambell did score exactly one less goal than ehiogu in the league. \n\nSo, checking the relevant cells: for cambell, it's row index where name is 'cambell' (which is row 32) under 'league'. For ehiogu, it's row index 30 under 'league'.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because 0 is indeed one less than 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that cambell scored one fewer goal in the league compared to ehiogu. Checking the table:\n\n- cambell has 0 goals in the league (row 32).\n- ehiogu has 1 goal in the league (row 30).\n\nThus, the statement is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is one among three players who scored exactly 8 goals in the league.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective statistics across different columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The relevant column here is \"league\" since we're focusing on goals scored in the league.\n\nI'll go through each player's data to check how many have 8 goals in the league column. \n\nStarting from row index 0:\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 in the league column.\n- Then I look at other rows:\n   - whelan: 4\n   - n\u00e9meth: 3\n   - ince: 2\n   - cooper: 2\n   - queudrue: 2\n   - marinelli: 2\n   - mustoe: 2\n   - deane:1, johnston:1, greening:1, stockdale:1, festa:1, windass:1, southgate:1, carbone:1, ehiogu:1, murphy:0, wilson:0, cambell:0, own goals:1\n\nFrom this, only bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals in the league. No other player has exactly 8 goals in that column. Therefore, there isn't a total of three players with 8 goals; only one exists.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because it states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players, but the data shows he's the sole player with 8 league goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only bok\u0161i\u0107 scored exactly 8 goals in the league.

The claim states that \"cooper , marinelli , mustoe , and queudrue all score 2 total goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each of these names in the table and check their 'total' column.\n\nStarting with Cooper: Looking at row index 4 (since counting starts from 0), under the 'total' column, it shows 2. So Cooper has 2 goals.\n\nNext is Marinelli: That's row index 5. The 'total' there is also 2. So that matches too.\n\nThen Mustoe: Row index 6. His 'total' is 2 as well. Good so far.\n\nNow Queudrue: I need to find the correct row for him. Let me check each name carefully. Wait, row index 4 is Cooper, then 5 is marinelli, 6 is mustoe, and then... actually, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, the rows are as follows:\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n- Row 1: whelan\n- Row 2: n\u00e9meth\n- Row 3: inc\u00e9\n- Row 4: cooper\n- Row 5: queudrue\nWait no, let me look again. The table as given in the HTML has rows listed from index 0 to maybe around 26 or so.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the names with their row indices properly:\n\nLooking at the tbody section:\n1st tr: bok\u0161i\u0107 \u2192 row index 0\n2nd tr: whelan \u2192 row 1\n3rd tr: n\u00e9meth \u2192 row 2\n4th tr: inc\u00e9 \u2192 row 3\n5th tr: cooper \u2192 row 4\n6th tr: queudrue \u2192 row 5\n7th tr: marinelli \u2192 row 6\n8th tr: mustoe \u2192 row 7\n9th tr: deane \u2192 row 8\n10th tr: johnston \u2192 row 9\n11th tr: greening \u2192 row 10\n12th tr: stockdale \u2192 row 11\n13th tr: festa \u2192 row 12\n14th tr: murphy \u2192 row 13\n15th tr: wilson \u2192 row 14\n16th tr: cambell \u2192 row 15\n17th tr: own goals \u2192 row 16\n\nWait, that can't be right because the HTML shows more rows. Let me recount properly:\n\nLooking at the tbody, each <tr> is a new row.\n\nSo starting from index 0:\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n- Row 1: whelan\n- Row 2: n\u00e9meth\n- Row 3: inc\u00e9\n- Row 4: cooper\n- Row 5: queudrue\n- Row 6: marinelli\n- Row 7: mustoe\n- Then deane (row8), johnston(row9), greening(10), stockdale(11), festa(12), murphy(13), wilson(14), cambell(15), own goals(16).\n\nSo Cooper is row 4, queudrue is row5, marinelli row6, mustoe row7.\n\nNow checking each of their 'total' columns:\n\n- Cooper (row4): total is 2 \u2192 correct.\n- queudrue (row5): total is 1? Wait no, looking at the table data for queudrue: his 'total' column is under which value?\n\nWait let me check again. The claim says all four have a total of 2 goals.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow4: cooper \u2192 total=2\nRow5: queudrue \u2192 looking at the row, the cells are [queudrue, 0,0,1], so 'total' is 1. Wait no, let me check the actual HTML data for queudrue's row.\n\nLooking back:\n\n<tr>\n<td>queudrue</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n\nWait, that would be under 'total' as 1. So queudrue has a total of 1, not 2.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- cooper: row4 \u2192 total=2\n- queudrue: row5 \u2192 total=1\n- marinelli: row6 \u2192 total=2\n- mustoe: row7 \u2192 total=2\n\nSo queudrue's total is only 1. Therefore, the claim that all four have a total of 2 is false because queudrue has 1.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made an error in identifying the rows. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the tbody section again:\n\nAfter row3 (inc\u00e9), next is cooper (row4: yes, with 0 goals? No, let's check each row's data.\n\nWait each row's structure is Name | goals for league | ... etc., but perhaps I should parse each row correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe queudrue has a total of 1. So the claim says all four have 2, but queudrue has only 1, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cooper, marinelli, mustoe, and queudrue all have a total of 2 goals each. Checking each name in the table:\n\n- Cooper (row4): Total is 2 \u2192 correct.\n- marinelli (row6): Total is 2 \u2192 correct.\n- mustoe (row7): Total is 2 \u2192 correct.\n- queudrue (row5): Total is 1 \u2192 incorrect.\n\nSince one of them does not meet the condition, the claim is FALSE.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim states two things: first, that Whelan scored three goals, and second, that he's the only player who did so across any competition. So I need to check both parts.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are 'name', 'league', 'fa cup', 'league cup', 'total'. The rows list players with their respective goal counts in these competitions and the total goals.\n\nFirst, let me find Whelan's row. Scanning through the names, I see a row where the name is \"whelan\". Let's look at his numbers: he has 4 league goals, 3 FA cup goals, 0 league cup goals, and a total of 7 goals.\n\nSo according to this table, Whelan scored 3 goals in the FA Cup. Now, I need to check if any other player also scored exactly 3 goals in any competition.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107: League - 8, others 0\n- Whelan: FA cup - 3\n- N\u00e9meth: 1 in FA, 2 in league cup\n- Ince: 1 in FA\n- Cooper: 2 league\n- Queudrue: same as Cooper\n- Marinelli: same\n- Mustoe: same\n- Deane and others below him up to Ehiogu have 0 or 1 goals in various competitions.\n- Then we get to Murphy, Wilson, Cambell, and 'own goals' row. Murphy has 0 league, 0 FA, 1 league cup. Wilson same as Murphy but with 1 league cup. Cambell has 0 league, 1 FA cup.\n\nWait, hold on, the claim says \"any competition\", so I need to check each player's numbers in each column (league, fa cup, league cup) for any that have exactly 3 goals.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Whelan: FA cup - 3\nIs there anyone else with a '3' in any of their columns?\n\nGoing through each row:\n1. Bok\u0161i\u0107: League is 8, others are 0.\n2. Whelan: FA cup is 3 (that's the only one so far)\n3. N\u00e9meth: 1 FA, 2 league cup\n4. Ince: 1 FA\n5. Cooper: 2 league\n6. Queudrue: same as Cooper\n7. Marinelli: same\n8. Mustoe: same\n9. Deane and others up to Ehiogu have 0 or 1 in each category.\n10. Murphy: League cup is 1\n11. Wilson: same as Murphy\n12. Cambell: FA cup is 1\n13. Own goals row has 1 league, 1 FA cup.\n\nSo, looking at all the rows, only Whelan has a '3' in any of his competition columns (FA cup). The others have 0,1, or up to 8 but not exactly 3. So yes, Whelan is the only player who scored exactly three goals in any single competition listed in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Whelan is the sole player with exactly 3 goals in any competition.

The relevant columns are \"name\", \"league\", since we're concerned with league goals.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- For cambell: I find a row where name is 'cambell'. The value under \"league\" is 0.\n  \n- For ehiogu: There's a row named 'ehiogu' with a \"league\" value of 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Actually, looking again:\n\nNo, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, the table has a lot of rows, so let me go through each one carefully.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow indices start at 0.\n\nLooking for 'cambell':\n\nI see row index 31: name is 'cambell', league column is 0 (since it's third row from the bottom). Wait no, let me recount.\n\nWait the table has multiple rows. Let's list them all:\n\nRows:\n\n0: bok\u0161i\u0107 - league 8\n\n1: whelan - 4\n\n2: n\u00e9meth -3\n\n3: ince -2\n\n4: cooper -2\n\n5: queudrue -2\n\n6: marinelli -2\n\n7: mustoe -2\n\n8: deane -1\n\n9: johnston -1\n\n10: greening -1\n\n11: stockdale -1\n\n12: festa -1\n\n13: windass -1\n\n14: southgate -1\n\n15: carbone -1\n\n16: ehiogu -1\n\nWait, row 16 is ehiogu? Let me count again:\n\nFrom the top:\n\n0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n\n1: whelan\n\n2: n\u00e9meth\n\n3: ince\n\n4: cooper\n\n5: queudrue\n\n6: marinelli\n\n7: mustoe\n\n8: deane\n\n9: johnston\n\n10: greening\n\n11: stockdale\n\n12: festa\n\n13: windass\n\n14: southgate\n\n15: carbone\n\n16: ehiogu\n\nYes, row 16 is ehiogu. The \"league\" value for ehiogu is 1.\n\nNow looking for cambell:\n\nContinuing down the table after row 16:\n\nRow 17: murphy -0 in league\n\nRow 18: wilson -0 in league\n\nRow 19: cambell -0 in league. So row index 19.\n\nSo cambell is at row 19, and ehiogu is at row 16.\n\nNow, their \"league\" goals:\n\ncambell's league column is 0 (row 19, column 'league')\n\nehiogu's league is 1 (row 16, column 'league').\n\nSo they don't have the same number of goals in the league. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\nFor cambell: row 19, \"league\"\n\nFor ehiogu: row 16, \"league\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states that \"cooper, marinelli, mustoe, and queudrue be the only players to score 2 or more goals.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying these four players are the only ones who have scored two or more goals in total. So, I should look at the 'total' column for each player listed and check if they indeed have 2 or more. Also, I need to ensure that no other players outside this list have a 'total' of 2 or more.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. The 'total' column is where we should focus since it's about the overall goals scored by each player.\n\nLet me go through each player mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. Cooper: Checking the row for cooper. The 'total' column shows 2.\n2. Marinelli: Similarly, marinelli has a total of 2.\n3. Mustoe: mustoe also has a total of 2.\n4. Queudrue: queudrue's total is 2 as well.\n\nSo far, all four have totals of exactly 2. Now, I need to check if there are any other players with a 'total' of 2 or more.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table:\n\n- bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 (league) and total 8.\n- whelan has 4 in league, 3 in fa cup, totaling 7.\n- n\u00e9meth: 3 +1 +2 =6\n- Ince: 2+1=3\n- The next players after queudrue are marinelli, mustoe, cooper, and queudrue again, all with totals of 2. Then there's a series of players like deane, johnston, greening, etc., each with total 1.\n- Own goals: this row might be tricky because it says 'own goals' as the name, which could represent a team or an aggregate, but looking at the numbers, league is 1, fa cup 1, so total is 2.\n\nWait, that's important. The row named \"own goals\" has a total of 2. So according to this, there's another entry with a total of 2. But does \"own goals\" refer to players? Or is it an aggregate category?\n\nIn football (soccer), own goals are when a player scores against their own team. They might be listed separately in tables, but they don't represent individual players. So perhaps this row isn't about individual players but rather the total number of own goals scored by the team.\n\nIf that's the case, then \"own goals\" shouldn't be considered as an individual player who scored 2 or more. Therefore, the only players with totals of 2 or more are cooper (row 10), marinelli (row 11), mustoe (row 12), and queudrue (row 9). \n\nBut let's double-check each row:\n\n- Row 4: n\u00e9meth total is 6\n- Row 5: Ince has total 3\n- Then comes cooper (row 9, total 2), marinelli (10, 2), mustoe (11, 2), queudrue (8, 2). Wait, I think I miscounted the rows. Let me recount.\n\nWait no, the row indices start from 0. So let's list them properly:\n\n- Row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n- Row 1: whelan\n- Row 2: n\u00e9meth\n- Row 3: Ince\n- Row 4: cooper (total 2)\n- Row 5: marinelli (total 2)\n- Row 6: mustoe (total 2)\n- Row 7: queudrue (total 2)\n- Rows after that have totals of 1 except for \"own goals\" at row 29 with total 2.\n\nSo according to this, the four players mentioned are indeed the only ones with a total of exactly 2. The own goals row might be considered as another 'player' but it's likely not an individual player, so we can disregard that in the context of the claim which refers to players.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
