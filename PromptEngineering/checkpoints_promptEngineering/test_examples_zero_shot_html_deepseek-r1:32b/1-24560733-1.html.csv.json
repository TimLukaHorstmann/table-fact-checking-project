    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim says that the Wildcats kept their opponents from scoring in four games. That would mean, in those four games, the opponents' points were zero. So I should look at the \"opponents\" column to see how many times it's zero.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record. The relevant column here is \"opponents,\" which shows the points scored by each opposing team in each game.\n\nNow I'll go through each row and check the \"opponents\" value:\n\n1. Game 1: Opponents scored 14 points. Not zero.\n2. Game 2: Opponents scored 0 points. That's one instance.\n3. Game 3: Opponents scored 7 points. Not zero.\n4. Game 4: Opponents scored 0 points. Second instance.\n5. Game 5: Opponents scored 0 points. Third instance.\n6. Game 6: Opponents scored 6 points. Not zero.\n7. Game 7: Opponents scored 13 points. Not zero.\n8. Game 8: Opponents scored 6 points. Not zero.\n9. Game 9: Opponents scored 0 points. Fourth instance.\n10. Game 10: Opponents scored 13 points. Not zero.\n\nSo, the opponents were scoreless in games 2, 4, 5, and 9. That's four games where their score was zero. Therefore, the claim is true because there are exactly four instances where the opposing teams didn't score any points.\n\nNow, to note down the relevant cells for each of these instances:\n\n- Game 2: Row index 1 (since HTML tables start at 0), column \"opponents\".\n- Game 4: Row index 3.\n- Game 5: Row index 4.\n- Game 9: Row index 8.\n\nEach of these rows has an opponents score of zero, confirming the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in four games (2, 4, 5, and 9), the opposing teams scored zero points.

The claim states that there's 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, etc. My focus is on the 'date' and 'result' columns to verify the number of losses in each month.\n\nStarting with September:\n- The first two rows (game 1 and 2) have dates \"sept 20\" and \"sept 27\". \n- For game 1, the result is a loss.

The claim states: \"the wildcat play 2 game in september, 4 game in october, and 4 game in november.\" Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check how many games were played in September. Looking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 0 (game 1): sept 20 \u2192 September\n- Row 1 (game 2): sept 27 \u2192 September\n\nSo that's two games in September.

October has four games (3-6). November has four games (7-10). So 2 + 4 + 4 = 10, which matches the number of rows in the table.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 36 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the Wildcats scored 36 points more than their opponent in a game. So, I'm looking for a row where the Wildcats' points minus the opponents' points equals 36.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two columns relevant here: \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\". For each row, I'll calculate the difference by subtracting the opponents' points from the wildcats' points.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Wildcats scored 7, Opponents 14 \u2192 Difference is -7 (loss)\n2. Game 2: 20 vs. 0 \u2192 +20\n3. Game 3: 20 vs.7 \u2192 +13\n4. Game 4: 26 vs.0 \u2192 +26\n5. Game 5:14 vs.0 \u2192+14\n6. Game 6:7 vs.6 \u2192+1\n7. Game 7:0 vs.13 \u2192-13 (loss)\n8. Game 8:15 vs.6\u2192+9\n9. Game 9:36 vs.0\u2192+36\n10.Game10:6 vs.13\u2192-7 (loss)\n\nLooking at these differences, the highest margin of victory is in Game 9 where Wildcats scored 36 points and opponents 0, giving a difference of +36.\n\nSo, the claim states that the maximum outscore was by 36 points. From the data, this is accurate because in Game 9, they indeed outscored their opponent by 36 points.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is row 8 (since rows are zero-indexed) and column \"wildcats points\" as it's where the 36 points were recorded.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in Game 9, Wildcats outscored their opponent by 36 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that the Wildcats kept their opponents' scores at zero points in all 10 games listed in the table. So, for each of the 10 games, the \"opponents\" column should have a value of 0.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are two relevant columns: \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents.\" The claim is specifically about the opponents' scores, so I'll focus on the \"opponents\" column for each row.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **Game 1**: Opponents scored 14 points. This is not zero.\n2. **Game 2**: Opponents scored 0 points. This meets the condition.\n3. **Game 3**: Opponents scored 7 points. Not zero.\n4. **Game 4**: Opponents scored 0 points. Meets the condition.\n5. **Game 5**: Opponents scored 0 points. Meets the condition.\n6. **Game 6**: Opponents scored 6 points. Not zero.\n7. **Game 7**: Opponents scored 13 points. Not zero.\n8. **Game 8**: Opponents scored 6 points. Not zero.\n9. **Game 9**: Opponents scored 0 points. Meets the condition.\n10. **Game 10**: Opponents scored 13 points. Not zero.\n\nFrom this, I can see that not all games have opponents' scores at zero. In fact, only Games 2, 4, 5, and 9 meet the condition. Therefore, the claim that the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless in all 10 games is false.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells for each game where the opponents scored points (non-zero). These are rows 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Each of these has an \"opponents\" column value greater than zero.\n\nSo, compiling this information:\n\n- **Answer**: FALSE\n- **Relevant Cells**: For each game where opponents scored, we note the row index (from 0 to 9) and the column name \"opponents.\"\n\nThis method ensures that we've thoroughly checked each game against the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because not all games have the opposing team's score at zero.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record. Each row represents a game played by the Wildcats, with details about that game.\n\nThe claim is specifically about games where the Wildcats won and their score in those games. It states that they never scored more than 7 points in any of their wins. So, I need to check each win and see if there's any instance where the Wildcats scored more than 7 points.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 1)**: Result is a loss. Not relevant since we're only interested in wins.\n2. **Row 1 (Game 2)**: Result is a win. Wildcat Points are 20. Wait, that's way more than 7. This already contradicts the claim.\n3. **Row 2 (Game 3)**: Result is a win. Points are 20 again. Still higher than 7.\n4. **Row 3 (Game 4)**: Win with 26 points. That's even higher.\n5. **Row 4 (Game 5)**: Another win, 14 points. Again above 7.\n6. **Row 5 (Game 6)**: Win with 7 points exactly. This meets the claim.\n7. **Row 6 (Game 7)**: Loss, so not relevant.\n8. **Row 7 (Game 8)**: Win with 15 points. Again over 7.\n9. **Row 8 (Game 9)**: Win with 36 points. That's a lot more than 7.\n10. **Row 9 (Game 10)**: Loss, so not relevant.\n\nFrom this, I can see that in multiple games where the Wildcats won, they scored way above 7 points. The claim states they never scored more than 7 in any win, but clearly, there are several wins with much higher scores. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not true that every win had a score of 7 or less.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because multiple games show Wildcats winning with points exceeding 7.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the wildcat play 4 games in September, 2 games in October, and 2 games in November.\" \n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The columns are 'game', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', 'wildcats points', 'opponents', and 'record'. Each row represents a game played by the Wildcats.\n\nTo verify the claim, I'll count how many games were played each month. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Date is September 20 \u2192 This is one game in September.\n2. Game 2: September 27 \u2192 Second game in September.\n3. Game 3: October 4 \u2192 First game in October.\n4. Game 4: October 11 \u2192 Second game in October.\n5. Game 5: October 18 \u2192 Third game in October? Wait, but the claim says only 2 games in October. Hmm, this is a conflict because according to the table, there are more than two games in October.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at all the dates:\n\n- September:\n  - Game 1: Sept 20\n  - Game 2: Sept 27 \u2192 Total of 2 games in September, not 4 as claimed. \n\nWait, that's a mistake because the claim says 4 games in September, but according to the table, there are only two games in September (rows 1 and 2). So already the claim is incorrect here.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check each row again:\n\nRows with 'date' in September:\n- Row 0: Sept 20\n- Row 1: Sept 27 \u2192 Only two games in September.\n\nSo the claim says 4 games in September, which is wrong. Therefore, the entire statement is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other games in September that I missed. Looking through all rows:\n\nRow indices 0 to 9:\n- Row 0: Sept 20\n- Row 1: Sept 27 \u2192 Only two games in September.\n\nSo yes, only two games in September, not four as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, checking October and November for completeness:\n\nOctober dates:\n- Oct 4 (Row 2)\n- Oct 11 (Row 3)\n- Oct 18 (Row 4)\n- Oct 25 (Row 5) \u2192 That's four games in October. But the claim says only two, so that also contradicts.\n\nNovember dates:\n- Nov 1 (Row6)\n- Nov 8 (Row7)\n- Nov 15 (Row8)\n- Nov22 (Row9) \u2192 Four games in November as well. The claim says two, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the claim's counts for all months are wrong. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were 4 September games, but only 2 exist. Similarly, October and November each have more than 2 games. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that the maximum points by which the Wildcats outscored their opponents in a single game was 26 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for \"game,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"result,\" \"wildcats points,\" \"opponents\" (which I assume is the opponent's score), and \"record.\" The relevant columns here are \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents.\"\n\nTo find out by how much the Wildcats outscored each opponent, I'll calculate the difference between their points and the opponents' points for each game. But wait, I should only consider games where they won because if they lost, they couldn't have outscored the opponent.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Wildcats scored 7, Opponent 14 \u2192 Result is loss. Since it's a loss, we can ignore this for outscoring.\n2. Game 2: Wildcats 20, Opponents 0 \u2192 Difference is 20 points. They won, so this counts.\n3. Game 3: Wildcats 20, Opponents 7 \u2192 Difference is 13 points. They won, so this counts.\n4. Game 4: Wildcats 26, Opponents 0 \u2192 Difference is 26 points. They won, so this is a candidate for the maximum.\n5. Game 5: Wildcats 14, Opponents 0 \u2192 Difference is 14 points. They won.\n6. Game 6: Wildcats 7, Opponents 6 \u2192 Difference is 1 point. They won.\n7. Game 7: Wildcats 0, Opponents 13 \u2192 Loss; ignore.\n8. Game 8: Wildcats 15, Opponents 6 \u2192 Difference of 9 points. Win.\n9. Game 9: Wildcats 36, Opponents 0 \u2192 Difference is 36 points. They won; this might be higher than the previous max of 26.\n10. Game 10: Wildcats 6, Opponents 13 \u2192 Loss; ignore.\n\nWait a minute, in game 9, they scored 36 against opponents who scored 0. That's a difference of 36 points, which is higher than the previously noted 26 from game 4. So does that mean the maximum outscoring was actually 36?\n\nBut let me double-check because sometimes people might consider only certain games or if there's any mistake in interpreting the table.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Game 9: Wildcats have 36, opponents 0 \u2192 Difference is indeed 36.\n- The claim mentions 26 points. So according to the table, they outscored by more than that in game 9.\n\nTherefore, the maximum outscoring was higher than 26 points (it's 36). So the claim would be FALSE because it states the most was 26, but there's a higher value.\n\nHowever, I should check if I missed any other games where they scored more. Let me list all the differences in wins:\n\n- Game 2: +20\n- Game 3: +13\n- Game 4: +26\n- Game 5: +14\n- Game 6: +1\n- Game 8: +9\n- Game 9: +36\n\nYes, game 9 has the highest difference of 36. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the maximum outscoring was higher than 26 points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the maximum outscore was 26 points, but in game 9, they outscored by 36 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
