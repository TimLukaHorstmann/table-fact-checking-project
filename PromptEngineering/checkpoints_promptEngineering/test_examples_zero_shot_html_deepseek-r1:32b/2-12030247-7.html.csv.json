    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be no loan receive with a total debt of 169256\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has several columns: candidate, money raised 3q, loans received 3q, money spent 3q, total receipts, cash on hand, total debt, and after debt. Each row represents a different candidate with their respective financial data.\n\nThe claim states that there is no loan received when the total debt is 169256. So I need to check if any candidate has both 'loans received' as zero or '-' (indicating no loans) and 'total debt' equal to 169256.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Rudy Giuliani: Loans received is '-', which means he didn't receive any loans. His total debt is 169,256. This matches the condition in the claim where there's no loan received with that specific debt amount. So this candidate fits.\n\n2. Mitt Romney: He did receive loans (8,500,000), so this doesn't fit the claim about having no loans.\n\n3. Fred Thompson: Loans received is '-', so he didn't take any loans. His total debt is 678,432, which doesn't match 169,256. So this row isn't relevant for the claim.\n\n4. Ron Paul: Again, loans received are '-'. His total debt is also '-', meaning no debt? Wait, his 'after debt' is same as cash on hand, so perhaps he has zero debt. But regardless, his debt isn't 169k either.\n\n5. John McCain: Loans received '-', but his total debt is 1,730,691, which doesn't match.\n\n6. Mike Huckabee: No loans, but his debt is 47,810, not matching.\n\n7. Duncan Hunter: Received a small loan of $50,000. So this row isn't relevant since he did take a loan.\n\n8. Tom Tancredo: Loans received '-', total debt 295,603. Doesn't match.\n\n9. Sam Brownback: Loans received '-', total debt '-'. So no debt here either.\n\nFrom the above analysis, only Rudy Giuliani has both no loans (loans received is '-') and a total debt of exactly 169,256. The claim says \"there be no loan receive with a total debt of 169256\", which is true because Rudy Giuliani fits this condition.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row 0 for both 'loans received 3q' and 'total debt'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loans received 3q\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total debt\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 132741 left in hand after debt of 82741\" is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The phrase \"left in hand after debt\" probably means that we're looking for a candidate who has a certain amount remaining after accounting for their debts. So, if someone has 132741 left in hand after a debt of 82741, that suggests that before paying off the debt, they had more money, and after subtracting the debt, 82741 remains.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see there's a \"cash on hand\" column and an \"after debt\" column. The \"after debt\" might be the amount remaining after debts are deducted from cash on hand. So for each candidate, their \"cash on hand\" minus their total debt should equal the \"after debt\" value.\n\nThe claim mentions two numbers: 132741 and 82741. I need to find a row where these two numbers appear in the relevant columns. Let me go through each candidate's data:\n\n1. Rudy Giuliani: cash on hand is 16,649,825; after debt is 16,480,569. The difference would be total debt (169,256), which doesn't match the claim.\n2. Mitt Romney: cash on hand is 9,216,517; after debt is -8,133,483. The negative value suggests he owes money beyond his cash on hand.\n3. Fred Thompson: cash on hand is 7,121,744; after debt is 6,443,312. The difference here would be total debt (678,432), not matching the claim.\n4. Ron Paul: cash on hand and after debt are both 5,443,667. He has no debt mentioned, so this doesn't fit.\n5. John McCain: cash on hand is 3,488,627; after debt is 1,757,936. The total debt is 1,730,691. If I subtract 1,730,691 from 3,488,627, does it give the after debt? Let me calculate: 3,488,627 - 1,730,691 = 1,757,936. That's correct, but neither number is 132741 or 82741.\n6. Tom Tancredo: cash on hand is 110,079; after debt is -185,524. Again, a negative value, indicating more debt than cash.\n7. Sam Brownback: cash on hand and after debt are both 94,653. No debt mentioned.\n\nWait, I might have missed someone. Let me check again. Oh, there's a row for \"sam brownback\" but that doesn't help. Hmm, maybe I overlooked another candidate.\n\nLooking back at the table, I see \"tancredo\" and \"brownback,\" but neither matches the numbers in the claim. Wait, did I miss any other rows? Let me count: Rudy (0), Mitt (1), Fred (2), Ron (3), John (4), Tom (5), Sam (6). That's seven candidates.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the table. The row indices start at 0, so the first candidate is index 0. Let me check each one again:\n\n- Index 0: Giuliani - cash on hand 16,649,825; after debt 16,480,569. Not matching.\n- Index 1: Romney - cash on hand 9,216,517; after debt negative. No match.\n- Index 2: Thompson - cash on hand 7,121,744; after debt 6,443,312. The difference is 678,432. Not matching the claim's numbers.\n- Index 3: Paul - both 5,443,667. No debt involved.\n- Index 4: McCain - cash on hand 3,488,627; after debt 1,757,936. His total debt is 1,730,691. So 3,488,627 - 1,730,691 = 1,757,936, which matches the after debt. But this doesn't relate to the claim.\n- Index 5: Tancredo - cash on hand 110,079; after debt negative. No match.\n- Index 6: Brownback - both 94,653.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. The numbers in the claim are 132741 and 82741. Let me see if any candidate has these exact values. Looking at \"cash on hand\" for each:\n\n- Giuliani: 16,649,825\n- Romney: 9,216,517\n- Thompson: 7,121,744\n- Paul: 5,443,667\n- McCain: 3,488,627\n- Tancredo: 110,079\n- Brownback: 94,653\n\nNone of these match 132,741 or 82,741. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong column. The claim says \"left in hand after debt,\" which might be the \"after debt\" value. So maybe it's referring to a candidate whose \"after debt\" is 82,741 and cash on hand was higher before.\n\nLooking at \"after debt\":\n\n- Giuliani: 16,480,569\n- Romney: -8,133,483\n- Thompson: 6,443,312\n- Paul: 5,443,667\n- McCain: 1,757,936\n- Tancredo: -185,524\n- Brownback: 94,653\n\nStill none match 82,741. Wait a second, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me check each row's \"after debt\" again:\n\nLooking at index 4 (McCain): after debt is 1,757,936, which is over a million. Index 2: Thompson has 6,443,312.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check each candidate's \"after debt\" value:\n\n- Rudy Giuliani: after debt 16,480,569\n- Mitt Romney: -8,133,483\n- Fred Thompson: 6,443,312\n- Ron Paul: 5,443,667\n- John McCain: 1,757,936\n- Tom Tancredo: -185,524\n- Sam Brownback: 94,653\n\nNone of these are close to 82,741. So perhaps the claim's numbers don't correspond to any candidate in the table. Or maybe I misread the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"after debt\" for a different candidate is 82,741. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back at the table, maybe I missed a row or miscounted. The table has seven candidates as per the indices provided (0 to 6). None of their after debt values are 82,741.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"cash on hand\" is 132,741 and \"after debt\" is 82,741 for a candidate. Let me see:\n\n- Giuliani: cash 16,649,825; after debt 16,480,569\n- Romney: cash 9,216,517; after debt -8,133,483\n- Thompson: cash 7,121,744; after debt 6,443,312\n- Paul: cash 5,443,667; after debt same\n- McCain: cash 3,488,627; after debt 1,757,936\n- Tancredo: cash 110,079; after debt negative\n- Brownback: cash and after same\n\nNone of these match the claim's numbers. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"You are tasked with...\" but then the user provided a response that included a table. Maybe I need to look at that table again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about identifying which candidate has after debt of 82741 and cash on hand of 132741. But from the data, none do.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my initial approach. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"You are tasked with... You must provide your answer within [think] tags.\" Then the user provided their response, which included a table with candidates and their financial details.\n\nIn that table, for example, \"John McCain\" has cash on hand 3,488,627 and after debt 1,757,936. So perhaps the claim's numbers don't match any in the table, leading to the conclusion that no candidate fits, or maybe I've missed a row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"after debt\" for another candidate is 82,741. Let me check each again:\n\n- Giuliani: after debt 16,480,569\n- Romney: -8,133,483\n- Thompson: 6,443,312\n- Paul: 5,443,667\n- McCain: 1,757,936\n- Tancredo: -185,524\n- Brownback: 94,653\n\nNo, none match. Therefore, the answer is that no candidate in the table has an after debt of 82,741 and cash on hand of 132,741.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the provided financial data for each candidate, it's clear that none of them have a \"cash on hand\" amount of $132,741 or an \"after debt\" amount of $82,741. \n\nThe candidates and their respective figures are as follows:\n\n- **Rudy Giuliani**: Cash on Hand - $16,649,825; After Debt - $16,480,569\n- **Mitt Romney**: Cash on Hand - $9,216,517; After Debt - ($8,133,483)\n- **Fred Thompson**: Cash on Hand - $7,121,744; After Debt - $6,443,312\n- **Ron Paul**: Cash on Hand - $5,443,667; After Debt - $5,443,667\n- **John McCain**: Cash on Hand - $3,488,627; After Debt - $1,757,936\n- **Tom Tancredo**: Cash on Hand - $110,079; After Debt - ($185,524)\n- **Sam Brownback**: Cash on Hand - $94,653; After Debt - $94,653\n\nNone of these figures match the specified amounts in the question. Therefore, there is no candidate in the provided data who has a cash on hand of $132,741 or an after debt of $82,741.\n\nAnswer: No candidate matches the specified financial figures.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the amount of total receipt be 4235333, when 925745 be raise.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to say that when a candidate raised $925,745, their total receipts were $4,235,333.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns for \"candidate,\" \"money raised 3q,\" \"total receipts,\" and others. My task is to find if there's a row where \"money raised 3q\" is exactly 925745 and the corresponding \"total receipts\" is 4235333.\n\nI'll go through each candidate:\n\n1. Rudy Giuliani: Money raised is 11624255, which doesn't match.\n2. Mitt Romney: 9896719 \u2013 no match.\n3. Fred Thompson: 9750820 \u2013 close but not exactly 925745.\n4. Ron Paul: 5258455 \u2013 no.\n5. John McCain: 5734477 \u2013 nope.\n6. Mike Huckabee: 1034486 \u2013 no.\n7. Duncan Hunter: 486356 \u2013 no.\n8. Tom Tancredo: 767152 \u2013 no.\n9. Sam Brownback: Money raised is 925745, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking Sam Brownback's \"total receipts\" column, it shows 4235333. This exactly matches the claim. Therefore, both conditions are satisfied in row index 8 (since counting starts from 0). The relevant columns are \"money raised 3q\" and \"total receipts.\"\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"money raised  , 3q\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total receipts\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"5470277 be spend when the amount after debt be 1757936.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the candidate who has a 'money spent' value of 5,470,277. Scanning through the table rows, I notice that John McCain's money spent is listed as 5,470,277. So, this seems relevant.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'after debt' amount for John McCain. Looking at his row under the 'after debt' column, it shows 1,757,936. That's exactly what the claim mentions. \n\nSo both conditions are met: John McCain spent $5,470,277 and had an after-debt amount of $1,757,936.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"for the candidate mike huckabee the after debt be 63490 and cash on hand be 651300.\" So I need to check two things in the table for Mike Huckabee's row: the value under 'after debt' and the value under 'cash on hand'.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, each row represents a candidate. Let me find Mike Huckabee's row. Scanning through the candidates:\n\n- Rudy Giuliani\n- Mitt Romney\n- Fred Thompson\n- Ron Paul\n- John McCain\n- Mike Huckabee\n- Duncan Hunter\n- Tom Tancredo\n- Sam Brownback\n\nMike Huckabee is the 6th row (since counting starts at 0, so index 5).\n\nNow, I'll check each relevant column for this row.\n\nFirst, 'cash on hand'. The column names are: candidate, money raised, loans received, money spent, total receipts, cash on hand, total debt, after debt. So the 'cash on hand' is the sixth column. Looking at Mike Huckabee's row under that column, it shows 651300. That matches exactly with what the claim states. So that part seems correct.\n\nNext, the 'after debt'. The eighth column is 'after debt'. For Mike Huckabee, this value is listed as 603490. Wait, but the claim says 63490. Hmm, that's a discrepancy because 603490 isn't equal to 63490.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the columns. Let me double-check. The headers are:\n\n1. candidate\n2. money raised , 3q\n3. loans received , 3q\n4. money spent , 3q\n5. total receipts\n6. cash on hand\n7. total debt\n8. after debt\n\nYes, that's correct. So 'after debt' is the eighth column. Mike Huckabee's value there is 603490, which doesn't match the claim of 63490.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the number? Let me look again: for Mike Huckabee, the after debt is listed as 603,490. The claim says 63,490. That's significantly different. So the 'after debt' value in the table doesn't match what's claimed.\n\nSo both parts of the claim need to be true for the overall statement to be TRUE. Since one part (cash on hand) is correct and the other ('after debt') isn't, the entire claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.

I need to determine if the claim \"their be 132741 raise after debt of 82741\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's referring to. The phrase seems a bit awkwardly phrased, so I'll break it down. It mentions \"raise after debt,\" which probably means the amount of money someone has after accounting for their debt. So, I'm looking for a candidate whose \"cash on hand\" or \"after debt\" is 132741 and another where it's 82741.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"cash on hand\" and \"after debt\" are both present. The \"after debt\" column shows net cash after subtracting total debt, while \"cash on hand\" is the amount before considering debt. So, I need to check if any candidate has a value of 82741 in either \"after debt\" or \"cash on hand,\" and another with 132741.\n\nNow, scanning through each row:\n\n- Rudy Giuliani: cash on hand is 16,649,825; after debt is 16,480,569.\n- Mitt Romney: cash on hand is 9,216,517; after debt is -8,133,483 (negative).\n- Fred Thompson: cash on hand is 7,121,744; after debt is 6,443,312.\n- Ron Paul: cash on hand and after debt are both 5,443,667.\n- John McCain: cash on hand is 3,488,627; after debt is 1,757,936.\n- Mike Huckabee: cash on hand is 651,300; after debt is 603,490.\n- Duncan Hunter: cash on hand is 132,741; after debt is 82,741.\n- Tom Tancredo: cash on hand is 110,079; after debt is -185,524 (negative).\n- Sam Brownback: cash on hand and after debt are both 94,653.\n\nAh, here we go. In the row for Duncan Hunter:\n- Cash on hand is 132,741.\n- After debt is 82,741.\n\nSo, the claim mentions \"raise after debt of 82741.\" Since 82,741 is exactly what's shown under \"after debt\" for Duncan Hunter, and his cash on hand is indeed 132,741 before considering debt. Therefore, the numbers in the claim match exactly with this row.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 7 (Duncan Hunter) for both \"cash on hand\" and \"after debt.\"\n\nSo, the claim is supported by these values.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"cash on hand\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"after debt\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"for candidate mitt romney , the loan receive 3q be 8500000 and the money spent be 62829068.\"\n\nFirst, I'll locate Mitt Romney's row in the table. Scanning through the candidates, I see that Mitt Romney is the second row (index 1 since counting starts from 0). \n\nNow, let's check each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Loans Received, 3Q:** The claim says it should be 8,500,000. Looking at the \"loans received , 3q\" column for Mitt Romney, I see the value is 8500000. That matches exactly with what's claimed.\n\n2. **Money Spent:** The claim states that money spent should be 62,829,068. However, looking at the \"money spent , 3q\" column for Mitt Romney, it shows 21,301,755. This is a significant discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake? Let me double-check. The claim mentions \"the money spent be 62829068.\" But in the table, under \"money spent , 3q\" for Mitt Romney, it's indeed 21301755, not 62 million. \n\nAdditionally, I notice that the total receipts column has a value of 62,829,068 for Mitt Romney. So, the claim might have confused \"total receipts\" with \"money spent.\" That would explain why it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, while the loan amount is correct, the money spent figure in the claim doesn't match the table data. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the money spent by Mitt Romney as 62,829,068 instead of the actual figure and incorrectly associates it with \"money spent.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loans received , 3q\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money spent , 3q\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the amount of money raised, 3q for rudy giuliani, 11624255, be less than the money raised, 3q for ron paul.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure to identify the relevant columns and rows. The table has a column named \"money raised , 3q\" which is where I should check the amounts for each candidate.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Rudy Giuliani's row shows that under \"money raised , 3q\", he has 11624255.\n- Ron Paul's row shows his \"money raised , 3q\" amount as 5258455.\n\nNow, I need to compare these two numbers. The claim says Giuliani's money is less than Paul's. Let me check: 11,624,255 versus 5,258,455. Clearly, 11 million is more than 5 million, so Giuliani raised more than Ron Paul in the 3q period.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Giuliani's amount is less than Paul's is incorrect. The answer should be FALSE.\n\nI'll also note the relevant cells to support this conclusion. For Rudy Giuliani, it's row index 0 under \"money raised , 3q\". For Ron Paul, it's row index 3 in the same column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money raised , 3q\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money raised , 3q\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the amount of money spent , 3q , be 819376 , for duncan hunter\". So, we're looking for Duncan Hunter's spending in the \"money spent , 3q\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each row represents a candidate. The columns are: candidate, money raised 3q, loans received 3q, money spent 3q, total receipts, cash on hand, total debt, and after debt.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find Duncan Hunter. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Rudy Giuliani: Not the candidate we're looking for.\n2. Mitt Romney: No.\n3. Fred Thompson: No.\n4. Ron Paul: No.\n5. John McCain: No.\n6. Mike Huckabee: No.\n7. Duncan Hunter: Yes, this is our target row.\n\nNow, in the \"money spent , 3q\" column for Duncan Hunter, I see the value is 618117. The claim says it's 819376. That doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I misread the rows or columns. Scanning again:\n\n- The row index starts at 0. So, Rudy Giuliani is row 0, then Mitt Romney is 1, and so on until Duncan Hunter is in row 6 (since it's the seventh row). Let's count: row indices are from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the rows are:\n\n- Row 0: Rudy\n- Row 1: Mitt\n- Row 2: Fred\n- Row 3: Ron Paul\n- Row 4: John McCain\n- Row 5: Mike Huckabee\n- Row 6: Duncan Hunter\n\nYes, so row index 6 is correct.\n\nLooking at column names: \"money spent , 3q\" is the fourth column (index 2 if starting from 0). Wait, let me count:\n\nColumns are:\n0. candidate\n1. money raised, 3q\n2. loans received, 3q\n3. money spent, 3q\n4. total receipts\n5. cash on hand\n6. total debt\n7. after debt\n\nSo \"money spent , 3q\" is column index 3.\n\nIn row 6 (Duncan Hunter), the value under this column is 618117, not 819376. Therefore, the claim is false because the amount does not match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money spent , 3q\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"651300 be after debt when cash on hand be 603490\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that if a candidate has a cash on hand of 603,490, then their \"after debt\" should be 651,300. Alternatively, it might be stating that for the same row where cash on hand is 603,490, after debt is 651,300.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each candidate's data to find a match for these numbers.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Rudy Giuliani: Cash on hand is 16,649,825. Not matching.\n- Mitt Romney: Cash on hand is 9,216,517. No match.\n- Fred Thompson: 7,121,744. Nope.\n- Ron Paul: 5,443,667. Still not.\n- John McCain: 3,488,627. Not matching.\n- Mike Huckabee: Cash on hand is 651,300? Wait, no, looking at the cash on hand column, Mike Huckabee has 651,300 in the \"cash on hand\" cell. Now checking his \"after debt\" value. According to the table, after debt for Mike Huckabee is 603,490.\n\nWait a minute, that's the reverse of what the claim says. The claim states that when cash on hand is 603,490, after debt should be 651,300. But in the table, for Mike Huckabee, cash on hand is 651,300 and after debt is 603,490.\n\nSo, looking at the claim again: \"651300 be after debt when cash on hand be 603490.\" That would mean that if cash on hand is 603,490, then after debt should be 651,300. But in the table, for Mike Huckabee, it's the other way around: cash on hand is 651,300 and after debt is 603,490.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The relevant row for Mike Huckabee has:\n- cash on hand: 651,300\n- after debt: 603,490\n\nSo the claim says that when cash on hand is 603,490, then after debt should be 651,300. But in reality, Mike Huckabee has cash on hand of 651,300 and after debt of 603,490.\n\nTherefore, the claim does not hold because the numbers are reversed for this candidate. There's no row where cash on hand is 603,490 with after debt being 651,300. Instead, Mike Huckabee has cash on hand 651,300 and after debt 603,490.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the conditions are not met in any row of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when \"cash on hand\" is 603,490, \"after debt\" should be 651,300. Checking each candidate's data:\n\n- Mike Huckabee has cash on hand 651,300 and after debt 603,490.\n\nNo candidate matches the claim's condition where cash on hand is 603,490 with after debt as 651,300. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cash on hand\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"after debt\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
