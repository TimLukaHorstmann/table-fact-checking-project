    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"academia quintana fc be found in 1969 before all other team in the puerto rico soccer league.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that Academia Quintana FC was founded in 1969 and that this happened before all other teams in the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL). So, two things to check: when Academia Quintana was founded and whether they were indeed the first.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each row for the 'founded' year. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **Academia Quintana FC**: Founded in 1969. That's clear.\n2. **Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC**: Founded in 2008.\n3. **Bayam\u00f3n FC**: Founded in 2009.\n4. **Fajardo FC**: Founded in 2010.\n5. **Guaynabo Fluminense FC**: Founded in 2002.\n6. **Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC**: Founded in 1998.\n7. **Puerto Rico Islanders FC**: Founded in 2003.\n8. **CF Tornados de Humacao**: Founded in 1994.\n\nWait, so the oldest team besides Academia Quintana is CF Tornados de Humacao, founded in 1994. That's way after 1969. So, if Academia Quintana was founded in 1969 and all other teams were founded later, then they are indeed the first.\n\nBut I should make sure that all teams listed in the table have a 'founded' year after 1969. Let me list them:\n\n- 2008: Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC\n- 2009: Bayam\u00f3n FC and others\n- 2010: Fajardo FC and others\n- 2002: Guaynabo Fluminense FC\n- 1998: Gigantes de Carolina FC\n- 2003: Puerto Rico Islanders FC\n- 1994: CF Tornados de Humacao\n\nWait, the claim says \"before all other teams in the PRSL.\" So, are there any teams in the table that were founded before 1969? Looking again:\n\nNo, the next oldest is 1994. Therefore, Academia Quintana FC was indeed founded earlier than all others listed.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any other team's 'founded' year could be misinterpreted. For example, \"founded\" might refer to when they joined PRSL rather than their establishment date. But the claim is about being found in 1969 before others, so as per the table, it seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the 'founded' year of Academia Quintana FC and the 'founded' years of all other teams to confirm they were established after 1969.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each team's founding year in the table. Since all other teams were founded after 1969, the statement holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"atl\u00e9tico de san juan fc and academia quintana fc both play game at the hiram bithorn stadium.\" \n\nFirst, let me look through the table to find the relevant clubs mentioned in the claim. I'll check each row one by one.\n\nLooking at row 0: The club is academia quintana fc. Their home city is san juan, and their stadium is listed as hiram bithorn stadium. They were founded in 1969 and played in seasons 2008 and 2009. So, this club does play at hiram bithorn.\n\nNext, row 1: The club is atl\u00e9tico de san juan fc. Their home city is also san juan, and their stadium is the same as academia quintana fc\u2014hiram bithorn stadium. They were founded in 2008 and played in seasons 2008 and 2009.

The claim says they've been in the league for three consecutive seasons from 2008 to 2010.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the row for Guaynabo Fluminense FC. Scanning through the rows, I see that it's the fifth entry. Now, looking at the columns, there are five: club, home city, stadium, founded, and seasons in prsl.\n\nThe claim mentions three consecutive seasons from 2008 to 2010. So, I need to check the \"seasons in prsl\" column for Guaynabo Fluminense FC. The cell under that column has \"2008 , 2009 , 2010\". That means they were in the league during each of those years.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if these seasons are consecutive. Consecutive means one after another without any gaps. Looking at the years: 2008, 2009, and 2010 follow each other without missing a year. So yes, they were in three consecutive seasons.\n\nI should also check if there's any information that might contradict this. The \"founded\" column shows they were founded in 2002, which is before the seasons mentioned, so that doesn't affect the claim. Their home city and stadium details don't impact whether they played in those seasons either.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table. Guaynabo Fluminense FC was indeed part of the league from 2008 to 2010 without any gaps.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"seasons in prsl\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"fajardo fc be the most recent team to join the puerto rico soccer league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim states: fajardo fc is the most recent team to join PRSL (Puerto Rico Soccer League). So, I need to find out when each team joined and see which one has the latest start year.\n\nThe relevant columns here are \"founded\" and \"seasons in prsl\". The \"founded\" column shows the year the club was established, while \"seasons in prsl\" indicates the years they participated in the league.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Academy Quintana FC: Founded 1969, seasons in PRSL 2008, 2009.\n- Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC: Founded 2008, seasons in PRSL 2008, 2009.\n- Bayam\u00f3n FC: Founded 2009, season in PRSL 2009.\n- Fajardo FC: Founded 2010, season in PRSL 2010.\n- Guaynabo Fluminense FC: Founded 2002, seasons in PRSL 2008, 2009, 2010.\n- Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC: Founded 1998, seasons in PRSL 2008, 2009.\n- Puerto Rico Islanders FC: Founded 2003, season in PRSL 2010.\n- CF Tornados de Humacao: Founded 1994, seasons in PRSL 2008, 2009.\n\nI need to identify the team with the most recent \"founded\" year or the latest participation. \n\nLooking at founded years:\n- The earliest is 1969 (Academia Quintana), and the latest is 2010 (Fajardo FC).\n\nBut also, checking seasons in PRSL:\n- Fajardo FC participated in 2010.\n- Puerto Rico Islanders FC also participated in 2010.\n\nWait, so both Fajardo FC and Puerto Rico Islanders FC joined or were active in the league in 2010. However, the claim is about being the \"most recent\" to join, which could mean when they first joined. \n\nLooking at their founded years:\n- Fajardo FC was founded in 2010, so it's likely that they joined PRSL in 2010.\n- Puerto Rico Islanders FC was founded earlier (2003) but only participated in PRSL starting in 2010.\n\nSo both have their first season in 2010. But since Fajardo FC was founded in 2010, that would be the most recent founding year. However, if a team already existed before and joined later, like Puerto Rico Islanders, they might not count as the \"most recent\" if another team started in the same year.\n\nWait, no, both Fajardo FC and Puerto Rico Islanders have their first PRSL season in 2010. So they both are equally recent in terms of joining the league. However, the claim is about Fajardo being the most recent, so if there's another team that joined at the same time, then Fajardo isn't the sole most recent.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the \"founded\" year as when they started existing, and the \"seasons in PRSL\" as when they participated. So even though Puerto Rico Islanders were founded earlier, they joined PRSL in 2010, same as Fajardo FC. But since Fajardo was founded in 2010, it's possible that they are considered more recent because the team itself is newer.\n\nBut the claim says \"to join\", which refers to when they started participating in the league, not necessarily when they were founded. So both teams joined in 2010. Therefore, Fajardo FC isn't the only most recent; Puerto Rico Islanders also joined in the same year.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nFajardo FC has \"seasons in prsl\" as 2010.\nPuerto Rico Islanders have \"seasons in prsl\" as 2010.\n\nSo both teams were active in PRSL in 2010. Therefore, Fajardo FC isn't the sole most recent; they joined alongside another team. Hence, the claim that Fajardo is the most recent might be incorrect because another team also joined at the same time.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider only when each team first joined PRSL. If both joined in 2010, then neither is more recent than the other; they are equally recent. Therefore, Fajardo isn't uniquely the most recent.\n\nAlternatively, if we look at when they were founded:\n\nFajardo FC was founded in 2010 and started in PRSL that same year.\nPuerto Rico Islanders were founded earlier (2003) but joined PRSL later (2010).\n\nSo Fajardo is a newer club both in existence and league participation. But whether \"most recent to join\" refers to when they first participated or their founding date.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is when they first joined the league, which would be 2010 for both. So since both started in 2010, Fajardo isn't uniquely the most recent.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Fajardo FC is the most recent team to join PRSL is FALSE because Puerto Rico Islanders also joined in the same year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Fajardo FC is the most recent team to join the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL) is **FALSE**. Both Fajardo FC and Puerto Rico Islanders FC joined PRSL in 2010, making them equally recent additions to the league.\n\nAnswer: FALSE",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"only 1 team be found before 1970, that be the academia quintana fc\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that only one team was founded before 1970, and that team is Academia Quintana FC. To verify this, I'll examine each row in the table looking at the \"founded\" column since that's relevant to the founding year.\n\nLooking through each club:\n\n1. **Academia Quintana FC**: Founded in 1969, which is indeed before 1970.\n2. **Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC**: Founded in 2008.\n3. **Bayam\u00f3n FC**: Founded in 2009.\n4. **Fajardo FC**: Founded in 2010.\n5. **Guaynabo Fluminense FC**: Founded in 2002, which is after 1970.\n6. **Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC**: Founded in 1998.\n7. **Puerto Rico Islanders FC**: Founded in 2003.\n8. **CF Tornados de Humacao**: Founded in 1994.\n\nNow, focusing on the \"founded\" year:\n\n- Academia Quintana FC is the only team with a founding year before 1970 (1969).

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"guaynabo fluminense fc was founded in 1969 before all other teams in the puerto rico soccer league.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table to find information about Guaynabo Fluminense FC. Scanning through the rows, I see that Guaynabo Fluminense FC is listed with a \"founded\" year of 2002. So according to the table, they were founded in 2002, not 1969.\n\nNext, I need to check when all the other teams were founded to see if any were founded before Guaynabo Fluminense FC. Let's go through each team:\n\n1. Academia Quintana FC: Founded in 1969.\n2. Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC: Founded in 2008.\n3. Bayam\u00f3n FC: Founded in 2009.\n4. Fajardo FC: Founded in 2010.\n5. Gigantes de Carolina / Boca Juniors Carolina FC: Founded in 1998.\n6. Puerto Rico Islanders FC: Founded in 2003.\n7. CF Tornados de Humacao: Founded in 1994.\n\nLooking at these, I see that both CF Tornados de Humacao (1994) and Gigantes de Carolina (1998) were founded before Guaynabo Fluminense FC's listed founding year of 2002. However, Academia Quintana FC was actually founded in 1969, which is earlier than Guaynabo's 2002.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says that Guaynabo was founded before all others. But according to the table, there are teams like Tornados de Humacao and Gigantes de Carolina that were founded in 1994 and 1998 respectively, which are both earlier than 2002. So Guaynabo Fluminense FC wasn't the first; in fact, they came much later.\n\nMoreover, the claim mentions \"founded in 1969,\" but according to the table, Guaynabo was founded in 2002, which contradicts that part of the claim. Also, Academia Quintana is actually the team founded in 1969, not Guaynabo.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim incorrectly states that Guaynabo Fluminense FC was founded in 1969 and before all other teams. However, the table shows they were founded in 2002, and there are several teams founded earlier than them. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Guaynabo Fluminense FC was founded in 2002, not 1969, and there are other teams with earlier founding years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It claims that CF Tornado de Humacao is the most recent team to join the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL). To verify this, I need to check two things: when each team joined and which one was the last.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different club with details about their founding year and the seasons they were in PRSL. The \"seasons in prsl\" column lists the years each team participated in the league.\n\nI'll go through each team's \"founded\" year and their participation in the PRSL:\n\n1. **Academia Quintana FC**: Founded in 1969, but only played in 2008 and 2009.\n2. **Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC**: Founded in 2008 and played in 2008 and 2009.\n3. **Bayam\u00f3n FC**: Founded in 2009 and played in 2009.\n4. **Fajardo FC**: Founded in 2010 and played in 2010.\n5. **Guaynabo Fluminense FC**: Founded in 2002, but played in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n6. **Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC**: Founded in 1998, played in 2008 and 2009.\n7. **Puerto Rico Islanders FC**: Founded in 2003 and played in 2010.\n8. **CF Tornados de Humacao**: Founded in 1994 and played in 2008, 2009.\n\nNow, the claim is about being the most recent to join PRSL. The \"seasons in prsl\" column shows when they participated. The latest season mentioned across all teams is 2010. Looking at which teams were in PRSL in 2010:\n\n- **Fajardo FC**: Joined in 2010 (founded 2010, played in 2010).\n- **Guaynabo Fluminense FC**: Played in 2010 as well.\n- **Puerto Rico Islanders FC**: Also played in 2010.\n\nSo Fajardo FC was founded and joined PRSL in 2010. Since they were the last to join based on their founding year and participation in 2010, which is later than CF Tornados de Humacao's participation (which stopped after 2009), the claim that CF Tornados is the most recent is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those showing Fajardo FC's founding year (row 3, column \"founded\") and their seasons in PRSL (row 3, column \"seasons in prsl\").

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"cf tornado de humacao have be in the league for 3 consecutive season from 2008 to 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row corresponding to \"cf tornados de humacao\". Scanning the club names, I find it's in the last row (row index 7).\n\nNext, I check the relevant columns for this claim. The key information needed is the seasons they were part of the league. The column titled \"seasons in prsl\" should have this data.\n\nLooking at that cell for cf tornados de humacao, it lists the seasons as \"2008 , 2009\". This means they participated in 2008 and 2009 but not in 2010. The claim states they were in the league from 2008 to 2010 consecutively, which would require three seasons: 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\nSince they only have entries for 2008 and 2009, it's clear they weren't in the league in 2010. Therefore, their participation wasn't consecutive from 2008 to 2010 as claimed.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because they missed the 2010 season.\n</think>\n\nThe club \"cf tornados de humacao\" participated in seasons 2008 and 2009 but not in 2010. Thus, they weren't consecutive for three years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"seasons in prsl\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 team be found before 1970 , that be the fajardo fc\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that only one team was founded before 1970, and that team is Fajardo FC. So I need to check two things: how many teams were founded before 1970, and which ones they are.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different club with details including the year it was founded. The relevant column here is \"founded.\"\n\nLet's go through each team:\n\n1. Academia Quintana FC: Founded in 1969.\n2. Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC: Founded in 2008.\n3. Bayam\u00f3n FC: Founded in 2009.\n4. Fajardo FC: Founded in 2010.\n5. Guaynabo Fluminense FC: Founded in 2002.\n6. Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC: Founded in 1998.\n7. Puerto Rico Islanders FC: Founded in 2003.\n8. CF Tornados de Humacao: Founded in 1994.\n\nWait, Fajardo FC was founded in 2010, so that's after 1970. The claim says Fajardo FC is the only team before 1970, but according to this, Fajardo was actually founded much later.\n\nLooking again at all teams:\n\n- Only Academia Quintana FC and Gigantes de Carolina FC were founded before 2008. Specifically, Academia in 1969 (which is before 1970) and Gigantes in 1998 (also before 2008). So there are at least two teams founded before 2008.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions \"before 1970.\" Let me check each team's founding year:\n\n- Academia Quintana FC: 1969 (yes, before 1970)\n- Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC: 2008\n- Bayam\u00f3n FC: 2009\n- Fajardo FC: 2010\n- Guaynabo Fluminense FC: 2002\n- Gigantes de Carolina FC: 1998 (before 1970? Wait, no, 1998 is after 1970.\nWait, 1998 is after 1970. So only Academia Quintana was founded before 1970.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that:\n\nThe claim says \"before 1970.\" So any team founded in 1969 or earlier would qualify. Checking each team:\n\n- Academia Quintana FC: 1969 (yes)\n- Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC: 2008\n- Bayam\u00f3n FC: 2009\n- Fajardo FC: 2010\n- Guaynabo Fluminense FC: 2002\n- Gigantes de Carolina FC: 1998 (no, that's after 1970)\n- Puerto Rico Islanders FC: 2003\n- CF Tornados de Humacao: 1994 (also after 1970)\n\nSo only Academia Quintana FC was founded before 1970. The claim says it's Fajardo FC, but that's incorrect because Fajardo FC was founded in 2010. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0 (Academia Quintana FC) under \"founded\" which shows 1969\n- Row 3 (Fajardo FC) under \"founded\" showing 2010\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because only Academia Quintana was founded before 1970, not Fajardo FC.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}",
