It suggests that Daniel Boaventura is one among six individuals who portray Gomez Addams in different casts.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a character (like Gomez Addams) and lists various casts across different productions: original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, etc.\n\nFocusing on the Gomez Addams row, which is the first row of data. The columns under this role are:\n- Original Broadway cast: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway cast: Roger Rees\n- Original US Tour cast: Douglas Sills\n- Original Nonequity Tour cast: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima cast: Diego Bertie\n\nCounting the actors listed for Gomez Addams:\n1. Nathan Lane (Broadway)\n2. Roger Rees (Closing Broadway)\n3. Douglas Sills (US Tour)\n4. Jesse Sharp (Nonequity Tour)\n5. Daniel Boaventura (S\u00e3o Paulo)\n6. Diego Bertie (Lima)\n\nThat's six actors in total playing Gomez Addams across different casts. Daniel Boaventura is indeed one of them, specifically in the S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Daniel Boaventura is listed as one of the six individuals who played Gomez Addams.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"pugsley addams be the only role that have 3 people available to play it in the original s\u00e3o paulo cast.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that among all the roles listed in the table, Pugsley Addams is the sole role with three actors in its original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are:\n- role\n- original broadway cast\n- closing broadway cast\n- original us tour cast\n- original nonequity tour cast\n- original s\u00e3o paulo cast\n- original lima cast\n\nSo, I need to check each row's \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" column to see how many actors are listed for each role.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: \"daniel boaventura\" \u2013 that's just one person.\n2. Morticia Addams: \"marisa orth\" \u2013 also one person.\n3. Uncle Fester: \"claudio galvan\" \u2013 again, one person.\n4. Grandma Addams: \"in\u00e1 de carvalho\" \u2013 one person.\n5. Wednesday Addams: \"laura lobo\" \u2013 one person.\n6. Pugsley Addams: \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz  , matheus lustosa\" \u2013 here, I count three names separated by commas.\n7. Lurch: \"rog\u00e9rio guedes\" \u2013 one person.\n8.

Lucas Beineke: \"beto sargentelli\" \u2013 one person.\n\nSo, only Pugsley Addams has three actors listed in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. All other roles have just one actor each. Therefore, the claim is true because no other role has three people; it's unique to Pugsley Addams.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Pugsley Addams is the only role with three actors in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

My focus will be on these two columns because they are directly mentioned in the claim.\n\nI need to find the rows where Adam Riegler and Zachary James are listed under the \"original broadway cast.\" Let's scan through each row:\n\n1. **Gomez Addams**: Original cast is Nathan Lane, closing is Roger Rees.\n2. **Morticia Addams**: Bebe Neuwirth in original, Brooke Shields in closing.\n3. **Uncle Fester**: Kevin Chamberlin originally, Brad Oscar in closing.\n4. **Grandma Addams**: Jackie Hoffman in both original and closing.\n5. **Wednesday Addams**: Krysta Rodriguez originally, Rachel Potter closing.\n6. **Pugsley Addams**: Adam Riegler in both original and closing.\n7. **Lurch**: Zachary James in both original and closing.\n8. **Mal Beineke**: Terrence Mann originally, Adam Grupper closing.\n9. **Alice Beineke**: Carolee Carmello originally, Heidi Blickenstaff closing.\n10. **Lucas Beineke**: Wesley Taylor originally, Jesse Swenson closing.\n\nFrom this, I see that both Adam Riegler (Pugsley Addams) and Zachary James (Lurch) are listed in the \"original broadway cast\" column. Now, checking the \"closing broadway cast\" for their respective roles:\n\n- Pugsley Addams: Adam Riegler is still listed.\n- Lurch: Zachary James remains.\n\nSo both actors played the same role in both casts.

The columns we're interested in are \"original broadway cast\" and \"original lima cast\".\n\nLooking at the \"original lima cast\" column, each row lists one or more actors for each role. For example, Pugsley Addams has two names: \"giuseppino castellano  , brando gallesi\".

So, I'm looking to see if the row corresponding to \"lurch\" has three different actors listed across any of its columns.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a character (like Gomez Addams, Morticia Addams, etc.), and each column lists the actor for that role under different casts: original Broadway, closing Broadway, original US tour, etc. So, I'll focus on the \"lurch\" row.\n\nIn the \"lurch\" row, here's what the columns show:\n\n- Original Broadway cast: Zachary James\n- Closing Broadway cast: Zachary James (same as above)\n- Original US Tour: Tom Corbeil\n- Original Nonequity Tour: Dan Olson\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Rog\u00e9rio Guedes\n- Original Lima cast: Gustavo Mayer\n\nSo, for Lurch, the actors listed are Zachary James (appearing twice in Broadway), Tom Corbeil, Dan Olson, Rog\u00e9rio Guedes, and Gustavo Mayer.

Looking at the table, I see that each row represents a different character from the Addams Family musical or related roles. Each column lists various casts across different productions.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to Bebe Neuwirth. Scanning through the \"original broadway cast\" column, I find her name under the role of Morticia Addams in the second row (row index 1). So, she's definitely part of the original Broadway cast for that role.\n\nNow, the claim is about the Lima cast, specifically the \"original lima cast\" column. Let me look at that column to see who was in it for each role. For the role of Morticia Addams, the Lima cast is listed as Fiorella Rodriguez. That's a different person from Bebe Neuwirth.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check other rows just in case? No, since each row is about a specific character. Since Bebe Neuwirth is only listed under the Broadway and closing Broadway casts for Morticia Addams, she doesn't appear elsewhere in the Lima column.\n\nSo putting it together: Bebe Neuwirth isn't part of the original Lima cast according to the table.

Let me start by understanding what the claim means. It's saying that no actor played the same role both in the original Broadway cast (opening) and in the closing Broadway cast.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: role, original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, etc. So for each row, which represents a character/role, I need to compare the \"original broadway cast\" actor with the \"closing broadway cast\" actor.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Gomez Addams**: Original Broadway is Nathan Lane, Closing is Roger Rees. Different actors.\n2. **Morticia Addams**: Bebe Neuwirth vs Brooke Shields. Different.\n3. **Uncle Fester**: Kevin Chamberlin vs Brad Oscar.

But since I found multiple instances where the same actor is in both, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. I need to list each instance where an actor stayed from opening to closing. So looking back:\n\n- Grandma Addams: row 3 (index starts at 0?), original and closing.\nWait, wait, let's check row indexes. The first row after header is Gomez Addams as row 0.\n\nRow 3 is Grandma Addams: both columns are Jackie Hoffman. So that's relevant.\n\nSimilarly, Pugsley Addams in row 5 has Adam Riegler in both.

In other words, each role has more than one actor associated with it across different casts (like original Broadway, closing Broadway, etc.).\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"role\" followed by various cast types such as original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, and others like US tour, nonequity tour, S\u00e3o Paulo, Lima casts. Each row represents a character in the Addams Family musical or related roles.\n\nTo verify if there's always an extra actor for each role, I need to check if each role has at least two different actors listed across all the columns except perhaps the first \"role\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Gomez Addams**: Original Broadway is Nathan Lane, closing is Roger Rees. So two different actors here. That's good.\n2. **Morticia Addams**: Bebe Neuwirth and Brooke Shields. Again, two different actors.\n3. **Uncle Fester**: Kevin Chamberlin and Brad Oscar. Two actors.\n4. **Grandma Addams**: Jackie Hoffman is listed in both original and closing Broadway. So only one actor here.\n5. **Wednesday Addams**: Krysta Rodriguez and Rachel Potter. Two actors.\n6. **Pugsley Addams**: Adam Riegler is in both original and closing Broadway, but looking further, the US tour has Patrick D Kennedy and others. Wait, but for the claim to be TRUE, each role should have at least one extra actor. But Grandma Addams only has Jackie Hoffman across all columns I checked.\n7. **Lurch**: Zachary James is in both original and closing Broadway. So only one actor here as well.\n8. **Mal Beineke**: Terrence Mann and Adam Grupper. Two actors.\n9. **Alice Beineke**: Carolee Carmello and Heidi Blickenstaff. Two actors.\n10. **Lucas Beineke**: Wesley Taylor and Jesse Swenson. Two actors.\n\nWait, but for Grandma Addams, in the original Broadway and closing Broadway, it's Jackie Hoffman both times. The other columns show different actresses like Pippa Pearthree, Amanda Bruton, etc., so actually, there are multiple actors for this role across different tours. Similarly, Lurch has Zachary James in two columns but also Tom Corbeil, Dan Olson, etc.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check each role again:\n\n- **Grandma Addams**: The original Broadway and closing Broadway both have Jackie Hoffman. However, the US tour cast is Pippa Pearthree, so that's another actor. So actually, there are multiple actors for Grandma Addams across different casts.\n\nSimilarly, Lurch has Zachary James in two columns but also Tom Corbeil and others elsewhere. So each role does have more than one actor available when considering all the cast types.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because every role has at least two actors listed across the various casts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
