    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The columns are: season, manager, record, win %, post- season record, post- season win %, and mlb affiliate.\n\nThe claim mentions \"kansas city,\" so I should look for rows where the \"mlb affiliate\" is \"kansas city.\" Scanning through the table:\n\nLooking at each row's \"mlb affiliate\":\n- 2001: houston\n- 2002: houston\n- 2003: houston\n- 2004: houston\n- 2005: houston\n- 2006: houston\n- 2007: houston\n- 2008: houston\n- 2009: houston\n- 2010: houston\n- 2011: houston\n- 2012: houston\n- 2013: kansas city\n\nSo, the only row with \"kansas city\" as the mlb affiliate is the last one, season 2013.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a post-season record for that row. The columns are \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\". For season 2013:\n\n- post - season record: \"-\"\n- post - season win %: \"-\"\n\nThe dashes indicate no data or absence of a post-season record, which aligns with the claim stating there's no post-season record.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"houston have no post- season record\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim refers to \"houston,\" which seems to be an MLB affiliate as per the table's columns. So, I should look at all the rows where the 'mlb affiliate' column is 'houston.' Then, I need to check if these rows have any post-season records.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has a 'post- season record' and 'post- season win %' columns. The claim is that Houston has no post-season record, which would mean these two columns should be empty or indicate absence of post-season participation for all their entries.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. **2001**: Post-season record is 4 - 0. That's a clear indication they had a post-season presence.\n2. **2002**: Both post-season columns have '-', which might mean no post-season or not applicable.\n3. **2003 \u2666**: Post-season record is 0 - 2, so they did participate but lost both games.\n4. **2004 to 2012 (except 2006)**: These entries have '-' in the post-season columns.\n5. **2006 \u2666**: Again, 0 - 2, indicating participation.\n\nWait a minute, for years like 2003 and 2006, Houston has post-season records with actual numbers (like 4-0 or 0-2). This means that during these seasons, they did have post-season games. So the claim that \"houston have no post- season record\" is not entirely accurate because there are instances where they do have a post-season record.\n\nTherefore, since there are rows showing Houston with post-season records, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because in some years (like 2001, 2003, and 2006), Houston had post-season records.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post- season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post- season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post- season record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
