    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The table has columns: year, award, category, work, and result. Each row represents an award nomination or win that \"icarly\" received in a particular year under a specific category.\n\nThe claim is saying that icarly was nominated for more awards than it actually won. So I need to count the number of times icarly was nominated versus the number of times it won.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. 2009: Teen Choice Awards, Category: Choice TV Actor: Comedy, Work: icarly, Result: Nominated.\n2. 2010: Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award, icarly, Nominated.\n3. 2010: Same awards, Lol Award (shared), icarly, Won.\n4. 2011: UK Kids' Choice Awards, Nick UK's Funniest Person, icarly, Won.\n5. 2011: Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil, Funniest Character, icarly, Nominated.\n6. 2012: Kids' Choice Awards, Favorite TV Sidekick, icarly, Nominated.\n7. 2013: Daytime Emmy Awards, Outstanding Performer in Animated Program, Tuff Puppy, Nominated.\n\nWait, the last row mentions \"tuff puppy\" as the work, not icarly. So I should exclude this one from my count because it's a different show. The claim is about icarly specifically.\n\nSo let me list only the rows where the work is icarly:\n\n1. 2009: Nominated\n2. 2010: Nominated\n3. 2010: Won\n4. 2011: Won\n5. 2011: Nominated\n6. 2012: Nominated\n\nNow, counting nominations and wins:\n\nNominations:\n- Row 0 (2009)\n- Row 1 (2010)\n- Row 4 (2011)\n- Row 5 (2012)\n\nThat's 4 nominations.\n\nWins:\n- Row 2 (2010) - Lol Award\n- Row 3 (2011) - Funniest Person\n\nSo that's 2 wins.\n\nThe claim is that the number of nominations exceeds the number of wins. Here, 4 > 2, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells for this determination. Each relevant cell is where the result was either \"nominated\" or \"won\" and the work was icarly (excluding row 6 as it's a different show). \n\nSo, rows 0,1,2,3,4,5 are all about icarly.\n\nRelevant cells would be each of these rows under the 'result' column. So I'll list each row index and 'result' as the column.\n\nWait, but the last row (row 6) is for Tuff Puppy, so it's not relevant. So my relevant cells are:\n\nRow 0: result\nRow 1: result\nRow 2: result\nRow 3: result\nRow 4: result\nRow 5: result\n\nYes, that makes sense because each of these rows contributes to either a nomination or a win for icarly.\n\nSo compiling this into the JSON structure as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that \"Tuff\" is the only other show besides \"iCarly\" that was nominated. So, I'm looking to see if there's any other work apart from \"iCarly\" and \"tuff puppy\" that has a nomination in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different award and category for specific works. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **2009**: The work is \"icarly\". Result is nominated.\n2. **2010**: Two rows both have \"icarly\" as the work. One was nominated, the other won.\n3. **2011**: Again, \"icarly\" with a win and another nomination in Brazil.\n4. **2012**: Another nomination for \"icarly\".\n5. **2013**: Here, the work is \"tuff puppy\", which was nominated.\n\nSo, besides \"iCarly\", only \"Tuff Puppy\" (from 2013) has a nomination. All other entries are about \"iCarly\". There's no other show mentioned in any of the rows except these two.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\" is TRUE because \"Tuff Puppy\" is indeed the sole other work with a nomination.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that besides \"iCarly\", only \"Tuff Puppy\" has a nomination.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It seems to say that Jerry Traino was nominated for two awards in 2010 and two awards in 2011, and he won one award each of those years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several rows with information about different awards over the years. Each row has details like year, award name, category, work, and result (whether it was nominated or won).\n\nI'll start by examining the 2010 entries. The table shows two rows for 2010:\n\n1. In the first 2010 entry, he was nominated in the \"big kid award\" category for \"icarly,\" but the result is \"nominated.\"\n2. In the second 2010 entry, he was part of a shared ensemble that won the \"lol award.\" The result here is \"won.\"\n\nSo for 2010, there are two awards: one nomination and one win. That matches the claim's statement about being nominated twice in 2010.\n\nNext, looking at 2011:\n\nThere are two entries again:\n\n1. One where he was nominated for \"nick uk 's funniest person,\" result is \"nominated.\"\n2. Another nomination for \"funniest character\" in Brazil, also resulting in a nomination.\n\nWait, both of these have the result as \"nominated.\" The claim says he won one award each year. But according to this, in 2011, he was nominated twice but didn't win any awards. That contradicts the claim because it states he won one in each year.\n\nSo putting it together: In 2010, he had two awards (one nomination, one win), which matches the claim for that year. However, in 2011, he was nominated twice but didn't win any, which doesn't match the claim's assertion of winning one in each year.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim isn't fully supported by the table because while it holds true for 2010, it fails for 2011. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Traino was nominated twice in both 2010 and 2011, winning one each year. The table shows two nominations and a win in 2010, but only nominations in 2011 with no wins.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says that Jerry Traino won a total of 2 awards: one for \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and another for \"nick uk's funniest person.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find any entries related to these awards.\n\nStarting with the first row, it's from 2009, Teen Choice Awards, category is \"choice tv actor: comedy\" for work \"icarly,\" and the result was \"nominated.\" This isn't a win, so I can ignore this one.\n\nNext, the second row is from 2010, Australian Kids' Choice Awards, \"big kid award,\" same work, also nominated. Not relevant.\n\nThe third row in 2010: same year and award as the previous, but category is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" for \"icarly.\" The result here is \"won.\" So this counts as one win.\n\nMoving on to 2011, there are two entries. The first is from UK Kids' Choice Awards with category \"nick uk's funniest person,\" work \"icarly,\" and the result was \"won.\" That's another win.\n\nThe fourth row in 2011 is a nomination for \"funniest character\" at Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil, so not relevant here.\n\nThen, in 2012, it's a nomination again, so no award won there.\n\nLastly, in 2013, it's an Emmy nomination for \"tuff puppy,\" but the result is \"nominated.\"\n\nSo, from this table, I see two awards where Jerry Traino either won or was part of a winning ensemble. The first win is the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards for the \"lol award\" shared with others, and the second is the 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards for being the funniest person.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Jerry Traino won two awards as stated is correct. \n\nNow, I'll note the relevant cells from the table. The first win is in row index 2 (third row) under columns \"award,\" \"category,\" and \"result.\" The second win is in row index 3 (fourth row) with the same columns.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should be TRUE with the specified relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"In 2010, Jerry Traino was nominated for the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Award in 2 different categories.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Year**: 2010\n2. **Awards Event**: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards\n3. **Nominee**: Jerry Traino\n4. **Nominations**: In two different categories\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by filtering the rows to find entries from 2010 related to the Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n\n- The second row (index 1) shows \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\" with category \"big kid award\" and result \"nominated.\"\n- The third row (index 2) also mentions \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\" but under the category \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" with the result \"won.\"\n\nSo, there are two entries for 2010 in this specific award event. Each entry represents a different category: \"big kid award\" and \"lol award.\" This means Jerry Traino was indeed nominated in two different categories.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that both of these entries pertain to Jerry Traino.

It seems like it's trying to say that iCarly was nominated ten times as many awards as it actually won. So, we're looking at whether the number of nominations is ten times the number of wins.\n\nFirst, let me look through the table and count how many times \"icarly\" was nominated versus how many times it won awards.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. 2009: Teen Choice Awards, Comedy Actor. Result: Nominated.\n2. 2010: Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award. Result: Nominated.\n3. 2010: Same event, LOL Award (shared).

Result: Nominated.\n6. 2012: Kids' Choice Awards, Favorite TV Sidekick. Result: Nominated.\n7. 2013: Daytime Emmys, Outstanding Performer in Animated Program. Work is \"tuff puppy.\" So this row isn't about iCarly.\n\nSo, let's count the nominations and wins specifically for iCarly:\n\nNominations:\n- 2009\n- 2010 (Big Kid)\n- 2011 (Funniest Character)\n- 2012\n\nThat's 4 nominations.\n\nWins:\n- 2010 (LOL Award)\n- 2011 (Funniest Person)\n\nThat's 2 wins.\n\nNow, the claim says that iCarly was nominated ten times as many awards as it won. So, according to this, we have 4 nominations and 2 wins. The ratio is 2:1, not 10:1. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- 2009: iCarly, Nominated.\n- 2010: Two entries for Australian Kids' Choice; one won (LOL), one nominated (Big Kid).\n- 2011: One win in UK and a nomination in Brazil.\n- 2012: Nominated again.\n- 2013: Not iCarly.\n\nSo, yeah, total nominations are 4 and wins are 2. The ratio is 2:1, not 10:1. So the claim is definitely false.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only counting the relevant rows for iCarly.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is given in HTML format, and the claim provided is \"tuff be the only show nominate\". I need to parse the table, check each row against the claim, and then decide if the statement holds true based on the data.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"tuff\" being the only show that was nominated. So, the claim implies two things: that there's a show named \"Tuff\" (maybe case-insensitive) in the table and that it's the sole nominee across all categories.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns: year, award, category, work, result. Each row represents an entry where someone or something was nominated or won an award. The relevant columns for this claim would likely be 'work' (to identify which show) and 'result' (to check if it's a nomination).\n\nNow, let me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Year 2009, Award is Teen Choice Awards, Category is \"Choice TV Actor: Comedy\", Work is \"icarly\", Result is \"nominated\".\n   - Work here is icarly, not Tuff. So this doesn't relate to the claim.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Year 2010, Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award, work icarly, nominated.\n   - Again, same as above; work is icarly.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Same year and award as row 1, but category \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\", work icarly, result won.\n   - Work is still icarly, so this doesn't affect the claim about Tuff.\n\n4. **Row 3**: 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards, Nick UK's Funniest Person, work icarly, result won.\n   - Still icarly; no mention of Tuff here.\n\n5. **Row 4**: 2011 Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil, Funniest Character, work icarly, nominated.\n   - Work is icarly again.\n\n6. **Row 5**: 2012 Kids' Choice Awards, Favorite TV Sidekick, work icarly, nominated.\n   - Again, icarly; no Tuff here yet.\n\n7. **Row 6**: 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards, Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program, work tuff puppy, result nominated.\n   - This is the first mention of \"tuff puppy\" under the 'work' column. So this row is relevant because it's a nomination for Tuff Puppy.\n\nSo, from the table, only one entry is related to Tuff Puppy, and that's in 2013 where it was nominated. Now, the claim says Tuff is the \"only show nominate\". But wait, looking at all other rows, all have work as icarly with various results, including multiple nominations.\n\nTherefore, the table shows multiple nominations for icarly across different years and awards, plus one nomination for Tuff Puppy in 2013. So if the claim is that Tuff is the only show to be nominated, that's not true because icarly has several nominations as well. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo confirm, let me list out all the 'work' entries and their results:\n\n- icarly: 2009 (nominated), 2010 (nominated and won in another category), 2011 (won and nominated), 2012 (nominated)\n- Tuff Puppy: 2013 (nominated)\n\nSo, there are multiple shows (icarly and tuff puppy) with nominations. Therefore, the claim that \"tuff be the only show nominate\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be all rows where 'work' is either icarly or Tuff Puppy and their corresponding results to see if they were nominated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Jerry Traino's nominations and wins is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Jerry Traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win both in each year.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim step by step.\n\n1. **Nominations in 2010**: The claim says Jerry was nominated for two awards in 2010.\n   - Looking at the table, I'll check all rows with the year 2010.\n   - There are two entries for 2010:\n     - First row (index 1): Award is \"2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards\", category \"Big Kid Award\", work \"iCarly\", result \"nominated\".\n     - Second row (index 2): Same award, different category \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\", same work, but result is \"won\".\n   - So in 2010, Jerry was nominated once and won another. The claim mentions nominations for two awards, so this seems to fit.\n\n2. **Nominations in 2011**: The claim states he was nominated for two awards that year.\n   - Checking the rows with year 2011:\n     - Third row (index 3): Award \"2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards\", category \"Nick UK's funniest person\", result \"won\".\n     - Fourth row (index 4): Award \"Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil\", category \"funniest character\", result \"nominated\".\n   - Here, in 2011, he was nominated once and won another. The claim says he was nominated for two awards each year, but actually, only one nomination exists in 2011.\n\n3. **Wins in both years**: The claim also states that he won both awards each year.\n   - In 2010, he won the LOL Award and was nominated for the Big Kid Award. So he didn't win both.\n   - In 2011, he won one award and was nominated for another. Again, not both.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any mention of Jerry Traino in the table. The work column lists \"iCarly\" or \"Tuff Puppy,\" but the performer isn't explicitly named as Jerry Traino anywhere. Therefore, it's unclear if these entries are about him. \n\nConsidering all this, the claim that he was nominated for two awards each year and won both is incorrect based on the table data. Moreover, there's no explicit mention of Jerry Traino in the provided table, so his involvement isn't confirmed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Traino was nominated for two awards in 2010 and two in 2011, winning all each year. However, the table shows only one nomination in each year, with wins not occurring in both cases. Additionally, there's no confirmation of Jerry Traino being involved.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"jerry traino win a total of 4 award , 2 for lol award (shared with ensemble) and 2 for nick uk 's funniest person.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to identify any mentions related to Jerry Traino or awards he has won. The table lists several entries from different years and awards.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Year 2009, Teen Choice Awards, category \"Choice TV Actor: Comedy\" for work \"iCarly.\" Result is \"nominated.\"\n   - This doesn't mention Jerry Traino or any specific award categories mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Year 2010, Australian Kids' Choice Awards, category \"Big Kid Award,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"nominated.\"\n   - Again, no mention of Jerry Traino or specific awards from the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Year 2010, same awards as row 1, but category is \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble),\" work \"iCarly,\" and result \"won.\"\n   - This is relevant because it mentions the LOL Award which the claim refers to. It's a win, so that's one award.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Year 2011, UK Kids' Choice Awards, category \"Nick UK's Funniest Person,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"won.\"\n   - This is relevant as it mentions the specific award from the claim and it was won. So another award for Jerry Traino.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Year 2011, Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil, category \"Funniest Character,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"nominated.\"\n   - Not related to the awards mentioned in the claim.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Year 2012, Kids' Choice Awards, category \"Favorite TV Sidekick,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"nominated.\"\n   - Doesn't relate to the specific awards in the claim.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Year 2013, Daytime Emmy Awards, category \"Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program,\" work \"Tuff Puppy,\" result \"nominated.\"\n   - Not relevant to the claim as it's a different award and work.\n\nNow, let's tally up the awards won:\n\n- **LOL Award (shared with ensemble)**: Only one win in 2010 (Row 2).\n- **Nick UK's Funniest Person**: One win in 2011 (Row 3).\n\nSo, there are only two awards won by Jerry Traino according to the table. The claim states he won four awards, with two in each category mentioned. However, the table shows only one award in each of those categories, and both were wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it suggests a total of four awards (two in each category) when in reality, there's only one win for each category mentioned, totaling two awards instead of four.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 2008 jerry traino be nominate for the 2008 australian kids' choice award in 2 different category.\" Hmm, first, I notice that the years mentioned are 2008 and 2009. So, my first step is to check if there's any entry in the table related to 2008.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- The first row is for 2009.\n- Then 2010 appears twice.\n- Followed by 2011, 2011 again, and 2012.\n  \nI don't see any entries for 2008 in the table. So right away, that's a red flag because if there are no rows for 2008, it can't support claims about events happening that year.\n\nNext, let me check who is involved. The claim mentions \"jerry traino,\" but looking through the 'work' column, all entries are related to \"icarly\" except one in 2013 which is for \"tuff puppy.\" There's no mention of Jerry Traino anywhere in the table.\n\nAdditionally, the award mentioned is the \"australian kids' choice awards.\" I see that there's a 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards listed, but not for 2008. The claim refers to two different categories in 2008, but since there are no entries for that year, it's impossible to verify.\n\nTherefore, the table doesn't have any information supporting the claim about 2008, Jerry Traino, or nominations in two categories. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any entries from 2008, nor is there any mention of Jerry Traino or the Australian Kids' Choice Awards for that year. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
