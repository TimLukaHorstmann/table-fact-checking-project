    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"both of kelly dullanty's loss have come in the first round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the table contains and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it seems to list fight results for someone named Kelly Dullanty. Each row represents a different match with details like result, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location.\n\nThe claim is about two losses both happening in the first round. So I need to check each loss entry in the table and see if they both occurred in round 1.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Result is \"loss\", record is 4-2. Opponent is Lance Wipf, method was KO via punch at PureCombat event. Round is 1. Location California. So this loss did happen in the first round.\n\n2. Second row: Another loss, record drops to 4-1. Opponent Matt Serra, submission by triangle choke at UFC 36. Event details again, round is 1. Nevada location. This loss also happened in the first round.\n\nWait a minute, that's two losses both in round 1. Are there more losses? Let me check if there are any other rows with \"loss\" result.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table: The third row is a win (4-0), fourth is another win (3-0), fifth is a win (2-0), and sixth is a first win (1-0). So only the first two rows are losses, both in round 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both of Kelly Dullanty's losses came in the first round is TRUE. The relevant cells are the \"round\" column for each loss row.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two losses by Kelly Dullanty, both occurring in the first round.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim about Kelly Dullanty's fight record. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim states. It says, \"kelly dullanty have an overall record of 4 - 2, by win their first 4 and then lose the rest.\" So, breaking this down, the overall record should be 4 wins and 2 losses. Additionally, it claims that Kelly won her first four fights and then lost the remaining two.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there are six rows, each representing a different fight. Each row has details like result (win or loss), record after the fight, opponent, method, event, round, and location.\n\nI'll start by examining the 'record' column to see how Kelly's wins and losses add up. The first row shows a record of 4 - 2 with a loss to Lance Wipf via KO. That means after this fight, she had four wins and two losses. But wait, if her overall record is 4-2, that suggests she has six fights in total. Let me check the other rows.\n\nThe second row shows a record of 4 - 1 with a loss to Matt Serra via submission. Then, the next three rows are all wins: against Nuri Shakir (record becomes 4-0), Rudy Vallederas (3-0), and Duane Ludwig (2-0). The last row is another win against Shad Smith, bringing her record to 1-0.\n\nWait a minute, this seems confusing. If each fight updates the record, starting from 0-0, then the first win would be 1-0, the second 2-0, and so on. Let me reconstruct the sequence:\n\nLooking at the records in order:\n1. After the first row: 4 - 2 (loss)\n2. Second row: 4 - 1 (another loss)\n3. Third row: 4 - 0 (win)\n4. Fourth row: 3 - 0 (win)\n5. Fifth row: 2 - 0 (win)\n6. Sixth row: 1 - 0 (win)\n\nThis doesn't make sense because the record should increment with each fight, not decrease. It seems like the 'record' column might represent her overall record at that point in time, but it's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the 'record' column. Let me look again. The first row has a loss and shows 4-2 as the record. That would mean she had four wins and two losses up to that point. Then, the second row shows a loss with a record of 4-1, which doesn't add up because if she had four wins and one loss before this fight, losing again should make it four wins and two losses.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding how the 'record' is presented. Alternatively, perhaps each row represents a different event in her career, but the records don't follow sequentially. Maybe the table isn't ordered chronologically?\n\nWait, looking at the events: the first event is PureCombat - Bring The Pain, then UFC 36, followed by IFC WC 13, and so on. It seems like these are different events in her career. So perhaps each row represents a specific fight, but the 'record' column shows her overall record after that fight.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me go through each row:\n\n- First fight: loss to Lance Wipf, record 4-2. That would mean before this fight, she had four wins and one loss (since now it's 4-2).\n- Second fight: loss to Matt Serra, record 4-1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if she lost again, her losses should increase.\n- Third fight: win against Nuri Shakir, record 4-0. That would mean before this fight, she had three wins and zero losses? Or is the 'record' cumulative?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching it wrong. Let's instead count all the wins and losses in the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Loss: opponent Lance Wipf\n2. Loss: opponent Matt Serra\n3. Win: Nuri Shakir\n4. Win: Rudy Vallederas\n5. Win: Duane Ludwig\n6. Win: Shad Smith\n\nSo, that's four wins and two losses in total. So her overall record is indeed 4-2.\n\nNow, the claim also states that she won her first four fights and then lost the rest. Let's see:\n\nIf we order the fights chronologically, which they seem to be based on events, the first fight was a loss (record 4-2), second fight another loss (record 4-1). Then wins follow.\n\nBut wait, that would mean her first two fights were losses, not wins. So she didn't win her first four fights; instead, she lost her first two and then won the next four. But according to the table, the last four are all wins except the first two.\n\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Loss (Lance Wipf) \u2192 Record 4-2\nRow 2: Loss (Matt Serra) \u2192 Record 4-1\nRow 3: Win (Nuri Shakir) \u2192 Record 4-0\nRow 4: Win (Rudy Vallederas) \u2192 Record 3-0? That doesn't make sense. The record after each win should increment the wins.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the 'record' column isn't cumulative but represents her overall career record at the time of that fight. So, for example, when she fought Lance Wipf and lost, her overall record was 4-2, meaning before this fight, she had four wins and one loss.\n\nThen fighting Matt Serra, another loss, so her record becomes 4-2 (since she already had four wins and two losses after the first fight? That doesn't add up because losing again would make it five losses. This is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row's 'record' is just a typo or misrepresentation. Maybe they meant that at the time of the event, her record was 4-2, regardless of previous fights. But that still doesn't clarify the sequence.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's ignore the 'record' column for a moment and just count wins and losses from the 'result' column.\n\nIn the table:\n- Result is win or loss.\n- There are four wins (rows 3,4,5,6) and two losses (rows1,2).\n\nSo total record is indeed 4-2. Now, regarding the sequence: if the first two fights were losses, then she lost her first two fights and won the next four. But the claim says she won her first four and then lost the rest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because according to the table, she lost her first two fights and then won the subsequent four. So she didn't win the first four; instead, she lost the first two.\n\nThis contradicts the claim that she won her first four fights. Therefore, the statement in the claim is false based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kelly Dullanty has an overall record of 4-2, having won her first four fights and then lost the remaining two. However, upon analyzing the table, we observe:\n\n1. **Overall Record**: The table shows six fights with four wins and two losses, confirming her overall record as 4-2.\n   \n2. **Sequence of Fights**:\n   - First fight: Loss to Lance Wipf\n   - Second fight: Loss to Matt Serra\n   - Third fight: Win against Nuri Shakir\n   - Fourth fight: Win against Rudy Vallederas\n   - Fifth fight: Win against Duane Ludwig\n   - Sixth fight: Win against Shad Smith\n\nThis sequence indicates that Kelly lost her first two fights and won the subsequent four. Therefore, she did not win her first four fights as claimed; instead, she lost her initial two matches.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is incorrect based on the provided data. Kelly Dullanty's record is 4-2, but she lost her first two fights before achieving consecutive wins in the next four matches.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{The claim is false}}$",

The claim states: \"2 of kelly dullanty 's win be by decision , and each last at least 3 round.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the table and check each row where the result is a win. Looking through the table:\n\n1. **Row 2**: Win against Nuri Shakir via decision in round 4.\n2. **Row 3**: Win against Rudy Vallederas via tko, so not by decision.\n3. **Row 4**: Win against Duane Ludwig via decision in round 3.\n4. **Row 5**: Win against Shad Smith via tko (strikes), so not by decision.\n\nSo there are two wins by decision: rows 2 and 4.\n\nNext, I need to check if each of these decisions lasted at least 3 rounds.\n\n- Row 2: The event was in round 4.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It says that in two of Kelly's fights, the outcome was decided by a technical knockout (TKO) via strikes. So, we're looking for two rows in the table where the method column is \"tko  (strikes)\" and the result is either a win or loss.\n\nLooking at the HTML table structure, each row represents a fight with details like result, record, opponent, method, etc. The relevant columns here are 'res' and 'method'.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for any instances where the method was a TKO via strikes.\n\nRow 0:\n- Result: loss\n- Method: ko (punch)\nNot matching.\n\nRow 1:\n- Result: loss\n- Method: submission (triangle choke)\nNope.\n\nRow 2:\n- Result: win\n- Method: decision\nDoesn't fit.\n\nRow 3:\n- Result: win\n- Method: tko\nBut the method is just 'tko', not specifically 'strikes'.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"kelly's third win come against rudy vallederas by tko , but outside of the typical round\"\n\nFirst, let's identify the key points from the claim:\n1. It's about Kelly's third win.\n2. The opponent was Rudy Vallederas.\n3. The method of victory was TKO.\n4. The fight occurred outside of the typical round.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to find where Kelly won against Rudy Vallederas with a TKO result and check if it happened outside a standard round number.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 0: Loss to Lance Wipf via KO.\n- Row 1: Loss to Matt Serra via submission.\n- Row 2: Win against Nuri Shakir by decision in Round 4.\n- Row 3: Win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO. The round is listed as \"n/a\".\n- Row 4: Win against Duane Ludwig by decision in Round 3.\n- Row 5: First win against Shad Smith by TKO in Round 1.\n\nSince the claim mentions the third win, I need to ensure which row corresponds to that. Looking at the 'record' column:\n- Each win increases the record from right to left. So Row 2 has a record of 4-0, indicating this is Kelly's fourth win? Wait, no\u2014records are listed as wins-losses. So starting from the bottom:\n\nRow 5: 1-0 (first win)\nRow 4: 2-0 (second win)\nRow 3: 3-0 (third win)\nRow 2: 4-0 (fourth win)\n\nSo Row 3 is indeed Kelly's third win, against Rudy Vallederas via TKO.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Kelly Dullanty is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"kelly dullanty have an overall record of 4 - 2 , by win their first 4 and then lose the rest on event kotc 6  - road warrior\". Hmm, I notice that there are a couple of typos here\u2014probably should be \"has\" instead of \"have\", and maybe \"kotc 6 - Road Warriors\" to match the table. But since this is just a claim, I'll proceed with the information given.\n\nNext, looking at the table, it's an HTML table with columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location. There are six rows of data here. Let me go through each row and see what each one tells us about Kelly Dullanty's fights.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. The first row says \"loss\", record is 4-2, opponent Lance Wipf, method KO (punch), event PureCombat - Bring the Pain, round 1, location California, US. So this seems like a loss in his first fight here.\nWait, but if his overall record is 4-2, that would mean he has more wins than losses. Let me check each row's result.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- Row 0: loss\n- Row 1: loss\n- Rows 2,3,4,5: win\n\nSo actually, there are four wins and two losses. That matches the overall record of 4-2 as per the claim.\n\nNow, the claim says he won his first four fights and then lost the rest on a specific event called \"kotc 6 - road warrior\". Let's see if that aligns with the table.\n\nWait, looking at the events:\nRow 5: win against Shad Smith in event kotc3\nRow 4: win against Duane Ludwig in event kotc6 (Road Warriors)\nRow 3 and 2 are from IFC WC13\n\nRows 0 and 1 are losses against Lance Wipf and Matt Serra, events PureCombat and UFC36.\n\nWait, so the claim says he won his first four fights. But looking at the table, actually, the first two rows (rows 0 and 1) are losses, then the next four rows (2-5) are wins. That's the opposite of what the claim states. So according to the table, he had two losses before any wins? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait no, wait a second\u2014the record in each row is cumulative. Let me check each row's record:\n\nRow 0: loss (record 4-2) \u2014 so this must be his sixth fight.\nRow 1: loss (record 4-1)\nRow 2: win (4-0)\nRow3: win (3-0)\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the 'record' column shows the fighter's record after each fight.\n\nSo starting from row5 to row0:\n\nRow5: win, record is 1-0 \u2014 so this was his first fight.\nRow4: win, record 2-0\nRow3: win, 3-0\nRow2: win, 4-0\nRow1: loss, 4-1 (so that's his fifth fight)\nRow0: loss, 4-2 (sixth fight)\n\nSo the order of fights is from row5 to row0. So in the table, row5 is first fight, row4 second, etc., up to row0 being last.\n\nTherefore, his record progression is:\n\n1st fight: win (record 1-0)\n2nd: win (2-0)\n3rd: win (3-0)\n4th: win (4-0)\n5th: loss (4-1)\n6th: loss (4-2)\n\nSo in the claim, it says he won his first four and then lost the rest. That matches because first four fights are wins, fifth and sixth are losses.\n\nNow, where did these losses occur? The last two rows, row0 and row1, have events PureCombat and UFC36, respectively. So according to the table, both of these losses occurred in different events: row1 is UFC36, and row0 is PureCombat.\n\nThe claim says that he lost the rest on event \"kotc 6 - road warrior\". But looking at the table, his last two fights were not in kotc6. The only fight in kotc6 is row4 (which was a win). So the losses occurred in different events, not in kotc6.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that he lost both on the same event, when in reality they were separate events.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Overall record: 4-2 \u2014 correct.\n- Won first four fights: correct as per table (rows5-2).\n- Lost the rest (fights five and six) on event kotc6 - road warrior: incorrect. The losses were in different events, not in kotc6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but also has inaccuracies regarding where the losses occurred.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any of the losses are in kotc6. Looking back:\n\nRow4's event is kotc6 - Road Warriors and it was a win. Rows0 and1 have events PureCombat and UFC36 as losses. So no, he didn't lose on kotc6; he won there.\n\nHence, the claim that he lost both subsequent fights on kotc6 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the overall statement has some truth but also inaccuracies.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kelly Dullanty has an overall record of 4-2, achieved by winning his first four fights and then losing the rest on the event \"kotc 6 - road warrior.\" \n\nFrom the table analysis:\n\n1. **Overall Record**: Correct. The cumulative record shows he ends with 4 wins and 2 losses.\n\n2. **Winning First Four Fights**: Correct. His first four fights (rows5-2) resulted in wins, leading to a 4-0 record before his fifth fight.\n\n3. **Losing the Rest on Event \"kotc 6 - road warrior\"**: Incorrect. The last two fights (rows1 and0) were losses, but they occurred at events PureCombat and UFC36, not at kotc6. His only fight at kotc6 was a win in his fourth fight.\n\n**Conclusion**: While Kelly Dullanty did achieve a 4-2 record with the first four wins, he did not lose both subsequent fights on the event \"kotc 6 - road warrior.\" Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but contains inaccuracies regarding the events where the losses occurred.",

This is a knockout but not specifically a technical knockout via strikes.\n2. **Row 1**: Method is \"submission\". Not relevant here.\n3. **Row 2**: Method is \"decision\". Doesn't involve a knockout.\n4. **Row 3**: Method is \"tko\". This could be a technical knockout, but the description doesn't specify it's via strikes.\n5. **Row 4**: Method is \"decision\". Again, not relevant.\n6. **Row 5**: Method is \"tko (strikes)\". This fits as a technical knockout via strikes.\n\nSo, only row 5 explicitly mentions a tko via strikes. Row 3 mentions a tko without specifying the method, but it doesn't match the specific claim about strikes.\n\nNext, checking the events: The event in row 5 is \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\". None of the other rows have this event. Therefore, only one fight matches both the method and the event criteria.\n\nSince there's only one such occurrence, the claim that two fights were decided by a technical knockout via strikes at the same event isn't supported by the table. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a claim about Kelly Dullanty's fight records from the provided HTML table is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"2 of kelly dullanty  's win be by decision  , and each last at least 3 round in location nevada  , united state.\" So there are two main conditions here:\n\n1. Kelly Dullanty has exactly 2 wins by decision.\n2. Each of these wins lasted at least 3 rounds, and both occurred in Nevada, United States.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to see if it supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the 'res' column for wins:\n- Row 0: loss\n- Row 1: loss\n- Row 2: win (decision)\n- Row 3: win (tko)\n- Row 4: win (decision)\n- Row 5: win (tko)\n\nWait, that's four wins in total. But the claim says exactly two wins by decision.\n\nLooking at 'method' for each win:\n- Row 2: method is \"decision\" \u2192 this is one.\n- Row 4: method is \"decision\" \u2192 another.\nSo, there are two wins by decision as per rows 2 and 4.\n\nNow, checking the rounds for these wins. The claim says each lasted at least 3 rounds:\n- For row 2 (win vs Nuri Shakir): round is 4. That's more than 3, so it meets the condition.\n- For row 4 (win vs Duane Ludwig): round is 3. Exactly 3, which also meets the condition.\n\nNow checking the location for these wins:\n- Row 2: Location is California, United States.\n- Row 4: Location is Michigan, United States.\n\nBoth are not in Nevada, so the claim that both occurred in Nevada is false.\n\nTherefore, while there are two wins by decision and each lasted at least 3 rounds, they didn't occur in Nevada. Hence, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step and check against each relevant part of the table.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"kelly 's be the only 1 never have third win come against rudy vallederas by tko , but outside of the typical round\"\n\nI think there might be a typo in the name. Maybe it's supposed to be \"Kelly\" instead of \"kelly 's\". Also, the phrase \"be the only 1 never have third win\" is a bit unclear. I'll assume it means Kelly has a third win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO but not in the typical round.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The relevant columns are res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round.\n- We need to find if there's a row where the opponent is Rudy Vallederas and result is a win via TKO. Then check the round number.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent Lance Wipf, result loss. Not relevant.\n\nRow 1: Opponent Matt Serra, result loss. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Opponent Nuri Shakir, result win by decision. Record is 4-0 here. Wait, that's the fourth fight? Or does each row represent a single fight?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at all wins to see if Kelly has three wins and check the third one.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 2: Win against Nuri Shakir via decision in round 4. Record is 4-0.\n\nRow 3: Win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO. The record here is 3-0, which implies this was the third fight. Wait, but row 2 has a higher fight count (4-0) than row 3 (3-0). That doesn't make sense because each subsequent fight should increase the win count.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to sort the fights in order of when they happened. The rows are ordered from most recent to earliest? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the events and years might help, but there's no year given. Alternatively, the record progression could indicate the order. \n\nRow 5: Win against Shad Smith via TKO. Record is 1-0.\n\nRow 4: Win against Duane Ludwig via decision. Record is 2-0.\n\nRow 3: Win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO. Record is 3-0.\n\nRow 2: Win against Nuri Shakir via decision. Record is 4-0.\n\nSo, the order of fights from earliest to latest (assuming each row is in chronological order) would be:\n\n5th row: 1st fight\n4th row: 2nd fight\n3rd row: 3rd fight\n2nd row: 4th fight\n\nWait, but rows are listed as 0-5. So row 5 is the first fight.\n\nSo row 5: Win against Shad Smith, record 1-0.\nRow 4: Next win, record 2-0.\nRow 3: Next win, record 3-0 (TKO vs Rudy Vallederas).\nRow 2: Then a decision win in round 4 to make it 4-0.\n\nSo the third fight is against Rudy Vallederas via TKO. The claim says \"third win come against rudy vallederas by tko\". So that part checks out.\n\nNow, does this fight happen outside of the typical round? Looking at row 3's 'round' column: it's listed as 'n / a'. That probably means no round was completed or not applicable. So the TKO happened outside the usual rounds, maybe in the first round or even before the rounds started.\n\nSo according to the table, Kelly did have their third win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO and that fight didn't go into the typical rounds (as indicated by 'n / a'). \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
