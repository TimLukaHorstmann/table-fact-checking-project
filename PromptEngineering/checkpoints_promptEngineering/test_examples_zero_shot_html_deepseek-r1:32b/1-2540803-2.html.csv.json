    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"vegetable shortening (hydrogenate) and suet be only material with less than 100 g of fat.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It's saying that among all the materials listed in the table, only vegetable shortening (hydrogenated) and suet have less than 100 grams of total fat.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different oil or fat product, with columns for 'Unnamed: 0' which is the name, 'total fat', and others. The relevant column here is 'total fat'.\n\nI'll go through each row to check their 'total fat' values:\n\n1. Sunflower oil: 100 g\n2. Soybean oil: 100 g\n3. Canola oil: 100 g\n4. Olive oil: 100 g\n5. Corn oil: 100 g\n6. Peanut oil: 100 g\n7. Rice bran oil: 100 g\n8. Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): 71 g\n9. Lard: 100 g\n10. Suet: 94 g\n\nSo, the 'total fat' column shows that most entries have exactly 100 grams except for vegetable shortening (71g) and suet (94g). \n\nWait a minute, suet is listed as 94g, which is less than 100. However, vegetable shortening is at 71g, also below 100.\n\nThe claim says that these two are the only materials with less than 100g of fat. But looking again, all other entries have exactly 100g except for suet and vegetable shortening. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true because no other entries fall below 100g besides those two.\n\nWait, but in the row for 'vegetable shortening', it's written as \"71 g\" under total fat, which is indeed less than 100. Suet is also 94g, so that's correct.\n\nBut wait another thought: The claim says \"only material with less than 100g\". Are there any other materials below 100g? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- sunflower oil: 100g\n- soybean oil: 100g\n- canola oil: 100g\n- olive oil: 100g\n- corn oil: 100g\n- peanut oil: 100g\n- rice bran oil: 100g\n- vegetable shortening:71g (only one under)\n- lard:100g\n- suet:94g\n\nSo yes, only these two are below 100. Hence, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because only vegetable shortening and suet have less than 100 grams of fat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim focuses on total fat content being less than 100g for two specific materials: vegetable shortening (hydrogenated) and suet.\n\n2. **Check Each Row's Total Fat:**\n   - Vegetable shortening: 71g\n   - Suet:94g\n\n3. **Compare with Other Entries:** All other entries in the 'total fat' column are exactly 100g except for these two, confirming they are the only ones under 100g.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"total fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"total fat\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"suet is the only material to have a smoke point\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me carefully analyze the information provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be the name of each oil), total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and smoke point.\n\nThe claim is about \"suet\" being the only material with a smoke point. So, I need to check two things: whether suet has a smoke point entry in the table, and whether any other materials also have a smoke point listed.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Sunflower oil: The smoke point column says \"degree\". Not specific but indicates there's an entry.\n2. Soybean oil: Same as above.\n3. Canola oil: \"degree\" again.\n4. Olive oil: \"degree\".\n5. Corn oil: \"degree\".\n6. Peanut oil: \"degree\".\n7. Rice bran oil: \"degree\".\n8. Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): \"degree\".\n9. Lard: \"degree\".\n10. Suet: The smoke point is listed as \"200degree (400degree)\".\n\nSo, suet does have a specific numerical value for the smoke point, while others just say \"degree\". Now, I need to see if any other materials besides suet have a numerical value or at least an entry in the smoke point column. \n\nWait, actually, all entries under smoke point are either \"degree\" or have some numbers. The first nine rows (excluding suet) all list \"degree\", which might indicate that they do have smoke points but perhaps not specified numerically here. Suet is the only one with a numerical value. However, the presence of any entry in the smoke point column for others would mean they also have smoke points.\n\nSo, if the claim is that suet is the only material to have a smoke point, it's false because all materials listed have some form of smoke point indicated (even if just as \"degree\"). Therefore, the claim isn't true; multiple materials have smoke points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that suet is the only material with a smoke point. However, examining the table shows that every oil and fat listed has an entry in the smoke point column, either as \"degree\" or specific values like for suet. Therefore, the claim is false because other materials also have smoke points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sunflower oil has the highest polyunsaturated fat of any of the material\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be the oil names), total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and smoke point. The rows list different oils with their respective values for each column.\n\nThe claim is about sunflower oil having the highest polyunsaturated fat. So I need to focus on the \"polyunsaturated fat\" column. Let me go through each row in that column.\n\nLooking at the first row (row index 0), it's sunflower oil, and under polyunsaturated fat, it says \"69 g (4 g in high oleic variety)\". Wait, that seems a bit confusing. So is the value 69g or 4g? I think the higher number might be the standard, and the lower one is for a specific variety. But to confirm, I should compare all values.\n\nNext row (index 1) is soybean oil with 58g polyunsaturated fat. Then canola oil at 28g. Olive oil is 11g, corn oil 55g, peanut oil 32g, rice bran oil 37g, vegetable shortening has 37g (but it's hydrogenated so maybe different), lard with 11g, and suet at 3g.\n\nWait a second, sunflower oil's polyunsaturated fat is listed as 69g. But let me check all other oils to see if any have higher than that. Soybean is 58g which is less than 69g. Corn oil is 55g, also less. The only one close is soybean at 58, but still lower. So yes, sunflower oil's standard value of 69g seems to be the highest.\n\nBut wait, in the sunflower oil row, it mentions two numbers: 69g and 4g. Does that mean there are different varieties? The higher number is 69g, which is more than any other oil except perhaps soybean's 58g. So if we consider the standard variety, sunflower oil does have the highest.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other oils have higher values when considering their high oleic or other varieties. Looking at canola oil, it's 28g, and corn is 55g. The only other one that might be higher is soybean at 58g, but that's still less than 69g.\n\nSo yes, sunflower oil has the highest polyunsaturated fat in its standard form compared to all others listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as sunflower oil has the highest polyunsaturated fat content of 69g.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about sunflower oil and soybean oil is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"sunflower oil have 5 g less saturated fat with 11 g than soybean oil with 16 g.\" So, the claim is stating that sunflower oil has 11 grams of saturated fat, which is 5 grams less than soybean oil's 16 grams.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The table lists various oils and their nutritional information across different columns: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be the name of the oil), total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and smoke point.\n\nI need to find the relevant rows for sunflower oil and soybean oil. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row under the header is sunflower oil.\n- Looking at the 'saturated fat' column in that row: it shows 11 g. So, sunflower oil has 11 grams of saturated fat.\n\nThen, I'll check soybean oil's row. Soybean oil is the second row in the table. The 'saturated fat' entry here is 16 grams.\n\nNow, comparing these two values: sunflower oil has 11g and soybean oil has 16g. The difference between them is indeed 5 grams (16 - 11 = 5). Therefore, the claim that sunflower oil has 5 grams less saturated fat than soybean oil is correct.\n\nI should also note down the relevant cells from the table to support this conclusion. For sunflower oil, it's the first row and the 'saturated fat' column. For soybean oil, it's the second row under the same column.\n\nSo, compiling this information into the required JSON format, I'll mark the answer as TRUE and list the relevant cells with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"saturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"saturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"suet have the fewest gram of polyunsaturated fat out of any of the material\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is saying that suet has the least amount of polyunsaturated fat compared to all other materials listed in the table. So, I need to look at the \"polyunsaturated fat\" column for each row and see if suet indeed has the lowest value there.\n\nFirst, let me find where suet is located in the table. Looking at the rows, I see that the last row before the one with vegetable shortening (row 8) is lard, and then the next row (row 9) is suet. So, suet is in row index 9.\n\nNow, let's look at the \"polyunsaturated fat\" values for all materials:\n\n1. Sunflower oil: 69 g or 4 g depending on variety.\n2. Soybean oil: 58 g\n3. Canola oil: 28 g\n4. Olive oil: 11 g\n5. Corn oil: 55 g\n6. Peanut oil: 32 g\n7. Rice bran oil: 37 g\n8. Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): 37 g (but wait, the row for vegetable shortening is row index 7, and its polyunsaturated fat is listed as 37 g? Or maybe I need to check that again.\n9. Lard: 11 g\n10. Suet: 3 g\n\nWait a second, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 8 (lard): polyunsaturated fat is 11g.\n\nRow 9 (suet): polyunsaturated fat is 3g.\n\nSo suet has 3g of polyunsaturated fat, which seems to be the lowest among all the entries. Let me list all the values again to make sure:\n\n- Sunflower oil: either 69 or 4g depending on variety, but in the table it's listed as 69 g (with high oleic being 4g). So I think the main value is 69g.\n- Soybean oil: 58\n- Canola:28\n- Olive:11\n- Corn:55\n- Peanut:32\n- Rice bran:37\n- Vegetable shortening:37 (but wait, looking at row 8: it's vegetable shortening with 37g? Wait no, the last row is suet. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 9 because there are 10 rows after the header.\n\nSo:\n\n0: sunflower oil - polyunsaturated fat: 69g (with high oleic being 4g)\n1: soybean -58\n2: canola-28\n3: olive-11\n4: corn-55\n5: peanut-32\n6: rice bran-37\n7: vegetable shortening- the polyunsaturated fat is listed as 37g (the data says \"37 g (52%)\", so main value is 37)\n8: lard-11g\n9: suet-3g\n\nSo comparing all these:\n\n69, 58,28,11,55,32,37,37,11,3.\n\nThe smallest is 3g in suet. Next is 11g in olive oil and lard. So yes, suet has the fewest grams of polyunsaturated fat.\n\nWait, but looking again at sunflower oil: it's listed as 69g (with high oleic being 4g). Does that mean that sometimes it's lower? But the main value is 69, so I think for this claim, we consider the primary values unless specified otherwise. The claim just says \"suet have the fewest\", so comparing all entries, suet has 3g which is indeed the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is row index 9, column \"polyunsaturated fat\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that suet has the least polyunsaturated fat. By examining each entry in the table, suet's value of 3 grams is the smallest among all listed materials. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So I need to check each of these items in the table to see their total fat content.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are:\n- Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be the name of the material)\n- total fat\n- saturated fat\n- monounsaturated fat\n- polyunsaturated fat\n- smoke point\n\nSo, I need to focus on the \"total fat\" column for each relevant row.\n\nLet me go through each item mentioned:\n\n1. **Vegetable Shortening (Hydrogenated)**: In the table, under the row labeled \"vegetable shortening  ( hydrogenated )\", the total fat is listed as 71 g. This is less than 100 g, so this fits the claim.\n\n2. **Suet**: The suet row shows a total fat of 94 g. Again, that's under 100 grams, so this also meets the condition.\n\nNow, the claim says these two are among four materials with less than 100g.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"suet be 1 of 2 material to have a smoke point list\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim seems to state that suet is one of two materials listed in the table that have a smoke point value. So, I need to check if suet has a smoke point entry and also identify how many other materials share this characteristic.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which lists the oil types), total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and smoke point. Each row corresponds to a different oil or fat.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on the \"smoke point\" column for each row. Most of the rows under this column just say \"degree\", except for suet. Suet has an entry of \"200degree (400degree)\". That seems a bit odd, but it does have numerical values associated with degrees, which I assume refers to temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n\nNow, let me check each row:\n\n1. Sunflower oil: smoke point is \"degree\" \u2013 no number.\n2. Soybean oil: same as above.\n3. Canola oil: same.\n4. Olive oil: same.\n5. Corn oil: same.\n6. Peanut oil: same.\n7. Rice bran oil: same.\n8. Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): same.\n9. Lard: same.\n10. Suet: has \"200degree (400degree)\" \u2013 so two numerical values here.\n\nSo, looking at this, only suet has specific numbers in the smoke point column. All others just have the word \"degree\" without any numbers. Therefore, according to the table, only one material (suet) has a smoke point listed with actual numerical values. The claim says that suet is one of two materials with such a list, but from what I see, it's actually the only one.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't accurate because there aren't two materials with smoke points listed numerically; only suet does.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that suet is the only material with numerical values in the smoke point column.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"sunflower oil have the second highest polyunsaturated fat of any of the material\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the relevant information is in the table. The table has several rows with different oils and fats, each listing their total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and smoke point. Since the claim is about polyunsaturated fat, I should focus on that column.\n\nLooking at the \"polyunsaturated fat\" column:\n\n- Sunflower oil: 69 g (but there's a note saying in high oleic variety it's 4 g). Hmm, so does that mean 69 g or 4 g? The way it's written suggests that 69 g is the standard value and 4 g is for the high oleic version. So I think we should consider 69 g as the polyunsaturated fat content unless specified otherwise.\n\nNext, let me list all the values from the table:\n\n1. Sunflower oil: 69 g (poly)\n2. Soybean oil: 58 g\n3. Canola oil: 28 g\n4. Olive oil: 11 g\n5. Corn oil: 55 g\n6. Peanut oil: 32 g\n7. Rice bran oil: 37 g\n8. Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): 37 g (but the note says 37 g with 52%)\n9. Lard: 11 g\n10. Suet: 3 g\n\nWait, but looking at vegetable shortening, it's a bit confusing. The cell says \"37 g (52%)\". I think that refers to the percentage of polyunsaturated fat in the total fat, which is 71 g. So 52% of 71 g would be approximately 36.92 g, roughly 37 g. So it's consistent with the first part.\n\nNow, let me list all the polyunsaturated fats:\n\n- Sunflower oil: 69 g\n- Soybean oil: 58 g\n- Corn oil: 55 g\n- Rice bran oil: 37 g (matches both regular and hydrogenated)\n- Peanut oil: 32 g\n- Vegetable shortening: ~37 g\n- Canola oil: 28 g\n- Olive oil: 11 g\n- Lard: 11 g\n- Suet: 3 g\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nLooking at each row's polyunsaturated fat value:\n\n1. Sunflower oil: 69 g (normal) and 4 g (high oleic). So depending on variety, but I think in this context, unless specified otherwise, we take the main value which is 69 g.\n\n2. Soybean oil: 58 g\n3. Canola oil: 28 g\n4. Olive oil: 11 g\n5. Corn oil: 55 g\n6. Peanut oil: 32 g\n7. Rice bran oil: 37 g\n8. Vegetable shortening: 37 g (with 52% as part of the note)\n9. Lard: 11 g\n10. Suet: 3 g\n\nSo arranging these in descending order:\n\n- Sunflower oil: 69 g (highest)\n- Soybean oil: 58 g (second highest)\n- Corn oil: 55 g (third)\n- Rice bran oil and Vegetable shortening: both 37 g (fourth)\n- Peanut oil: 32 g\n- Canola oil: 28 g\n- Olive oil, Lard: 11 g each\n- Suet: 3 g\n\nSo the highest is sunflower at 69 g. The second highest would be soybean oil with 58 g.\n\nBut wait, the claim says sunflower has the second highest. That can't be right because soybean oil has higher polyunsaturated fat than corn oil and others after it.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in ordering. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Sunflower:69\n2. Soybean:58\n3. Corn:55\n4. Rice bran and Vegetable shortening:37 each\n5. Peanut:32\n6. Canola:28\n7. Olive, Lard:11\n8. Suet:3\n\nSo the order is correct. Sunflower has the highest at 69, then soybean at 58.\n\nTherefore, sunflower oil does not have the second highest; it's actually the highest. So the claim that it's second highest would be false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm considering all rows correctly. Are there any other oils with higher than soybean? No, soybean is 58, which is less than sunflower's 69. So sunflower is first, soybean is second. Therefore, the claim that sunflower has the second highest would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread something. Let me check again:\n\nSunflower oil: poly is 69 g (main value). Soybean:58. Corn:55. Rice bran and shortening:37. Peanut:32. Canola:28. Olive oil:11. Lard:11. Suet:3.\n\nSo in terms of order, from highest to lowest:\n\n69 (Sunflower), 58 (Soybean), 55 (Corn), 37 (Rice bran and shortening), 32 (Peanut), 28 (Canola), 11 (Olive, Lard), 3 (Suet).\n\nSo sunflower is first. The second highest is soybean at 58.\n\nTherefore, the claim that sunflower has the second highest is incorrect; it actually has the highest.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to consider all materials listed. Wait, maybe I missed something? Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 0: Sunflower oil: poly 69\nRow1: Soybean:58\nRow2:Canola:28\nRow3:Olive:11\nRow4:Corn:55\nRow5:Peanut:32\nRow6:Rice bran:37\nRow7:Vegetable shortening:37\nRow8:Lard:11\nRow9:Suet:3\n\nYes, that's correct. So sunflower is highest, soybean second.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because sunflower oil has the highest polyunsaturated fat content, not the second.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the vegetable shortening. Its value is 37 g, which is less than corn oil's 55 and soybean's 58. So yes, it fits into fourth place.\n\nTherefore, sunflower has the highest, so the claim that it's second is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that sunflower oil has the second highest polyunsaturated fat content. However, based on the table data, sunflower oil actually has the highest value at 69 g. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I think there's a mistake in the JSON. The second relevant cell should be row index 1, not row_1.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut according to the correct analysis, sunflower oil is first. So the relevant cells are those with polyunsaturated fat values.",

Sunflower oil is listed as the first row (row index 0), and soybean oil is the second row (row index 1).\n\nNext, I need to find the \"saturated fat\" values for each of them. For sunflower oil, the saturated fat is 11 g. Soybean oil has 16 g of saturated fat.\n\nThe claim says that sunflower oil has 5 grams more than soybean oil. But wait, 11g compared to 16g actually means soybean oil has 5g more. So the claim seems to be incorrect because sunflower oil has less saturated fat than soybean oil.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"saturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"saturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"suet have the highest gram of polyunsaturated fat out of any of the material\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that suet has the highest amount (in grams) of polyunsaturated fat compared to all other materials listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with different oils and fats, including sunflower oil, soybean oil, canola oil, olive oil, corn oil, peanut oil, rice bran oil, vegetable shortening (hydrogenated), lard, and suet. The relevant column here is \"polyunsaturated fat\".\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the polyunsaturated fat values:\n\n1. **Sunflower oil**: 69 g (but there's a note about high oleic variety having only 4g). However, since it's in parentheses and not specified as the primary value, I might consider both numbers.\n2. **Soybean oil**: 58 g\n3. **Canola oil**: 28 g\n4. **Olive oil**: 11 g\n5. **Corn oil**: 55 g\n6. **Peanut oil**: 32 g\n7. **Rice bran oil**: 37 g\n8. **Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated)**: The value is listed as 37g but with a percentage in parentheses, which I think refers to the composition, not grams.\n9. **Lard**: 11 g\n10. **Suet**: 3 g\n\nNow, comparing these values:\n\n- Sunflower oil has either 69g or 4g depending on variety. Assuming the standard value is 69g since it's listed first without any indication that 4g is the default.\n- Soybean:58\n- Corn:55\n- Canola:28\n- Olive:11\n- Peanut:32\n- Rice bran:37\n- Vegetable shortening:37 (though percentages are confusing, the number seems same as rice bran)\n- Lard:11\n- Suet:3\n\nSo, sunflower oil has 69g, soybean has 58g. So suet's 3g is much lower than these.\n\nWait, but in the table, for suet under \"polyunsaturated fat\" it says \"3 g (3%)\". So polyunsaturated fat is 3g. \n\nComparing to others:\n\nThe highest I see is sunflower oil with 69g. Even soybean at 58g is higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim that suet has the highest is clearly false because there are multiple oils with much higher polyunsaturated fat content.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for \"polyunsaturated fat\" across all rows show that suet's value of 3 grams is significantly lower than others like sunflower oil at 69 grams. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
