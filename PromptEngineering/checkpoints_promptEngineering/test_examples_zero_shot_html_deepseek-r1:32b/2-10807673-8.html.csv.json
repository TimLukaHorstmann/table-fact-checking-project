    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne outscore north melbourne by 22 points on 21 june 1941\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row of the table to find the game between South Melbourne and North Melbourne. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Richmond vs St Kilda\nRow 1: Hawthorn vs Melbourne\nRow 2: Collingwood vs Essendon\nRow 3: Carlton vs Fitzroy\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne \u2013 This is the relevant game.\nRow 5: Geelong vs Footscray\n\nSo, row index 4 contains the data for South Melbourne and North Melbourne.\n\nNext, I'll check the scores. The 'home team score' for South Melbourne is listed as 8.16 (64). In Australian rules football, scoring is in the format goals.behinds, where each goal is worth 6 points and each behind is worth 1 point. So, 8 goals would be 8*6 = 48 points, and 16 behinds would add 16 points, totaling 64.\n\nSimilarly, North Melbourne's score is 6.6 (42). That's 6*6=36 plus 6=42 points.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the point difference between South Melbourne and North Melbourne. South Melbourne scored 64 points, while North Melbourne scored 42. The difference is 64 - 42 = 22 points.\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne outscored North Melbourne by exactly 22 points on June 21, 1941. Since the table confirms this, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo support this conclusion, the relevant cells are:\n- The home team (South Melbourne) and their score.\n- The away team (North Melbourne) and their score.\n- The date of the match to ensure it's June 21, 1941.\n\nSo, I'll list these cells in the relevant_cells array with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"on 21 june 1941 the crowd be 5000 for 2 match during the 1941 vfl season.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the table data. Each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The date for all these matches is \"21 june 1941\", so they all happened on that day.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the crowd being 5000 for two matches and the date being 21 June 1941 during the 1941 VFL season. Since the table only includes matches from 21 June 1941, I'll focus on that.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Richmond vs St Kilda: Crowd is 6000.\n2. Hawthorn vs Melbourne: Crowd is 2000.\n3. Collingwood vs Essendon: Crowd is 6000.\n4. Carlton vs Fitzroy: Crowd is 4000.\n5. South Melbourne vs North Melbourne: Crowd is 5000.\n6. Geelong vs Footscray: Crowd is 5000.\n\nSo, the crowd numbers are as follows:\n- 5000 appears twice (rows 4 and 5).\n- Other crowds are 2000, 4000, 6000.\n\nThe claim states that there were two matches with a crowd of exactly 5000 on that date. From the table, I can see rows 4 and 5 have \"crowd\" as 5000 each. That's two matches meeting the condition.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'crowd' column in those two rows where the value is 5000. The row indices for these are 4 and 5 (since indexing starts at 0), but looking back:\n\nWait, let me double-check the row numbers. In the table, rows are indexed starting from 0.\n\n- Row 0: Richmond vs St Kilda - crowd 6000.\n- Row 1: Hawthorn vs Melbourne - crowd 2000.\n- Row 2: Collingwood vs Essendon - crowd 6000.\n- Row 3: Carlton vs Fitzroy - crowd 4000.\n- Row 4: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne - crowd 5000.\n- Row 5: Geelong vs Footscray - crowd 5000.\n\nSo, rows 4 and 5 have the required crowd numbers. Therefore, two matches on that day had a crowd of exactly 5000. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are row indices 4 and 5 under the 'crowd' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the total score for the home team in 6 match be 396\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the table represents. The table has six rows, each representing a different match. Each row includes information about the home team, their score, the away team, the away team's score, venue, crowd, and date. All matches are on the same date: 21 June 1941.\n\nThe claim mentions that the total score for the home teams across six matches is 396. My first thought is to check each home team's score in the table and sum them up to see if it equals 396.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Richmond vs St Kilda**: Home team score is 73.\n2. **Hawthorn vs Melbourne**: Home team score is 44.\n3. **Collingwood vs Essendon**: Home team score is 60.\n4. **Carlton vs Fitzroy**: Home team score is 77.\n5. **South Melbourne vs North Melbourne**: Home team score is 64.\n6. **Geelong vs Footscray**: Home team score is 78.\n\nWait, that's only six rows, so all matches are accounted for. Let me list these scores again to ensure I didn't miss any:\n\n- Richmond: 73\n- Hawthorn: 44\n- Collingwood: 60\n- Carlton: 77\n- South Melbourne: 64\n- Geelong: 78\n\nNow, adding them up step by step:\n\n73 (Richmond) + 44 (Hawthorn) = 117  \n117 + 60 (Collingwood) = 177  \n177 + 77 (Carlton) = 254  \n254 + 64 (South Melbourne) = 318  \n318 + 78 (Geelong) = 396\n\nSo, the total sum is indeed 396. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I should double-check each addition:\n\n- 73 + 44: Let's add 70+40=110 and 3+4=7 \u2192 Total 117.\n- 117 +60: 117+60=177.\n- 177 +77: 177+70=247, then +7=254.\n- 254 +64: 254+60=314, +4=318.\n- 318 +78: 318+70=388, +8=396.\n\nAll the additions check out correctly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also make sure that each relevant cell in the table contributes to this calculation. The column I need is \"home team score\" for each of the six rows. So, each row's \"home team score\" is a relevant cell.\n</think>\n\nThe total home team scores across all six matches add up exactly to 396, confirming the claim as TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the venue be different in all 6 matches in the 1941 VFL season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that each of the six matches listed had a different venue. So, my goal is to check each row in the table and see if all the venues are unique across these six matches.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant column here is \"venue\" since that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Venue is Punt Road Oval.\n2. **Row 1:** Venue is Glenferrie Oval.\n3. **Row 2:** Venue is Victoria Park.\n4. **Row 3:** Venue is Princes Park.\n5. **Row 4:** Venue is Lake Oval.\n6. **Row 5:** Venue is Kardinia Park.\n\nNow, I'll list all the venues to check for duplicates:\n- Punt Road Oval\n- Glenferrie Oval\n- Victoria Park\n- Princes Park\n- Lake Oval\n- Kardinia Park\n\nLooking at these names, they all seem distinct.

I need to determine whether the claim \"on 21 june 1941 the crowd be 5000 for 3 match during the 1941 vfl season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It mentions three key points:\n1. The date: 21 June 1941\n2. The crowd size: 5000 for three matches\n3. These matches are part of the 1941 VFL season\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns relevant to this claim: 'crowd' and 'date'. Each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd number, and date.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the date is 21 June 1941. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 21 june 1941\n- Row 1: same date\n- Row 2: same date\n- Row 3: same date\n- Row 4: same date\n- Row 5: same date\n\nSo all six matches in the table took place on 21 June 1941. \n\nNext, I need to check how many of these matches had a crowd of exactly 5000. Looking at the 'crowd' column:\n\n- Row 0: 6000\n- Row 1: 2000\n- Row 2: 6000\n- Row 3: 4000\n- Row 4: 5000\n- Row 5: 5000\n\nFrom this, rows 4 and 5 have a crowd of 5000. That's only two matches with exactly 5000 attendees.\n\nThe claim states that there were three matches with a crowd of 5000 on that date. However, according to the table, it's only two. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data provided.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider whether all these matches are part of the 1941 VFL season. Since all entries in the table are from 21 June 1941 and likely belong to that season, but the claim doesn't require verification beyond the date and crowd numbers for three matches. \n\nThus, since only two matches had a crowd of 5000 on the specified date, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were three matches with a crowd of 5000 on June 21, 1941.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the match between South Melbourne and North Melbourne on June 21, 1941. Scanning the 'date' column, all entries are for 21 june 1941, so that condition is satisfied across all rows.\n\nNext, I need to identify which row has both teams involved in the claim: South Melbourne as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team. Looking at each row:\n\n- The first row is Richmond vs St Kilda.\n- Second is Hawthorn vs Melbourne.\n- Third is Collingwood vs Essendon.\n- Fourth is Carlton vs Fitzroy.\n- Fifth is South Melbourne vs North Melbourne. This is the relevant row.\n- Sixth is Geelong vs Footscray.\n\nSo, the fifth row (index 4) contains the game between South Melbourne and North Melbourne. Now, I need to check their scores.\n\nIn that row, the home team score is 8.16 (64), which means 8 goals and 16 behinds. In Australian rules football, a goal is worth 6 points, and a behind is worth 1 point. So calculating South Melbourne's total: (8 * 6) + 16 = 48 + 16 = 64 points.\n\nThe away team score is North Melbourne with 6.6 (42). Calculating that: (6 * 6) + 6 = 36 + 6 = 42 points.\n\nNow, the claim states that South Melbourne outscored North Melbourne by 25 points. Let's find the difference between their scores: 64 (South) - 42 (North) = 22 points. The actual margin is 22 points, not 25 as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the difference is 22 points, not 25.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne outscored North Melbourne by 25 points on 21 June 1941.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"Footscray while playing as the away team scored the most points (93) in all 6 matches.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim means. Footscray is mentioned as the away team, so I should look for rows where \"away team\" is footscray. Then, I need to check their score and see if it's indeed the highest among all six matches.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 6 rows, each representing a match on June 21, 1941. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team is richmond, away is st kilda. St Kilda scored 47 points.\n2. Second row: Hawthorn vs Melbourne. Melbourne as the away team scored 84.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs Essendon. Essendon's away score was 52.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs Fitzroy. Fitzroy, the away team, scored 85 points.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne. North Melbourne's away score was 42.\n6. Sixth row: Geelong vs Footscray. Footscray is the away team here and they scored 93 points.\n\nSo, footscray as the away team in their match scored 93 points. Now, checking all other away teams:\n\n- St Kilda: 47\n- Melbourne: 84\n- Essendon:52\n- Fitzroy:85\n- North Melbourne:42\n\nComparing these, footscray's 93 is indeed the highest among all six matches. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n\nI need to list each cell that supports this conclusion. The main points are:\n\n1. Footscray being the away team and their score of 93.\n2. All other away teams' scores to confirm none exceeded 93.\n\nSo, I'll include the \"away team\" column for all rows where footscray is listed as away, and their corresponding \"away team score\". Additionally, I need to check each row's away team score to ensure no higher than 93 exists. Thus, every row needs to be checked in terms of away team and their scores.\n\nWait, actually, the claim specifically says \"in all 6 match\", so I think I should check each match's away team score. Therefore, for each of the six rows, I need to look at the \"away team\" column to see if footscray is there (only in row 5) and their score. Also, for other rows, just ensure that no away team has a higher score than 93.\n\nSo, relevant cells would include:\n\n- For each of the six rows: \"away team\" and \"away team score\".\n\nBut maybe to streamline, since the claim is about footscray's performance relative to all others, I can list the row where footscray is away and their score (row 5), and perhaps other rows where away teams have high scores like Melbourne and Fitzroy.\n\nWait, but for a thorough check, every away team's score should be considered. So, maybe include each away team's \"away team\" column to confirm it's not footscray except in the relevant row, and their scores to ensure 93 is the highest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just list all the rows where the away team's scores are compared, but that might complicate things. Maybe a better approach is:\n\n- Include row 5 (where footscray is away) for both \"away team\" and \"away team score\".\n- For other rows, include the \"away team score\" to check they don't exceed 93.\n\nSo in total, for each of the six rows, I need their \"away team score\". But since the instruction says to list only the relevant cells, maybe just the ones that directly support the claim. That would be:\n\n- The row where footscray is away (row 5): both \"away team\" and \"away team score\".\n- All other rows' \"away team score\" columns to confirm no higher than 93.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON structure, each cell is an object with row index and column name. Let's number the rows starting from 0:\n\nRow 0: away team (st kilda) and score (47)\nRow 1: away team (melbourne) and score (84)\nRow 2: away team (essendon) and score (52)\nRow 3: away team (fitzroy) and score (85)\nRow 4: away team (north melbourne) and score (42)\nRow 5: away team (footscray) and score (93)\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor each row:\n- \"away team\" column to check if it's footscray\n- \"away team score\" for all rows\n\nBut since the claim is about footscray scoring 93 being the highest in all matches, I think we need to include all away team scores. So, the relevant cells are:\n\nAll six rows under \"away team score\", and specifically row 5's \"away team\" to confirm it's footscray.\n\nTherefore, in JSON terms:\n\n[\n    {row:0, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:0, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:1, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:2, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:3, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:4, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:5, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:5, column:\"away team score\"}\n]\n\nBut perhaps the user just wants to highlight footscray's row and maybe a couple others. However, for completeness, including all away scores makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about footscray having the highest among all 6, it suffices to list their cell and any that are higher than or equal, but in this case, none are higher. So perhaps just row5's \"away team\" and \"score\", and maybe row3's \"score\" (85) as the next highest.\n\nBut I think including all six rows' away scores would be more accurate for a thorough check.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. Footscray, as the away team in their match, scored 93 points, which was the highest among all six matches.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Footscray's Match:** Locate the row where Footscray is listed as the away team (Row 5). Their score was 93.\n2. **Compare All Away Team Scores:** Check each of the six rows for away team scores:\n   - Row 0: St Kilda scored 47\n   - Row 1: Melbourne scored 84\n   - Row 2: Essendon scored 52\n   - Row 3: Fitzroy scored 85\n   - Row 4: North Melbourne scored 42\n   - Row 5: Footscray scored 93\n3. **Determine the Highest Score:** Among all away teams, Footscray's 93 is the highest.\n   \n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nEach row's \"away team\" and their corresponding \"away team score\" to ensure no other team exceeded Footscray's score.\n\n```json\n[\n    {row:0, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:0, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:1, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:1, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:2, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:2, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:3, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:3, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:4, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:4, column:\"away team score\"},\n    {row:5, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:5, column:\"away team score\"}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, for brevity and clarity, focusing on Footscray's row and the highest-scoring away teams:\n\n```json\n[\n    {row:3, column:\"away team score\"},  // Fitzroy scored 85\n    {row:5, column:\"away team\"},\n    {row:5, column:\"away team score\"} // Footscray scored 93\n]\n```\n\n**Final Answer:** The claim is TRUE. Footscray scored the highest as the away team with 93 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_claim_true\": true,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row\": 5, \"column\": \"away team\" },\n    { \"row\": 5, \"column\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the venue be the same for 3 match and different for the other 3 in the 1941 vfl season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that in the 1941 VFL season, there are three matches held at the same venue and the other three matches are held at different venues. So, essentially, out of six matches, three share one common venue, and each of the remaining three has a unique venue.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that all matches are from June 21, 1941. The relevant column here is \"venue\". Let me list out the venues for each match:\n\n1. Row 0: punt road oval\n2. Row 1: glenferrie oval\n3. Row 2: victoria park\n4. Row 3: princes park\n5. Row 4: lake oval\n6. Row 5: kardinia park\n\nWait, that's six venues in total. Each match has a different venue. So, no venue is repeated more than once.\n\nThe claim states that three matches are at the same venue and the other three are each at different venues. But according to the table, all six venues are unique; none of them repeat. Therefore, there isn't any venue shared by three matches or even two matches.\n\nSo, since every match has a distinct venue, the claim that three share one venue and the others have different ones is not supported by the data. In fact, it's contradicted because all venues are different for each match.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "fitzroy while play as the away team score the most point (93) in all 6 match",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"fitzroy while play as the away team score the most point (93) in all 6 match.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. The key points are:\n1. Fitzroy was playing as the away team.\n2. They scored the highest points with 93.\n3. This happened across all six matches.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a single match between a home team and an away team on June 21, 1941. So there are six different games listed here.\n\nLet me go through each row to find where Fitzroy is playing as the away team. Scanning the \"away team\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Away team is St Kilda.\n- Row 1: Away team is Melbourne.\n- Row 2: Away team is Essendon.\n- Row 3: Away team is Fitzroy.\n- Row 4: Away team is North Melbourne.\n- Row 5: Away team is Footscray.\n\nSo only in row 3, Fitzroy is the away team. Now, what's their score? The \"away team score\" for this row is 12.13 (85). Wait, but the claim says they scored 93 points. Hmm, that doesn't match. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misreading the scores. Each entry in the score column has two parts: something like X.Y (Z). I think the Z is the total points because it's written as (73), which would be the sum of goals and behinds converted to points.\n\nSo for each row, the away team's points are:\n\n- Row 0: St Kilda scored 6.11 \u2192 6*6 + 11 = 47 points.\n- Row 1: Melbourne scored 12.12 \u2192 12*6 +12=84 points.\n- Row 2: Essendon scored 7.10 \u2192 7*6+10=52 points.\n- Row 3: Fitzroy scored 12.13 \u2192 12*6+13=85 points.\n- Row 4: North Melbourne scored 6.6 \u2192 6*6+6=42 points.\n- Row 5: Footscray scored 13.15 \u2192 13*6 +15=93 points.\n\nWait, so in row 5, the away team is Footscray, and their score is 13.15 (93). So Fitzroy as the away team only has 85 points, but Footscray has 93 as the away team. \n\nSo the claim says Fitzroy scored 93 points while playing as the away team. But from the table, Fitzroy's score is 85 when they were away against Carlton. The highest scoring away team is Footscray with 93.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because:\n1. Fitzroy didn't score 93; they scored 85.\n2. The highest score by an away team was actually Footscray's 93 points in another match.\n\nSo the relevant cells are for row 3 where Fitzroy is the away team and their score, as well as row 5 where Footscray scored higher as the away team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Fitzroy, while playing as an away team, scored the most points (93) in all six matches. However, examining the table:\n\n- In the match where Fitzroy is the away team (row 3), their score is 12.13 (85).\n- The highest away team score is 93 by Footscray in row 5.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because Fitzroy did not score 93 points as an away team and another team scored higher.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the total score for the away team in 6 match be 396",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the total score for the away team in 6 match be 396\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the total away team scores across six matches add up to 396 points. So my task is to verify if the sum of all the away team scores in each match equals 396.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are six rows, each representing a different match on June 21, 1941. Each row has columns for home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant column here is \"away team score\".\n\nEach away team score is given in the format of goals and behinds, like \"6.11 (47)\". I need to sum up all these scores correctly. Wait a second, in Australian rules football, each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is worth 1 point. So when the score is written as \"6.11 (47)\", that means 6 goals (which is 36 points) plus 11 behinds (11 points), totaling 47 points.\n\nSo for each away team score, I can take the number in parentheses as their total points and sum them all up. Alternatively, if the numbers weren't already calculated, I would have to compute it myself, but since they're provided, I can just add those totals.\n\nLet's list out the away team scores from each row:\n\n1. St Kilda: 6.11 (47)\n2. Melbourne: 12.12 (84) \u2013 Wait, no, looking back at the table, Melbourne is actually the home team in one of the rows. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Each row has both home and away teams, so for each row, the away team's score is the second column. So let's list them correctly:\n\n1. Row 0: Away team is St Kilda with 6.11 (47)\n2. Row 1: Away team is Melbourne with 12.12 (84) \u2013 Wait, no, in row 1, the home team is Hawthorn and away is Melbourne? No, wait, looking at the table:\n\n- First row: richmond vs st kilda, so away is st kilda\n- Second row: hawthorn vs melbourne, away is melbourne\nWait, actually no. The second row shows hawthorn as home team and melbourne as away? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nEach row has \"home team\", then \"away team\". So in each case, the first team is home, the second is away.\n\nSo for each row:\n\n1. Row 0: home - richmond, away - st kilda\n2. Row 1: home - hawthorn, away - melbourne\n3. Row 2: home - collingwood, away - essendon\n4. Row 3: home - carlton, away - fitzroy\n5. Row 4: home - south melbourne, away - north melbourne\n6. Row 5: home - geelong, away - footscray\n\nNow, the away team scores for each:\n\n1. St Kilda: 6.11 (47)\n2. Melbourne: 12.12 (84)\nWait, hold on. In row 1, the away team is melbourne with a score of 12.12 (84). So that's correct.\n\n3. Essendon: 7.10 (52)\n4. Fitzroy: 12.13 (85)\n5. North Melbourne: 6.6 (42)\n6. Footscray: 13.15 (93)\n\nWait, but in row 5, footscray is the away team with a score of 13.15 (93). So their total points are as given.\n\nNow, let's list all the away scores:\n\nRow 0: 47\nRow 1: 84\nRow 2: 52\nRow 3: 85\nRow 4: 42\nRow 5: 93\n\nWait a minute. Let me confirm each row's away team score correctly.\n\nRow 0:\n<away team> st kilda with score 6.11 (47)\nSo yes, 47 points.\n\nRow 1:\n<away team> melbourne with score 12.12 (84)\nYes, 84.\n\nRow 2:\n<away team> essendon with score 7.10 (52) \u2192 correct.\n\nRow 3:\n<away team> fitzroy with score 12.13 (85) \u2192 correct.\n\nRow 4:\n<away team> north melbourne with score 6.6 (42)\nCorrect.\n\nRow 5:\n<away team> footscray with score 13.15 (93)\nYes.\n\nSo now, let's sum all these up:\n\n47 + 84 = 131\n\n131 + 52 = 183\n\n183 + 85 = 268\n\n268 + 42 = 310\n\n310 + 93 = 403.\n\nWait, that gives a total of 403. But the claim is 396.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because my calculation arrives at 403 instead of 396.\n\nLet me double-check each step to ensure I didn't make an addition error.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nRow 0: 47\n\nTotal so far: 47\n\nRow 1: 84 \u2192 47 + 84 = 131\n\nRow 2: 52 \u2192 131 + 52 = 183\n\nRow 3: 85 \u2192 183 + 85 = 268\n\nRow 4: 42 \u2192 268 + 42 = 310\n\nRow 5: 93 \u2192 310 + 93 = 403.\n\nSo according to this, the total is 403 points. But the claim states it should be 396. So that would make the claim false, correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which are the away team scores? Let me double-check each row's away team and their score.\n\nRow 0: richmond (home), st kilda (away) \u2192 score is 47\n\nRow 1: hawthorn (home), melbourne (away) \u2192 score 84\n\nRow 2: collingwood (home), essendon (away) \u2192 score 52\n\nRow 3: carlton (home), fitzroy (away) \u2192 score 85\n\nRow 4: south melbourne (home), north melbourne (away) \u2192 score 42\n\nRow 5: geelong (home), footscray (away) \u2192 score 93.\n\nYes, that's correct. So all away team scores are accounted for correctly.\n\nHmm, so why the discrepancy? The total is 403, but the claim is 396. That suggests either I made a mistake in addition or perhaps the user intended to refer to another column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in parentheses aren't supposed to be added as points, but that seems unlikely because they are clearly labeled with the total in brackets.\n\nWait, let me check the scores again:\n\nRow 0: st kilda away \u2192 6 goals (36) + 11 behinds (11) = 47. Correct.\n\nRow 1: melbourne away \u2192 12 goals (72) + 12 behinds (12) = 84. Correct.\n\nRow 2: essendon away \u2192 7 goals (42) + 10 behinds (10) = 52. Correct.\n\nRow 3: fitzroy away \u2192 12 goals (72) + 13 behinds (13) = 85. Correct.\n\nRow 4: north melbourne away \u2192 6 goals (36) + 6 behinds (6) = 42. Correct.\n\nRow 5: footscray away \u2192 13 goals (78) + 15 behinds (15) = 93. Correct.\n\nSo all the scores are correctly converted to points. Therefore, adding them up should give me 403, not 396.\n\nWait a minute, could there be an error in my addition? Let's try another method: summing each component separately.\n\nSum of goals for away teams:\n\nst kilda: 6\n\nmelbourne:12\n\nessendon:7\n\nfitzroy:12\n\nnorth melbourne:6\n\nfootscray:13\n\nTotal goals: 6 + 12 = 18; 18 +7=25; 25+12=37; 37+6=43; 43+13=56. So total goals:56.\n\nEach goal is worth 6 points, so 56 * 6 = 336.\n\nSum of behinds for away teams:\n\nst kilda:11\n\nmelbourne:12\n\nessendon:10\n\nfitzroy:13\n\nnorth melbourne:6\n\nfootscray:15\n\nTotal behinds:11 +12=23; 23+10=33; 33+13=46; 46+6=52; 52+15=67.\n\nEach behind is worth 1 point, so total points from behinds:67.\n\nTotal away team points: 336 + 67 = 403. Same result.\n\nSo the calculation holds up both ways. Thus, the correct total should be 403, not 396.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the total is 396 is incorrect based on the data provided.\n\nBut let me check one more time to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in adding the behinds. Let me re-calculate:\n\nBehind counts:\n\nst kilda:11\n\nmelbourne:12 \u2192 11+12=23\n\nessendon:10 \u2192 23+10=33\n\nfitzroy:13 \u2192 33+13=46\n\nnorth melbourne:6 \u2192 46+6=52\n\nfootscray:15 \u219252+15=67. Correct.\n\nGoals:\n\nst kilda:6\n\nmelbourne:12\u21926+12=18\n\nessendon:7\u219218+7=25\n\nfitzroy:12\u219225+12=37\n\nnorth melbourne:6\u219237+6=43\n\nfootscray:13\u219243+13=56. Correct.\n\nThus, 56 goals *6=336, 67 behinds*1=67, total 403. So yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use different point allocations, like in some leagues where behinds are worth 2 points or something else? But traditionally, behinds are 1 point.\n\nWait, no, in Australian rules football, a goal is 6 points and a behind is 1 point. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error in presenting the data?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"st kilda:6 goals, 11 behinds\n\nmelbourne:12 goals,12 behinds\n\nessendon:7 goals,10 behinds\n\nfitzroy:12 goals,13 behinds\n\nnorth melbourne:6 goals,6 behinds\n\nfootscray:13 goals,15 behinds\"\n\nSo the data seems consistent as presented.\n\nThus, my conclusion is that the total away points are 403, not 396. Therefore, the claim of 396 is incorrect based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe total away team points for the given matches sum up to 403, not 396.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe total away team points add up to \\boxed{403}.",
