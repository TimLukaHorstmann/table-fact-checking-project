    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let me read through the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game against bordeaux on 10 / / 2009 have the highest attendance with 41978.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the key parts of this claim:\n- The opponent is Bordeau.\n- The date is October 10, 2009 (I think that's what \"10 / / 2009\" refers to).\n- The attendance was 41978, which is claimed to be the highest.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see rows with the following data:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 5 (since there are six rows in total).\n\nLet me go through each row that involves Bordeau. From the table, rows 2 and 3 mention Bordeu as opponents.\n\n- Row 2: Date is \"2006 - 10 - 18\", so October 18, 2006. Attendance here is 31471.\n- Row 3: Date is \"2006 - 10 - 31\", which is October 31, 2006. Attendance is 41978.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions the date as \"10 / / 2009,\" but all the dates in the table are from 2006. So the games against Bordeu were in October and November of 2006, not 2009. Therefore, there's no game in 2009 mentioned here.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the attendance numbers:\n- The highest attendance in the table is 41978 (row 3).\n- Other attendances include 35000, 41976, and so on. So indeed, row 3 has the highest attendance.\n\nBut since the claim refers to a game in 2009 which doesn't exist in the table, the claim is false.\n\nAlso, checking other cells for any possible mistakes:\n- The opponent is correctly identified as Bordeu.\n- The attendance number of 41978 exists but corresponds to a different year (2006).\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states the date and thus cannot be supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there's no game against Bordeu in 2009. The highest attendance against Bordeu was in 2006.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"each team list be the opponent exactly 2 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: kick off, opponents, h/a (home/away), result, referee, and attendance. For this claim, the relevant column is \"opponents\".\n\nThe claim states that each team appears as an opponent exactly two times in the list. So, I'll need to count how many times each unique team is listed under the \"opponents\" column.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. Row 0: psv eindhoven\n2. Row 1: galatasaray\n3. Row 2: bordeaux\n4. Row 3: bordeaux\n5. Row 4: psv eindhoven\n6. Row 5: galatasaray\n\nNow, let's count each opponent:\n\n- **psv eindhoven**: appears in rows 0 and 4 \u2192 total of 2 times.\n- **galatasaray**: appears in rows 1 and 5 \u2192 total of 2 times.\n- **bordeaux**: appears in rows 2 and 3 \u2192 total of 2 times.\n\nWait a minute, that's each team appearing exactly two times. So, does that mean the claim is TRUE?\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any other teams or miscount. The opponents listed are only psv eindhoven, galatasaray, and bordeaux. Each of them appears twice.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true as each team is an opponent exactly two times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because each team (psv eindhoven, galatasaray, bordeaux) appears as opponents exactly two times in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The \"opponents\" column is key here since the claim is about teams being listed as opponents.\n2. **List All Opponents:**\n   - psv eindhoven\n   - galatasaray\n   - bordeaux\n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - psv eindhoven: 2 times (rows 0 and 4)\n   - galatasaray: 2 times (rows 1 and 5)\n   - bordeaux: 2 times (rows 2 and 3)\n4. **Conclusion:** Each opponent appears exactly twice, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the last game against galatasaray have the smallest attendance with 23000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify all games against Galatasaray in the table. Looking through the opponents column:\n\n- Row 1: Opponents are Galatasaray (played at home on 2006-09-27)\n- Row 5: Opponents are Galatasaray again (played away on 2006-12-05)\n\nSo, there are two games against Galatasaray. The claim refers to the \"last\" game, which would be the one on 2006-12-05.\n\nNext, I'll check the attendance for this last game. In row 5 under the 'attendance' column, it's listed as 23000.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this is indeed the smallest attendance across all games. Let's list out all attendances:\n\n- Row 0: 35000\n- Row 1: 41976\n- Row 2: 31471\n- Row 3: 41978\n- Row 4: 41948\n- Row 5: 23000\n\nLooking at these numbers, 23000 is the smallest attendance figure in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the first game against psv eindhoven have the fewest total goal score with 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main points: \n1. The first game against PSV Eindhoven.\n2. This game had the fewest total goals scored, specifically zero.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check for the games involving PSV Eindhoven. \n\nThe table has six rows. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponents are PSV Eindhoven, result is 0-0.\n- Row 4: Opponents again are PSV Eindhoven, result is 2-0.\n\nSo there are two games against PSV Eindhoven. The claim refers to the first one, which is row 0.\n\nNow, checking the total goals in that game. The result is 0-0, so both teams scored zero goals each. The total would be 0 + 0 = 0 goals.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this is indeed the fewest total goals across all games in the table. Let's look at all results:\n\nRow 0: 0-0 \u2192 Total 0\nRow 1: 3-2 \u2192 Total 5\nRow 2: 1-0 \u2192 Total 1\nRow 3: 3-0 \u2192 Total 3\nRow 4: 2-0 \u2192 Total 2\nRow 5: 2-3 \u2192 Total 5\n\nThe totals are [0,5,1,3,2,5]. The smallest total is 0. So the first game against PSV Eindhoven does have the fewest goals with a total of 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for this determination:\n- Row 0's opponents (to confirm it's against PSV)\n- Row 0's result (to get the goal count)\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include row_index 0 and column_name \"opponents\" as well as row_index 0 and column_name \"result\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Row 0: kick off is 2006-09-12, which matches September 12th.\n2. Other rows have dates from September 27th onwards, so they are later than the first game.\n\nSince the claim states that the first game was on September 12th, and this date is present in the first row of the table, it's accurate. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being the \"kick off\" column in row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the first game against psv eindhoven have the most total goal score with 3.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. So, breaking it down:\n\n1. **Identify the First Game Against PSV Eindhoven**: I should look through the table and find all games where the opponent is \"psv eindhoven.\" Then determine which one is the first occurrence.\n\n2. **Determine Total Goal Score for That Game**: For that specific game, check both teams' goals and sum them up to get the total goals.\n\n3. **Check if It's the Most in the Table**: Compare this total with all other games to see if it indeed has the highest number of goals scored.\n\nLet me start by going through each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Opponent is psv eindhoven, result is 0-0.
