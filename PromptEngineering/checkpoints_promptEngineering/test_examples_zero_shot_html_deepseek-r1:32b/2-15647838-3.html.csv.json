    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"attendance be over 70000 8 time in virginia tech hokies bowl game.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that there were eight instances where the attendance exceeded 70,000 at Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games. However, looking at the data in the table, I notice that each row represents a different team's performance, not specifically Virginia Tech. The teams listed include Georgia Bulldogs, Stanford Cardinal, Michigan Wolverines, etc., but there's no mention of Virginia Tech in any of these rows.\n\nSince the claim is about Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games, and the table doesn't contain any data related to them, I can conclude that there are zero instances where attendance exceeded 70,000 for their games as per this data. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the information given.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check each row to ensure I'm not missing anything. Each row details a specific bowl game with different teams participating, but none of them are Virginia Tech. The attendance numbers vary, some above 70,000 and others below, but without any data on Virginia Tech, the claim can't be verified or supported.\n\nThus, based on the provided table, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a table with several rows of data about different games held in various stadiums across the United States. They also made a claim: \"3 out of 20 6 game be hold at memphis memorial stadium in memphis, tn.\" I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim clearly. The user mentions that three out of six games were held at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. So, my task is to check each row in the table and see how many times the stadium mentioned matches \"Memphis Memorial Stadium\" located in Memphis, TN.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns such as Year, Game Name, Result, Opponent, Stadium, City, and Attendance. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'Stadium' and 'City'. I'll need to go through each row and check these two columns to see if any of them mention Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis.\n\nI'll start from the top of the table (Row 0) and move down one by one:\n\n- Row 0: The stadium is Pro Player Stadium, located in Miami Gardens, FL. Not matching.\n- Row 1: Pro Player Stadium again, same location as above. Still not a match.\n- Row 2: Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium in Orlando, FL. Nope.\n- Row 3: Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, LA. Doesn't fit.\n- Row 4: Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, FL. Not the right place.\n- Row 5: Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium again, same as row 2.\n- Row 6: Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA. Still not Memphis.\n- Row 7: Pro Player Stadium again. Same issue as before.\n- Row 8: Chick-fil-A Bowl at Georgia Dome, same city as row 6.\n- Row 9: Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium once more.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n- Row 10: Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, FL.\n- Row 11: Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans.\n- Row 12: Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium again, Orlando, FL.\n- Row 13: Georgia Dome, Atlanta, GA.\n- Row 14: Pro Player Stadium, same location.\n\nAs I go through each row, none of them mention Memphis Memorial Stadium or Memphis, TN as the city. Every game is located in a different stadium across various cities like Miami Gardens, Orlando, New Orleans, Atlanta, etc.\n\nSince there are no entries where the stadium is Memphis Memorial Stadium and the city is Memphis, TN, the claim that three out of six games were held there doesn't hold up. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nIn terms of relevant cells, I checked each row's 'Stadium' and 'City' columns to verify the claim. So, for every row, both these columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"City\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"City\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"City\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"there be 10 win out of 26 game in virginia tech hokies bowl game\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It says that Virginia Tech Hokies have won 10 games out of 26 bowl games they've played. So, my goal is to verify how many wins and total games Virginia Tech has in this context.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with details about the bowl game, such as the opponent, result, stadium location, etc. The columns include \"Year,\" \"Bowl Game,\" \"Result,\" \"Opponent,\" \"Stadium,\" \"Location,\" and \"Attendance.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to see if Virginia Tech is mentioned as the team playing against someone else. However, in this table, it seems that only the opponent's name is listed under the \"Opponent\" column. For example, rows mention teams like \"kansas jayhawks,\" \"cincinnati bearcats,\" etc., but I don't see any explicit mention of \"virginia tech hokies.\" \n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The table lists each year's bowl game with the opponent Virginia Tech faced. So, for example, in 1990, they played against Texas A&M Aggies, and so on. Since each row corresponds to a game that Virginia Tech Hokies participated in, the total number of rows will give me the total number of games.\n\nCounting the rows from 1990 to 2012, I find there are 23 entries. So, the claim mentions 26 games, but according to this table, it's only 23. That already suggests a discrepancy, making the claim potentially false.\n\nNext, let's check the number of wins. In each row, the \"Result\" column shows either 'W' for win or 'L' for loss. I'll go through each row and count how many times 'W' appears.\n\nStarting from 1990:\n- 1990: L\n- 1991: W (this is actually a game in 1991, so maybe the table starts earlier than 26 games)\nWait, I'm confused. The first row is labeled as 1990, but looking at the data, it's probably from different years. Let me recount each result:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 22 (since there are 23 rows). Let me list them out with their results:\n- Row 0: L\n- Row 1: W\n- Row 2: W\n- Row 3: W\n- Row 4: W\n- Row 5: W\n- Row 6: L\n- Row 7: W\n- Row 8: W\n- Row 9: W\n- Row 10: W\n- Row 11: L\n- Row 12: W\n- Row 13: W\n- Row 14: W\n- Row 15: W\n- Row 16: L\n- Row 17: L\n- Row 18: W\n- Row 19: W\n- Row 20: L\n- Row 21: W\n- Row 22: W\n\nCounting the 'W's, I get a total of 15 wins. But wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought there were only 23 games in the table. The claim is about 10 wins out of 26 games, but according to my count, it's 15 wins out of 23 games.\n\nHold on, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\nRow 0: L\nRow 1: W (1)\nRow 2: W (2)\nRow 3: W (3)\nRow 4: W (4)\nRow 5: W (5)\nRow 6: L\nRow 7: W (6)\nRow 8: W (7)\nRow 9: W (8)\nRow 10: W (9)\nRow 11: L\nRow 12: W (10)\nRow 13: W (11)\nRow 14: W (12)\nRow 15: W (13)\nRow 16: L\nRow 17: L\nRow 18: W (14)\nRow 19: W (15)\nRow 20: L\nRow 21: W (16)\nRow 22: W (17)\n\nSo, total wins are 17 out of 23 games. That's more than the claim states.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. The years listed in the table go from 1990 to 2012, which is 23 seasons, but bowl appearances can vary. Maybe not every year they played a bowl game, so the total number of games could be less than 26 as per the claim.\n\nHowever, based on this table, it's only showing 23 games with 17 wins. Therefore, the claim that there are 10 wins out of 26 games doesn't align with this data. \n\nBut let me double-check: maybe I missed some rows or miscounted the wins. Let's list them again:\n\nRow numbers and results:\n0: L\n1: W\n2: W\n3: W\n4: W\n5: W (Total 5)\n6: L\n7: W (6)\n8: W (7)\n9: W (8)\n10: W (9)\n11: L\n12: W (10)\n13: W (11)\n14: W (12)\n15: W (13)\n16: L\n17: L\n18: W (14)\n19: W (15)\n20: L\n21: W (16)\n22: W (17)\n\nYes, that's 17 wins. So the claim of 10 out of 26 is incorrect according to this table.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended a different set of data or maybe there are more games beyond what's listed here. However, based solely on the provided table, the total games are 23 with 17 wins, not 26 with 10 wins.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I should consider that each row represents a bowl game played by Virginia Tech Hokies against the opponent listed. So if there are 23 rows, it's 23 bowl games. The claim says 26, which is more than what's in the table. Therefore, without additional data beyond this table, we can't confirm the full 26 games, but according to this, they have played at least 23 with 17 wins.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim states 10 wins out of 26 bowl games for Virginia Tech Hokies. According to the table, there are 23 games with 17 wins. Therefore, the claim is not accurate based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Virginia Tech Hokies have 10 wins out of 26 bowl games is incorrect based on the provided table. The table shows 23 bowl games with 17 wins. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**False**\n\n\\boxed{False}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim states that \"there be 10 loss out of 26 game in virginia tech hokies bowl game.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly this claim is saying. It mentions \"loss,\" so it's about games where Virginia Tech lost. Then it says there are 10 losses out of 26 games. So, according to the claim, out of all the bowl games Virginia Tech has played (which total 26), they have lost 10 times.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a different bowl game involving Virginia Tech's team, the Hokies. The relevant columns here are \"Year\" and \"Result.\" The result column shows either a win ('W') or a loss ('L'). \n\nI'll start by counting the number of games listed in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl: W\n2. 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl: W\n3. 2010 Orange Bowl: L\n4. 2011 Sugar Bowl: L\n5. 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl: W\n6. 2007 Orange Bowl: L\n7. 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl: L\n8. 2005: Not provided, but assuming all rows from 2008 to 2012 are listed.\nWait, actually, looking at the table, I see that it starts with 1999, then 2007-2012. Let me recount properly:\n\nRows:\n0: 1999\n1: 2007\n2: 2008\n3: 2009\n4: 2010\n5: 2011\n6: 2012\n\nWait, actually, the table seems to have rows from 1999 onwards. Let me count all the rows:\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see rows starting from 1999 up to 2012. So each row represents a bowl game played by Virginia Tech in those years.\n\nNow, let's count how many games are listed and how many of them resulted in losses.\n\nTotal number of games (rows): Let me count the rows from index 0 onwards:\n\nRow indexes: 0,1,2,... up to where?\n\nLooking at the provided table, there are multiple entries. Let me list each row's result:\n\n- Row 0: 1999 Chick-fil-A Bowl: W\n- Row 1: 2007 Orange Bowl: L\n- Row 2: 2008 Orange Bowl: W\n- Row 3: 2009 Orange Bowl: W\n- Row 4: 2010 Orange Bowl: L\n- Row 5: 2011 Sugar Bowl: L\n- Row 6: 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl: W\n\nWait, that's only 7 rows. But the claim mentions 26 games, which is much higher than what's in this table.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The user provided a table with specific bowl games for Virginia Tech Hokies, but maybe the actual total number of bowl games they've played is different.\n\nBut according to the table, there are 7 games listed. Let me recount:\n\n- From the table, starting from 1999:\n1999 Chick-fil-A Bowl: W\n2007 Orange Bowl: L\n2008 Orange Bowl: W\n2009 Orange Bowl: W\n2010 Orange Bowl: L\n2011 Sugar Bowl: L\n2012 Russell Athletic Bowl: W\n\nThat's 7 games total in the table. The claim mentions 26 games, so this table doesn't cover all of them. Therefore, I can't verify the entire claim based solely on this data.\n\nWait, but maybe the user made a mistake and intended to refer to a different team or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps they are referring only to the games listed here, which is 7, but that doesn't align with the claim of 26 games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is not complete, and only shows a subset of games. But since we're instructed to check against the provided table, I must work with what's given.\n\nIn the table, let's count the number of losses (L) in the \"Result\" column:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1999: W\n- 2007: L\n- 2008: W\n- 2009: W\n- 2010: L\n- 2011: L\n- 2012: W\n\nSo, in the table, there are 3 losses: 2007, 2010, and 2011.\n\nTotal games in the table: 7 (from 1999 to 2012). \n\nBut the claim says 10 losses out of 26 games. Since our table only shows 7 games with 3 losses, it doesn't support the claim. Therefore, based on the data provided, the claim is not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row is separated by line breaks. Let me list them all:\n\n1. 1999 Chick-fil-A Bowl: W\n2. 2007 Orange Bowl: L\n3. 2008 Orange Bowl: W\n4. 2009 Orange Bowl: W\n5. 2010 Orange Bowl: L\n6. 2011 Sugar Bowl: L\n7. 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl: W\n\nYes, that's 7 rows in total.\n\nTherefore, the claim of 10 losses out of 26 games cannot be verified with this data because the table only provides 7 games and 3 losses. It might be that the user intended to refer to a different set of games or perhaps made an error in stating the number of games and losses.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Virginia Tech has lost 10 out of 26 bowl games. However, based on the provided table, only 7 games are listed with 3 losses. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the given data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false according to the provided data.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"attendance be over 70000 7 time in virginia tech hokies bowl game.\" I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two main points:\n1. Attendance over 70,000.\n2. This should happen 7 times in Virginia Tech Hokies' bowl games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a bowl game with details like Year, Bowl Game Name, Result (Win/Loss), Opponent, Stadium, Location, and Attendance.\n\nI notice that some rows have \"virginia tech hokies\" as one of the teams. Wait, actually, looking closely, in the table, the opponent is listed under the \"Opponent\" column. So, if Virginia Tech Hokies are playing, they would be either the team or the opponent. In this case, since all the opponents seem to vary (e.g., Clemson Tigers, Georgia Bulldogs), I need to see which games involve Virginia Tech as one of the teams.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the table, it doesn't explicitly state that each row is about Virginia Tech's game. Instead, it seems like these are various bowl games where different teams participate. So perhaps I should consider all rows where either team is Virginia Tech Hokies. But in this table, I don't see any mention of \"virginia tech hokies\" as the team; instead, they appear in some opponents, but maybe that's a mistake because in reality, Virginia Tech does play in bowl games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents Virginia Tech's bowl game appearances, and the opponent is listed. So I'll proceed under that assumption since otherwise, it would be hard to verify the claim without more information.\n\nNow, focusing on attendance over 70,000: I need to look at the \"Attendance\" column for each row where Virginia Tech Hokies played, check if it's over 70k, and count how many times this happened.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0 (1964): Not relevant since opponent is Clemson Tigers.\nWait, perhaps each row represents a different team. Hmm, maybe the \"Opponent\" column is the other team in the game, so to find Virginia Tech's games, I need rows where either team is Virginia Tech.\n\nBut looking through the table, the only mention of Virginia Tech is in the opponent column for some rows. Wait, actually, let me check each row:\n\nLooking at all opponents:\n- 1964: Clemson Tigers\n- 1965: Georgia Bulldogs\n- 1967: North Carolina Tar Heels\n- ... etc.\n\nWait a second, none of the opponents are Virginia Tech Hokies. So perhaps this table doesn't include any bowl games where Virginia Tech is one of the teams. That would mean there are zero instances of their attendance being over 70k in their bowl games as per this data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps each row represents a bowl game involving Virginia Tech, and the opponent varies. But that doesn't seem to be the case because, for example, in 2012, the opponent is Rutgers Scarlet Knights, but that's just one of many possible opponents.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all rows where either team is Virginia Tech Hokies. Since the table lists \"Opponent\" as various teams, and doesn't specify the other team (which would be Virginia Tech), it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe each row represents a game where the opponent is listed, implying that the home team is another school.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps the claim can't be verified because there's no data about Virginia Tech Hokies' bowl games in the provided table. Therefore, since there are no rows indicating their participation, we can infer that the attendance over 70k seven times doesn't hold.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check all the \"Attendance\" numbers regardless of the team and see if any exceed 70k, but the claim specifically mentions Virginia Tech's games. Since I don't have data on which games belong to them, it's impossible to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a game that Virginia Tech played in, so let's check all attendances:\n\nLooking at each \"Attendance\" value:\n- 1964: 73500 (over 70k)\n- 1965: 83623 (over)\n- 1967: 45843 (no)\n- 1969: 40598 (no)\n- 1971: 44289 (no)\n- 1973: 56200 (no)\n- 1975: 50275 (no)\n- 1976: 69370 (close, but under)\n- 1979: 47100 (no)\n- 1980: 44738 (no)\n- 1983: 42352 (no)\n- 1984: 61709 (no)\n- 1987: 62858 (no)\n- 1990: 55762 (no)\n- 1992: 80239 (over)\n- 1995: 73140 (over)\n- 1997: 73388 (over)\n- 1999: 73126 (over)\n- 2002: 74247 (over)\n- 2005: 71348 (over)\n- 2008: 70084 (exactly over)\n- 2011: 75961 (over)\n- 2014: 73326 (over)\n- 2017: 72406 (over)\n- 2020: 71822 (over)\n- 2023: 72195 (over)\n\nCounting the attendances over 70k:\nFrom the list above, I see attendances in 1964, 1965, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, 2023. That's more than seven instances.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about Virginia Tech Hokies' games. If each row represents their bowl game appearances, then they've had multiple attendances over 70k. However, if some of these rows don't involve Virginia Tech, then my count might be incorrect.\n\nGiven that the table's structure isn't clear regarding which team is playing, but assuming each row represents a game where one of the teams is Virginia Tech Hokies, then their attendance has exceeded 70k multiple times (at least seven). Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at all attendances over 70k:\n1964: Yes\n1965: Yes\n1992: Yes\n1995: Yes\n1997: Yes\n1999: Yes\n2002: Yes\n2005: Yes\n2008: Exactly 70,084 (over)\n2011: Yes\n2014: Yes\n2017: Yes\n2020: Yes\n2023: Yes\n\nThat's more than seven times.

Therefore, they've had multiple games with attendance over 70k, exceeding seven times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Virginia Tech Hokies have attended bowl games with over 70,000 attendees seven times.

So \"Game\" is the name of the bowl game.\n\nSo let's list all the games that were the Gator Bowl:\n\nRow 1: Gator Bowl (Year 1997)\nRow 2: Gator Bowl (Year 1998)\nRow 4: Gator Bowl (Year 2005)\nWait, actually looking at row indexes. Let me recount:\n\nRows:\n- Row index 0: Orange Bowl\n- Row 1: Gator Bowl (Year 1997)\n- Row 2: Gator Bowl (Year 1998)\n- Row 3: Chick-fil-a Bowl (Year 2000)\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait the table starts at row index 0 with Year 1994? Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, the first row is Year 1994 (row 0), Game: Orange Bowl; then 1995 (row1): Gator Bowl; 1996 (row2): Gator Bowl; 1997 (row3): Chick-fil-a Bowl? Wait no, let me check:\n\nWait the table data shows:\n\nRow 0: Year 1994, Game: Orange Bowl\nRow1: Year 1995, Game: Gator Bowl\nRow2: Year 1996, Game: Gator Bowl\nRow3: Year 1997, Game: Chick-fil-a Bowl? Wait no.\n\nWait the table data shows:\n\nLooking back at the provided HTML table:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr> <td>1994</td> <td>Orange Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row0\n<tr> <td>1995</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row1\n<tr> <td>1996</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row2\n<tr> <td>1997</td> <td>Chick-fil-a Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row3\n<tr> <td>1998</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row4\n<tr> <td>1999</td> <td>Orange Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row5\n<tr> <td>2000</td> <td>Chick-fil-a Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row6\n<tr> <td>2001</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row7\n<tr> <td>2002</td> <td>Sun Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row8\n<tr> <td>2003</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row9\n<tr> <td>2004</td> <td>Orange Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row10\n<tr> <td>2005</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row11\n<tr> <td>2006</td> <td>Chick-fil-a Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row12\n<tr> <td>2007</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row13\n<tr> <td>2008</td> <td>Orange Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row14\n<tr> <td>2009</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row15\n<tr> <td>2010</td> <td>Sun Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row16\n<tr> <td>2011</td> <td>Orange Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row17\n<tr> <td>2012</td> <td>Gator Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row18\n<tr> <td>2013</td> <td>Orange Bowl</td> ... </tr> \u2192 row19\n\nWait that's 20 rows, so years from 1994 to 2013.\n\nNow, counting the Gator Bowl games:\n\nRows where Game is \"Gator Bowl\":\n\nRow1 (1995), Row2(1996), Row4(1998), Row7(2001), Row9(2003), Row11(2005), Row13(2007), Row15(2009), Row18(2012). So that's 9 Gator Bowl games.\n\nWait, so the claim says \"5 out of 20 6 game be the gator bowl\". Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps \"5 out of 20 games were the Gator Bowl\"? But from the table, there are 9 Gator Bowl games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant 5 Gator Bowl appearances in total, but according to this, it's more than that.\n\nAlso, the claim says \"the first in 1994\". Looking at the data, the first Gator Bowl was in 1995 (row1). So if the claim says the first was in 1994, that would be incorrect because row0 is Orange Bowl in 1994.\n\nSo putting it together: The table shows 9 Gator Bowl games starting from 1995. The claim mentions 5 out of 20 games being Gator Bowl and the first in 1994. But according to the data, that's not accurate because there are more than 5, and the first was in 1995.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"5 out of 20 games were the Gator Bowl, with the first occurring in 1994.\" However, examining the table reveals that there are actually 9 Gator Bowl appearances starting from 1995. Thus, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is incorrect based on the data provided. There were 9 Gator Bowl games, with the first occurring in 1995, not 1994. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that 5 out of 20 games were the Gator Bowl or that the first was in 1994.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The claim is incorrect based on the data provided.}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the user's query and trying to figure out how to approach it. They've provided a table with various bowl game data, including years, bowl names, outcomes, opponents, venues, locations, and attendances. The claim is that \"the 4 sugar bowl games have a combined attendance of 291,424.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user wants. They're asking me to verify this claim by checking the relevant cells in the table. My job is to determine if the total attendance for all Sugar Bowl games listed adds up to that number.\n\nI start by identifying which rows correspond toSugar Bowl games. Scanning through the \"Bowl\" column, I notice that there are multiple entries for the Orange Bowl, Chick-fil-a Bowl, and others, but only a few mention the Sugar Bowl. Specifically, looking at each row:\n\n- The 2011 Sugar Bowl is in row 14.\n- There's another Sugar Bowl entry in row 7 (from 2009), but wait, actually checking that, it's the Chick-fil-a Bowl again. So perhaps only oneSugar Bowl? Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nRow 3: Orange Bowl 1998 with attendance 74560\n\nRow 10: Sugar Bowl 2011 with attendance 64512\n\nIs there another Sugar Bowl in the table?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Chick-fil-a Bowl 1996\n- Row 1: Orange Bowl 1997\n- Row 2: Orange Bowl 1998\n- Row 3: Chick-fil-a Bowl 1999\n- Row 4: Orange Bowl 2000\n- Row 5: Sugar Bowl 2001? Wait, no. Looking at the data again:\n\nWait, in the table provided, each row has a \"Bowl\" column. Let me list them out with their indices to be accurate.\n\nRow indices start from 0:\n\n0: Chick-fil-a Bowl\n1: Orange Bowl\n2: Orange Bowl\n3: Chick-fil-a Bowl\n4: Orange Bowl\n5: Chick-fil-a Bowl\n6: Orange Bowl\n7: Sugar Bowl? Wait, no. Let me check each row's \"Bowl\" value.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. The table has rows from 1996 to 2012.\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\nRow 0 (1996): Chick-fil-a Bowl\n\nRow 1 (1997): Orange Bowl\n\nRow 2 (1998): Orange Bowl\n\nRow 3 (1999): Chick-fil-a Bowl\n\nRow 4 (2000): Orange Bowl\n\nRow 5 (2001): Chick-fil-a Bowl\n\nRow 6 (2002): Orange Bowl\n\nRow 7 (2003): Sugar Bowl? Wait, no. Let me check the actual \"Bowl\" column values.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nActually, in the provided table, I need to look for entries where the \"Bowl\" column is \"Sugar Bowl.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 4: Orange Bowl\n\nRow 5: Chick-fil-a Bowl\n\nRow 6: Orange Bowl\n\nRow 7: Chick-fil-a Bowl (2009)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me go step by step.\n\nThe table has rows from 1996 to 2012. Let's list each row with its \"Bowl\" and attendance:\n\n- Row 0: 1996 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\n- Row 1: 1997 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n- Row 2: 1998 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n- Row 3: 1999 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\n- Row 4: 2000 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n- Row 5: 2001 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\n- Row 6: 2002 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n- Row 7: 2003 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406 (but in the data, row 7 is for 2009)\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the rows. Let me recount:\n\nActually, looking at the table structure, each row corresponds to a specific year and bowl game.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 14 (since there are 15 rows):\n\n0: 1996 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\n1: 1997 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n2: 1998 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n3: 1999 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\n4: 2000 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n5: 2001 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\n6: 2002 - Orange Bowl - 74560\n7: 2003 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406 (but in the data, row 7 is for 2009)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the actual years and bowls.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Year 1996, Bowl: Chick-fil-a Bowl, Attendance: 75406\nRow 1: 1997, Orange Bowl, 74560\nRow 2: 1998, Orange Bowl, 74560\nRow 3: 1999, Chick-fil-a Bowl, 75406\nRow 4: 2000, Orange Bowl, 74560\nRow 5: 2001, Chick-fil-a Bowl, 75406\nRow 6: 2002, Orange Bowl, 74560\nRow 7: 2003, Chick-fil-a Bowl, 75406 (but in the data, row 7 is for 2009)\nWait no, perhaps each row corresponds to a different year. Let me list them correctly:\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\nEach row seems to represent consecutive years from 1996 onwards.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: 1996 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\nRow 1: 1997 - Orange Bowl - 74560\nRow 2: 1998 - Orange Bowl - 74560\nRow 3: 1999 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\nRow 4: 2000 - Orange Bowl - 74560\nRow 5: 2001 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406\nRow 6: 2002 - Orange Bowl - 74560\nRow 7: 2003 - Chick-fil-a Bowl - 75406 (but in the data, row 7 is for 2009)\nWait no, I think I'm miscounting because the years go up to 2012. Let me recount properly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for \"Sugar Bowl\" entries directly.\n\nLooking through each bowl name:\n\nRow 0: Chick-fil-a\nRow 1: Orange\nRow 2: Orange\nRow 3: Chick-fil-a\nRow 4: Orange\nRow 5: Chick-fil-a\nRow 6: Orange\nRow 7: Chick-fil-a\nRow 8: Orange\nRow 9: Chick-fil-a\nRow 10: Sugar Bowl (2011) - attendance 64512\nRow 11: Chick-fil-a (2012)\n\nWait, that's only oneSugar Bowl entry in row 10.\n\nSo perhaps the claim of four Sugar Bowls is incorrect because there's only one in the table. Or maybe I'm missing some rows where \"Sugar\" is part of the bowl name but not exactly \"Sugar Bowl.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and need to recount.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRows 0-14 (assuming 15 rows):\n\nRow 0: Chick-fil-a\nRow 1: Orange\nRow 2: Orange\nRow 3: Chick-fil-a\nRow 4: Orange\nRow 5: Chick-fil-a\nRow 6: Orange\nRow 7: Sugar Bowl? No, looking at the data, row 7 is for 2009 and it's a Chick-fil-a Bowl.\n\nWait no, in the provided table, let me look at each \"Bowl\" value:\n\nThe table as per the user's message includes rows with bowl names like Orange Bowl, Chick-fil-a Bowl, etc. Specifically, looking through each row:\n\n- 1996: Chick-fil-a\n- 1997: Orange\n- 1998: Orange\n- 1999: Chick-fil-a\n- 2000: Orange\n- 2001: Chick-fil-a\n- 2002: Orange\n- 2003: Chick-fil-a\n- 2004: Orange\n- 2005: Chick-fil-a\n- 2006: Sugar Bowl (attendance 74512)\nWait, perhaps in row 10 it's the Sugar Bowl with attendance 64512.\n\nSo only oneSugar Bowl entry.\n\nTherefore, if the task is to find the total attendances for all four Sugar Bowls, but there's only one in the data, perhaps that's an error or maybe I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps \"four\" refers to another aspect.\n\nBut given the information, I'll proceed with the data provided and sum the attendances for anySugar Bowl entries.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the total attendance for all Sugar Bowls listed, we first identify each occurrence of a Sugar Bowl in the dataset. Upon reviewing the data:\n\n- **2011**: Sugar Bowl with an attendance of 64,512.\n\nThere is only oneSugar Bowl entry in the provided information. Therefore, the total attendance for this singleSugar Bowl event is:\n\n**Total Attendance = 64,512**\n\nIf there were additional Sugar Bowl entries beyond the one listed, we would sum their attendances as well. However, based on the data given, the total remains **64,512**.\n\n**Answer:** The total attendance for all listed Sugar Bowls is \\boxed{64512}.",

But the claim is 491,424.\n\nThis suggests a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in identifying which rows are Sugar Bowl games or their attendances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Sugar Bowl games include more than these four? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow indices where Game is 'Sugar Bowl':\n\n- Row 1: 2013, Sugar Bowl\n\n- Row 4: 2015, Sugar Bowl\n\n- Row 9: 2017, Sugar Bowl\n\n- Row 11: 2018, Sugar Bowl\n\nSo four games.\n\nTheir attendances:\n\nRow 1: 75,868\n\nRow 4: 72,401\n\nRow 9: 39,287\n\nRow 11: 64,512\n\nAdding these together:\n\n75,868 + 72,401 = 148,269\n\n+39,287 = 187,556\n\n+64,512 = 252,068\n\nThis totals to 252,068, which is significantly less than the claimed 491,424.\n\nTherefore, either I've misread the attendances or the games. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a different set of data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more Sugar Bowl games in the table that I missed.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRow indices 0 to 11 (assuming 12 rows):\n\nRow 0: Orange\n\nRow 1: Sugar\n\nRow 2: Orange\n\nRow 3: Chick-fil-a\n\nRow 4: Sugar\n\nRow 5: Chick-fil-a\n\nRow 6: Orange\n\nRow 7: Chick-fil-a\n\nRow 8: Orange\n\nRow 9: Sugar\n\nRow 10: Chick-fil-a\n\nRow 11: Sugar\n\nSo only four Sugar Bowl games as above.\n\nTherefore, the total attendance is approximately 252k. But the user's claim is 491k.\n\nThis suggests either an error in my calculation or perhaps I've misread the attendances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some other rows are alsoSugar Bowls that I missed.\n\nWait, perhaps Row 5 and Row 7 have different games? Let me check:\n\nRow 5: Chick-fil-a Bowl\n\nRow 3: same.\n\nSo no, only four Sugar Bowl games. Therefore, the total attendance is ~252k, not ~491k.\n\nThis suggests that either my approach is incorrect or perhaps there's an error in the data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total attendance for the Sugar Bowl games over four years based on the provided table, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Rows**: Locate the rows where the game is listed as \"Sugar Bowl.\" From the table:\n   - 2013: Attendance of 75,868\n   - 2015: Attendance of 72,401\n   - 2017: Attendance of 39,287\n   - 2018: Attendance of 64,512\n\n2. **Sum the Attendances**: Add the attendances from each Sugar Bowl game:\n   \n   \\[\n   75,868 + 72,401 = 148,269\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   148,269 + 39,287 = 187,556\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   187,556 + 64,512 = 252,068\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total attendance for the Sugar Bowl games over these four years is **252,068**.\n\nHowever, this total does not match the previously mentioned figure of 491,424. It's possible there may be a misunderstanding or error in identifying the correct rows or attendances from the table. To ensure accuracy, double-check the data and verify that all Sugar Bowl games are accounted for correctly.",

The task is to verify the claim: \"6 out of 20 games be the gator bowl, the first in 1994.\" I need to check this against the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has rows from index 0 (1994) up to index 18 (2012). Each row represents a game with details like year, bowl name, result, opponent, stadium, location, and attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. There are 6 Gator Bowl games out of 20.\n2. The first Gator Bowl was in 1994.\n\nI'll start by checking how many times \"Gator Bowl\" appears in the table. Looking through each row:\n\n- 1994: Gator Bowl\n- 1995: Chick-fil-A Bowl\n- 1996: Orange Bowl\n- 1997: Sugar Bowl\n- 1998: Citrus Bowl\n- 1999: Outback Bowl\n- 2000: Gator Bowl\n- 2001: Insight Bowl\n- 2002: Gator Bowl\n- 2003: Cotton Bowl Classic\n- 2004: Gator Bowl\n- 2005: Orange Bowl\n- 2006: Chick-fil-A Bowl\n- 2007: Orange Bowl\n- 2008: Orange Bowl\n- 2009: Chick-fil-A Bowl\n- 2010: Orange Bowl\n- 2011: Sugar Bowl\n- 2012: Russell Athletic Bowl\n\nCounting the Gator Bowls:\n- 1994, 2000, 2002, 2004. That's 4 times, not 6.\n\nNext, checking if the first Gator Bowl was in 1994. Looking at row index 0 (1994), the bowl is indeed the Gator Bowl. So that part is correct.\n\nHowever, since there are only 4 Gator Bowl games and the claim says 6 out of 20, this isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are all rows where the bowl name is \"Gator Bowl\" to count occurrences and check the first occurrence.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"2 out of 20 6 game be hold at memphis memorial stadium in memphis, tn.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I think the claim is stating that two games (out of maybe six or twenty-six?) were held at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. But looking at the table, each row represents a game from 1996 to 2012. Wait, actually, let me count how many rows there are. The table starts at row index 0 (1996) and goes up to row index 15 (2012). So that's 16 games total, not 20 or six. Maybe the claim is misstated.\n\nNext, I need to check if any of these games were held in Memphis Memorial Stadium. Looking at the \"Stadium\" column for each row:\n\n- Row 0: Pro Player Stadium (Miami Gardens)\n- Row 1: Louisiana Superdome (New Orleans)\n- Row 2: Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium (Orlando)\n- Row 3: Sun Life Stadium (Miami Gardens)\n- Row 4: Mercedes-Benz Superdome (New Orleans)\n- ... and so on.\n\nI don't see any mention of Memphis Memorial Stadium in any of the rows. The stadium locations are mostly in Miami, New Orleans, Orlando, etc., but none in Memphis, TN.\n\nSo, since there's no game listed as being held at Memphis Memorial Stadium, the claim that two games were held there is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two games were held at Memphis Memorial Stadium, but checking all relevant cells shows no such games. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
