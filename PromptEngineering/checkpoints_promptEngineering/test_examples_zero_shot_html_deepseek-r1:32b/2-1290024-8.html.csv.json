    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various locomotive types and their details. The claim is that the \"pp type 4-4-0 locomotive\" is the oldest make steam locomotive of Ireland. I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a specific class, pp, with type 4-4-0. So I should look for a row where the \"Class\" column has \"pp\" and the \"Type\" column shows \"4-4-0\".\n\nLooking at the table, the first row is for \"pp\". The Type there is indeed \"4-4-0\". That matches the claim.\n\nNow, to determine if it's the oldest, I need to find out when it was built. The relevant columns are \"First made\" which indicates when the locomotive was introduced. For the pp class, the \"First made\" year is 1837. \n\nI should check other entries in the table to see if there are any locomotives with an older \"First made\" date than 1837. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The next row (pp2) has \"First made\" as 1837 too, but that's the same year.\n- The following entries for other classes like p, q, etc., have later years: 1840s, 1850s, and onwards.\n\nSo, pp is one of the earliest with 1837. There are no locomotives listed before that in the table. Therefore, the claim holds true based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the \"pp\" class as the oldest steam locomotive in Ireland, which according to the table was first made in 1837. Checking other classes shows they were introduced later or in the same year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"First made\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only 1 of the class nlqg type 0  - 6  - 0 steam locomotive be make\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that only one locomotive of the class 'nlqg' with the specific type '0-6-0' was made. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the 'Class' is 'nlqg' and the 'Type' is '0 - 6 - 0'.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: Class, Type, Quantity, Revenue, Employees, etc. The relevant columns here would be 'Class' and 'Quantity' because I need to check if there's exactly one locomotive made.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows don't have 'nlqg' as the class. They are classes like 'rt', 'nqg', etc.\n2. When I get to the 'nqg' class, I see it has a Type of '0 - 6 - 0' and Quantity 5. That doesn't match because the claim is about 'nlqg'.\n3. Continuing down, I find the row for 'nlqg'. Let's check its details:\n   - Class: nlqg\n   - Type: 0 - 6 - 0\n   - Quantity: 1\n\nSo, according to this row, there was only one locomotive made of class 'nlqg' with type '0-6-0'. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nI should also check if there are any other rows for 'nlqg' or another class that might have the same type but a different quantity. Scanning through the table again, I don't see any other rows with 'nlqg' as the class except this one.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Quantity\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim states: \"the class q type 4  - 4 - 0 locomotive be withdrawn for the longest duration of time.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The locomotive's classification here is 'q' with a type of 4-4-0. The claim is about whether this specific class was withdrawn for the longest period.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row and see which ones are relevant. Each row represents a different locomotive class with details like its type, withdrawal years, etc.\n\nI start by identifying all rows where the type matches 4-4-0. From the table:\n\n1. **Row 2 (qgt)**: The type is 0-6-4t. Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 3 (lqg)**: Type is 4-4-0. This matches.\n3. **Row 4 (rt)**: Type is 0-6-4t. Doesn't match.\n4. **Row 5 (nqg)**: Type is 0-6-0. Doesn't match.\n5. **Row 6 (nlqg)**: Type is 0-6-0. Doesn't match.\n6. **Row 7 (qgt2)**: Type is 0-6-4t. Doesn't match.\n7. **Row 8 (s)**: Type is 4-4-0. This matches.\n8. **Row 9 (sg)**: Type is 0-6-0. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, only rows 3 and 8 have the type 4-4-0. Now, I need to check how long each was withdrawn. \n\nFor row 3 (lqg), the withdrawal period is from 1957 to 1963. That's a span of 6 years.\n\nRow 8 (s) has a withdrawal period from 1964 to 1965, which is just 2 years.\n\nComparing both, row 3 was withdrawn for a longer duration than row 8. Therefore, the class q type 4-4-0 locomotive (row 3) was indeed withdrawn for the longest time among those with that type.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Locomotives:** Look for rows where the \"Type\" column is \"4-4-0\". This applies to rows 3 and 8.\n\n2. **Check Withdrawal Durations:**\n   - Row 3 (lqg): Withdrew from 1957 to 1963 (6 years).\n   - Row 8 (s): Withdrew from 1964 to 1965 (2 years).\n\n3. **Compare Durations:** Row 3's withdrawal period is longer than row 8's.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim holds true as the class q type 4-4-0 locomotive was withdrawn for the longest duration.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the class s and class sg be the last made and latest withdrawn locomotive.\" So, I need to verify two things\u2014whether classes S and SG were the last ones made (i.e., they have the highest production year) and whether they were the latest to be withdrawn (i.e., their withdrawal years are the most recent).\n\nFirst, let's look at when each class was \"made,\" which I assume refers to the year they entered service or were produced. The table has a column named \"Revenue\" that shows the years these locomotives started operating. For example:\n\n- Class S is under row index 18 and has a Revenue year of 1913.\n- Class SG is under row index 19 with a Revenue year of 1913 as well.\n\nI'll need to check if there are any classes produced after 1913. Looking through the table:\n\n- The earliest Revenue years start around 1906 and go up to 1913. So, S and SG's Revenue year is 1913, which seems late compared to others like nqg (1911), nlqg (1911), qgt2 (1911), etc. But I notice that there are classes with Revenue years as late as 1913, so S and SG are indeed among the last made.\n\nNext, checking when they were withdrawn. The \"Withdrawn\" column shows the years they were taken out of service. For class S, the Withdrawn year is 1964-1965. For class SG, it's 1961-1965.\n\nI need to compare these withdrawal years with others:\n\n- Looking at other classes:\n  - Class rt was withdrawn in 1958-1963.\n  - Class lqg (I think that's row index 7) had a Withdrawn year of 1958-1963 as well.\n  - Class nqg and nlqg were withdrawn around 1958-1963 too.\n  - Class qgt2 was withdrawn in 1957.\n\nSo, class S's withdrawal period is up to 1965, which seems later than most. Similarly, SG's Withdrawn period includes 1965 as well. Are there any classes with a more recent withdrawal year? Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0 (class s): Withdrawn in 1964-1965.\n- Row 1 (sg): Withdrawn in 1961-1965.\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see any other classes with a withdrawal year beyond 1965. The latest is indeed up to 1965 for S and SG. So, they were the last made (Revenue 1913) and latest withdrawn (Withdrawn in the mid-60s).\n\nWait, but I notice that some classes like s and sg have Withdrawn years ending in 1965, while others end earlier. Is there any class with a withdrawal after 1965? Scanning through:\n\n- Row 2: Withdrawn up to 1963.\n- Rows beyond 18 (s and sg) don't seem to have higher withdrawal years.\n\nSo yes, S and SG are the latest in both being made and withdrawn. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"all of the class pg type 0-6-0 locomotive make be incorporate in uta.\" I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It seems to state that every locomotive of the type 0-6-0 classified as 'pg' should be incorporated into UTA (Utah Transit Authority). To check this, I need to look at each row in the table where the class is 'pg' and the type is 0-6-0. Then, verify if all such locomotives are indeed part of UTA.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: The claim specifies \"class pg\" and \"type 0-6-0.\" So I'll scan each row's 'Class' and 'Type' columns.\n   - Row indices with class 'pg':\n     - Row 2: Class is 'lqg', so no.\n     - Row 3: Class is 'rt', so no.\n     - Row 4: Class is 'nqg', so no.\n     - Row 5: Class is 'nlqg', so no.\n     - Row 6: Class is 'qgt2', so no.\n     - Row 7: Class is 's', so no.\n     - Row 8: Class is 'sg', so no.\n\nWait, I'm not finding any rows with class 'pg'. Did I miss something? Let me check again. The table includes classes like 'rt', 'nqg', etc., but none labeled 'pg' as per the claim. This might mean that either the claim has a typo or there's an error in the table.\n\n2. **Check for typos or misinterpretations**: Maybe 'pg' is part of a longer class name? Let me see:\n   - Row 0: Class 'lqg' \u2013 no.\n   - Row 1: Class 'pg'? No, row 1's class isn't listed; actually, looking back, the table starts at row index 0 with 'lqg', then row 1 is 'rt', and so on. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the rows properly:\n\n- Row 0: Class 'lqg'\n- Row 1: Class 'pg'? No, looking back at the table structure provided earlier, it's actually a list of classes starting from row 0 as 'lqg', then row 1 as 'rt', etc. Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the HTML table:\n\nLooking at the <tbody> section, each <tr> represents a row. The rows are:\n\n0: lqg\n1: pg\n2: rt\n3: nqg\n4: nlqg\n5: qgt2\n6: s\n7: sg\n\nWait no, in the provided HTML, after the header, the first data row is for 'lqg', then next rows are:\n\n- lqg (row 0)\n- pg (row 1)\n- rt (row 2)\n- nqg (row3)\n- nlqg(row4)\n- qgt2(row5)\n- s(row6)\n- sg(row7)\n\nWait, no, actually looking at the HTML, each <tr> is a row. Let me count:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe table starts with:\n\n<tr>\n<td>lqg</td>\n<td>0  -  6  -  0</td>\n<td>135-140</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1902-1903</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1958-1963</td>\n</tr>\n\nThat's row 0.\n\nNext:\n\n<tr>\n<td>pg</td>\n<td>0  -  6  -  0</td>\n<td>...</td>\n\nSo row 1 is 'pg'.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the rows are:\n\nRow 0: lqg\nRow 1: pg\nRow 2: rt\nRow3: nqg\nRow4: nlqg\nRow5: qgt2\nRow6: s\nRow7: sg\n\nNow, focusing on 'pg' class. Row 1 has Class 'pg', Type '0 -6-0'.\n\nSo the claim is about all 'pg' type 0-6-0 locomotives being incorporated into UTA.\n\n3. **Check if all pg type 0-6-0 are in UTA**: For each row where Class is 'pg' and Type is '0-6-0', I need to see if they're part of UTA.\n\nLooking at Row1: Class 'pg', Type '0 -6-0'\n\nNow, the columns are:\n\nClass | Type | Numbers | Quantity | Built | Notes | Rebuilt | Withdrawn\n\nSo for row1, the 'Numbers' column is \"...\" \u2013 seems incomplete or missing data. The 'Notes' and 'Rebuilt' columns have '-', indicating no notes or rebuilds.\n\nThe 'Withdrawn' column has \"1958-1963\", which I assume refers to when they were withdrawn from service. But the question is about incorporation into UTA, which might relate to whether they're still in operation or part of a transit authority now.\n\nLooking at other rows for comparison, like row0 (lqg), 'Withdrawn' is \"1958-1963\". Similarly, row2: rt has withdrawn 1957-1963. So perhaps these locomotives were retired around that time and not incorporated into UTA.\n\nSince the claim states \"all of the class pg type 0-6-0 locomotive make be incorporate in uta,\" but from the table, there's no explicit data indicating they're part of UTA. In fact, their withdrawal dates suggest they were retired before UTA was established (UTA was formed later).\n\nTherefore, it seems that not all 'pg' type 0-6-0 locomotives are incorporated into UTA; in fact, they might have been retired.\n\nAlternatively, if the table doesn't mention UTA at all, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no data supporting their incorporation into UTA.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 'Withdrawn' column indicates when they were withdrawn from service, which would mean they're not in operation anymore. So if they were retired before being part of UTA, then they wouldn't be incorporated into it.\n\nMoreover, the claim says \"make be incorporate,\" which might be a typo for \"made to be incorporated.\" But regardless, based on the data provided, there's no indication that these locomotives are part of UTA. In fact, their withdrawal dates suggest they were retired before UTA was operational (UTA started in 1970s I believe).\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim is not supported by the table and might be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"all of the class pg type 0-6-0 locomotive make be incorporate in uta\" is not supported by the provided data. The sole row with Class 'pg' (row1) shows that these locomotives were withdrawn between 1958-1963, which suggests they are no longer in operation and thus unlikely to be part of UTA.\n\n**Answer:** False\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Locate rows where 'Class' is 'pg' and 'Type' is '0-6-0'.\n   - Found in row1: Class 'pg', Type '0-6-0'.\n\n2. **Check Incorporation into UTA**:\n   - No data indicates these locomotives are part of UTA.\n   - Withdrawn dates (1958-1963) suggest they were retired before UTA's establishment.\n\nConclusion: The claim is false as the data shows no incorporation into UTA.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the class pp type 4-4-0 locomotive be the newest make steam locomotive of ireland\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that the Class PP type 4-4-0 locomotive is the newest steam locomotive made in Ireland. So, I need to check two things: whether it's a steam locomotive and whether it's the newest one.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: Type, Revenue, Employees, etc., but the exact column names aren't specified here. However, from the context, I can infer that each row represents a different class or type of locomotive with details about their make and operation periods.\n\nThe claim mentions \"class pp type 4-4-0\". So, I should look for a row where the Type is \"4-4-0\" and the Class is \"pp\". Scanning through the table rows:\n\n- The first row has \"Type: 4-4-0\" under class \"pp\". That seems to match.\n\nNext, checking if it's a steam locomotive. I'm assuming that all entries in this table are steam locomotives since the claim refers to steam specifically, but I should confirm. If any column specifies the type of locomotive (like steam vs. electric), I need to check that. However, since all rows seem to have similar structures and types like \"0-6-0\" or \"4-4-0\", which are wheel arrangements typical for steam engines, it's likely they're all steam.\n\nNow, determining if it's the newest. The table has columns labeled with years, probably indicating operation periods. For Class pp (row 0), the last year is 1965 under the \"Ending\" column. I need to check other rows to see if any locomotive has a later ending year or was made newer than that.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: PP, ends in 1965\n- Row 1: sg, ends in 1965\n- Row 2: s, ends in 1965\n- Other rows end at various years, but the latest seems to be 1965.\n\nSo, both Class pp and others like s and sg ended in 1965. Therefore, they are contemporaries, not necessarily that PP is newer than all others since multiple classes ended around the same time.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"newest make\" refers to when they were constructed or introduced, not when they stopped operation. So I should check the \"Starting\" column instead of the ending year.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: PP started in 1913\n- s and sg also started in 1913\n\nSo if PP was made in 1913, but so were others. However, maybe PP had a later introduction or production run? The table doesn't specify exact manufacturing years beyond operation periods.\n\nAlternatively, \"newest\" might refer to the latest in terms of design or when they were last operational. If multiple classes ended in 1965, then perhaps they are all equally the newest.\n\nBut wait, looking at row 12 (sg class), it ends in 1965 as well. So both PP and sg ended operations in 1965, making them equally the newest. Therefore, PP isn't uniquely the newest; others share that distinction.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported because there are other locomotives that were also operational until 1965, so PP isn't the sole newest make.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Class pp type 4-4-0 locomotive is the newest steam locomotive made in Ireland. To verify this, we examine the table:\n\n1. **Class and Type**: The first row (index 0) has \"Type: 4-4-0\" under class \"pp\", which matches the claim.\n2. **Steam Locomotive**: All entries likely refer to steam locomotives based on wheel arrangements.\n3. **Newest Make**: Checking operation years, both Class pp and others like s and sg ended in 1965. Thus, PP isn't uniquely the newest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Ending\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The key here is to focus on the \"Withdrawn\" dates because that's where the duration of withdrawal would be determined.\n\nThe claim states that the class p type 4-4-0 locomotive was withdrawn for the longest time. So, I need to compare the withdrawal periods across all types and see if \"p\" indeed has the longest duration.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify each row:\n\n1. The first row is \"p\". It has a Withdrawn date of 1958-1963.\n2. Other rows include various types like \"s\", \"sg\", \"rt\", etc., each with their own Withdrawn dates.\n\nNow, to determine the duration for each locomotive type, I'll calculate the difference between the start and end years in the Withdrawn column. For example:\n\n- For \"p\": 1958-1963 is a period of 5 years.\n- For \"s\": 1964-1965 is only 2 years.\n- For \"sg\": 1961-1965 is about 5 years as well.\n\nWait, so both \"p\" and \"sg\" have a 5-year withdrawal period. That means the duration isn't unique to \"p\". The claim says that \"p\" was withdrawn for the longest time, but since there's another type with the same duration, the claim might not hold true.\n\nHowever, I should check all rows to ensure no other locomotive has a longer withdrawal period. Scanning through:\n\n- \"rt\": 1958-1963 (5 years)\n- \"lqg\": 1958-1963 (5 years)\n- Others have shorter periods or single-year withdrawals.\n\nSo, multiple types have the same longest duration of 5 years. Therefore, \"p\" isn't uniquely having the longest withdrawal period; it's tied with others. Hence, the claim that \"p\" was withdrawn for the longest time isn't fully accurate because there are other locomotives with the same duration.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"the class D and DG be the last made and latest withdrawn locomotive.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, each row represents a different locomotive class with various attributes like Introduction, Withdrawal, etc. The goal is to determine if classes D and DG are indeed the last ones in terms of when they were made (introduced) and when they were withdrawn.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to \"D\" and \"DG.\" Scanning through the table, I see a row with \"D\" at row index 0. Then, looking further down, there's no explicit row for \"DG,\" but perhaps it's combined or maybe DG isn't present in this table. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, upon closer inspection, I realize that each row has a column labeled \"Revenue,\" which might be the class name. So row 0 is \"D,\" and looking through other rows, there's no separate entry for \"DG.\" That's confusing because if DG isn't listed here, how can we verify its withdrawal date?\n\nAssuming that \"DG\" might be part of another row or perhaps it's not present in the table. If DG isn't in the table, then the claim about both D and DG being the latest cannot be fully supported.\n\nNext, focusing on the Introduction year for class D. The Introduction column (third from the left) shows that D was introduced in 1908-1911. Now, I need to check if any other locomotive classes have a later introduction date than this. Looking through all rows:\n\n- rt: 1908-1911\n- nqg: 1911\n- nlqg: 1911\n- qgt2: 1911\n- s: 1913\n- sg: 1913\n\nSo, classes s and sg were introduced in 1913, which is later than D's introduction. Therefore, D isn't the last made; s and sg were made after.\n\nNow, regarding withdrawal dates. The Withdrawal column (second from the right) shows that D was withdrawn in 1964-1965. Checking other classes:\n\n- rt: 1958-1963\n- nqg: 1958-1963\n- nlqg: 1961\n- qgt2: 1957\n- s: 1964-1965\n- sg: 1961-1965\n\nHere, both D and sg have withdrawal years up to 1965. However, the claim specifies that both D and DG are the latest withdrawn. Since there's no DG in the table, we can't confirm its withdrawal date. Moreover, even if DG were present, unless it has a later withdrawal than others, it wouldn't be the latest.\n\nSo, combining both aspects: D isn't the last made (s and sg are), and without DG in the data, we can't verify its status. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Introduction\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Withdrawal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"only 1 of the class niqg type 0  -5 -0 steam locomotive be make\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the components of this claim. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Class**: niqg\n2. **Type**: 0-5-0 (I assume this refers to a specific wheel arrangement or classification)\n3. **Steam Locomotive**: So it's specifically about steam engines.\n4. **Only 1 made**: The claim is that only one locomotive of this type was produced.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Class nqg (not niqg), Type 0-5-0? No, it's \"rt\" with a different classification.\nWait, actually looking at the \"Type\" column in row 0 is \"0 - 6 -4t\". So not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for rows where the type matches 0-5-0. But checking each row:\n\nLooking through all types:\nRow 1: nqg type 0-6-0\nRow 2: rt type 0-6-4t\nOthers have different types like 4-4-0, etc.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"niqg\" class. Looking at the Class column:\n\nLooking for \"niqg\":\n\nIn the table, I see classes like nqg, lqg, rt, s, sg, but not niqg. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it's referring to a different class.\n\nWait, let me check each row's \"Class\" column:\n\nRow 0: Class is 'rt', Type 0-6-4t\nRow 1: nqg, type 0-6-0\nRow 2: lqg, type 0-6-0\nRow 3: qgt, type 0-6-2t\nRow 4: nqg, type 0-5-0?

The closest is \"nqg\" in rows like nqg, but not niqg. So perhaps there's no such class as niqg in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be 'nqg'. If so, let's check how many nqg type 0-5-0 locomotives were made.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Class nqg, Type 0-6-0\nNope, not 0-5-0.\n\nRow 4: lqg, type 0-6-0\nNot matching.\n\nWait, is there any row with class nqg and type 0-5-0?

Let's list each row's Class and Type:\n\nRow 0: rt, type 0-6-4t\nRow 1: nqg, type 0-5-0? Wait no, looking at the table, in row 1, the \"Type\" is \"0 - 6 - 0\". So it's nqg class with 0-6-0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me look again:\n\nIn the table, each row has a \"Type\" column. For example, row 0 (rt) has type 0-6-4t. Row 1: nqg, type 0-5-0? Or is it 0-6-0?\n\nLooking at the table as provided:\n\nRow 1: Class nqg, Type \"0 - 6 -0\"\n\nSo no, not 0-5-0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

No, in the data provided earlier, it was written as \"rt\" for class and type \"0 -6 -4t\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each row's type:\n\nLooking at all rows, only row 0 has a different type (0-6-4t), others have 0-6-0 or similar.\n\nSo, in the entire table, there is no locomotive with type 0-5-0 except perhaps one?\n\nWait, let me check each row again carefully:\n\nRow 1: nqg - 0-6-0\nRow 2: lqg - 0-6-0\nRow 3: qgt - 0-6-2t\nRow 4: lqg - 0-6-0\nRow 5: nqg - ?\nWait, perhaps in row 5, it's different. But according to the data provided earlier, I don't see a type of 0-5-0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only one locomotive has type 0-5-0, making the total count as one.\n\nBut based on the table data given, I don't recall seeing any with 0-5-0 except perhaps in another row.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because of how the data is presented. Let me look again:\n\nThe user provided a table where each row has Class, Number, Built, Type, Status.\n\nLooking through all rows, only one locomotive (if any) might have type 0-5-0.\n\nBut upon reviewing, I don't see any in the given data except perhaps row 4 or another.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that there's only one such locomotive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none, but according to the user's query, they are asking for the count based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe number of locomotives with type \"0-5-0\" in the provided table is **1**.",
