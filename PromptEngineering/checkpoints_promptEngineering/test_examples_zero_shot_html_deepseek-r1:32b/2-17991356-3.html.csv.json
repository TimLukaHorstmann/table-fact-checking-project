The claim states: \"all of the 7 player in the 2003 pga championship be from the united state.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for player name, country, year won, total, and to par. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"2003 PGA Championship,\" but when I examine the 'year won' column in the table, the years listed are 1993, 1997, 1996, 1991, 1986, 1988, and 2002. There's no entry for 2003. This suggests that the data provided doesn't include information about the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\nSince the table doesn't have any players from 2003, it can't be used to verify if all seven players in that year were from the United States. Without relevant data for 2003, I can't confirm the claim as TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because the information required isn't present in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells here are all the 'year won' entries since they don't include 2003, indicating a lack of necessary data to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"all of the 7 player in the 2003 pga championship be from the united state,\" we check each player's country and year. The table lacks any entries for 2003, so we can't confirm all players were from the U.S.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year won\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So yes, Mark Brooks does have the highest total.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For Mark Brooks, I need the \"player\" and \"total\" columns.\n- To confirm it's the highest, I should compare his total against all others, so each player's \"total\" is relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells are every row's \"total\" column to ensure 181 is indeed the maximum.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"davis love iii do not win in 1996 or 1991\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: player, country, year won, total, and to par. There are seven rows of data corresponding to different players.\n\nThe claim is about Davis Love III not winning in either 1996 or 1991. So I need to check if there's any entry for him that shows he won in those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player and their respective details. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row is Paul Azinger from the United States who won in 1993.\n2. The second row is Davis Love III, also from the United States, with the year won as 1997. His total is 149 and to par is +9.\n3. Mark Brooks won in 1996 with a total of 181 and +11 to par.\n4. John Daly's win was in 1991, totaling 151 with +11.\n5. Bob Tway won in 1986.\n6. Jeff Sluman in 1988.\n7. Rich Beem in 2002.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Davis Love III's entry shows he won in 1997, not 1996 or 1991. So the claim is saying he didn't win in those years, which is correct because his only listed win was in 1997. \n\nAdditionally, checking other rows, Mark Brooks did win in 1996, and John Daly won in 1991. But since the claim is about Davis Love III specifically, those entries don't affect our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify this are Davis Love III's row where year won is 1997. So we need to highlight that specific cell in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Davis Love III did not win in 1996 or 1991. Checking the table, Davis Love III's win was in 1997, so the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year won\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"paul azinger and davis love iii each have the same number as their total : 149.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to find where Paul Azinger and Davis Love III are listed.\n\nLooking at the HTML table:\n\n- The first row after the header has Paul Azinger. Let me check his 'total' value.\n- The second row is Davis Love III; I'll check his 'total' as well.\n\nIn the first row (row index 0), under the 'total' column, it shows 149 for Paul Azinger.\nIn the second row (row index 1), under the same 'total' column, Davis Love III also has a value of 149.\n\nSo both players have the same total score. The claim is correct because their totals are indeed equal at 149 each.\n\nNow, I'll list the relevant cells. Both rows have their respective 'total' entries that support this claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Paul Azinger and Davis Love III both have a total of 149.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a table here with information about various players in the PGA Championship, including their country, year won, total score, and to par. The claim is: \"3 of the 7 2003 pga championship player have to par +11.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"2003 PGA Championship players,\" so my first step should be to look into the table and see if there are any entries from the year 2003. Let me go through each row in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'year won' column:\n\n- Paul Azinger: 1993\n- Davis Love III: 1997\n- Mark Brooks: 1996\n- John Daly: 1991\n- Bob Tway: 1986\n- Jeff Sluman: 1988\n- Rich Beem: 2002\n\nHmm, none of the entries have a 'year won' of 2003. The closest is Rich Beem in 2002. So, does that mean there are no players from 2003 in this table? That seems to be the case.\n\nNow, the claim says \"3 of the 7 2003 PGA Championship player have to par +11.\" Wait a minute, the table only has 7 rows, but they're all for different years. So, if there are no players from 2003 in this table, how can we verify anything about them? It seems like the claim is making a statement about players from 2003, which aren't present here.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The claim refers to \"7 2003 pga championship player,\" but in our table, there are only 7 entries total, not necessarily all from 2003. In fact, as we saw, none of them are from 2003. So the table doesn't include any players from that year.\n\nTherefore, since there are no 2003 players in the table, it's impossible for 3 of them to have a 'to par' of +11 because those players aren't even listed here. The claim is making an assertion about data that isn't present in our table.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The table doesn't include any entries from the 2003 PGA Championship. Therefore, we can't confirm or support the claim based on this table. Hence, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any players from the 2003 PGA Championship. Therefore, it's impossible to have 3 players from that year with a 'to par' of +11.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim mentions 2003 PGA championship players, so I should check if any of the entries in the table correspond to that year.\n\nLooking through each row under the \"year won\" column:\n- Paul Azinger: 1993\n- Davis Love III: 1997\n- Mark Brooks: 1996\n- John Daly: 1991\n- Bob Tway: 1986\n- Jeff Sluman: 1988\n- Rich Beem: 2002\n\nNone of these players have a \"year won\" of 2003. The most recent year in the table is 2002 for Rich Beem. Therefore, there are no players listed as having won in 2003.\n\nSince the claim refers to 5 out of 7 players from the 2003 championship, but our table doesn't include any data from that year, we can conclude that the information required to support this claim isn't present. Thus, the claim is false because there's no evidence in the provided table about the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\nAdditionally, even if I consider the possibility of a typo and check for players with \"+11\" to par regardless of the year, only three players (Mark Brooks, John Daly, Bob Tway) have that statistic.
