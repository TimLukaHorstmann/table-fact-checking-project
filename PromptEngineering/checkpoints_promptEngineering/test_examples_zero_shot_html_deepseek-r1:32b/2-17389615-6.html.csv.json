    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 5 team with no championship, and only 1 with a championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are 'team', 'sport', 'played', 'venue', and 'championships'. Since all teams listed are under football, that's consistent across all rows.\n\nThe claim mentions two parts:\n1. Five teams have no championships.\n2. Only one team has a championship.\n\nI'll start by examining the 'championships' column for each row to see which teams have championships and which don't.\n\nLooking at the first five rows (row indices 0 to 4), I see that each of these entries under 'championships' says \"none\". So, Evansville Crimson Giants, Evansville Vipers, Evansville Bluecats, Evansville Express, and Tri-State Titans all have no championships. That's five teams without any.\n\nNow, checking the sixth row (row index 5), the team is Ohio River Bearcats, and under 'championships', it says \"gmfl title 2008\". This indicates that this team has at least one championship. So, there's exactly one team with a championship.\n\nPutting it all together: five teams without championships and one team with a championship. That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Championships = none \u2705\n- Row 1: Championships = none \u2705\n- Row 2: Championships = none \u2705\n- Row 3: Championships = none \u2705\n- Row 4: Championships = none \u2705\n- Row 5: Championships = gmfl title 2008 \u2705\n\nYes, that's consistent. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll list out the relevant cells to support this conclusion. Each of the first five rows in the 'championships' column shows \"none\", and the sixth row shows a championship. So, each of these cells is relevant.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE with all these cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the venue that be use the most be goebel soccer complex\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems there might be a typo in the phrasing. The intended meaning appears to be: \"The venue used the most is Goebel Soccer Complex.\" So, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nNext, I should look at the table to find out how often each venue was used. Let's go through each row and note the venues:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants: Played 1921-1922 at Bosse Field.\n2. Evansville Vipers: Played 2000-2007 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n3. Evansville Bluecats: Played 2003-2007 at Roberts Municipal Stadium.\n4. Evansville Express: Played 2004-2005 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n5. Tri-State Titans: Played 2008-2009 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n6. Ohio River BEARCats: Played 2008-2010 at Reitz Bowl.\n\nNow, let's count how many times each venue was used:\n\n- Bosse Field: Once (Row 0)\n- Goebel Soccer Complex: Three times (Rows 1, 4, and 5)\n- Roberts Municipal Stadium: Once (Row 2)\n- Reitz Bowl: Once (Row 5)\n\nWait a second, looking back at the table, actually:\n\nWait, for row 5, it's the Ohio River BEARCats who played at Reitz Bowl. So:\n\nGoebel Soccer Complex is listed in rows 1 (Vipers), 4 (Express), and 5 (Titans). That makes three instances.\n\nOther venues: Bosse Field once, Roberts Municipal Stadium once, Reitz Bowl once.\n\nSo Goebel Soccer Complex was the venue used the most, with three entries. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nEach time Goebel Soccer Complex appears in the 'venue' column, we need to note those rows and columns.\n\nRows 1,4,5 have 'Goebel Soccer Complex' as their venue. So the relevant cells are in the 'venue' column for each of these rows.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant_venues being rows 1,4,5 under 'venue'.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_venues\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, the instructions specify to use 'relevant_ cells' as a list of row indices and column names. Since I'm considering only the venue column for these rows:\n\nBut looking back at the data structure in the example, it's a list with each object having \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So, correcting that:\n\nThe correct JSON should be:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_venues\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut wait, in the original instruction, it's 'relevant_ cells' as a list of row indices and column names. Since each venue is in the same column, I need to list each occurrence.\n\nSo, for rows where venue is Goebel Soccer Complex:\n\nRows 1: Vipers - Goebel\nRow 4: Express - Goebel\nRow 5: Titans - Goebel\n\nTherefore, three entries in 'venue' column. So the JSON should reflect that.\n\nBut looking back at my thought process, I realized that row 5 is actually the Tri-State Titans, not Ohio River BEARCats. Because the last row is \"ohio river bearcats\" which played at Reitz Bowl, so Goebel was in rows 1 (Vipers), 4 (Express), and 5 (Titans). Therefore, three times.\n\nHence, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_venues\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine if the claim \"the event at the reitz bowl take place after the event at bosse field\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to identify which teams played at Reitz Bowl and Bosse Field.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first row mentions \"bosse field\" as the venue for \"evansville crimson giants\" from 1921 - 1922.\n- Scanning further, I see that \"ohio river bearcats\" played at \"reitz bowl\" from 2008 - 2010.\n\nSo, the events at Bosse Field occurred in the early 1920s, and the event at Reitz Bowl took place much later, starting in 2008. This means the Reitz Bowl event indeed happened after the Bosse Field event.\n\nTo support this, I'll note the relevant cells:\n- The first row (index 0) under \"venue\" column shows \"bosse field\".\n- The sixth row (index 5) under \"venue\" column shows \"reitz bowl\".\n\nThese two pieces of information are crucial in verifying the timeline of events.

So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"4 of the team have the name evansville in their team name\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the table structure. The table has six rows and five columns: team, sport, played, venue, championships. Each row represents a different football team with various details.\n\nThe claim specifically talks about teams whose names include \"evansville.\" So my focus is on the 'team' column in each row. I need to count how many of these teams have \"evansville\" as part of their name.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row:** The team is \"evansville crimson giants.\" Clearly, it starts with \"evansville,\" so that's one.\n2. **Second Row:** The team is \"evansville vipers.\" Again, the name begins with \"evansville,\" making it two.\n3. **Third Row:** Here, the team is \"evansville bluecats.\" Starts with \"evansville\" again, so now three.\n4. **Fourth Row:** The team is \"evansville express.\" Once more, \"evansville\" is at the beginning, bringing the count to four.\n5. **Fifth Row:** This team is \"tri-state titans.\" There's no mention of \"evansville\" here.\n6. **Sixth Row:** The team name is \"ohio river bearcats,\" which also doesn't include \"evansville.\"\n\nSo, after checking all six teams, four of them have \"evansville\" in their names. This matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: since we're only concerned with the 'team' column to verify if each team's name includes \"evansville,\" the relevant cells are all the entries under the 'team' column for rows 0 through 3 (indices 0 to 3). Each of these rows contributes to confirming that four teams have \"evansville\" in their names.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or potential errors here. The claim is straightforward, and each team name was clearly checked against the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that four teams have \"evansville\" in their names.

To verify this, I'll look through the table for any mention of the GMFL title and the corresponding team.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it means that Bosse Field was the most frequently used venue among all the venues listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing different football teams with details about when they played, their venue, and championships. The columns we're interested in are \"team\", \"played\", and \"venue\".\n\nI'll list out the venues from each row:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants: Bosse Field\n2. Evansville Vipers: Goebel Soccer Complex\n3. Evansville Bluecats: Roberts Municipal Stadium\n4. Evansville Express: Goebel Soccer Complex\n5. Tri-State Titans: Goebel Soccer Complex\n6. Ohio River Bearcats: Reitz Bowl\n\nNow, I need to count how many times each venue appears.\n\n- Bosse Field: 1 (only the Crimson Giants)\n- Goebel Soccer Complex: 3 (Vipers, Express, Titans)\n- Roberts Municipal Stadium: 1 (Bluecats)\n- Reitz Bowl: 1 (Bearcats)\n\nSo, Goebel Soccer Complex is used three times, which is more than any other venue. Bosse Field was only used once.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Bosse Field is the most used venue\" is FALSE because it's actually Goebel Soccer Complex that's used the most.\n\nTo support this, I'll look at each row where the venue is mentioned:\n\n- Row 0: Bosse Field\n- Rows 1, 3, and 4: Goebel Soccer Complex\n- Row 2: Roberts Municipal Stadium\n- Row 5: Reitz Bowl\n\nSo the relevant cells are the \"venue\" column for all rows. But since we're specifically checking which venue is used the most, I can note that Bosse Field appears only once while others have higher counts.\n\nWait, but to verify the claim about Bosse Field being the most used, I need to check all instances where the venue was used and compare their frequencies. So each row's \"venue\" cell is relevant because they show which venues were used by each team during their active years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bosse Field was the most used venue.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the event robert municipal stadium take place before the event at boose field.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like we're comparing two venues where events took place and determining the order of these events\u2014specifically whether Robert Municipal Stadium had an event before Bosse Field did.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows with different teams and their details. Each row has information about the team, sport, played years, venue, and championships. The claim mentions two venues: Robert Municipal Stadium and Bosse Field.\n\nLet me scan through each row to find where these venues appear.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. The first row is \"evansville crimson giants\" playing football at Bosse Field between 1921-1922.\n2. The second row mentions Goebel Soccer Complex, which isn't relevant here.\n3. The third row lists \"roberts municipal stadium,\" so that's Robert Municipal Stadium, home to the evansville bluecats from 2003-2007.\n\nWait a minute, Bosse Field was used by the crimson giants in the early 1920s, while Robert Municipal Stadium was used later in the mid-2000s. So, the events at Robert Municipal Stadium happened much after those at Bosse Field.\n\nSo, the claim is suggesting that the event at Robert Municipal Stadium took place before Bosse Field's event. But according to the table, that's not correct because 1921-1922 comes way before 2003-2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: The rows with venues Robert Municipal Stadium and Bosse Field are rows 2 (index starting from 0) and 0 respectively. The columns in question are 'venue' and 'played'.\n\nSo, compiling this, I'll note that row 2's venue is Robert Municipal Stadium, played from 2003-2007, and row 0's venue is Bosse Field, played from 1921-1922. Since 2003 is after 1921, the event at Robert Municipal Stadium happened later.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"played\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"there be only 2 team that have the word evansville in their team name.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: team, sport, played, venue, championships. Since the claim is about team names containing 'evansville,' I should focus on the 'team' column.\n\nLooking through each row's 'team' entry:\n\n1. Row 0: \"evansville crimson giants\" - contains 'evansville'.\n2. Row 1: \"evansville vipers\" - contains 'evansville'.\n3. Row 2: \"evansville bluecats\" - contains 'evansville'.\n4. Row 3: \"evansville express\" - contains 'evansville'.\n5. Row 4: \"tri- state titans\" - does not contain 'evansville'.\n6. Row 5: \"ohio river bearcats\" - does not contain 'evansville'.\n\nSo, there are four teams with 'evansville' in their names: rows 0,1,2,3. The claim says only two such teams exist, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the evansville viper win the championship at goebel soccer complex\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by carefully reading and understanding the claim. It states that the Evansville Vipers won a championship at Goebel Soccer Complex. To verify this, I need to check the table for any information related to the Evansville Vipers winning a championship and if that took place at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: team, sport, played, venue, championships. So, relevant columns here are 'team', 'championships', and 'venue'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries related to the Evansville Vipers. Scanning the first few rows:\n\n- The first row is about the Evansville Crimson Giants, which isn't relevant.\n- The second row mentions the Evansville Vipers. Let's look at their details:\n  - Played: 2000 - 2007\n  - Venue: Goebel Soccer Complex\n  - Championships: None\n\nSo, according to this data, the Evansville Vipers did play at Goebel Soccer Complex but didn't win any championships. The 'championships' column explicitly states \"none\" for them.\n\nI should also check if there are any other teams that might be related or if I missed anything. The subsequent rows mention other teams like Evansville Bluecats, Express, Tri-State Titans, and Ohio River Bearcats. None of these have championships listed either except the Ohio River Bearcats, which won a GMFL title in 2008 at Reitz Bowl.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the Evansville Vipers didn't win any championship, let alone at Goebel Soccer Complex. This means the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the table shows that the Evansville Vipers played at Goebel Soccer Complex but did not win a championship.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
