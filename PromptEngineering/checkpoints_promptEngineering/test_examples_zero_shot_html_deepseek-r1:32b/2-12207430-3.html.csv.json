    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the date the Kansas City Royal beat the Blue Jays with a record of 18-12 after May 12th.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Team Involved**: The Kansas City Royals.\n2. **Opponent**: The Blue Jays (likely Toronto Blue Jays).\n3. **Result**: The Royals beat them.\n4. **Record After May 12th**: Specifically, after May 12th, their record was 18-12.\n\nLooking at the table headers: it's a bit unclear because the table columns aren't labeled clearly. From the data, I can infer that the columns might be something like Date, Team, Opponent, Result, Record. But to be precise, let me check each row.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: May 3 - Royals vs Blue Jays, record after is 18-12. Wait, but the date is May 3rd, which is before May 12th. So this doesn't fit because we need a date after May 12th.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 7 (assuming rows start at 0): May 16 - Royals vs Blue Jays again, with a record of 18-12. That's after May 12th. So that fits the claim.\n\nWait, but let me count the rows properly to get the correct row indices. The first row is index 0 (May 3), then each subsequent date increments the index.\n\nSo, checking for dates after May 12:\n\n- May 16: That's the next game against Blue Jays. So in the table, that would be row 4 perhaps? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: May 3\nRow 1: May 5\nRow 2: May 7\nRow 3: May 9\nRow 4: May 10\nRow 5: May 12\nRow 6: May 13\nRow 7: May 14\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list the dates with their row indices:\n\n- Row 0: May 3\n- Row 1: May 5\n- Row 2: May 7\n- Row 3: May 8 (probably)\n- Row 4: May 9\nWait, actually, looking back at the table, the first data row is May 3, then each subsequent row adds a day. So perhaps:\n\nRow 0: May 3\nRow 1: May 5\nRow 2: May 7\nRow 3: May 8\nRow 4: May 9\nRow 5: May 10\nRow 6: May 12\nRow 7: May 13\nRow 8: May 14\nRow 9: May 16\n\nWait, the table shows:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>May 3</tr>\n<tr>May 5</tr>\n<tr>May 7</tr>\n<tr>May 8</tr>\n<tr>May 9</tr>\n<tr>May 10</tr>\n<tr>May 12</tr>\n<tr>May 13</tr>\n<tr>May 14</tr>\n<tr>May 16</tr>\n...\n</tbody>\n\nSo, the May 16 game is row 9.\n\nIn that row (row 9), it's May 16, Royals vs Blue Jays, record after is 18-12. So this fits the claim because it's after May 12th and the record matches.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it says \"the date\" which implies a specific date when they had that record after May 12th. Since there's only one game against Blue Jays on May 16 with that record, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim: \"the kansas city royal victory over the toronto blue jay on may 12th drop the blue jays' record to 18 - 12\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is saying that on May 12th, the Kansas City Royals won a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, and as a result, the Blue Jays' overall record dropped to 18 wins and 12 losses.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant information to check this. The table has columns like \"Date\", \"Opponent\", \"Score\", \"Starting Pitcher\", \"Attendance\", and \"Record\". \n\nI'll start by searching for May 12th in the Date column. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row with Date: may 12th. Let me check what happened on that day.\n\nOn May 12th, the opponent was the Kansas City Royals (Royal). The score shows they won against the Blue Jays (Bj), so that part checks out\u2014the Royals did win. Now, I need to see what the Blue Jays' record was after this game. \n\nIn the \"Record\" column for that row, it says 18-12. That's exactly what the claim is stating\u2014that their record dropped to 18 wins and 12 losses after this game.\n\nWait a minute, but I should also consider if there were any other games around May 12th that might affect the Blue Jays' record. Looking at the table, right before May 12th, on May 9th and May 10th, the Blue Jays played against the Royals as well. Let me check those records.\n\nOn May 9th: The score was 4-3 (Bj), so that's a win for the Blue Jays. Their record after that game was 18-11. Then on May 10th, they won again with a score of 7-2 (Bj). So their record went up to 19-11.\n\nBut then on May 12th, the Royals won, so the Blue Jays lost that game. That would bring their record down from 19-11 to 18-12 after that loss. Wait, but looking at the table's \"Record\" column for May 12th, it's 18-12 for the Blue Jays. But I thought they had a higher record before this game.\n\nWait no\u2014maybe I'm misreading. The \"Record\" column in the table shows the Blue Jays' record after each game. So on May 9th: 18-11 (Blue Jays won), then May 10th: 19-11 (another win). Then, May 12th: 18-12 (a loss). That makes sense because they had two wins before and one loss here.\n\nSo the claim says that after this victory by the Royals on May 12th, the Blue Jays' record dropped to 18-12. Based on the table, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}]}",
