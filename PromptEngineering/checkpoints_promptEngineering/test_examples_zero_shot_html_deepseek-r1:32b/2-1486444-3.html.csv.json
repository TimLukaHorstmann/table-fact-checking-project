    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table of fight events and a specific claim about an event on March 18th, 2003 in Tokyo where the fighter battled Rumina Sato at the SHOOTO 2003 event. My task is to verify if this claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to:\n1. The date: March 18th.\n2. The location: Tokyo, Japan.\n3. The event name: SHOOTO 2003.\n4. The fighter he battled with: Rumina Sato.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if these details match any of the entries.\n\nLet me go through the rows one by one:\n\n- **Row 16:** Event is SHOOTO 2003: Year - End Show. Location is Chiba, Japan. Date isn't specified here but it's for the year end.\n- **Row 15:** Event is SHOOTO 2003: March 18th. Wait, I need to check that.\n\nWait, looking back at row indices might be a bit confusing since tables start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nThe table starts with row 0 as the header, then rows 1 through let's see how many there are. From the data provided, it seems there are multiple events in 2003.\n\nLooking for SHOOTO 2003: March 18th, I find a row where:\n- Event Name: SHOOTO 2003: 3/18\n- Opponent: Rumina Sato\n\nLet me check the details of that specific row. The opponent is indeed Rumina Sato, and the event name includes \"SHOOTO 2003\" with the date 3/18, which I assume stands for March 18th. The location is Tokyo, Japan as per the table.\n\nWait, in the table, under 'Event Name' for that row, it's listed as SHOOTO 2003: 3/18. That should correspond to March 18th. So yes, this matches the claim.\n\nAlso, checking the location column for that row: Tokyo, Japan, which aligns with the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table as it correctly identifies the event name, date, location, and opponent. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Event Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to verify a claim based on the data in the table provided. The claim is: \"at dream 11 , his fight with shinya aoki go to 4:56\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. It seems like the person is talking about a specific event or fight that happened at something called \"dream 11\" where someone fought Shinya Aoki and the duration was 4 minutes and 56 seconds.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: Result, Opponent, Method, Event, Round, Time, Location. So I need to check if there's a row in this table that matches the details of the claim.\n\nThe key pieces of information from the claim are:\n1. The event name is \"dream 11\".\n2. The opponent is Shinya Aoki.\n3. The time duration was 4:56 minutes.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nStarting from the top, I check each Event column for \"dream 11\". Looking through all the events listed like 'CW 3', 'Fire Fight 5', etc., I don't see any entry that says \"dream 11\".\n\nWait, maybe it's not in the table at all. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Scanning through each row, none of them mention an event called \"dream 11\". So if the event isn't present, there's no way the fight with Shinya Aoki happened here.\n\nAdditionally, looking for the opponent Shinya Aoki in the Opponent column, I don't see his name listed either. The opponents include names like 'Rumina Sato', 'Takumi Nakayama', etc., but not Shinya Aoki.\n\nSince neither the event nor the specific opponent is present in the table, there's no way to support the claim that at \"dream 11\", there was a fight with Shinya Aoki lasting 4:56. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any entries for an event named \"dream 11\" or an opponent named Shinya Aoki.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"his fight at pride bushido 10 end via ko with a knee strike\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific event: a fight at \"Pride Bushido 10\" that ended with a KO (knockout) using a knee strike. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the Event is Pride Bushido 10 and the Result or Method of victory was KO via knee.\n\nLooking at the table columns: there's an \"Event\" column and a \"Method\" column which probably indicates how the fight ended. The other relevant information might be the opponent and perhaps the round or time, but for this claim, the main points are Event name and method of knockout.\n\nNow I'll go through each row to find any mention of Pride Bushido 10. Let me scan the \"Event\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Event is \"Pride Bushido 10\". That's a match.\n- The rest of the rows don't have that event name.\n\nSo, looking at Row 0, the Method is listed as KO (knee strike). That aligns perfectly with the claim\u2014KO via knee. \n\nTherefore, since there's a direct match in both Event and Method, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the \"Event\" and \"Method\" columns from Row 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies two key pieces of information: the event name (\"Pride Bushido 10\") and the method of knockout (\"KO with a knee strike\"). Checking the table:\n\n- **Row 0** has Event as \"Pride Bushido 10\" and Method as \"KO (knee strike)\", which matches the claim exactly.\n\nThus, both conditions are satisfied, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is about an event called \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" being held in Turku, Finland with an opponent named Rumina Sato. I need to check if this claim is true or false based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any mention of \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". Scanning through the rows, I see that one of the events listed is \"shooto 2003: 3  / 18\" in row index 9. That seems like a match.\n\nNext, I need to check where this event took place. Looking at the 'Location' column for that row, it says \"tokyo, japan\". Hmm, that's different from Turku, Finland as mentioned in the claim. So according to the table, the location is Tokyo, not Turku.\n\nNow, about the opponent: The claim mentions Rumina Sato as the opponent. In row index 9, under the 'Opponent' column, it indeed says \"rumina sato\". So that part matches.\n\nSo putting it together: The event name and opponent match, but the location doesn't. Since the claim specifies Turku, Finland, which isn't what's in the table, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe event \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" does have an opponent of Rumina Sato, but it took place in Tokyo, Japan, not Turku, Finland.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"Pride Bushido 10 never have KO (knee) method\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, I'll carefully read the claim and understand what it's stating. It claims that in Pride Bushido 10 events, there are no instances where a match ended with a Knockout via knee strikes. So, my goal is to check the table for any matches associated with Pride Bushido 10 that resulted in a KO (knee).\n\nNext, I'll examine the table structure and identify which columns contain relevant information. The key columns here would be:\n\n- **Event**: To find matches from \"Pride Bushido 10.\"\n- **Method**: To check if any of these matches ended with a \"KO (knee).\"\n\nLooking at each row in the table, I need to scan through the 'Event' and 'Method' columns. Starting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Event is \"Pride Bushido 12\", Method is \"Submission.\" Not relevant.\n\nRow 1: Event is \"Bellator 237,\" Method is \"TKO (punches).\" Different event, so ignore.\n\nRow 2: Event is \"Rizin 9,\" Method is \"Decision (unanimous).\" Again, not the event we're interested in.\n\nContinuing this process for each row:\n\nRows 3 to 16 don't mention \"Pride Bushido\" at all. Some events are different promotions or other PrideBushido numbers but not 10.\n\nFinally, checking Row 17: Event is \"Pride Bushido 10,\" and the Method is \"KO (knee).\" Oh, this directly contradicts the claim because it shows that in Pride Bushido 10, there was a match that ended with a KO via knee. \n\nSince we found at least one instance where the method was \"KO (knee)\" in Pride Bushido 10, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells:\n\n- The 'Event' column in Row 17 tells us it's Pride Bushido 10.\n- The 'Method' column in Row 17 shows \"KO (knee),\" which supports that such a method was used.\n\nSo, these two cells are crucial for verifying the claim. Therefore, the relevant_cells should include both of these entries with their respective row indexes and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. I have a table with various rows and columns, each containing data about different matches or fights. The claim is \"round 3 be at 3:50.\" My task is to check if this claim is true based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It seems like it's stating that in round 3 of a particular fight, the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds (or perhaps some other measurement, but given the context, it's likely referring to the duration or timing at which something happened in round 3). So I'm looking for any row where there is a Round 3 entry with a corresponding value of 3:50.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are:\n\n- Row index (implicitly from the numbering)\n- Match details including opponent, result, method, event, round number, time, and location.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the table has columns like Round, Time, etc. Let me check again.\n\nWait no, looking at the provided HTML table structure, each row has:\n\n- The first column seems to be the opponent's name.\n- Then result (win/loss/draw)\n- Record after that match\n- Method of victory or loss\n- Event name\n- Round number\n- Time\n- Location\n\nSo each row represents a single fight/match, with details about it.\n\nThe claim is \"round 3 be at 3:50.\" So I need to look for any entry where the round is 3 and the time is 3:50. Alternatively, maybe the round number being 3 and the time in that specific cell being 3:50.\n\nSo I'll go through each row and check both the Round column and the Time column.\n\nLet's list out all rows:\n\nRow 0:\n- Opponent: Tatsuya Kawajiri\n- Result: Win\n- Record: 21-6 (but looking at the table data, it might be different)\nWait, perhaps I should parse each row correctly. Let me look at the actual table.\n\nLooking at the provided HTML, each <tr> is a row with multiple <td> cells.\n\nThe first row after the header has:\n\n<td>Tatsuya Kawajiri</td>\n<td>Win</td>\n<td>21-6</td>\n<td>TKO (punches)</td>\n<td>K-1 World GP 2009 in Dubai</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3:50</td>\n<td>Dubai, UAE</td>\n\nSo for this row:\n\nRound is 3, Time is 3:50.\n\nWait, that's exactly what the claim says. So according to this row, there was a round 3 at 3:50.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because in row 0, Round is 3 and Time is 3:50.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows just to be thorough. Maybe other rows also have Round 3 and different times or vice versa.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Round: 3\n- Time: 3:50\n\nThis matches the claim exactly.\n\nRow 1:\n- Round: 2 (I think, but let me check)\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the provided table data again, perhaps I made a mistake in counting rows because the initial table might have more or fewer details. Alternatively, maybe some rows don't specify round numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out each row's Round and Time to be precise.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: Tatsuya Kawajiri | Win | ... | Round:3 | Time:3:50\n\nRow 1: Naoyuki Kotani | Loss | ... | Round:2 | Time:0:48\n\nRow 2: Tetsuji Saito | Win | ... | Round:3 | Time:3:00\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nActually, in the provided table, each row has the following data:\n\nLooking at the tbody section:\n\n<tr>\n<td>Tatsuya Kawajiri</td>\n<td>Win</td>\n<td>21-6</td>\n<td>TKO (punches)</td>\n<td>K-1 World GP 2009 in Dubai</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3:50</td>\n<td>Dubai, UAE</td>\n</tr>\n\nSo row index 0 has Round:3 and Time:3:50.\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow 1:\nOpponent: Naoyuki Kotani\nResult: Loss\nRecord: ... \nRound: 2\nTime: 0:48\n\nDoesn't match.\n\nRow 2:\nOpponent: Tetsuji Saito\nResult: Win\nRound:3\nTime:3:00\n\nSo Round is 3, Time is 3:00. Doesn't match the claim of 3:50.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have different round numbers and times.\n\nTherefore, only row 0 matches both Round=3 and Time=3:50.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there's a record where in Round 3, the time was exactly 3:50.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"round 3 be at 3:50\" is true based on the data provided. In row 0 of the table, the round number is 3 and the time recorded is 3:50.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"dream 11 be the event at 5:00 with the opponent of caol uno\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems like it's saying that in an event called \"Dream 11,\" the time was 5:00 and the opponent was Caol Uno. I need to check if both these pieces of information are accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different event with various details. The columns include things like Result, Opponent, Event Name, Round, Time, Location, etc. Wait, actually, looking more closely, the headers seem a bit jumbled because the HTML is cut off in the user's message. Let me try to parse the table correctly.\n\nThe columns are probably structured as follows based on the data:\n\n- Row Index\n- Result (Win/Loss/Draw)\n- Opponent\n- Event Name\n- Round\n- Time\n- Location\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML code provided, the headers might be different. The user hasn't specified all the column names clearly because the HTML is incomplete. But from the data in each row, I can infer the columns.\n\nFor example, the first row has \"You are tasked...\", which seems like a prompt rather than part of the table. Wait, maybe that's not part of the table but an introduction. Let me re-examine the user message.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user provided a HTML table within backticks, so I need to parse it correctly. The table starts with <table> and has a tbody with multiple tr elements, each containing td elements.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n\n<tr><td>You are tasked...</td></tr>\n\nNo, that's not correct because the actual data rows have more structure. Wait, perhaps the table is presented after the initial text. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the user message, the claim and instructions are followed by a table enclosed within <table> tags. The table has headers like \"Result\", \"Opponent\", \"Event Name\", etc., but I'm not entirely sure because the HTML is cut off. Alternatively, perhaps each row has multiple columns with data points.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each row in the table represents a fight with details such as Result, Opponent, Event, Round, Time, and Location. So for example, looking at one of the rows:\n\n<tr><td>win</td><td>caol uno</td><td>DREAM 11</td><td>n/a</td><td>5:00</td><td>turku, finland</td></tr>\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual data in each row is structured as follows:\n\nEach row has the following columns:\n\n- Result\n- Opponent\n- Event Name\n- Round\n- Time\n- Location\n\nBut looking at the data, for example:\n\n<tr>\n<td>win</td>\n<td>caol uno</td>\n<td>DREAM 11</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>5:00</td>\n<td>turku, finland</td>\n</tr>\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking at the data provided by the user, each row seems to have multiple cells. Let me count:\n\nLooking at one of the rows in the tbody:\n\n<tr><td>win</td><td>caol uno</td><td>DREAM 11</td><td>n/a</td><td>5:00</td><td>turku, finland</td></tr>\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me parse the HTML properly.\n\nThe user provided this HTML snippet:\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>win</td><td>caol uno</td><td>DREAM 11</td><td>n/a</td><td>5:00</td><td>turku, finland</td></tr>\n...\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nWait, perhaps each row has six columns. Let me list the column names based on context:\n\nAssuming the table is structured as follows, with each row containing:\n\n1. Result (win/loss/draw)\n2. Opponent\n3. Event Name\n4. Round\n5. Time\n6. Location\n\nSo for example, a row might look like this:\n\nResult | Opponent | Event Name | Round | Time | Location\nwin | caol uno | DREAM 11 | n/a | 5:00 | turku, finland\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \"n/a\" for round and 5:00 for time. Alternatively, perhaps the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, considering another row:\n\n<tr><td>win</td><td>4  - 1</td><td>K-1 World Grand Prix 2002 - Final</td><td>super fight</td><td>5:00</td><td>Tokyo, Japan</td></tr>\n\nWait, in this case, the columns might be:\n\nResult | Record | Event Name | Round | Time | Location\n\nBut that doesn't align with \"4  - 1\" as a record. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are Result, Opponent, Event, Round (number), Time, Location.\n\nSo for example:\n\nResult | Opponent | Event | Round | Time | Location\nwin | caol uno | DREAM 11 | n/a | 5:00 | turku, finland\n\nBut \"n/a\" for round might mean that the event didn't have rounds, or it's a special fight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are:\n\nResult | Opponent | Event Name | Round Number | Time | Location\n\nSo in this case, looking for an event named \"DREAM 11\" with opponent \"caol uno\" and time \"5:00\".\n\nLooking through the rows, I need to find a row where:\n\n- Opponent is \"caol uno\"\n- Event Name is \"DREAM 11\"\n- Time is \"5:00\"\n\nWait, but in the table provided by the user, each row seems to have these details. Let me look for such a row.\n\nLooking at the rows provided by the user:\n\nFor example, one of the rows is:\n\n<tr><td>win</td><td>caol uno</td><td>DREAM 11</td><td>n/a</td><td>5:00</td><td>turku, finland</td></tr>\n\nWait, that's exactly what I'm looking for. So in this row:\n\n- Result: win\n- Opponent: caol uno\n- Event Name: DREAM 11\n- Round: n/a (meaning not applicable or unknown)\n- Time: 5:00\n- Location: turku, finland\n\nSo according to this, the event \"DREAM 11\" had an opponent of \"caol uno\" and a time of \"5:00\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because there's a row where the Event Name is DREAM 11, Opponent is caol uno, and Time is 5:00.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are multiple entries for DREAM 11 or any inconsistencies. Let me scan through all the rows to ensure that this is accurate.\n\nLooking at another row:\n\n<tr><td>win</td><td>mike zamansky</td><td>K-1 World Grand Prix 2003 - Final</td><td>n/a</td><td>5:00</td><td>Tokyo, Japan</td></tr>\n\nThis is a different event with opponent Mike Zamansky and time 5:00.\n\nAnother row:\n\n<tr><td>win</td><td>kazuyuki fujita</td><td>K-1 World Grand Prix 2003 - Semi-Final</td><td>n/a</td><td>5:00</td><td>Tokyo, Japan</td></tr>\n\nAgain, time is 5:00 but different event and opponent.\n\nSo the only row where the Event Name is DREAM 11 is the one with opponent caol uno and time 5:00. Therefore, the claim holds true based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in \"DREAM 11,\" the opponent was Caol Uno and the time was 5:00. According to the table, there's a row where:\n\n- Event Name: DREAM 11\n- Opponent: caol uno\n- Time: 5:00\n\nThus, the claim is accurate.\n\n**Answer:** true",
