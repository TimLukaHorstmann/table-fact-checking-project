    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two institutions located in Ohio and that they are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). Wait, actually, looking back, the claim says \"be member,\" which I think might be a typo for \"are members.\" But regardless, the main points are:\n\n1. Institutions are located in Ohio.\n2. They are part of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nNow, let's look at the table. The table has columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left.\n\nI need to find all institutions in Ohio and check if they were members of GMC by looking at their 'joined' and 'left' years, assuming that these indicate when they were part of the conference.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: University of Cincinnati, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\nRow 1: University of Dayton, also in Ohio. Joined 1993, left 1995.\nRow 2: DePaul University is in Chicago, Illinois\u2014so not relevant.\nRow 3: Marquette University is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2014not Ohio.\nRow 4: University of Memphis is in Tennessee.\nRow 5: Saint Louis University is in Missouri.\n\nSo, only the first two rows are from Ohio. Both joined and left around the same time. Since both were part of the conference between their respective join and left years, they would be considered members during that period.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two institutions in Ohio that were members of the Great Midwest Conference as per the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are the 'location' and either 'joined' or 'left' for each institution. But since the claim is about being a member, we need to confirm their membership through 'joined' and 'left' dates.\n\nWait, but do I have information on whether they were members of the GMC? The table doesn't explicitly say \"Great Midwest Conference\" anywhere, just 'joined' and 'left' years. So assuming that these are the years when they were part of the GMC, then yes, both institutions in Ohio were members between 1991-1995.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because there are two institutions (University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton) located in Ohio that were members of the conference.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are two Ohio institutions listed with relevant 'joined' and 'left' years indicating their membership in the Great Midwest Conference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"5 out of the 6 institution that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991\"\n\nFirst, I notice a typo in the claim: \"be\" should likely be \"are\". So, it's about 5 out of 6 institutions in the Great Midwest Conference joining in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing an institution. Each row has a 'joined' column which shows the year they joined the conference.\n\nI'll list the 'joined' years for each institution:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: 1991\n2. University of Dayton: 1993\n3. DePaul University: 1991\n4. Marquette University: 1991\n5. University of Memphis: 1991\n6. Saint Louis University: 1991\n\nNow, counting how many joined in 1991:\n\n- Cincinnati: 1991 (yes)\n- Dayton: 1993 (no)\n- DePaul: 1991 (yes)\n- Marquette: 1991 (yes)\n- Memphis: 1991 (yes)\n- Saint Louis: 1991 (yes)\n\nThat's five institutions that joined in 1991. However, the claim mentions \"5 out of 6\", but actually, only one institution (Dayton) did not join in 1991; it joined in 1993.\n\nWait a minute, let me recount:\n\n- Joined in 1991: Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, Saint Louis \u2192 that's five.\n- Joined in 1993: Dayton \u2192 one.\n\nSo, 5 out of the 6 institutions joined in 1991. The claim is correct because it states exactly that: 5 out of 6 joined in 1991.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells in the table to support this conclusion. For each institution, the 'joined' column is crucial. So, for rows 0 through 5, I need to look at the 'joined' column.\n\nRelevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 0: joined (1991)\n- Row 1: joined (1993)\n- Row 2: joined (1991)\n- Row 3: joined (1991)\n- Row 4: joined (1991)\n- Row 5: joined (1991)\n\nBut since the claim is about the count, it's sufficient to show each institution's 'joined' year. Therefore, all six rows under the 'joined' column are relevant.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because five out of six institutions indeed joined in 1991.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 5 out of 6 institutions joined the conference in 1991. By examining each institution's 'joined' year from the table, we find that all except one (University of Dayton) joined in 1991. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table here about different universities and some details about them. The claim is: \"there be 2 public institution that be member of the great midwest conference.\" Wait, that sounds a bit old-fashioned with \"be\" instead of \"are.\" But I guess it's just a typo or something, so I'll interpret it as \"there are 2 public institutions that are members of the Great Midwest Conference.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's claiming that there are exactly two public institutions in the table that were part of this conference. The table has several columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left.\n\nLooking at the \"type\" column will tell me if an institution is public or private. I'll go through each row:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati - type is public.\n2. University of Dayton - type is private.\n3. DePaul University - type is private.\n4. Marquette University - type is private.\n5. University of Memphis - type is public.\n6. Saint Louis University - type is private.\n\nSo, from this, the public institutions are rows 0 (University of Cincinnati) and 4 (University of Memphis). That's two public institutions.\n\nNext, I need to check if these two were members of the Great Midwest Conference. The table has \"joined\" and \"left\" columns which likely refer to the years they joined and left the conference. Both University of Cincinnati and University of Memphis have values in these columns: 1991-1995 for Cincinnati, same as others. So they were part of the conference during those years.\n\nTherefore, there are indeed two public institutions (rows 0 and 4) that were members of the Great Midwest Conference. The claim is true.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the \"type\" column for rows 0 and 4.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two public institutions, University of Cincinnati and University of Memphis, both having joined and left the conference as indicated by their 'joined' and 'left' years.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that three members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before the year 1860. So, my task is to check how many institutions in the table have a 'founded' year earlier than 1860.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with details including when it was founded. The relevant column here is \"founded\". I'll go through each row and note down the founding years:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Founded in 1819.\n2. University of Dayton: Founded in 1850.\n3. DePaul University: Founded in 1898.\n4. Marquette University: Founded in 1881.\n5. University of Memphis: Founded in 1912.\n6. Saint Louis University: Founded in 1818.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these were founded before 1860. Let's check each:\n\n- Cincinnati (1819) is before 1860? Yes.\n- Dayton (1850) is also before 1860. Yes.\n- DePaul (1898) is after 1860. No.\n- Marquette (1881) is after 1860. No.\n- Memphis (1912) is way after. No.\n- Saint Louis (1818) is before 1860. Yes.\n\nSo, the institutions founded before 1860 are Cincinnati, Dayton, and Saint Louis. That makes three institutions. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"3 of the members... were found before 1860\" is correct. The relevant cells are those in the 'founded' column for these three institutions.\n\nI should note the row indices correctly. In the table provided, rows start at index 0. So:\n\n- Cincinnati: Row 0\n- Dayton: Row 1\n- Saint Louis: Row 5\n\nSo, each of these has a 'founded' year before 1860.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Its enrollment is 41357 students.\n\nSaint Louis University is in the sixth row (row_index 5).

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left. The claim mentions institutions in Ohio that are members of a conference, specifically the Great Midwest Conference. From the table, I don't see a column explicitly stating conference membership. However, the 'joined' and 'left' columns might indicate when they were part of a conference.\n\nThe claim is about Ohio having only one institution in this conference. So, I'll check each row where the location is in Ohio.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati - Location: Cincinnati, Ohio\n2. University of Dayton - Location: Dayton, Ohio\n\nBoth are in Ohio. Now, checking their 'joined' and 'left' years. The claim doesn't specify a time frame, but since both joined in 1991 and left in 1995, they were members during that period.\n\nIf the Great Midwest Conference was operational between 1991 and 1995, both universities were part of it.

The claim states: \"all 6 institution join the great midwest conference at the same time in 1991.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim is saying. The key points are:\n\n1. There are 6 institutions.\n2. All joined the Great Midwest Conference.\n3. They all joined at the same time in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has a column called \"joined\" which I assume refers to the year each institution joined some conference, possibly the Great Midwest Conference. The other columns include institution name, nickname, location, founded year, type (public/private), enrollment, and left year.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to check the \"joined\" column for each institution.\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Joined in 1991.\n2. University of Dayton: Joined in 1993.\n3. DePaul University: Joined in 1991.\n4. Marquette University: Joined in 1991.\n5. University of Memphis: Joined in 1991.\n6. Saint Louis University: Joined in 1991.\n\nWait a minute, the second institution, University of Dayton, has a \"joined\" year of 1993, which is different from 1991. This means that not all six institutions joined at the same time as claimed. \n\nAdditionally, I should confirm if there are exactly six institutions in the table. Looking at the rows, yes, there are six entries: each with a unique institution name.\n\nSo, since five of them joined in 1991 but one (University of Dayton) joined later in 1993, the claim that all six joined at the same time in 1991 is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to list each cell where the \"joined\" column shows a year different from 1991 or the same. In this case, University of Dayton's \"joined\" value is 1993, which is the only one not matching 1991.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all six rows under the \"joined\" column to verify their joining years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"only private institution be member of the great midwest conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that only private institutions were members of a certain conference\u2014presumably the Great Midwest Conference, though it's not explicitly named in the problem. The table lists several universities with details like their nickname, location, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment numbers, and years they joined and left.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution. The relevant columns here are \"institution,\" \"type,\" \"joined,\" and \"left.\" The claim is about whether all these institutions were private when they were part of the conference.\n\nThe time frame in question is from 1991 to 1995 since those are the years listed under \"joined\" and \"left.\" For each institution, I need to check if it was a member during this period and whether it was private at that time.\n\nLet's go through each institution one by one:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: It joined in 1991 and left in 1995. Its type is public. So, this is a public institution that was part of the conference from 1991 to 1995.\n\n2. University of Dayton: Joined in 1993 and left in 1995. It's private. This supports the claim so far.\n\n3. DePaul University: Joined in 1991, left in 1995. Private. Again, supporting the claim.\n\n4. Marquette University: Same years as others\u2014joined 1991, left 1995. Private. Still aligning with the claim.\n\n5. University of Memphis: Joined in 1991, left 1995. Type is public. This contradicts the claim because it's a public institution that was part of the conference during those years.\n\n6. Saint Louis University: Joined 1991, left 1995. Private. Fits with the claim.\n\nSo, among all these institutions, there are both private and public universities listed as members of the conference from 1991 to 1995. Specifically, the University of Cincinnati and the University of Memphis were public institutions during that time frame, which means they were part of the conference despite being public.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"only private institution be member\" is false because there are public institutions listed as members in the table during those years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because both public and private institutions were members of the conference from 1991 to 1995.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"more than half of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It seems like it's saying that more than half of the members of a certain conference (the Great Midwest Conference) were founded before 1860. The table provided lists several universities with details including their founding years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution, and there are six institutions in total. Each has a \"founded\" column which indicates the year they were established. To verify the claim, I need to check how many of these six institutions were founded before 1860.\n\nLet's go through each institution:\n\n1. **University of Cincinnati**: Founded in 1819. This is before 1860.\n2. **University of Dayton**: Founded in 1850. Also before 1860.\n3. **DePaul University**: Founded in 1898. That's after 1860.\n4. **Marquette University**: Founded in 1881. After 1860 as well.\n5. **University of Memphis**: Founded in 1912. Definitely after.\n6. **Saint Louis University**: Founded in 1818. Before 1860.\n\nNow, counting the ones founded before 1860: Cincinnati (1819), Dayton (1850), and Saint Louis (1818). That's three institutions. The other three were founded after 1860.\n\nSince there are six members total, more than half would mean at least four. But only three were founded before 1860, which is exactly half. Therefore, the claim that more than half were founded before 1860 isn't true\u2014it's actually exactly half.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are those in the \"founded\" column for each institution to check their founding years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrol as saint louis university.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify the relevant information for each institution mentioned in the claim. The two universities involved are the University of Cincinnati and Saint Louis University.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left. The key column here is \"enrollment\" because that's what the claim is about\u2014the number of students enrolled in each university.\n\nI need to find the rows for both universities. Starting with the University of Cincinnati: it's the first row (row index 0). Let me check the enrollment number there\u2014it says 41357. Okay, so University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of 41,357 students.\n\nNext, I'll look for Saint Louis University. That's the last row in the table (row index 5). The enrollment here is listed as 13785. So, Saint Louis University has 13,785 enrolled students.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 41,357 versus 13,785. They are clearly different. The University of Cincinnati has a much higher enrollment than Saint Louis University.\n\nSo, the claim is stating that both have the same number of student enrollments, which isn't true based on the data provided in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo make sure I haven't missed anything, I'll double-check the row indices and column names to ensure accuracy. The relevant cells are indeed the enrollment figures for both universities. So, the \"enrollment\" column is what matters here, and their respective values confirm that they're not equal.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two universities have the same student enrollment. By examining the table, University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of 41,357 while Saint Louis University has 13,785. These numbers are different, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
