    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of 8 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. The key points are:\n1. Identify which player has the greatest number of \"drop\".\n2. Check if this player's career spanned exactly 8 years.\n\nLooking at the table, there are nine players listed with various statistics including 'span', 'start', and 'drop'. \n\nStarting with point 1: Finding the player with the highest 'drop' value.\n- I'll go through each row and note the 'drop' column values:\n  - vaea anitoni: 0\n  - paul emerick: 0\n  - todd clever: 0\n  - philip eloff: 0\n  - takudzwa ngwenya: 0\n  - chris wyles: 1\n  - david fee: 0\n  - mike hercus: 4\n  - riaan van zyl: 0\n\nThe highest 'drop' value is 4, which belongs to Mike Hercus.\n\nNext, point 2: Checking Mike Hercus's career span.\n- His span is listed as \"2002 - 2009\". To calculate the duration:\n  - From 2002 to 2009 is a total of 7 years (since 2009 - 2002 = 7). However, sometimes spans are counted inclusively. If we consider both start and end years as full years, it might be 8 years.\n\nBut in most cases, the duration between two years is calculated by subtracting the start year from the end year. So, 2009 - 2002 = 7 years. Therefore, his career spanned 7 years, not 8.\n\nWait a minute\u2014I need to be careful here. Let me double-check: If someone starts in 2002 and ends in 2009, how many years is that? It's 2003-2004 (1), 2004-2005 (2)... up to 2008-2009 (7). So yes, it's 7 years. Alternatively, if considering each year as a full span from January to December, starting in 2002 and ending in 2009 would cover 8 calendar years: 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009. That's 8 years.\n\nHmm, now I'm a bit confused. How is the span usually calculated? Let me think of another example: if someone starts in 2010 and ends in 2012, that's 3 years (2010-2011, 2011-2012), or including both start and end, it might be considered as 3 calendar years.\n\nIn Mike Hercus's case, from 2002 to 2009 inclusive is 8 years. So perhaps the span is indeed 8 years when counting each year individually.\n\nBut wait, in the table, some spans are shown with a hyphen and two years, like \"1992 - 2000\" for vaea anitoni. Let me check how many years that would be: from 1992 to 2000 is 8 years (including both start and end). So yes, Mike Hercus's span from 2002-2009 is also 8 years.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n- Mike Hercus has the highest 'drop' value of 4.\n- His career spanned 8 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of 8 year\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll list the relevant cells:\n- For Mike Hercus's 'drop' value: row index 7 (since rows are zero-indexed), column 'drop'.\n- For his 'span': same row index 7, column 'span'.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE with these two relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"paul emerick do not have the greatest number of tries out of the 9 total player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Paul Emerick does NOT have the highest number of tries among all 9 players listed in the table. So, my task is to check if Paul's tries are indeed not the highest.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: player, span, start, tries, conv, pens, drop. The relevant column here is \"tries\" because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the number of tries each player has:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 26 tries\n2. Paul Emerick: 17 tries\n3. Todd Clever: 11 tries\n4. Philip Eloff: 10 tries\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10 tries\n6. Chris Wyles: 10 tries\n7. David Fee: 9 tries\n8. Mike Hercus: 9 tries\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 9 tries\n\nNow, I'll compare Paul Emerick's tries (17) with the others. The highest number of tries is actually Vaea Anitoni with 26. So, Paul doesn't have the greatest number; in fact, he's the second-highest.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anyone. Scanning through all rows again, yes, Vaea has the highest at 26. Everyone else is lower than that. So Paul Emerick definitely doesn't have the most tries.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Paul does not have the greatest number of tries among the players.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Paul Emerick doesn't have the highest number of tries. From the table, Vaea Anitoni has 26 tries, which is higher than Paul's 17. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"3 of the 9 players have not yet finished their span of play on the United States National Rugby Union team.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each column represents. The table has columns like player, span, start, tries, conv, pens, drop. I'm guessing \"span\" refers to the time period a player was active with the team.\n\nThe claim is about whether three players haven't finished their playing spans yet. So I need to check the \"span\" column for each player to see if their span ends with a dash (\"-\"), indicating that they're still active, or if it has specific years, meaning they've retired or left.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (specific end year)\n2. Paul Emerick: 2003 - 2012 (specific end year)\n3. Todd Clever: 2003 - (ends with dash, still active)\n4. Philip Eloff: 2000 - 2007 (specific end year)\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 - (still active)\n6. Chris Wyles: 2007 - (still active)\n7. David Fee: 2002 - 2005 (specific end year)\n8. Mike Hercus: 2002 - 2009 (specific end year)\n9. Riaan Van Zyl: 2003 - 2004 (specific end year)\n\nSo, Todd Clever, Takudzwa Ngwenya, and Chris Wyles all have spans ending with a dash, meaning they haven't finished their time yet. That's three players. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"3 of the 9.\" Let me count again: rows 2 (Todd), 4 (Takudzwa), and 5 (Chris). That's three players indeed.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in the \"span\" column for these three players. Their row indices are 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"chris wyles be 1 of the 2 player with drop during their time on the rugby team.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It seems to say that Chris Wyles is one out of two players who had a 'drop' during their time on the team. So I need to check how many players have a non-zero value in the 'drop' column.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column is 'drop'. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: drop is 0\n2. Paul Emerick: drop is 0\n3. Todd Clever: drop is 0\n4. Philip Eloff: drop is 0\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: drop is 0\n6. Chris Wyles: drop is 1\n7. David Fee: drop is 0\n8. Mike Hercus: drop is 4\n9. Riaan van Zyl: drop is 0\n\nSo, looking at the 'drop' column, only two players have non-zero values: Chris Wyles (row 5) with a value of 1 and Mike Hercus (row 7) with a value of 4. Therefore, there are exactly two players who had drops.\n\nThe claim says Chris is one of those two, which is correct because he does have a drop recorded. So the statement holds true.\n\nI need to collect the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The 'drop' column for both Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus are the key points here. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- For Chris Wyles: row 5, column 'drop'\n- For Mike Hercus: row 7, column 'drop'\n\nThese two show that there are indeed two players with drops, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"Paul Emerick do not have fewer tries than any other player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that Paul Emerick does NOT have fewer tries than any other player. In other words, no other player has more tries than Paul Emerick. Alternatively, this could mean that Paul's number of tries is at least as high as every other player's.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating Paul Emerick's data. From the HTML table, Paul Emerick is listed in the second row (row index 1). The columns we're interested in are 'player' and 'tries'. \n\nIn the 'tries' column for Paul Emerick, the value is 17. Now, I need to compare this number with all other players' tries to see if any of them have more than 17.\n\nLet's go through each player:\n\n1. **vaea anitoni** (row index 0) has 26 tries.\n   - This is higher than Paul's 17, so it contradicts the claim.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check all to be thorough.\n\n2. **paul emerick** (row index 1) has 17 tries. \n3. **todd clever** (row index 2) has 11 tries.\n4. **philip eloff** (row index 3) has 10 tries.\n5. **takudzwa ngwenya** (row index 4) has 10 tries.\n6. **chris wyles** (row index 5) has 10 tries.\n7. **david fee** (row index 6) has 9 tries.\n8. **mike hercus** (row index 7) has 9 tries.\n9. **riaan van zyl** (row index 8) has 9 tries.\n\nSo, besides Paul Emerick, the highest number of tries is 26 by vaea anitoni. This means that at least one player (vaea anitoni) has more tries than Paul Emerick. Therefore, the claim that \"Paul Emerick does not have fewer tries than any other player\" is false because there exists another player with a higher number of tries.\n\nThe relevant cells are the 'tries' column for Paul Emerick and all others to compare.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"riann van zyl have the shortest time span on the united state national rugby union team and tie with 3 others for the smallest number of tries.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Riaan Van Zyl has the shortest time span.\n2. He ties with three others for the smallest number of tries.\n\nI'll start by examining each part.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check the \"span\" column to find out the duration each player was on the team. The spans are as follows:\n- Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n- Paul Emerick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n- Todd Clever: 2003 - present\n- Philip Eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 - present\n- Chris Wyles: 2007 - present\n- David Fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n- Mike Hercus: 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n- Riaan Van Zyl: 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n\nFrom this, Riaan Van Zyl's span is the shortest at just one year. So the first part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNext, looking at the \"tries\" column to find out who has the smallest number:\n- Vaea Anitoni: 26\n- Paul Emerick: 17\n- Todd Clever: 11\n- Philip Eloff: 10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n- Chris Wyles: 10\n- David Fee: 9\n- Mike Hercus: 9\n- Riaan Van Zyl: 9\n\nWait, Riaan Van Zyl has 9 tries. Let's see who else has the same number:\n- David Fee: 9\n- Mike Hercus: 9\n- Riaan Van Zyl: 9\n\nThat makes three players with 9 tries. So Riaan ties with two others, not three as claimed.\n\nWait a minute, let me recount. The claim says he ties with three others. Let's list all players and their tries:\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 26\n2. Paul Emerick: 17\n3. Todd Clever: 11\n4. Philip Eloff: 10\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n6. Chris Wyles: 10\n7. David Fee: 9\n8. Mike Hercus: 9\n9. Riaan Van Zyl: 9\n\nSo, the players with 9 tries are David Fee, Mike Hercus, and Riaan Van Zyl. That's three people in total? Wait, no\u2014Riaan is one, so he ties with two others. So the claim says \"tie with 3 others,\" which would make four players in total (including himself), but according to the table, only three have 9 tries.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's list them again:\n- Riaan Van Zyl: 9\n- David Fee: 9\n- Mike Hercus: 9\n\nThat's three people with 9 tries. So Riaan is tied with two others, making it a total of three players. Therefore, the claim says he ties with three others, which would mean four in total, but that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"tie with 3 others,\" meaning besides himself, there are three others who have the same number. But looking at the table, only two other players (David Fee and Mike Hercus) have 9 tries. So Riaan is tied with two others, not three.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect because he doesn't tie with three others but two.\n\nWait, let me double-check all rows:\n\nRow indices start from 0:\n0: Vaea Anitoni - 26\n1: Paul Emerick - 17\n2: Todd Clever - 11\n3: Philip Eloff - 10\n4: Takudzwa Ngwenya - 10\n5: Chris Wyles - 10\n6: David Fee - 9\n7: Mike Hercus - 9\n8: Riaan Van Zyl - 9\n\nSo, the number of tries for each:\n- 26, 17, 11, 10 (three times), and then 9 three times.\n\nWait, no. Let's recount:\n\nLooking at the \"tries\" column:\nRow 0: 26\nRow 1: 17\nRow 2: 11\nRow 3: 10\nRow 4: 10\nRow 5: 10\nRow 6:9 \nRow7:9 \nRow8:9 \n\nSo, three players have 10 tries (rows 3,4,5), and three players have 9 tries (rows 6,7,8). So Riaan is one of the three with 9. Therefore, he ties with two others, making a total of three.\n\nBut the claim says \"tie with 3 others,\" which would mean four people in total. Since that's not the case, the second part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again:\n\nThe players with 9 tries are rows 6 (David Fee), 7 (Mike Hercus), and 8 (Riaan Van Zyl). That's three in total. So Riaan ties with two others, not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he ties with three others is incorrect because only two others share his number of tries.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. Shortest time span: Correct.\n2. Ties with three others for the smallest number of tries: Incorrect; he ties with two others.\n\nSince both parts need to be correct for the entire claim to be TRUE, and one part is incorrect, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure about the \"smallest\" number of tries. The smallest number is 9? Let me check all tries:\n\nLooking at the \"tries\" column again:\n- Vaea Anitoni:26\n- Paul Emerick:17\n- Todd Clever:11\n- Philip Eloff:10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya:10\n- Chris Wyles:10\n- David Fee:9\n- Mike Hercus:9\n- Riaan Van Zyl:9\n\nYes, 9 is the smallest number of tries. So the second part is about having the smallest number and tying with three others.\n\nWait, but as we saw, only two others have 9 tries. Therefore, the claim's second part is wrong because it should be two others, not three.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of only 1 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The columns are: player, span, start, tries, conv, pens, and drop. So, each row represents a player with their respective stats.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Identify the player(s) with the greatest number of 'drop'.\n2. Check if this maximum 'drop' happened over only one year.\n\nStarting with part 1: Looking at the 'drop' column for all players.\n- vaea anitoni: 0\n- paul emerick: 0\n- todd clever: 0\n- philip eloff: 0\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 0\n- chris wyles: 1\n- david fee: 0\n- mike hercus: 4\n- riaan van zyl: 0\n\nThe highest value is 4, achieved by mike hercus. So, he has the greatest number of 'drop's.\n\nNow, part 2: Checking if this happened over only one year. The 'span' column shows the period each player was active. For mike hercus, his span is \"2002 - 2009\". That\u2019s a span of 8 years. Since his 'drop' count is 4 over 8 years, it's not just one year.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says the greatest number happened over the span of only one year. Does that mean the maximum single-year drop? Or the total over any period?\n\nLooking back, the table might have each player's cumulative stats. So, 'drop' is likely the total during their entire span.\n\nIf mike hercus has 4 drops over 8 years, then the claim would be false because it wasn't just one year. However, if someone had a higher number in a single year, but since we don't have yearly data, only cumulative, we can't confirm that any player's maximum drop was within one year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misinterpreted. It could mean whether the greatest total drops occurred during a time span of just one year for a player. But mike hercus' span is 2002-2009 (8 years), so even if he had all 4 drops in one year, his overall span covers more than one year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any player's entire career was only one year. Looking at the 'span' column:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n- paul emerick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n- todd clever: 2003 - (current, but started in 2003 and still active; so at least a few years)\n- philip eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 2007 - (still active, several years)\n- chris wyles: 2007 - (several years)\n- david fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n- mike hercus: 2002 - 2009 (8 years)\n- riaan van zyl: 2003 - 2004 (2 years)\n\nSo, no player has a span of just one year. The closest is riaan van zyl with two years. Therefore, even the player with the highest 'drop' count (mike hercus) didn't have his career limited to one year.\n\nThus, the claim that the greatest number of drops happened over only one year isn't supported by the data. There's no player whose entire span was just one year, and the maximum drop is from mike hercus who played for multiple years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because no player had a career spanning just one year, so the maximum 'drop' count couldn't have occurred over only one year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"all of the players have already finished their span of play on the United States National Rugby Union Team.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each player's 'span' in the table to see if it ends with a year or just a dash, indicating they might still be playing.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000. That seems finished.\nRow 1:\n- Paul Emerick: 2003 - 2012. Also looks finished.\nRow 2:\n- Todd Clever: 2003 -. The dash at the end suggests he might still be active, meaning his span hasn't ended yet.\nRows 3 and onwards: Let me check just in case there are others with similar dashes.\n\nPhilipp Eloff: 2000 - 2007 \u2013 finished.\nTakudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 -. Another dash, so possibly still active.\nChris Wyles: 2007 -; same as above.\nDavid Fee: 2002 - 2005. Finished.\nMike Hercus: 2002 - 2009. Finished.\nRiaan van Zyl: 2003 - 2004. Also finished.\n\nSo Todd Clever and Takudzwa Ngwenya have spans ending with a dash, which probably means they're still playing or haven't retired yet. That would mean the claim is false because not all players have finished their spans.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because some players like Todd Clever and Takudzwa Ngwenya have active spans without end years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Chris Wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each column in the table represents. Looking at the headers:\n\n- player: Names of players.\n- span: The years they were active.\n- start: Probably the number of starts or appearances.\n- tries: Maybe tries scored?\n- conv: Could be conversions.\n- pens: Penalties.\n- drop: Possibly drop goals.\n\nThe claim is about \"drop,\" which I think refers to drop goals in rugby. So, we need to check if Chris Wyles is the only player who has a non-zero value under the 'drop' column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: drop = 0\n2. Paul Emerick: drop = 0\n3. Todd Clever: drop = 0\n4. Philip Eloff: drop = 0\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: drop = 0\n6. Chris Wyles: drop = 1\n7. David Fee: drop = 0\n8. Mike Hercus: drop = 4\n9. Riaan van Zyl: drop = 0\n\nWait, here I see that Mike Hercus has a 'drop' value of 4. So, he also has drops during his time on the team. Therefore, Chris Wyles is not the only player with a drop goal; Mike Hercus also has drop goals.\n\nSo the claim is false because there's another player (Mike Hercus) who has a higher number of drops than zero.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The claim involves checking all players' 'drop' values, but specifically focusing on Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus since they have non-zero drop goals.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Chris Wyles: row index 5 (assuming counting starts at 0), column 'drop'.\n- For Mike Hercus: row index 7, column 'drop'.\n\nThese two rows show that both players have drop goals, making Chris not the only one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Mike Hercus also has a non-zero value in the drop column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "riann van zyl have the longest time span on the united state national rugby union team and tie with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about Riaan van Zyl is true or false based on the provided table. I'll start by understanding the claim and then cross-verifying it against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states two things:\n1. Riaan van Zyl has the longest time span on the United States National Rugby Union team.\n2. He ties with only one other player for the greatest number of tries.\n\nFirst, I need to check each part of the claim using the information from the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: the length of Riaan van Zyl's time span. Looking at the \"span\" column in the table:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n- paul emerick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n- todd clever: 2003 - (still active as of the latest data, so more than 17 years)\n- philip eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 2007 - (still active, around 14+ years)\n- chris wyles: 2007 - (around 14+ years)\n- david fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n- mike hercus: 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n- riaan van zyl: 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n\nFrom this, Riaan van Zyl's span is only one year. Clearly, there are other players with much longer spans, such as Todd Clever and Takudzwa Ngwenya who started in 2003 and are still active. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nMoving on to the second part: number of tries. The \"tries\" column shows:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 26\n- paul emerick:17\n- todd clever:11\n- philip eloff:10\n- takudzwa ngwenya:10\n- chris wyles:10\n- david fee:9\n- mike hercus:9\n- riaan van zyl:9\n\nRiaan van Zyl has 9 tries. Looking at the other players, there are multiple players with higher or equal numbers of tries. For example, Vaea Anitoni leads with 26, and there's a tie between several players at 10. Therefore, Riaan doesn't have the greatest number of tries, nor does he tie with only one other player.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Riaan van Zyl's span isn't the longest, and his try count doesn't tie for the highest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
