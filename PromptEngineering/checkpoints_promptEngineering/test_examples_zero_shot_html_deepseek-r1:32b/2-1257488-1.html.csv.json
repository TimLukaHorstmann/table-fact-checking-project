    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the match held on January 26, 2006, the result be 2 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It's talking about a specific date and the result of the match on that date. So I should look for the row where the date is January 26, 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'date' column. Let me go through them one by one:\n\n1. June 7, 2000: Not the date we're looking for.\n2. November 17, 2004: Nope.\n3. Same as above, same date and year.\n4. Again, November 17, 2004.\n5. June 8, 2005: Still not our target date.\n6. September 7, 2005: Not it either.\n7. October 26, 2005: Close, but not January.\n8. January 26, 2006: Bingo! This is the row we need.\n\nNow that I've found the correct row (row index 7), I should check what the result was. The 'result' column in this row says \"2 - 1.\" So according to the claim, the result should be 2-1, which matches exactly.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm looking at the right columns. The claim mentions the date and the result. So I need to check both the 'date' column and the 'result' column in that specific row.\n\nIn row index 7:\n- Date: January 26, 2006 (matches)\n- Result: 2 - 1 (matches)\n\nSo everything checks out. There's no discrepancy here. The match on that date did indeed end with a result of 2-1.\n\nI don't think there are any other rows with the same date, so this is the only relevant entry. I should note down the row index and the column names that were checked for both the date and the result to support my answer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies the match on January 26, 2006, which had a result of 2-1 as stated in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
