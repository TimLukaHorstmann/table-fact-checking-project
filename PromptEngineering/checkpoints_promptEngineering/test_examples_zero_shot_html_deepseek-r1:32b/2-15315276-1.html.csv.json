The claim is: \"jessica shepley receive a winner's share of 14000 when she win the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key pieces of information from the claim:\n- Name of the champion: Jessica Shepley\n- Winner's share amount: $14,000\n- Tournament location: Beaver Meadow Golf Course\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"champion\", \"winner 's share\", and \"tournament location\". \n\nI'll scan each row to find where the champion is Jessica Shepley. Scanning through, I see that in 2011, the champion was Jessica Shepley. Let me check the details of that row.\n\nIn the 2011 row:\n- Champion: jessica shepley\n- Winner's share: 14000\n- Tournament location: beaver meadow golf course\n\nAll the elements match the claim. The name, amount, and location all align with what's stated in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other entries for Jessica Shepley to avoid confusion. Checking through the rest of the rows, she only appears once in 2011. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are from the 2011 row:\n- \"champion\" column\n- \"winner 's share\" column\n- \"tournament location\" column\n\nI'll list their respective row indexes and column names as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Jessica Shepley won in 2011 at Beaver Meadow Golf Course with a winner's share of $14,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"in 2012, the champion be from the united state\" is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share. The rows go from 2013 down to 2004.\n\nThe claim is about the year 2012, so I should find the row where the year is 2012. Scanning through the years: 2013 is row 0, 2012 is row 1, and so on down to 2004 in row 9.\n\nIn row 1 (which is the second row if counting from zero), I'll check the 'year' column to confirm it's 2012. It says 2012, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the champion being from the United States. So I need to look at the 'country' column in the same row. The champion's name is Jenny Gleason, and her country is listed as \"united states.\" \n\nTherefore, both conditions are met: the year is 2012, and the champion is indeed from the United States. So the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 1, column 'year' to confirm it's 2012.\n- Row 1, column 'country' to check the nationality of the champion.\n\nSo, I'll note these as the relevant cells in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that from the year after 2012 onwards, the winner's share has not been less than $15,000. So, I should look at all the entries in the table where the year is greater than 2012 and check their \"winner's share\" values.\n\nFirst, let me identify which rows correspond to years after 2012. The table has data from 2004 to 2013. So, the relevant rows are those with years 2013, 2014, ..., but looking at the provided data, I only see up to 2013.\n\nWait, let me check all the years in the table:\n\n- 2013: row index 0\n- 2012: row index 1\n- 2011: row index 2\n- 2010: row index 3\n- 2009: row index 4\n- 2008: row index 5\n- 2007: row index 6\n- 2006: row index 7\n- 2005: row index 8\n- 2004: row index 9\n\nSo, after 2012 is only the year 2013. Therefore, I should look at the \"winner's share\" for that specific row.\n\nLooking at row 0 (year 2013), the \"winner's share\" is $15,000. According to the claim, this amount shouldn't be less than $15,000. Since it's exactly equal, that's acceptable for the claim being TRUE.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says \"never less than 15000\", which means it can be equal or more. So in this case, since there is only one year after 2012 (which is 2013) and its share is exactly $15,000, the claim holds true.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any other years beyond 2013 in the table. But looking at the data provided, there aren't any entries beyond 2013. So, based on the given information, after 2012, the only year present is 2013 with a share of $15,000.\n\nTherefore, since all years after 2012 (only 2013) have a winner's share equal to or greater than $15,000, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell here is row index 0 in the \"winner 's share\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"champion jenny shin share 14000 dollar when she win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and then checking against the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: it mentions that champion Jenny Shin shared $14,000 when she won. So, I need to find if there's a row where the champion is Jenny Shin and check what her winner's share was.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with details about the champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share. The columns are 'year', 'dates', 'champion', 'country', 'score', 'tournament location', 'purse', and 'winner's share'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the champion is Jenny Shin.\n\nStarting from 2013 going backward:\n\n- 2013: Champion is Pk Kongkraphan, not Jenny Shin.\n- 2012: Champion is Jenny Gleason. Close name but not Shin.\n- 2011: Jessica Shepley, not relevant.\n- 2010: Here's \"jenny shin\". Wait, the name is written as 'jenny shin' with lowercase. Does case matter? In the table, it's all lowercase except for names like Pk Kongkraphan which starts with uppercase. The claim uses uppercase 'Jenny Shin', but in the table, it's 'jenny shin'. So I think it's referring to the same person regardless of case.\n\nSo, row index 3 (assuming starting from 0) is the one where the champion is jenny shin. Now, looking at that row, under 'winner's share' column, the value is 15400.\n\nThe claim states that her share was $14,000, but according to the table, it's $15,400. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the amount doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, did I check all rows correctly? Let me double-check:\n\n- 2010: jenny shin, winner's share 15400.\n- Other entries don't have Jenny Shin as champion except this one.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row index 3 for 'champion' and 'winner's share'. The claim says $14,000, but the table shows $15,400. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with data about golf tournaments from 2004 to 2013. The claim is: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400\". Hmm, let me parse this.\n\nFirst, the claim seems to say that in years after 2012 (so 2013), there are no tournaments where the winner\u2019s share is less than $15,400. Wait, actually, looking at the table, I see entries from 2004 up to 2013. So \"after 2012\" would just be 2013.\n\nLooking at the 2013 row: it's row index 0 in the HTML provided. The column for 'winner's share' is $15,000. Wait, that's less than 15,400? No, wait, no\u2014wait, 15,000 is less than 15,400. So the claim says there are zero purses after 2012 where the winner's share is less than 15,400. But in 2013, it's exactly 15,000, which is less than 15,400.\n\nWait, but let me check: 2013's winner\u2019s share is $15,000. Is that correct? Yes, per the table. So the claim is claiming that after 2012 (i.e., in 2013), there are zero such instances where the winner's share is less than 15,400. But since 2013's share is $15k, which is less than 15,400, that means there is at least one instance\u2014so the claim would be false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check the wording: \"zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400\". So it's saying that for all purses in years after 2012 (which is just 2013), none have a winner\u2019s share below $15,400. But since 2013 has a share of 15k, which is less than 15.4k, the claim isn't true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that 'after 2012' includes all years after, but in this table, there's only 2013 as the year after 2012. So if in 2013, the winner\u2019s share is less than 15,400, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check other years beyond 2012? But the table doesn't have data for years beyond 2013. So according to the given data, after 2012 (which is 2013), there is a winner\u2019s share of 15k, which is less than 15,400. Therefore, the claim that there are zero such instances is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would include the row for 2013 and the 'winner's share' column.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in 2013, the winner\u2019s share was $15,000, which is less than $15,400. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
