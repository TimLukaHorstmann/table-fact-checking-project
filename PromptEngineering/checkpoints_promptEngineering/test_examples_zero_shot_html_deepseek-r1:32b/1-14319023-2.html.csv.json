Let's check what mixed doubles are listed for that year. In row index 6 (assuming starting from 0), mixed doubles are \"wifqi windarto debby susanto.\" That matches exactly.\n\nSo, in the same year (2007) where the girl single is lindaweni fanetri, the mixed double is indeed wifqi windarto debby susanto.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia, the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim mentions two specific things happening at the same time: a particular girls doubles team and a boys doubles team.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- There are columns for \"girls singles,\" \"boys doubles,\" and others.\n- Each row represents a year, from 2001 to 2010.\n\nSo, I need to check if in any given year, the girls doubles (or maybe girls singles?) team is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\" and simultaneously, the boys doubles team is \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\"\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim mentions \"girl double,\" which I think refers to the \"girls doubles\" column. But looking at the table, in 2009, under \"girls doubles,\" it's listed as \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\" So that might be where the girls doubles team is mentioned.\n\nNow, for the boys doubles part: The claim says \"jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\" Looking at the table, in 2009 under \"boys doubles,\" it's listed as \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\" So that seems to match.\n\nWait, but let me check all the years to make sure there isn't another occurrence. Let's go through each year:\n\n- 2001: Girls doubles is \"lilyana natsir natalia poluakan\"; boys doubles is \"hendra setiawan joko riyadi.\" Doesn't match.\n- 2002: Girls doubles is \"purwati meiliana jauhari\"; boys doubles is \"ujang suherlan yoga ukikasah.\" No match.\n- 2003: Girls doubles is \"pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari\"; boys doubles is \"fran kurniawan chandra kowi.\" Doesn't fit.\n- 2004: Girls doubles same as 2003; boys doubles is different.\n- 2005: Girls doubles is \"lily siswanti shendy puspa irawati\"; boys doubles is \"rio willianto davin prawidssa.\" No match.\n- 2006: Not in the table, so skip.\n- 2007: Same as above, no data provided beyond 2010. Wait, actually the table goes up to 2010.\n\nWait, I should correct that. Let me check each year properly:\n\nLooking back at the table, it's from 2001 to 2010. So continuing:\n\n- 2006: Not present in the table data provided.\n- 2007: Same as above; no data beyond 2010.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check each row correctly.\n\nThe table rows are from 2001 to 2010:\n\n- 2001 (row index 0)\n- 2002 (row 1)\n- 2003 (row 2)\n- 2004 (row 3)\n- 2005 (row 4)\n- 2006? No, the next row after 2005 is 2009? Wait no, looking at the table data:\n\nWait, let me recount. The rows are as follows based on the HTML provided:\n\nRow 0: 2001\nRow 1: 2002\nRow 2: 2003\nRow 3: 2004\nRow 4: 2005\nRow 5: 2006? Wait no, in the HTML, the rows are:\n\nAfter 2005 (row index 4), next is row 5: 2009. Wait, that's odd; it jumps from 2005 to 2009, skipping some years.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the table again. The HTML shows:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr> (for each year)\n</tbody>\n\nLooking at the <tr> elements:\n\n- First row: 2001\n- Second: 2002\n- Third: 2003\n- Fourth: 2004\n- Fifth: 2005\n- Sixth: 2009\n- Seventh: 2010\n\nWait, that's odd. So the years go from 2001 to 2005, then jump to 2009 and 2010, skipping 2006, 2007, 2008.\n\nSo in row index 5: year 2009\nRow 6: year 2010\n\nTherefore, I need to check these rows for the mentioned teams.\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia, the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nSo, in row 5 (2009), girls doubles is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\" and boys doubles is \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\" That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For girls doubles: row index 5, column \"girls doubles\"\n- For boys doubles: same row, column \"boys doubles\"\n\nSo both conditions are met in the same year (2009). Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"}\n   ]\n}",

Scanning through the rows, I see that the sixth row (index starting from 0) has the year 2006.\n   \n   - In this row, there's a column named \"mixed doubles.\" The entry under this column for 2006 is \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto,\" which exactly matches the claim. So, this part checks out.\n\n2. **Boys Singles in 2006**: The claim also states that the boy's singles champion was \"nugroho andi saputro\" in 2006.\n\n   - Again, I look at the same row for 2006 (row index 5).

When the girls singles champion is Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. The mixed doubles champions are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto in a year after 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check these conditions.\n\nStarting with the girls singles column, I'm searching for \"lindaweni fanetri.\" Scanning down the rows:\n\n- 2001: Maria Kristin Yulianti\n- 2002: Fransisca Ratnasari\n- 2003: Wiwis Meilyanna\n- 2004: Pia Zebadiah\n- 2005: Bellaetrix Manuputty\n- 2006: Sylvinna Kurniawan\n- 2007: Lindaweni Fanetri\n\nAh, I find \"lindaweni fanetri\" in the year 2007. So that's our relevant row.\n\nNext, checking the mixed doubles for that same row (2007). The mixed doubles entry is \"wifqi windarto debby susanto.\" That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"after the year 2007.\" However, in this case, the event took place in 2007. So, it's not after but during 2007. The claim specifies \"after,\" which would mean years 2008 or later. \n\nLooking at subsequent years:\n\n- 2008: Irfan Fadhilah Weni Anggraeni\n- 2009: Didit Juang Indrianto Yayu Rahayu\n- 2010: Jones Ralfy Jansen Nurbeta Kwanrico\n\nNone of these entries match \"wifqi windarto debby susanto.\" Therefore, while the mixed doubles champions were indeed Wifqi and Debby in 2007, that's not after 2007.

The claim says: \"in 2010, the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia and the boy double be jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand where to find the necessary information. The columns are 'year', 'boys singles', 'girls singles', 'boys doubles', 'girls doubles', and 'mixed doubles'. Each row represents a year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI need to check two parts of the claim:\n1. For 2010, who were the girls doubles champions?\n2. For 2010, who were the boys doubles champions?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll find the row where 'year' is 2010. Scanning through each row, I see that the last row (row index 9) has the year 2010.\n\nNow, focusing on the columns for girls doubles and boys doubles in that row:\n- Under 'girls doubles', the names are \"aris budiharti dian fitriani\".\n- Under 'boys doubles', the names listed are \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\".\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\" for girls doubles. That doesn't match what's in the table. In 2010, the girls doubles winners were aris budiharti and dian fitriani, not ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\n\nLooking back at previous years to see if those names appear elsewhere: Checking row index 8 (2009), under 'girls doubles', we have \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\". So that's where the claim might be mixing up the years.\n\nTherefore, the girls doubles in 2010 were different from what the claim states.

The claim is: \"In 2009, the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. In 2009, the mixed doubles team was didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\n2. Hermansyah was the boys singles player in 2009.\n\nI'll start by checking each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row corresponds to a year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nFor 2009:\n\n- The relevant cells are in the row where year is 2009.\n- Let me find that row: It's the ninth row (index starts at 0, so row index 8? Wait, let's count from top. First data row is 2001 as index 0, then 2002 is 1, up to 2009 which should be row index 8.\n\nWait, actually the table has rows starting at index 0 for 2001, so 2009 would be row index 8? Let me check: 2001 (0), 2002(1), ..., 2009 is the 9th year listed, which is index 8 in zero-based counting. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting because there are 10 rows from 2001 to 2010. So yes, 2009 would be row index 8.\n\nNow, looking at that row:\n\n- Boys singles: riyanto subagja\n- Mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nSo for part 1 of the claim, mixed doubles in 2009 is indeed didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu. That's correct.\n\nFor part 2, Hermansyah as the boys singles player in 2009: Looking at the boys singles column in 2009 row, it says riyanto subagja, not hermansyah. So this is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014the claim mentions \"hermansyah be the boy single.\" Hmm, perhaps there's confusion between years? Let me check other rows to see where Hermansyah appears.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n2008: Boys singles is hermansyah.\nSo in 2009, it's riyanto subagja. So the claim incorrectly states that hermansyah was the boys single in 2009 when actually he was in 2008.\n\nTherefore, part 1 of the claim is correct, but part 2 is incorrect because Hermansyah wasn't the boys singles in 2009. The claim combines both parts, so since one part is wrong, the whole claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are:\n\n- For mixed doubles in 2009: row index 8, column \"mixed double\"\n- For boys singles in 2009: row index 8, column \"boys singles\"\n\nWait, but in the table, Hermansyah is in boys singles for 2008 (row index 7). So perhaps the claim is mixing up years. But according to the claim, it's specifically about 2009.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row index 8, mixed doubles: confirms didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n- row index 8, boys singles: shows riyanto subagja, not hermansyah\n\nSo both parts need to be true for the claim. Since Hermansyah isn't in 2009's boys singles, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed double\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions girls doubles as \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\" and mixed doubles as \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\". \n\nNow I check if \"anneke feiya...\" appears elsewhere in the table. Looking through other rows, I find that in 2007 (row index 6), girls doubles are \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\" and mixed doubles are \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\". \n\nSo, according to this, in 2007, both conditions of the claim are true. But the claim specifies the year as 2009, which does not match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the girls doubles and mixed doubles mentioned do not correspond to the data for 2009 but rather for 2007.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the 2007 champions with the year 2009. Therefore, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
