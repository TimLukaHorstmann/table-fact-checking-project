    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the score be 4 - 1 on 11 may 2003 and 20 jul 2003\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two specific dates: 11 May 2003 and 20 July 2003. The scores for these dates are claimed to be 4-1 each. I need to check if there are any entries in the table that match these dates and whether their scores are indeed 4-1.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: Date, Competition, Home Team, Away Team, Score, and a few more like something else (maybe venue or other details) and Revenue. Wait, actually, looking again, the column names might be \"Date\", \"Competition\", \"Home Team\", \"Away Team\", \"Score\", and another column which isn't clear from the initial description. But in any case, the relevant columns for this claim are Date and Score.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if either of these dates appears.\n\nStarting with the first row (row index 0): The date is 11 May 2003. That's one of the dates mentioned. Now, looking at the score in that row: it's 4-1. So this part matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking for the other date: 20 July 2003. I'll scan through all rows to see if any have this date. Going down each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is 09 May 2003 \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 2: 17 May 2003 \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: 18 May 2003 \u2013 no.\n...\nContinuing like this, I don't see any row with the date 20 July 2003. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing it. Maybe there are other rows further down.\n\nLooking through all rows up to index 48 (since there are 49 data rows), none of them have the date 20 Jul 2003. The earliest date is 11 May 2003, and others go up to October 2009, but I don't see any entry for July 2003.\n\nSo, while the first part of the claim (11 May 2003 with a score of 4-1) is supported by row index 0, the second part (20 Jul 2003 with a score of 4-1) isn't present in the table. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported because one of the two specified dates doesn't have an entry matching the claimed score.\n\nHence, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the average attendance in May for the Eternal Derby in Croatia is correct. The claim says it's 22,666 on average. Let me go through the data step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a game in the \"Eternal Derby.\" From my knowledge, the Eternal Derby typically refers to matches between two prominent Croatian football clubs, usually Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb. So, any match between these two teams would be part of this derby.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, competition (either 1. HNL or cup), location (Maksimir Stadium is Dinamo's home; Poljud Stadium is Hajduk's home), attendance, and opponent. \n\nI need to extract all games that occurred in May and were part of the derby. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: April 2007, Maksimir. Not May.\nRow 1: October 2007, Poljud. Not May.\nRow 2: February 2008, Maksimir. Not May.\nRow 3: May 2008, Maksimir. This is a cup game against Hajduk, so it's a derby in May.\nRow 4: October 2008, Poljud. Cup game, but not May.\nRow 5: February 2009, Poljud. Not May.\nRow 6: May 2009, Maksimir. Another cup game against Hajduk, so derby in May.\nRow 7: May 2009, Poljud. Cup game against Dinamo, another derby in May.\nRow 8: October 2009, Poljud. Not May.\nRow 9: March 2010, Maksimir. Not May.\nRow 10: April 2010, Poljud. Another cup game against Dinamo, but not May.\nRow 11: May 2010, Maksimir. League game against Hajduk, so derby in May.\n\nSo the relevant games are rows 3,6,7, and 11.\n\nNow, let's list their attendances:\n\nRow 3: 20,000\nRow 6: 20,000\nRow 7: 18,000\nRow 11: 13,000\n\nWait, that adds up to four games. Let me sum these attendances: 20k + 20k + 18k +13k = 71,000.\n\nTo find the average, I divide by the number of games (4): 71,000 /4 = 17,750.\n\nHmm, that's significantly lower than the claimed 22,666. But wait, did I miss any other May games? Let me double-check the table:\n\nLooking again at each row:\n\n- Row 3: May 2008, yes.\n- Row 6: May 2009, correct.\n- Row7: Also May 2009 but Poljud, so it's another game in May.\n- Row11: May 2010.\n\nWait a second, is row7 actually in May? The date for row7 is May 28, 2009. Yes, that's correct. So four games in total.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made an error in considering which games are derbies. Let me check each game:\n\n- Row3: Cup match vs Hajduk at Maksimir. Yes.\n- Row6: Cup final vs Hajduk at Maksimir. derby.\n- Row7: Cup semi-final vs Dinamo at Poljud? Wait, no\u2014Poljud is Hajduk's home, so if it's a game against Dinamo (which is the opponent), then it's a derby. So row7 is correct.\n\nWait, but row11 is in May 2010 at Maksimir against Hajduk, which is a league game, so yes.\n\nSo attendances are:\n\nRow3: 20k\nRow6: 20k\nRow7: 18k\nRow11:13k\n\nTotal:71k /4=17.75k average.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating the years. Let me check all May games:\n\nLooking at each row's date:\n\nRow0: April 2007 - not May.\nRow1: October 2007 - nope.\nRow2: February 2008 - nope.\nRow3: May 2008 - yes.\nRow4: October 2008 - nope.\nRow5: February 2009 - nope.\nRow6: May 2009 - yes.\nRow7: May 2009 - same month as row6, correct.\nRow8: October 2009 - nope.\nRow9: March 2010 - nope.\nRow10: April 2010 - nope.\nRow11: May 2010 - yes.\n\nSo that's four games in May across three years. Their attendances are as I listed before. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed a game? Let me check again. Maybe there's another May game that's part of the derby.\n\nLooking at row numbers:\n\nRow3: May 2008.\nRow6: May 2009 (cup final).\nRow7: May 28, 2009 (cup semi-final).\nRow11: May 2010.\n\nSo four games. The attendances are correct as I noted earlier.\n\nWait a minute, but the average I calculated is only ~17,750, which is much lower than 22,666. So perhaps there's an error in how the data was presented or perhaps the claim refers to a different set of games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misidentifying the derby matches. For example, are all these games actually derbies? Let me think: Hajduk vs Dinamo is always a derby regardless of competition.\n\nSo yes, all four games are derbies.\n\nTherefore, based on this data, the average attendance in May would be around 17,750, not 22,666. So the claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the average attendance for the Eternal Derby in May is 22,666 is incorrect based on the provided data. The analysis identified four derby matches held in May with total attendances of 71,000, resulting in an average of 17,750 attendees per game.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect; the correct average attendance for Eternal Derby games in May, according to the data, is approximately 17,750.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the attendance at the eternal derby (croatia) have never exceeded 35000\" is true or false based on the provided table. First, I need to understand what the table represents and which columns are relevant.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: Date, Competition, Home Team, Away Team, Score, Attendance, and Venue. The claim mentions attendance, so I should focus on the 'Attendance' column. Additionally, since it's about the \"eternal derby\" in Croatia, I assume this refers to matches between two prominent Croatian clubs, likely Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split, which are known for their rivalry.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one and check if both teams involved are from Croatia (specifically, these two clubs) since the eternal derby is a local rivalry. Then, I'll look at the attendance numbers to see if any of them exceed 35,000.\n\nStarting with row 1: The home team is Dinamo Zagreb and the away team is Hajduk Split. Both are from Croatia, so this is relevant. The attendance here is 35,000. That's exactly the threshold mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 2 shows an attendance of 38,000 for a match between Dinamo Zagreb (home) and Hajduk Split (away). This exceeds 35,000, which would make the claim false if this is indeed part of the eternal derby. However, I should verify if all these matches are considered part of the eternal derby.\n\nContinuing through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Attendance 35,000 (exactly the limit)\n- Row 2: 38,000 (exceeds)\n- Other rows have attendances like 35,000 again, but some are lower. For example, row 3 has 35,000 as well.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the table provided, I notice that some of the attendances might be higher than 35,000. For instance, there's an attendance of 38,000 on 22nd February 2009 for a Dinamo Zagreb vs Hajduk Split match.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to check which rows exactly are between these two teams. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRow index 1: Dinamo Zagreb (home) vs Hajduk Split (away), Attendance: 35,000\nRow index 2: Hajduk Split (home) vs Dinamo Zagreb (away), Attendance: 38,000\n...\nLooking further down, I see another match on 24th March 2010 with Hajduk Split home against Dinamo Zagreb away, attendance 13,000. So this is also part of the eternal derby.\n\nWait a second, so in row index 1 and 2 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or starting from 1?), but actually, looking at the table structure provided, it's a bit confusing because the initial HTML shows a table with multiple rows, each representing a match. The claim is about all attendances never exceeding 35,000.\n\nBut in row index 2 (assuming zero-based), the attendance is 38,000 which is higher than 35k. Therefore, this would make the claim false because there's at least one instance where attendance exceeded 35,000 during an eternal derby match.\n\nWait no, looking back: in the table provided, let me count the rows properly.\n\nLooking at the HTML structure, each <tr> represents a row. The first few rows are:\n\n<tr>\n<td>22 sep 2001</td>\n<td>croatia</td>\n<td>dinamo zagreb</td>\n<td>hajduk split</td>\n<td>2-0</td>\n<td>35000</td>\n<td>splitsko polupredsjednistvo</td>\n</tr>\n\nThen another row:\n\n<tr>\n<td>18 mar 2002</td>\n<td>croatia</td>\n<td>dinamo zagreb</td>\n<td>hajduk split</td>\n<td>1-2</td>\n<td>35000</td>\n<td>splitsko polupredsjednistvo</td>\n</tr>\n\nWait, but in the provided table above, I see that some attendances are 35,000 and others are higher or lower. For example, there's a match on 22 Feb 2009 where attendance was 38,000.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is false because at least one attendance figure exceeds 35,000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that attendance at the eternal derby in Croatia has never exceeded 35,000. However, examining the table reveals a match on February 22, 2009, between Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split with an attendance of 38,000, which exceeds 35,000. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because there are instances where attendance exceeded 35,000 during eternal derby matches.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Focus on the 'Attendance' column for matches involving Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split.\n2. **Check Each Match**: Look through each row to find matches between these two clubs and note attendance figures.\n3. **Compare with Threshold**: Identify any attendances above 35,000.\n4. **Conclusion**: Found a match (February 22, 2009) where attendance was 38,000, exceeding the threshold.\n\n**Final Answer:** The claim is false; there are instances of attendance exceeding 35,000 at eternal derby matches in Croatia.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"only 2 super cup game have ever be play\" is true based on the provided table. First, I need to understand what a Super Cup game entails. Typically, a Super Cup is a one-off match between two teams, usually the champions of different competitions within the same country or region.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, type (1. HNL or cup), venue (Maksimir or Poljud), score, attendance, and source. The claim specifically mentions \"super cup games,\" so I should focus on entries where the \"Type\" is \"cup.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to identify which ones are Super Cup games:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Type is \"1.

Counting all rows with \"Type\" as \"cup,\" there are more than two instances. \n\nSpecifically, looking at rows 1, 2, and 4, each has \"cup\" as their type.

The key elements are:\n\n1. **Crowd Attendance**: This relates to the number of people attending an event.\n2. **Month (June)**: We're looking for events that took place in June.\n3. **Eternal Derby (France)**: This seems to be a specific event or set of events, possibly a recurring match between two teams, and it's associated with France.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents an event with several columns:\n\n- **Date**: The date when the event took place.\n- **Category**: Either \"1. hnl\" or \"cup\", which might indicate the type of competition.\n- **Location**: Where the event was held, either \"maksimir\" or \"poljud\".\n- **Score**: The result of the match.\n- **Crowd**: The number of attendees.\n\nI need to check each row for events that occurred in June and are part of the Eternal Derby in France. However, upon reviewing all rows, I notice that none of the dates fall within June. Here's a summary:\n\n- The earliest date is 19 oct 2006.\n- The latest date is 31 oct 2009.\n\nAll events are spread across various months like October, February, March, April, May, September, etc., but there's no event listed in June. Since the claim specifies \"june,\" and there are no relevant rows for that month, I can't find any data to support or refute the average attendance figure of 25666.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions the Eternal Derby (France), which might refer to a specific context not present in our table. The locations listed are \"maksimir\" and \"poljud,\" which don't seem to correspond to France. This adds another layer of uncertainty because the events in the table aren't associated with France.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data for June and the Eternal Derby (France) isn't represented in the provided information, the claim cannot be supported.

Let me check:\n\nThe initial list shows multiple entries. Perhaps I missed some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lowest attendance is in October, which was 4000 in row 6 (assuming Oct 31, 2009). Now, looking at all attendances, the numbers are: 38k, 8k, 38k, 20k, 18k, 10k, 4k, 13k, 30k, 13k.\n\nSo the lowest is indeed 4000 in October. However, I should confirm if any other games have lower attendance than this.\n\nLooking through all attendances:\n\n- The smallest number is 4000 (October)\n- Next is 8000 (September), then 10000 (May), etc.\n\nSo yes, the lowest attendance is in October with 4000 attendees. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the game on October 31, 2009, had the lowest attendance of 4,000.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe lowest attendance occurred in October, specifically on October 31, 2009, with an attendance of 4,000.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"the final game score be 3 - 1 on 11 may and 20 aug 2003.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various games with dates, competition types (like 1. hnl or cup), locations (maksimir or poljud), scores, attendance, and source. My task is to check if there are any entries in the table that match the claim's details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: May 11, 2003, and August 20, 2003. It also states that on both these dates, the final game score was 3-1. \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the table to find any entries from May or August 2003.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first few rows are from 2003:\n  - Row 0: 8 mar 2003, score 2 - 1\n  - Row 1: 9 may 2003, score 1 - 1\n  - Row 2: 17 may 2003, score 1 - 0\n  - Row 3: 25 aug 2003, score 3 - 0\n\nWait, I don't see any rows with May 11 or August 20. The closest are May 9 and August 25 in 2003.\n\nI'll go through each row to ensure I haven't missed anything:\n\n- Row 4: 6 sep 2003\n- ...\n- Rows beyond 2003 don't include the dates mentioned, so they can be ignored.\n\nThe claim refers to two specific dates in 2003, but neither May 11 nor August 20 appears in any of the rows. Therefore, there's no evidence in the table supporting that these games occurred with a score of 3-1 on those dates.\n\nSince the claim specifies both dates and scores not present in the table, the relevant cells are the ones that match the closest details, but they don't confirm the claim. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the attendance at the eternal derby (germany) have exceed 42000",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the attendance at the eternal derby (germany) have exceed 42000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is about. The Eternal Derby refers to matches between Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in Germany. So, I'm looking for attendances at their games that have exceeded 42,000 people.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various matches with details like date, competition (like 1. HNL which is the top tier), venue (maksimir or poljud), score, attendance, and then \"sportnethr\" which might be irrelevant here. The key columns I need are probably \"venue\", \"attendance\".\n\nWait, but in this table, the venues listed are maksimir and poljud. Are these stadiums associated with Borussia Dortmund or Bayern Munich? Let me think: Dortmund's stadium is Signal Iduna Park, and Bayern plays at Allianz Arena. Maksimir and Poljud don't ring a bell as their main stadiums.\n\nHmm, maybe maksimir is in Zagreb, Croatia, so perhaps this table isn't about German derbies but something else. That complicates things because the claim mentions Germany, but the venues are elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking again at the attendance numbers: the highest I see is 38000 on row 21 (row index 21). Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: 42000? No, it's 42000? Wait, no. Looking back, let me list all attendances:\nRow 0: 38000\nRow 1: 42000? Wait, looking at the table data:\n\nLooking through each row, I see that most attendances are around 10,000 to 38,000. The highest is 38000 on row 21 (match date 22 feb 2009). There's no entry where attendance exceeds 42000.\n\nWait a second, did I miss any? Let me go through each one:\n\nRow 0: 38000\nRow 1: 42000? No, looking at the data provided earlier, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the table data in the user message shows attendances like 38000 on row 21, but others are lower. So no attendance exceeds 42000.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because none of the attendances listed go beyond 42,000.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not show any attendance exceeding 42,000 for matches at venues associated with the Eternal Derby in Germany. The highest attendance was 38,000 on row index 21.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the highest attendance set a new record for game in november",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the highest attendance set a new record for game in november.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like Date, Type (1. hnl and cup), Opponent, Score, Attendance, and Source. The rows contain data from different dates ranging from 2005 to 2010.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points: \n1. There's a game in November.\n2. The attendance for that game was the highest and set a new record.\n\nSo, I need to check if there's any game listed in November. Looking through the 'Date' column:\n\n- The earliest date is 8 May 2005, and the latest is 1 May 2010.\n- Scanning through each row, I don't see any dates with a month of November.\n\nWithout any games in November, there's no way to set an attendance record for that month. Therefore, the claim can't be supported by the data provided.\n\nNext, just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other points I might have missed. The highest attendance numbers are important here. The maximum 'Attendance' value in the table is 38000 on row 19 (22 Feb 2009). But since there's no November game, this doesn't affect the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: No games were played in November according to the table, so the highest attendance couldn't have been set in that month. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there have be at least 8 super cup game play in 2010",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"there have be at least 8 super cup game play in 2010.\" I need to verify this against the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a Super Cup is. Typically, a Super Cup is a football competition where the league champion plays against the cup champion. However, without additional context about which country or league we're talking about, it's challenging to confirm if these matches are indeed Super Cups. But for this task, I'll proceed under the assumption that \"Super Cup\" refers to any such match in 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, competition type (e.g., 'cup', '1. hnl'), location, result, attendance, and source ('sportnethr'). The years range from 2008 to 2010.\n\nThe claim specifies \"2010,\" so I'll focus on the rows where the date year is 2010. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- The last three rows are dated March, April, and May 2010.\n  - Row 34: 24 Mar 2010, cup\n  - Row 35: 7 Apr 2010, cup\n  - Row 36: 1 May 2010, 1. hnl\n\nWait, that's only three games in 2010. The claim says \"at least 8,\" which is much higher than what I see here. It seems the table doesn't have any other entries for 2010 beyond these.\n\nI need to check if there are more rows after row 36, but according to the provided data, it stops at row 36 with May 2010. So only three matches are listed in 2010.\n\nAdditionally, all competitions in 2010 are either 'cup' or '1. hnl.' Since a Super Cup is usually a specific type of competition, unless 'cup' refers to the Super Cup in this context, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven this, there are only three games listed for 2010, which doesn't meet the claim of at least eight. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
