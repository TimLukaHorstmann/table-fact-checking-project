    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"mikhail mamistov have a perfection percentage of 77.96.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's stating that Mikhail Mamistov has a perfection percentage of exactly 77.96%. My job is to check if this information matches the data in the provided HTML table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has five columns: rank, name, nationality, score, and perfection. Each row represents an individual with their respective details. The rows are numbered from 1 to 9, so there are nine entries in total.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Mikhail Mamistov's Row:** I'll scan through the 'name' column to find where \"mikhail mamistov\" is listed. Once located, that will be my row of interest.\n\n2. **Extract Perfection Percentage:** From the identified row, I'll look at the 'perfection' column to see what percentage is recorded there.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:** Finally, I'll compare this extracted value with the 77.96% mentioned in the claim to determine if it's accurate.\n\nStarting with step one, I go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Svetlana Kapanina\n- Row 2: Viktor Chmal\n- Row 3: Mikhail Mamistov\n\nSo, Mikhail is on row 3. Now, moving to the 'perfection' column in that row, the value given is 77.96%.\n\nComparing this with the claim, it's an exact match. Therefore, the statement holds true.\n\nI also note that all other rows don't have any conflicting information about Mikhail's perfection percentage since each row represents a different person.\n\nThus, based on the data in the table, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"perfection\"}]}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: rank, name, nationality, score, and perfection. The rows are numbered from 1 to 9.\n\nThe claim mentions \"svetlana fedorenko\" and her rank being 8. So, I need to find if this person exists in the table with that specific rank.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's name column to see if \"svetlana fedorenko\" is listed. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: svtelana kapanina\n- Row 2: viktor chmal\n- Row 3: mikhail mamistov\n- Row 4: elena klimovich\n- Row 5: oleg shpolyanskiy\n- Row 6: castor fantoba\n- Row 7: fran\u00e3\u00a7ois le vot\n- Row 8: svtelana fedorenko\n- Row 9: pierre marmy\n\nYes, I see \"svetlana fedorenko\" in row 8. Now, checking the rank for that row. The rank column in row 8 shows rank 8.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: her name is correctly spelled and she's ranked number 8. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains \"svetlana fedorenko\" with a rank of 8.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
