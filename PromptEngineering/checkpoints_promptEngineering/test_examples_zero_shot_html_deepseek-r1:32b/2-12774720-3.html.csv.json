The rows below include various tournaments like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and then a row labeled \"win - loss\". \n\nThe claim is about Michael Kohlmann's highest win-loss score being 5-4. I need to check the \"win - loss\" row in each year to see if any of them have a value higher than 5-4.\n\nLooking at the \"win - loss\" row:\n- 1999: 1 - 4\n- 2002: 1 - 4\n- 2004: 4 - 4\n- 2006: 3 - 4\n- 2007: 5 - 4\n- 2010: 5 - 4\n- 2011: 5 - 4\n- 2012: 2 - 4\n\nThe highest win-loss score here is indeed 5 - 4, which appears in the years 2007, 2010, and 2011.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. The columns are years from 1999 to 2012, and the rows include different tournaments like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a row for \"win - loss\". So each tournament has its own set of results across these years.\n\nThe claim says that in both 1999 and 2002, Michael Kohlmann had a win-loss score of 1-4. I need to check if this is accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at the \"win - loss\" row (row index 5), the columns are years from 1999 to 2012. So for 1999, under column '1999', it's showing \"1  - 4\". Similarly, in 2002 (column '2002'), it also shows \"1  - 4\". \n\nSo both years have the same win-loss record of 1-4. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The rows we're concerned with are the \"win - loss\" row (row index 5), and specifically the columns for '1999' and '2002'. \n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 5, column name '1999'\n- Row index 5, column name '2002'\n\nThis supports the claim that both years have a win-loss of 1-4. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table's \"win - loss\" row shows 1-4 for both 1999 and 2002.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2002\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. The columns are years: 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Each row under these years seems to detail the performance in different tournaments.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- The first row after the header is \"grand slam tournaments\", which likely serves as a category.\n- Then we have specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open.\n- The last row mentions \"win - loss\" with corresponding statistics for each year.\n\nThe claim is about Michael Kohlmann's performance in two tournaments in specific years. Let me focus on the 2004 column since that's the year mentioned in both parts of the claim.\n\nFor the Australian Open:\nI need to find the cell under \"Australian Open\" row and \"2004\" column. Looking at the table, the Australian Open row for 2004 shows '2r'. So that matches the claim: 2r in 2004 Australian Open.\n\nNext, checking the French Open in 2004:\nThe French Open row for 2004 is listed as '3r'. This also aligns with the claim which states he reached 3r there.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table, the claim should be TRUE. Now, I need to note down the relevant cells' row indices and column names.\n\nLooking back at the structure:\n- The \"Australian Open\" is the second row (row index 1) under the header.\n- The \"French Open\" is the third row (row index 2).\n- The year 2004 is a column named '2004'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n1. Row index 1, column name '2004' for Australian Open's 2r.\n2. Row index 2, column name '2004' for French Open's 3r.\n\nI think that covers both parts of the claim accurately without any discrepancies. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE with those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2004\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 1 sf in 2010 for michael kohlmann\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the table contains. The table has several rows: one titled \"grand slam tournaments,\" then each of the four major tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open), and a final row with \"win - loss\" records for each year from 1999 to 2012.\n\nThe claim mentions \"sf in 2010.\" I know that \"sf\" stands for semifinals. So, the claim is stating that in 2010, Michael Kohlmann reached the semifinals only once across all grand slam tournaments that year.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, each year from 1999 to 2012 has its own column. The rows under each tournament show how far a player advanced in that year. For example, \"3r\" means third round, \"qf\" is quarterfinals, and \"sf\" is semifinals.\n\nI need to check the 2010 column for each of the four tournaments to see how many times Michael Kohlmann reached the sf.\n\nStarting with Australian Open in 2010: The cell under Australian Open for 2010 says \"sf.\" So that's one instance of reaching semifinals.\n\nNext, French Open 2010: The entry is \"1r,\" meaning he lost in the first round. No sf here.\n\nWimbledon 2010: He reached the second round (\"2r\"), so no semifinal appearance.\n\nUS Open 2010: He also made it to the third round (\"3r\"), which is better than before but still not a semifinal.\n\nSo, looking at all four tournaments in 2010, Michael Kohlmann only reached the semifinals once\u2014in the Australian Open. The other three tournaments didn't get him past the early rounds or quarterfinals.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there's only one sf in 2010 for him is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the highest win - loss score for Michael Kohlmann be 4 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The table has a header row with years from 1999 to 2012. Each subsequent row represents different tournaments and their corresponding results. The last row in the body is labeled \"win - loss\" and shows win-loss scores for each year.\n\nThe claim mentions Michael Kohlmann, but I don't see any mention of his name in the table. All rows under the \"tournament\" column are either types of grand slam tournaments or \"win - loss\". So, maybe the table doesn't include information about individual players like Michael Kohlmann.\n\nLooking at the \"win - loss\" row, each cell has scores like 1-4, 5-4, etc. The highest score I see is 5-4 in multiple years. There's a 4-4 score in 2004 and another in 2006 and so on. But the claim says \"highest\" which should be the maximum value.\n\nSince 5-4 appears higher than 4-4, the highest win-loss shouldn't be 4-4. Also, without any player names, I can't confirm if Michael Kohlmann's data is even in this table. So the claim might not be supported by the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific player (Michael Kohlmann) whose data isn't present in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"michael kohlman play for total of 8 time in both wimbledon and us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the table shows.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for different years (1999, 2002, etc.) and rows that list various tournaments and other statistics like \"win - loss\". The first row under the header is just repeating \"grand slam tournaments\" across all columns, which seems redundant but probably indicates that those are the types of tournaments listed below. Then there are four specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. Each has entries for different years showing their performance in terms of rounds reached (like 1r, 2r, sf for semifinals, qf for quarterfinals, etc.).\n\nThe claim is about Michael Kohlman playing a total of 8 times in both Wimbledon and US Open. So I need to check how many times he participated in each of these tournaments across the years listed.\n\nFirst, let me identify which rows correspond to Wimbledon and US Open. In the table, Wimbledon is row index 3 (since the first data row after the header is index 0: grand slam tournaments, then Australian Open is index 1, French Open index 2, Wimbledon index 3). Similarly, US Open is row index 4.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times he played in each tournament. Each column corresponds to a year, so for each year from 1999 to 2012 (excluding some years), there's an entry indicating his performance that year.\n\nFor Wimbledon (row index 3):\n- The entries are: 1r, 2r, 1r, 2r, 2r, 1r, 1r, 2r.\nWait, looking back at the table, let me recount. From the HTML structure, each row has 8 data cells (since there are 9 columns including 'tournament'). So for Wimbledon, the entries are:\n- 1999: 1r\n- 2002: 2r\n- 2004: 1r\n- 2006: 2r\n- 2007: 2r\n- 2010: 1r\n- 2011: 1r\n- 2012: 2r\n\nThat's a total of 8 entries. Each entry represents his participation in that year, so he played Wimbledon 8 times.\n\nFor US Open (row index 4):\nThe entries are:\n- 1999: 1r\n- 2002: 1r\n- 2004: 2r\n- 2006: 3r\n- 2007: 2r\n- 2010: 2r\n- 2011: 2r\n- 2012: 1r\n\nAgain, that's 8 entries. So he played US Open 8 times.\n\nNow, the claim says he played a total of 8 times in both tournaments combined. Wait, no\u2014the wording is \"total of 8 time in both wimbledon and us open.\" So does that mean each tournament or combined? The way it's phrased could be ambiguous. If it means 8 times each, then that would be 16 total. But more likely, the claim is saying he played a combined total of 8 times across both tournaments.\n\nWait, but in the table, for Wimbledon, there are 8 entries (from 1999 to 2012), and similarly for US Open, 8 entries as well. So each tournament has 8 participations.\n\nBut looking at the years listed: 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012. That's 8 years in total for each tournament.\n\nSo Michael Kohlman played Wimbledon 8 times and US Open 8 times, making a combined total of 16 participations. But the claim says \"total of 8 time in both,\" which could be interpreted as 8 times combined or 8 times each.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The table has entries for each tournament across different years, but not all consecutive years are present. For example, from 1999 to 2012, there's a gap between 1999 and 2002 (missing 2000 and 2001), then 2004, skipping 2003, etc. So the years listed are not consecutive.\n\nBut regardless of the years, each tournament has 8 entries in the table, meaning he participated 8 times in Wimbledon and 8 times in US Open across those specific years. Therefore, the total number of participations in both tournaments combined would be 16.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"total of 8 time in both,\" which suggests that together, Wimbledon and US Open, he played 8 times. But according to the table, it's 8 each, totaling 16. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because he participated more than 8 times combined.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it means that in both tournaments, he played a total of 8 matches or rounds? No, the claim says \"play for total of 8 time,\" which likely refers to participations. So if each tournament has 8 participations, then the total is 16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that he played 8 times in each tournament, but I'm not sure. The way it's phrased is a bit unclear. But based on the table, each tournament shows 8 participations. So if the claim is that he played 8 times in each (totaling 16), then the claim would be TRUE only if it's about each individually. But since it says \"both wimbledon and us open,\" implying combined, the total would be 16, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again: for Wimbledon, he has entries in all 8 years listed (from 1999 to 2012, with gaps), which is 8 participations. Similarly for US Open, another 8. So combined, that's 16. The claim says \"total of 8 time in both,\" meaning together they sum up to 8. But since it's actually 16, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting the years. Let me count the number of years for each tournament:\n\nWimbledon entries:\n- 1999\n- 2002\n- 2004\n- 2006\n- 2007\n- 2010\n- 2011\n- 2012\n\nThat's 8 years, so 8 participations.\n\nUS Open entries:\nSame list of years: 8 participations.\n\nTotal combined: 16. Therefore, the claim that he played a total of 8 times in both tournaments is incorrect because it's actually 16 times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Michael Kohlman played a total of 8 times in both Wimbledon and US Open. The table shows he participated in each tournament 8 times across different years, resulting in a combined total of 16 participations. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

Since the claim refers to Michael Kohlman, and he isn't listed in the table, there's no direct evidence here about his performance.

The table has rows for different tournaments like Grand Slam tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a row for win-loss records. The columns are years from 1999 to 2012, but in this case, each cell under these years represents the performance of Michael Kohlmann in that specific tournament for that year.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions both the Australian Open and the French Open having scores of \"2r\". I need to check each of these tournaments across all years to see if there's any instance where both have \"2r\".\n\nStarting with the Australian Open row (row index 1), looking at each column:\n\n- 1999: 2r\n- 2002: 1r\n- 2004: 2r\n- 2006: 1r\n- 2007: 1r\n- 2010: sf\n- 2011: 3r\n- 2012: 2r\n\nSo in 1999, 2004, and 2012, the Australian Open shows \"2r\".

It also specifies the year 2010 and attributes this achievement to Michael Kohlman.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for different years: 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012. The rows under these columns are labeled with tournament names like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open, as well as a row for win-loss records.\n\nI need to check if there's any mention of Michael Kohlman in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see entries like \"australian open,\" \"french open,\" etc., but none of them are labeled as Michael Kohlman. The first row under \"tournament\" just says \"grand slam tournaments\" repeated across all columns.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the year 2010 to see if there's any indication that someone reached SF multiple times that year. In the 2010 column, looking at each tournament:\n\n- Australian Open: sf (semi-finals)\n- French Open: 1r (first round)\n- Wimbledon: 1r\n- US Open: 2r (second round)\n\nSo in 2010, the player reached the semi-finals once in the Australian Open but didn't make it that far in other tournaments. The claim says \"several sf's,\" which implies more than one. Since there's only one SF in 2010 according to the table, this part doesn't hold.\n\nAdditionally, since there's no specific mention of Michael Kohlman anywhere in the table, I can't attribute these results to him. The table might be summarizing another player's performance or is a general overview without specifying individual players like Michael Kohlman.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Michael Kohlman had several semi-finals in 2010 isn't supported by the data provided. There's only one SF achievement, and no reference to Michael Kohlman.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not mention Michael Kohlman. In the year 2010, there is only one \"sf\" (semi-final) listed for Australian Open.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2010\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"michael kohlman play wimbledon 4 time and the us open 6 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table shows. The table lists several tournaments: grand slam tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a row for win-loss records across different years (1999 to 2012). Each cell under these tournaments shows the performance in each year, like '1r' meaning first round, '2r' second round, etc.\n\nThe claim is about Michael Kohlman playing Wimbledon four times and the US Open six times. So I need to check how many times he participated in each tournament based on the table data.\n\nLooking at the \"Wimbledon\" row: The columns are years 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012. Each cell under Wimbledon shows his performance in that year.\n\nSimilarly, the \"US Open\" row has the same years and shows his results each year.\n\nTo find out how many times he played each tournament, I'll count the number of entries for each tournament. If there's an entry (like '1r', '2r'), it means he participated; if not, perhaps he didn't play that year.\n\nFor Wimbledon:\n- 1999: 1r\n- 2002: 2r\n- 2004: 1r\n- 2006: 2r\n- 2007: 2r\n- 2010: 1r\n- 2011: 1r\n- 2012: 2r\n\nThat's eight years, so he played Wimbledon 8 times, not four.\n\nFor US Open:\n- 1999: 1r\n- 2002: 1r\n- 2004: 2r\n- 2006: 3r\n- 2007: 2r\n- 2010: 2r\n- 2011: 2r\n- 2012: 1r\n\nAgain, eight years, so he played US Open 8 times, not six.\n\nWait, but the table might only list years where he participated. Let me check if all years are covered or just some. The columns go from 1999 to 2012, but each row has data for those specific years.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the entries under Wimbledon and US Open across their respective rows.\n\nThe claim says four times Wimbledon and six times US Open, but according to the table, he played both tournaments eight times. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2002\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2002\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2012\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
