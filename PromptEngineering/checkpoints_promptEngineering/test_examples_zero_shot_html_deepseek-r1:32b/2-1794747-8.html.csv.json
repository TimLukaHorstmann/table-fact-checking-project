    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for best actress in a musical category in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse each part of the claim and see where to look in the table.\n\n1. **Year**: The claim mentions 2013. I should check rows where the year is 2013.\n2. **Award Ceremony**: It's the Laurence Olivier Award. So I need to find rows with this award ceremony.\n3. **Category**: Best actress in a musical. Looking for that specific category.\n4. **Nominee**: Imelda Staunton should be listed as the nominee.\n5. **Result**: She must have 'won' according to the claim.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nThe table has rows from 2012 and multiple years of Laurence Olivier Awards in 2013. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2012, Evening Standard Award, Best musical. Doesn't match.\n- Rows 1 to 6 are all Laurence Olivier Awards in 2013.\n\nLooking at each category:\n- Row 1: Best musical revival. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Best actor in a musical. Michael Ball won.\n- Row 3: Best actress in a musical. Imelda Staunton, result is 'won'.\n- Rows 4-6 are other categories, but the nominees didn't win.\n\nSo, row index 3 has all the necessary info:\n- Year 2013\n- Laurence Olivier Award\n- Category: best actress in a musical\n- Nominee: Imelda Staunton\n- Result: won\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from row 3, specifically the 'year', 'award ceremony', 'category', 'nominee', and 'result' columns.\n\nWait, but according to instructions, I need to list each relevant cell's row index and column name. So for this row (index 3), all these columns are relevant because they confirm each part of the claim. So in the JSON, I should include each of these as separate objects in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim they want verified. The task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It looks like it's an awards table with columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. There are seven rows of data here, spanning from 2012 to 2013.\n\nThe claim is: \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012.\" So, I need to check if Imelda Staunton was nominated for an award in the year 2012 according to this table.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row and checking two things: the year and whether Imelda Staunton is listed as a nominee.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- Year: 2012\n- Nominee: \"best musical\" (which seems like the category name, not a person)\nSo, no person named here. Not relevant for the claim about Imelda.\n\nNext, rows 2 through 7 are all from 2013:\nRow 2: Best musical revival - nominee is \"best musical revival.\"\nRow 3: Best actor in a musical - Michael Ball.\nRow 4: Best actress in a musical - Imelda Staunton. Result is 'won'.\nRows 5-7: Various technical categories with different nominees.\n\nSo, all the entries for Imelda Staunton are in 2013. There's no mention of her being a nominee in 2012. Therefore, the claim that she was nominated in 2012 isn't supported by this table.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any rows from 2012 where Imelda could be listed as a nominee. Scanning through again, the only 2012 entry is the first row, and it's about \"best musical\" without a person's name.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no entry in the table for Imelda Staunton being a nominee in 2012.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
