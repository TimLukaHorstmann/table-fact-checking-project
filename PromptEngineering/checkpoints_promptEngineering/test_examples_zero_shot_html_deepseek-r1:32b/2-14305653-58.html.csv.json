The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 1:4 in the balkan cup against romania on august 27.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points from the claim:\n\n1. **Date**: August 27\n2. **Opponent**: Romania\n3. **Result**: Lose 1:4\n4. **Type of Game**: Balkan Cup\n\nNow, I'll check each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row is March 22, opponent Uruguay, result 2:1, friendly.\n- Second row: March 30, Romania, 2:0, Balkan Cup. Here they won against Romania with a 2:0 score in the Balkan Cup on March 30.\n- Third row: April 26, Poland, 2:1, friendly.\n- Fourth row: August 27, Bucharest, Romania, 1:4, Balkan Cup. This seems relevant because it's against Romania and part of the Balkan Cup on August 27. The result is a loss with a score of 1:4, which fits the claim about their worst outcome.\n- Fifth row: September 10, Luxembourg, 5:0, WCQ.\n- Sixth row: September 27, Denmark, 2:1, WCQ.\n- Seventh row: November 15, Italy, 0:2, WCQ.\n\nSo the relevant row is the fourth one. Let me note down the details:\n\n- **Date**: August 27 matches the claim.\n- **City**: Bucharest, Romania \u2013 opponent is Romania, which aligns with the claim.\n- **Opponent**: Romania as stated.\n- **Results**: 1:4 loss, which is their worst outcome in this table since it's a significant loss compared to other results like 2:0 wins or higher scores.\n- **Type of Game**: Balkan Cup, matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, all the details in the claim are supported by the fourth row of the table. The team did lose 1:4 against Romania on August 27 in a Balkan Cup match, which seems to be their worst result here.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the data provided.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the yugoslavian national team lose the balkan cup against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns for date, city, opponent, results, and type of game.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: that Yugoslavia lost the Balkan Cup against Romania, and the aggregate score was 3-4.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. March 22: Friendly match vs Uruguay, result 2:1. Not relevant.\n2. March 30: In Belgrade, played Romania in a Balkan Cup game, result 2:0. So Yugoslavia won here with 2-0.\n3. April 26: Friendly against Poland, 2:1 win. Not relevant.\n4. August 27: Played Romania again in Bucharest for the Balkan Cup. Result was 1:4. So here, Yugoslavia lost 1-4.\n\nNow, the claim says they \"lose the balkan cup... with a aggregate score of 3:4.\" An aggregate usually refers to two legs (home and away). \n\nFrom the table:\n- Home game in Belgrade on March 30: 2-0 win.\n- Away game in Bucharest on August 27: 1-4 loss.\n\nCalculating the aggregate: home score is 2, away is 1 for Yugoslavia; Romania's scores are 0 and 4. So total for Yugoslavia is 2+1=3 goals, Romania has 0+4=4 goals. That makes the aggregate 3-4 in favor of Romania.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they lost with an aggregate of 3:4 is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"type of game\"},\n     {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"type of game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. They failed to score only once.\n2. They lost a World Cup qualifier (WCQ) match 0:2 against Italy.\n\nStarting with point 2 since it seems more specific. I'll search for rows where the opponent is Italy and the type of game is WCQ. Looking through the table, the last row on November 15 shows a match in Torino, Italy, against Italy with a result of 0:2 and the type as 1982 wcq. This matches the claim about losing 0:2 in a WCQ.\n\nNow for point 1: failing to score only once. I'll check all results where Yugoslavia didn't score. Looking at each row's 'results' column:\n- March 22: 2:1 (scored)\n- March 30: 2:0 (scored)\n- April 26: 2:1 (scored)\n- August 27: 1:4 (they scored once, so not a failure to score)\n- September 10: 5:0 (scored)\n- September 27: 2:1 (scored)\n- November 15: 0:2 (didn't score)\n\nOnly one match where they failed to score is the November 15 game against Italy. So the claim that they failed only once holds true.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied with this data, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things: Yugoslavia failed to score only once and lost a WCQ match 0:2 against Italy.

The task is to determine whether a specific claim about the Yugoslavian national team's performance in 1982 World Cup qualifiers is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 3 1982 world cup qualify match.\" So, they're saying that in three matches related to the 1982 World Cup qualifiers, Yugoslavia scored a total of seven goals and conceded three.\n\nNext, I need to look at the table provided. The table lists several matches with details like date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. My focus is on rows where the 'type of game' is \"1982 wcq\" because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLooking through the table, I see three such entries:\n\n1. September 10: Played in Luxembourg against Luxembourg, result was 5-0.\n2. September 27: In Ljubljana against Denmark, result 2-1.\n3. November 15: In Torino, Italy, against Italy, result 0-2.\n\nNow, for each of these matches, I'll extract the goals scored by Yugoslavia and the goals they conceded.\n\nFirst match (September 10): Result is 5-0. So, Yugoslavia scored 5 and allowed 0.\nSecond match (September 27): Result is 2-1. They scored 2 and allowed 1.\nThird match (November 15): Result is 0-2. They scored 0 and allowed 2.\n\nAdding up the goals scored: 5 + 2 + 0 = 7. That matches the claim's total of seven goals scored.\n\nNow, adding up the goals conceded: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. This also aligns with the claim stating they allowed three goals in total.\n\nEach relevant cell contributes to verifying either the goals scored or conceded. The rows involved are index 4 (September 10), index 5 (September 27), and index 6 (November 15). The columns we're looking at for each row are 'results' because that's where both goals scored and conceded are indicated.\n\nSo, all the data points in the table support the claim.

The team in question is the Yugoslavian national team.\n2. They have two friendly matches.\n3. Both matches were won with a score of 0:2.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all rows where the type of game is \"friendly\". From the table, I see there are three such entries:\n\n- Row 0: Friendly match on March 22 in Sarajevo vs Uruguay, result 2:1.\n- Row 2: Friendly match on April 26 in Borovo vs Poland, result 2:1.\n\nWait, that's only two friendly matches. The third one is actually a WCQ game, not friendly.\n\nNow, check the results:\n\nBoth friendly matches have results of 2:1, meaning Yugoslavia won both but with different scores than claimed (0:2). Also, the claim says they won both by 0:2, which isn't matching either result.\n\nMoreover, in row index 4,5,6, those are WCQ games. So, in friendly matches (rows 0 and 2), Yugoslavia won with 2:1 each time, not 0:2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because:\n\n- The scores don't match.\n- They did win both friendlies, but the score isn't 0:2 as claimed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia won two friendly matches with a score of 0:2. However, the table shows they won their two friendlies with 2:1 each time.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table of football (soccer) match results is true or false. The claim is: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 2:1 in the balken cup against poland on march 22\".\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions several key elements:\n1. The Yugoslavian national team.\n2. Their worst outcome (a loss) with a score of 2:1.\n3. The game is part of the Balken Cup.\n4. They played against Poland on March 22.\n\nI'll go through each element to see if it matches any entry in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are seven rows, each representing a different match with details like date, city, opponent, results, and type of game.\n\nStarting with the date: \"march 22\". Scanning through the 'date' column, I find that row 0 has \"march 22\" as the date. That's a good start. So, this is the match in question.\n\nNext, checking the opponent on that date. The claim says against Poland. Row 0 shows the opponent as Uruguay, not Poland. This already seems conflicting because if it was against Poland, but according to the table, it was against Uruguay. That might mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nHowever, I should double-check other rows just in case there's another match on March 22 that I missed or any other matches involving Poland and the Balken Cup. Looking through all dates, March 22 is only present once, which is row 0.\n\nAdditionally, checking other rows for opponent \"Poland\": I find that in row 2, the date is April 26, city Borovo, opponent Poland, result 2:1, type friendly. So, this match was against Poland but it's a friendly game, not the Balken Cup, and the score was a win (2:1) for Yugoslavia.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Balken Cup\". Looking at the 'type of game' column in row 0, it's listed as 'friendly', so that doesn't fit. The other matches with the type 'balkan cup' are rows 1 and 3. Row 1 is against Romania on March 30, result 2:0; row 3 is against Romania again on August 27, result 1:4.\n\nSo, the claim says it's a Balken Cup match against Poland on March 22 with a loss of 2:1. But in reality, the March 22 match was a friendly game against Uruguay, and Yugoslavia won 2:1. There is another match against Poland, but that was on April 26, also a friendly, which they won. The only Balken Cup matches were against Romania.\n\nTherefore, the claim has several inaccuracies:\n- Wrong opponent (Uruguay instead of Poland).\n- Wrong type of game (friendly instead of Balken Cup).\n- Incorrect result in terms of context (they didn't lose in a Balken Cup match against Poland on that date; they actually won a friendly against Poland later).\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim is false because none of the details align correctly with any of the entries in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions a loss against Poland in the Balken Cup on March 22. Checking the table:\n- The match on March 22 was against Uruguay, not Poland.\n- It was a friendly game, not the Balken Cup.\n- Yugoslavia won 2:1.\n\nThus, the claim is false because it misidentifies the opponent, the type of game, and the result.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states two main points:\n1. The Yugoslavian team failed to score only once.\n2. They dropped a World Cup qualifier match 2:1 against Denmark.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all matches involving Yugoslavia where they failed to score. That means looking at rows where the result shows a score of 0: something for Yugoslavia's goals. Scanning through each row:\n\n- March 22: Result is 2:1 (Yugoslavia scored).\n- March 30: Result is 2:0 (Yugoslavia scored).\n- April 26: Result is 2:1 (Yugoslavia scored).\n- August 27: Result is 1:4 (Yugoslavia scored 1 goal).\n- September 10: Result is 5:0 (Yugoslavia scored a lot).\n- September 27: Result is 2:1 against Denmark.\n- November 15: Result is 0:2 against Italy.\n\nWait, in the November 15 match, Yugoslavia didn't score at all\u2014they lost 0:2. That's one instance where they failed to score. But I should check if there are more such instances. Looking through each row again, only the last match shows a result of 0 for Yugoslavia, so it seems they failed to score only once.\n\nNext, regarding the World Cup qualifier against Denmark: in September 27, the result is 2:1 in favor of Yugoslavia. So they actually won that match, not lost (dropped). The claim says they dropped the match, which would mean they lost, but according to the table, they won 2:1.\n\nTherefore, part one of the claim is correct\u2014only one instance where they didn't score\u2014but part two is incorrect because they won against Denmark in a WC qualifier. So the overall claim is false.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For the scoring failure, the November 15 match: row index 6, columns date, city, opponent, results.\n- For the WCQ against Denmark: September 27 match, row index 5, same columns.\n\nSo the relevant cells are those rows and their respective result columns to check the scores.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The Yugoslavian national team lost.\n2. They played against Romania.\n3. The match was in Italy (possibly meaning that the location was Italy).\n4. The aggregate score was 3:4.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, city, opponent, results, and type of game.\n\nI need to find any rows where Yugoslavia played Romania in Italy and whether the result matches the claim.\n\nChecking each row:\n\nRow 1: March 22, Sarajevo vs Uruguay. Not relevant since opponent is Uruguay, not Romania. Also, location isn't Italy.\n\nRow 2: March 30, Belgrade vs Romania. Opponent is Romania, but location is Belgrade, not Italy. Result is 2:0 in favor of Yugoslavia. So they didn't lose here.\n\nRow 3: April 26, Borovo vs Poland. Not relevant as opponent is Poland.\n\nRow 4: August 27, Bucharest, Romania vs Romania. Wait, that doesn't make sense; if the location is Bucharest and opponent is Romania, this might be a game where Yugoslavia played at Romania's home. The result was 1:4, so Yugoslavia lost with a score of 1-4.\n\nRow 5: September 10, Luxembourg vs Luxembourg. Opponent is Luxembourg, not Romania.\n\nRow 6: September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: November 15, Torino, Italy vs Italy. Opponent is Italy here, so Yugoslavia played in Italy against Italy, result was 0:2. So Yugoslavia lost to Italy with a score of 0-2.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"against Romania\" in Italy. Let me see if there's any game where Yugoslavia played Romania in Italy.\n\nLooking again at row 4: August 27, Bucharest (Romania) vs Romania. Result was 1:4 loss for Yugoslavia.\n\nBut this is in Romania, not Italy. The claim says \"in Italy against Romania.\" There's no such entry in the table. So perhaps the claim is mixing up details.\n\nWait, row 4's location is \"bucharest , romania,\" so it's a game away in Romania, not Italy.\n\nThen there's row 7: November 15, Torino, Italy vs Italy. Here, Yugoslavia played in Italy against Italy, but opponent isn't Romania.\n\nSo the claim says they lost to Romania in Italy with an aggregate of 3:4. Let me see if any games have aggregate scores.\n\nIn the table, each game is a single match, not necessarily part of an aggregate series. The results are all single matches, except perhaps the \"1982 wcq\" type which might be qualifiers, but each result is standalone.\n\nLooking at the results:\n\n- Against Romania in Belgrade: 2:0 (Yugoslavia win)\n- Against Romania in Bucharest: 1:4 (Yugoslavia loss)\n\nSo total aggregate over two matches would be 3:4 in favor of Romania. So Yugoslavia's total goals scored: 2+1=3; Romania's: 0+4=4.\n\nBut the claim says they lost against Romania \"in Italy\" with a 3:4 aggregate. However, all games against Romania were either in Belgrade or Bucharest (Romania). There was no game against Romania in Italy.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that Yugoslavia played against Romania in Italy and lost with an aggregate of 3:4. The actual games against Romania didn't take place in Italy; they were in Belgrade and Bucharest.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because:\n\n- They didn't play against Romania in Italy.\n- While their total goals in both matches against Romania are 3 (scored) to 4 (conceded), this was across two games in Yugoslavia and Romania, not in Italy.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be row indices where they played Romania. Rows 1 and 4:\n\nRow 1: opponent is Uruguay, not Romania. Wait, no\u2014row 2 is March 30 vs Romania in Belgrade.\n\nWait, let me correct that:\n\nLooking again, the rows are:\n\nRow 0: Sarajevo vs Uruguay\nRow 1: Belgrade vs Romania (March 30)\nRow 2: Borovo vs Poland\nRow 3: Bucharest vs Romania (August 27)\nRow 4: Luxembourg vs Luxembourg\nRow 5: Ljubljana vs Denmark\nRow 6: Torino, Italy vs Italy\n\nSo rows 1 and 3 are against Romania. The claim says the game was in Italy, but both these games were in Belgrade (Yugoslavia) and Bucharest (Romania), not Italy.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells for checking are:\n\n- row 1: date, city, opponent, results\n- row 3: same\n\nBut since the claim mentions playing in Italy against Romania, which isn't present, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Yugoslavian national team's performance in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse this to understand what it's claiming. It seems like they're saying that Yugoslavia scored a total of 7 goals and conceded (allowed) 3 goals across two matches in their 1982 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all rows where the \"type of game\" is \"1982 wcq\". Let me go through each row:\n\n- The first row: type of game is friendly. Not relevant.\n- Second row: balkan cup. Not relevant.\n- Third row: friendly again. Not relevant.\n- Fourth row: balkan cup. Still not relevant.\n- Fifth row: 1982 wcq. This is the first qualifier match.\n- Sixth row: same as above, another qualifier.\n- Seventh row: 1982 wcq again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, there are three rows with \"1982 wcq\". Let me list them:\n\nRow indices 4,5,6. So that's three matches in total, not two as the claim states.\n\nNow, let's look at each of these qualifier matches:\n\n- September 10: Played against Luxembourg, result was 5:0 (Yugoslavia scored 5, allowed 0).\n- September 27: Against Denmark, result 2:1 (scored 2, allowed 1).\n- November 15: Against Italy, result 0:2 (scored 0, allowed 2).\n\nWait, hold on. The claim says \"in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" So maybe they're referring to two specific qualifiers? But according to the table, there are three qualifiers.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if all three are considered or just some. Let me tally up the goals across all three qualifier matches:\n\nTotal goals scored by Yugoslavia: 5 (Luxembourg) + 2 (Denmark) = 7. Wait, but in November against Italy, they didn't score any, so total is 7.\n\nGoals allowed: 0 (Luxembourg) +1 (Denmark) +2 (Italy) = 3.\n\nSo across all three qualifiers, they scored 7 and allowed 3. The claim mentions \"in the 2 1982 world cup qualify,\" but in reality, there are three matches. However, the total goals match: 7 for, 3 against.\n\nBut does that mean the claim is true? Or does the mention of '2' instead of '3' make it false?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The table has three qualifier games. The claim says \"the 2 1982 world cup qualify,\" but actually, there are three matches.\n\nSo if the claim is about two qualifiers, that might be incorrect because there are three in total. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant three qualifiers.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\nTotal goals scored: September 10 (5), September 27 (2), November 15 (0). Total 7.\n\nTotal allowed: 0 +1+2=3.\n\nSo if the claim is about all their qualifier games, regardless of how many there were, then it's correct. But if they specifically refer to two qualifiers, that might be a problem because there are three. However, perhaps the user meant \"in their World Cup qualifiers\" without specifying the number of matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is accurate in terms of total goals, but not in the number of matches. But since the table has three qualifier games, I should consider whether all of them contribute to the totals.\n\nSo, considering that, the claim says they scored 7 and allowed 3 across their qualifiers. According to the table, this is correct, regardless of how many matches there were. So even though the number '2' in the claim might be incorrect (as it's actually three), the goal counts are accurate.\n\nWait, but does that matter? The main point is whether they scored 7 and allowed 3. If yes, then it's true despite the mention of two qualifiers instead of three. Or perhaps the user meant 'their' qualifier games, not specifying the count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider only two matches where they scored in total 7 goals and allowed 3. But looking at the data:\n\nIn the September 10 match: 5-0\n\nSeptember 27: 2-1\n\nNovember 15: 0-2\n\nSo if we take all three, the totals are correct.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is incorrect because it mentions '2' qualifiers when there were actually three. However, the key part of the claim is about scoring 7 and allowing 3. So even though the number of matches is two versus three, the goal counts are accurate across all their qualifier games.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is TRUE because the totals match, despite the mention of '2' instead of '3' qualifiers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and allowed 3 in their 1982 World Cup qualifiers. Checking the table:\n\n- September 10: Scored 5, allowed 0\n- September 27: Scored 2, allowed 1\n- November 15: Scored 0, allowed 2\n\nTotal goals scored: 5 + 2 + 0 = 7  \nTotal goals allowed: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3  \n\nThus, the claim is accurate regarding the goal totals. The mention of '2' qualifiers might be a minor error since there were three matches, but the main assertion about the goals holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The total goals scored by Yugoslavia in their 1982 World Cup qualifiers were 7 and the goals allowed were 3. This matches the claim despite a possible misstatement regarding the number of qualifier games.\"\n}\n```",
