    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about equestrian events at the Asian Games is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Equestrian at the Asian Game happen every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what information is available in the table. Looking at the HTML code, I see that it's a table with columns: year, location, gold, silver, and bronze. Each row represents data from different years starting from 1982 up to 2010.\n\nThe claim mentions that equestrian events occurred every four years during this period but skipped in 1990. So, I need to verify two things:\n1. Are there entries for each year from 1982 to 2010 with a four-year interval?\n2. Was there no event in 1990?\n\nLooking at the table years: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010. \n\nCalculating the intervals between these years:\n- From 1982 to 1986: +4 years\n- From 1986 to 1994: +8 years (this is a gap of 8 years instead of four)\n- Then from 1994 to 1998: +4\n- 1998 to 2002: +4\n- 2002 to 2006: +4\n- 2006 to 2010: +4\n\nWait, that means there's a gap between 1986 and 1994 of eight years. So, the events didn't occur every four years consistently because they skipped two cycles (1990 and 1993 or so). The claim says except for 1990, but according to this table, there's no entry in 1986 to 1994, which is a longer gap. Therefore, the events didn't happen every four years as claimed because they missed more than just 1990.\n\nAdditionally, checking if there's an event in 1990: The table doesn't have a row for 1990, so that part of the claim aligns with the data. However, since the events didn't occur every four years due to the longer gap between 1986 and 1994, the overall claim is not entirely accurate.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the 'year' column from each row as we checked all the years provided in the table to assess the intervals. The absence of a row for 1990 supports part of the claim but doesn't make the entire statement true because the four-year interval was broken beyond just that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that each time equestrian events happened in the Asian Games, they were held in a different city each year. So I need to check if all the locations are unique and correspond to each year without any repetition.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze.

The table has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. Each row represents a different Asian Games event, likely each corresponding to a specific edition of the games with the respective medalists in some category, probably equestrian as per the claim.\n\nLooking at the first row (row_index 0), the details are:\n- Year: 1982\n- Location: new delhi\n- Gold: nadia al - moutawaa\n- Silver: jamila al - moutawaa\n- Bronze: bariaa salem al - sabbah\n\nThe claim states that Nadia is the first to win gold in equestrian. To verify this, I need to check if she was indeed the first.\n\nLooking at subsequent rows (1986 onwards), each lists different winners for gold. There's no earlier year than 1982 in the table, so according to this data, Nadia is listed as the gold medalist in 1982. If this table covers all relevant editions from that point onward, then she would be the first.\n\nHowever, it's possible that equestrian events started later or there were earlier games not included here. But based solely on the given data, since 1982 is the earliest year listed and Nadia is the gold winner there, the claim holds as TRUE within this context.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in 1982, nadia al - moutawaa won the gold medal.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have be different in every year they have occur.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that each year the Asian Games took place, a different person won the gold medal in equestrian events. So, I need to check if all the gold medalists listed are unique across the years provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different year with corresponding details about where the games were held and who won the gold, silver, and bronze medals. The columns are \"year,\" \"location,\" \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze.\" \n\nI'll start by extracting the gold medalists from each row:\n\n1. 1982: Nadia al-Moutawaa\n2. 1986: Takashi Tomura\n3. 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n4. 1998: Jin Kanno\n5. 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski\n6. 2006: Ali Yousuf al-Rumaihi\n7. 2010: Ramzy al Duhami\n\nNow, I'll check if any of these names repeat across the years. \n\n- Nadia al-Moutawaa only appears in 1982.\n- Takashi Tomura is unique to 1986.\n- Konoshin Kuwahara is only in 1994.\n- Jin Kanno is specific to 1998.\n- Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski is listed for 2002 and doesn't appear elsewhere.\n- Ali Yousuf al-Rumaihi is unique to 2006.\n- Ramzy al Duhami appears only in 2010.\n\nSince all the gold medalists are different each year, the claim seems to hold true based on this data. There are no repetitions of any names in the gold column across the years provided. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nTo map this into the required JSON structure, I need to list all the cells that were checked. Each relevant cell is in the \"gold\" column for every row.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"equestrian at the asian game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that equestrian events in the Asian Games took place every four years starting from 1982 up until 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several rows with data about different years and locations where these games were held. The key here is to check the sequence of years provided and see if they follow a four-year interval without any gaps or overlaps beyond that.\n\nStarting from 1982, the next year listed is 1986. That's a four-year gap. Then, moving forward:\n\n- 1986 to 1994: That's an eight-year gap.\n- Wait, hold on, this doesn't fit the every-four-years pattern.\n\nWait, no, I need to double-check. The table goes from 1982, then 1986 (four years later), but after that:\n\n- 1986 to 1994 is eight years apart.\nThat breaks the four-year cycle because it's a longer gap than four years.\n\nSo, if the claim says every four years starting in 1982, the expected years would be: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, etc. However, looking at the table, there's no data for 1990. Instead, after 1986 comes 1994, which skips four years.\n\nTherefore, this indicates that equestrian events didn't occur every four years as claimed because there was an eight-year gap between 1986 and 1994. Additionally, the table continues up to 2010, but since the pattern isn't consistent from the start, the claim is invalid.\n\nI should check each year in the table:\n\n- 1982: Included\n- 1986: Four years after\n- Next expected would be 1990, which isn't present.\nInstead, it's 1994 (eight years from 1986)\nThen 1998, four years later\n2002, four years later\n2006, four years later\n2010, four years later\n\nSo the only issue is between 1986 and 1994. Hence, the claim is FALSE because it's not every four years throughout.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows equestrian events in the Asian Games from 1982 to 2010 but skips a cycle in 1990, indicating an eight-year gap between 1986 and 1994.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul and doha (and incheon, but that be only find elsewhere on the source page).\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to say two main things:\n\n1. South Korea has hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once.\n2. The locations were Seoul and Doha, with Incheon mentioned as another possible location but only found elsewhere.\n\nWait, actually, that might not be accurate because the parentheses mention Incheon being elsewhere. So perhaps the main points are about Seoul and Doha.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze.\n\nEach row represents an Asian Games event with the host city and the medalists in equestrian events, I assume.\n\nSo to verify if South Korea hosted more than once, I need to check how many times locations in South Korea appear as hosts for these events.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi (India)\n- 1986: Seoul (South Korea)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (Japan)\n- 1998: Bangkok (Thailand)\n- 2002: Busan (South Korea)\n- 2006: Doha (Qatar)\n- 2010: Guangzhou (China)\n\nSo, looking at the 'location' column:\n\nSeoul in 1986 and Busan in 2002 are both South Korean cities. So that's two instances where South Korea hosted.\n\nWait, but Busan is another city in South Korea, so that's two times: Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). Doha is in Qatar, so the claim mentions Seoul and Doha as hosts by South Korea, which isn't correct because Doha is not a South Korean location.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the claim again. It says \"host equestrian at the Asian Game more than 1 time, in seoul and doha.\" But if Doha is in Qatar, then that can't be South Korea hosting. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it lists Doha as a host for South Korea.\n\nWait, but looking back: The table shows that in 2006, the location was Doha (Qatar). So Doha is not in South Korea.\n\nSo the claim says South Korea hosted more than once, specifically in Seoul and Doha. But Doha isn't in South Korea. Therefore, the only two South Korean hosts are Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002), which makes two times. So South Korea did host twice. However, the claim incorrectly includes Doha as a South Korean host.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul and doha.\" But if Doha is not in South Korea, then that part of the claim is wrong because Doha is in Qatar.\n\nBut looking again at the table: The location for 2006 is Doha. So perhaps the claim is confusing because it says \"in Seoul and Doha\" as hosts by South Korea, which isn't accurate since Doha is in Qatar.\n\nTherefore, the correct instances where South Korea hosted are Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). The claim mentions Doha, which isn't a South Korean city. So the part about hosting in Doha is incorrect. Therefore, the claim's assertion that South Korea hosted more than once is true because they did host twice, but listing Doha as one of them is incorrect.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul and doha.\" So it's claiming that South Korea hosted in both Seoul and Doha. But since Doha isn't a South Korean city, this part is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading. Maybe the claim is saying that South Korea hosted twice: once in Seoul and again elsewhere (Doha), but that can't be because Doha is not in South Korea. Therefore, the claim's statement about hosting in both Seoul and Doha as a South Korean host is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The table shows two instances where South Korea hosted: 1986 in Seoul and 2002 in Busan. So that's two times, making South Korea the only country to have hosted more than once if no other country has done so more than once.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- India (New Delhi) once\n- Japan (Hiroshima) once\n- Thailand (Bangkok) once\n- China (Guangzhou) once\n- Qatar (Doha) once\n\nSo yes, South Korea hosted twice, others once. So the first part of the claim is correct: South Korea is the only country to have hosted more than once.\n\nHowever, the claim lists the locations as Seoul and Doha for these two instances, which is incorrect because Doha is not in South Korea. Therefore, the claim has an error in stating that one of the hosts was Doha.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct if it's saying that South Korea hosted twice, but mistakenly lists Doha as a host location instead of Busan. So maybe the claim is wrong in that aspect.\n\nBut regardless, the main point is whether South Korea is the only country to have hosted more than once. The table shows they did host twice (Seoul 1986 and Busan 2002), so that part is correct.\n\nHowever, when it mentions the locations as Seoul and Doha, which are in different countries, that's incorrect because Doha isn't a South Korean city.\n\nSo the claim has two parts: one correct about hosting twice, and another incorrect about listing Doha as a host location for South Korea.\n\nTherefore, overall, the claim is partially true but contains an error regarding the locations. However, perhaps the user wants to assess whether South Korea hosted more than once, which they did, regardless of the specific cities listed in the claim.\n\nBut given that the claim specifically mentions Seoul and Doha as the two hosts for South Korea, it's incorrect because Doha is not in South Korea.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because while South Korea did host twice (Seoul and Busan), listing Doha as a host location is wrong.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul and Doha. However, upon reviewing the provided data:\n\n1. **Hosting Instances**: The table shows that South Korea hosted the Asian Games twice: in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). This makes South Korea the only country to have hosted more than once.\n\n2. **Location Accuracy**: The claim incorrectly lists Doha as a host location for South Korea. In reality, Doha is in Qatar and was the host in 2006.\n\n**Conclusion**: While it's true that South Korea hosted equestrian events twice, the claim erroneously includes Doha as one of the host locations. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but contains an error regarding the location.\n\nAnswer: The claim is partially correct; South Korea did host more than once, but listing Doha as a host is incorrect.",

But according to the table, even those two years had unique locations.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no repetition of location across any years in the provided data. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because all events occurred in distinct cities without repetition, including 1994 and 1998.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"nadia al - moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the asian game and win silver another year.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It has two parts:\n1. Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first person to win a gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.\n2. She won a silver medal in another year.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if Nadia is listed as a gold medalist and then see if she also has a silver medal in a different year.\n\nStarting with the gold part: I'll go through each row to find Nadia's name under the \"gold\" column. The first row (index 0) shows that in 1982, the gold medalist is Nadia Al-Moutawaa. So that checks out for her winning gold.\n\nNow, checking if she won silver another year. I'll look through each subsequent year's silver medalists. Scanning rows 1 to 6:\n\n- 1986: Silver is Shuichi Toki.\n- 1994: Silver is Ryuzo Okuno.\n- 1998: Silver is Sohn Bong-Gak.\n- 2002: Silver is Lee Jin-Kyung.\n- 2006: Silver is Jasmine Chen-Shao Man.\n- 2010: Silver is Latifa Al Maktom.\n\nNadia's name doesn't appear in any of these silver columns. So she didn't win a silver medal in another year as per the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check if the claim refers to her winning both gold and silver across different years, regardless of being first. Since the table shows she won gold once and no silver elsewhere, the second part isn't supported. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE because while she did win gold in 1982, she didn't win a silver medal in any other year listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first to win gold in equestrian and later won silver. The table shows her winning gold in 1982 but no silver in subsequent years.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check for Gold Medal (Nadia):**\n   - Found in row 0, column \"gold\": Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold in 1982.\n\n2. **Check for Silver Medal in Other Years:**\n   - Examined rows from 1986 to 2010.\n   - No occurrence of Nadia's name in the \"silver\" column across these years.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - While she did win gold, there's no evidence of her winning silver in another year as per the table data.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** The cells where Nadia is mentioned for gold and all subsequent silvers are checked.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have be different in every year they have occur except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the table to see the years and corresponding gold medalists.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **1982 (New Delhi)**: Gold - Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n2. **1986 (Seoul)**: Gold - Takashi Tomura\n3. **1994 (Hiroshima)**: Gold - Konoshin Kuwahara\n4. **1998 (Bangkok)**: Gold - Jin Kanno\n5. **2002 (Busan)**: Gold - Mikaela Mar\u00eda Jaworski\n6. **2006 (Doha)**: Gold - Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n7. **2010 (Guangzhou)**: Gold - Ramzy Al Duhami\n\nNow, the claim says that every year's gold medalist was different except for 1994 and 1998. Wait, but looking at the data:\n\n- In 1994, Konoshin Kuwahara won.\n- In 1998, Jin Kanno won.\n\nThese are two distinct individuals. So, there's no repetition in these years either. Therefore, every year has a different gold medalist, including 1994 and 1998. The claim incorrectly states that they were the same except those two years, but actually, all are unique.

    "claim": "south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul 2 time",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It seems there might be some grammatical issues, so I'll rephrase it for clarity: South Korea is the only country that has hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul twice.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different year and location of an event. The columns are 'year', 'location', 'gold', 'silver', 'bronze'. I'm assuming this is about medalists in some sport, possibly equestrian, but the claim is about hosting, not medals. However, the table doesn't directly mention hosting; it shows where events were held.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the locations listed are where the Asian Games took place each year, and each event's host country can be inferred from the location. For example, 'seoul' is in South Korea, 'hiroshima' is also in Japan, etc. So, I need to check how many times each country has hosted the games.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi (India)\n- 1986: Seoul (South Korea)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (Japan)\n- 1998: Bangkok (Thailand)\n- 2002: Busan (South Korea)\n- 2006: Doha (Qatar)\n- 2010: Guangzhou (China)\n\nWait, I see that Seoul in 1986 and Busan in 2002 are both South Korean cities. So South Korea hosted the games twice. But does any other country host more than once?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nIndia - 1982\nSouth Korea - 1986, 2002 (two times)\nJapan - 1994\nThailand - 1998\nQatar - 2006\nChina - 2010\n\nSo only South Korea hosted twice. Therefore, the claim that they are the only country to have hosted more than once is correct.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"in Seoul 2 times.\" From the table, Seoul was the host in 1986, and Busan in 2002. So it's two different cities in South Korea, but both are hosting in South Korea. The claim says \"in Seoul 2 time,\" which might be inaccurate because the second hosting was in Busan, not Seoul.\n\nSo does that make the claim FALSE? Because while South Korea hosted twice, one was in Seoul and another in Busan. Therefore, it's not two times in Seoul specifically. So the part about being only country to host more than once is TRUE, but the part about doing so in Seoul twice is FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again at the claim: \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul 2 time.\" It seems to imply that South Korea hosted twice, both times in Seoul. But from the table, it's two different cities. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because they didn't host in Seoul twice; once in Seoul and once in Busan.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The first part about being the only country hosting more than once is correct, but the second part about hosting twice in Seoul is wrong. Since the claim combines both parts as a single statement, it's overall FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to look at each row where South Korea hosted and check their locations. So rows 1 (Seoul) and 5 (Busan). The column 'location' is relevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
