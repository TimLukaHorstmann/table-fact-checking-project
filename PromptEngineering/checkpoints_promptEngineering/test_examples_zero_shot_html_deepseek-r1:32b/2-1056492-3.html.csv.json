    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"there be no division present in the table with a season after 2012 that reach the round of 16 in the fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully. The claim states two things:\n\n1. There are no divisions (specifically, since all entries have division 1) present in the table.\n2. These divisions should be for seasons after 2012 that reach the round of 16 in the FA Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season from 2003 to 2012. The columns include 'season', 'division', 'tms', 'pos', and 'fa cup'. \n\nThe relevant parts for this claim are:\n- The 'season' column to check if there's any entry after 2012.\n- The 'fa cup' column to see if any of those seasons reached the round of 16.\n\nFrom the table, I can see that the latest season listed is 2012. There are no entries beyond that. So, there's no data in the table for seasons after 2012. \n\nSince the table only goes up to 2012 and does not include any seasons beyond that year, it means there are no divisions present in the table with a season after 2012. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the absence of such data supports the statement that no division from a post-2012 season reached the round of 16.\n\nTo identify the relevant cells:\n- We look at each row's 'season' to check if any are after 2012. All seasons are up to 2012, so none meet this criterion.\n- The 'fa cup' column shows that in 2012, they reached the round of 16, but since there's no data beyond 2012, it doesn't affect the claim.\n\nThus, the claim holds true based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first: \"there be no team in the division with less than 13 team and position less than 8 for the season 2003 through 2012.\" Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. I'll parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being said here. The claim is asserting that within the specified seasons (2003 to 2012), there are no teams in Division 1 where both the number of teams ('tms') is less than 13 and their position ('pos') is less than 8.\n\nSo, I need to check each season from 2003 to 2012 (which corresponds to rows 0 through 9) for two conditions:\n1. 'tms' < 13\n2. 'pos' < 8\n\nIf any row satisfies both these conditions, then the claim is FALSE because such a team exists. If none do, then it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For each row (season), I'll note down the values for 'tms' and 'pos'.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. 2003: tms=12, pos=11\n   - tms is less than 13? Yes.\n   - pos is less than 8? No (11 >=8)\n   - Both conditions not met.\n\n2. 2004: tms=13, pos=10\n   - tms <13? No (equal to 13).\n   - So condition fails here.\n\n3. 2005: tms=13, pos=8\n   - tms is not less than 13.\n   \n4. 2006: tms=14, pos=7\n   - tms is more than 13.\n   Wait, but wait the claim says 'tms' <13 and 'pos' <8. So even if one condition isn't met, it doesn't count.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says there are NO teams where both conditions are true. So any team that has tms <13 AND pos <8 would make the claim false.\n\nLet me check each row again more carefully:\n\n2003: tms=12 (which is less than 13), pos=11 (not less than 8). So both conditions not met. No problem here.\n\n2004: tms=13, which is not less than 13. So condition fails. No issue.\n\n2005: tms=13 again. Same as above.\n\n2006: tms=14. Not relevant for the first condition.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0 (2003): tms=12 <13 and pos=11 >=8 \u2192 Doesn't satisfy both.\n\nRow1 (2004): tms=13 is not less than 13, so even if pos was low, it doesn't matter. It fails the first condition.\n\nRow2 (2005): tms=13, same as above.\n\nRow3 (2006): tms=14, no issue.\n\nWait a minute\u2014what about row 3: pos is 7, which is less than 8. But since tms is 14, the first condition isn't met, so it's okay.\n\nIs there any other row where both conditions are true?\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- 2003: tms=12 <13, pos=11 \u2192 No.\n- 2004: tms=13 >=13 \u2192 Doesn't meet first condition.\n- 2005: tms=13 >=13.\n- 2006: tms=14 >=13; pos=7 <8. So only one condition met, not both.\n- 2007: tms=14, pos=12 \u2192 No.\n- 2008: tms=14, pos=11 \u2192 No.\n- 2009: tms=15 >=13; pos=15 \u2192 No.\n- 2010: same as above.\n- 2011: tms=16, pos=12 \u2192 No.\n- 2012: tms=16, pos=10 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, is there a row where both 'tms' <13 and 'pos' <8? Let me double-check each row's 'tms' and 'pos':\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: 12, 11 \u2192 tms<13 yes, pos<8 no.\nRow1:13,10\u2192 tms not <13.\nRow2:13,8\u2192 same as above; also, pos is exactly 8, which isn't less than 8.\nRow3:14,7\u2192 'tms' is >13, so doesn't meet first condition. 'pos' is <8 but since tms isn't <13, the pair is not both true.\n\nOther rows have higher 'tms', except for row0 and maybe any others?\n\nWait, let me check if there are other rows with 'tms' less than 13:\n\nLooking at all tms values:\n2003:12\nOthers: 13,13,14,14,15,15,16,16\n\nOnly row0 has tms <13. So only that row could potentially have both conditions. However, in row0, pos is 11 which is >=8.\n\nThus, there are no rows where both 'tms' <13 AND 'pos' <8. Therefore, the claim holds true: there are no such teams.\n\nBut wait\u2014am I interpreting the claim correctly? It says \"no team... with less than 13 team and position less than 8.\" So it's an AND condition.\n\nIf I'm correct, then no such team exists in any of these seasons, meaning the claim is TRUE. But let me cross-verify.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the wording was that there are teams where either tms <13 OR pos <8. But the original claim is about both being true simultaneously.\n\nSo yes, based on my analysis, no such team exists in any season between 2003 to 2012 with both tms<13 and pos<8. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I misread any rows:\n\n- Row4 (2007): tms=14, pos=12 \u2192 No.\n- Row5 (2008): tms=14, pos=11 \u2192 No.\n- Rows6 to 9: All have higher 'tms' values and positions not less than 8 except row3 where 'pos' is 7 but 'tms' is 14.\n\nSo yes, the conclusion remains that there are no teams meeting both conditions. Hence, the claim holds.\n\nBut wait, let's check for any possible typos or misreads:\n\nRow0: tms=12, pos=11 \u2192 Correct.\nRow3: tms=14, pos=7 \u2192 So 'pos' is less than 8 but 'tms' isn't. Hence, not both.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. So the answer should be that the claim holds; there's no such team. Therefore, in terms of providing evidence or the conclusion, if it were a question asking to verify this, we would say it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are no teams in Division 1 between the seasons 2003 and 2012 where both the number of teams ('tms') is less than 13 and their position ('pos') is less than 8. \n\nUpon reviewing each season:\n- In 2003, 'tms' is 12 (less than 13), but 'pos' is 11 (not less than 8).\n- All other seasons have either 'tms' \u226513 or 'pos' \u22658 when 'tms' <13.\n\nThus, no team meets both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct; there are no teams in Division 1 during the specified seasons with both fewer than 13 teams and a position lower than 8.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2006 the team in position 8 get to the quarter final\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the table structure. The columns are: season, division, tms, pos, fa cup. Each row corresponds to a specific year from 2003 to 2012 with various stats for each year.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. In 2006...\n2. ...the team in position 8 got to the quarter final.\n\nSo I need to find the row where season is 2006 and check two things: their position (pos) and how far they got in the FA cup.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are indexed from 0 to 9, corresponding to years 2003 to 2012. So for 2006, I'm looking at row index 3 (since 2003 is 0, 2004 is 1, etc.).\n\nIn that row:\n- season: 2006\n- division: 1\n- tms: 14\n- pos: 7\n- fa cup: quarter final\n\nWait a minute. The claim says the team was in position 8, but according to this row, their position (pos) is 7. So that doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the FA cup progress for that season, it does say \"quarter final\", which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nBut since the position is 7 instead of 8, the first condition isn't met. Therefore, the entire claim is not fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nSo I should mark this as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the 2006 season, so we look for row where season=2006 (row_index=3). We check pos and fa cup columns. pos is 7, not 8; thus, claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"all division in the season prior to 2012 reach round 16 in the fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that all divisions in seasons before 2012 reached at least the round of 16 in the FA Cup. The table has data from 2003 to 2012. So I need to check each season prior to 2012, which are 2003-2011.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Columns: season, division, tms, pos, fa cup\n- Rows: Each row represents a season from 2003 to 2012. All have division=1 except I think all rows have division=1 as per the given data.\n\nSo for each season before 2012 (rows 0 to 8), check if 'fa cup' is at least round of 16 or better. \n\nLooking through each relevant row:\n- 2003: quarter final\n- 2004: round of 32\n- 2005: quarter final\n- 2006: quarter final\n- 2007: round of 16\n- 2008: semi final (better than round of 16)\n- 2009: quarter - final (note the hyphen, but likely means same as quarter final)\n- 2010: round of 32\n- 2011: round of 32\n\nWait, the claim is about \"round 16\". Looking at the data, 'fa cup' column has entries like 'quarter final', 'round of 32', etc. So to reach round 16, they must have gone beyond or equal to that stage.\n\nBut looking at each season:\n- 2004: reached round of 32 (which is earlier than 16th round)\n- 2010 and 2011 also reached round of 32\n- 2005, 2006, 2009 all are quarter finals. Quarter final is typically the 8th round or so in FA Cup structure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the terms. In FA Cup, the rounds go: first round (local), then second, third, etc., with the semi-finals and finals at the end. So 'round of 32' might be an early stage, say Round 3 or something. Then 'quarter final' is a later stage.\n\nSo if the claim is that all prior to 2012 reached round 16 in FA Cup, but looking at the data:\n- 2004: reached round of 32 (likely earlier than round 16)\n- So for example, 'round of 32' would be before quarter final. Therefore, seasons like 2004 didn't reach round 16; they stopped at an earlier stage.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"reach round 16\", which might mean that the furthest they went was at least round 16. But in FA Cup, the rounds go up to final, so 'semi final' is higher than quarter final, which is higher than round of 32.\n\nSo if a team reaches semi final (like 2008), that's beyond round 16, but someone who only reached round of 32 didn't reach round 16. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because not all prior seasons reached at least round 16.\n\nLooking back, for each season prior to 2012:\n\n- 2003: quarter final (maybe considered as Round 4 or so)\n- 2004: round of 32 (probably earlier than quarter finals)\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the terminology. Let me think about FA Cup structure.\n\nIn FA Cup, teams start from preliminary rounds, then first round proper, second, third, fourth (quarter finals), fifth (semi-finals), and sixth (final). So 'round of 32' is the first round proper or similar. Therefore, if a team reached quarter final, that's the fourth round, which is more advanced than the round of 16.\n\nWait, no: Round 1 is 96 teams, Round 2 reduces to 48, Round 3 to 24, then Round 4 (quarter finals) with 8 teams. So 'round of 16' might not be a standard term; perhaps the user means that they reached at least the quarter final or later.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- Seasons prior to 2012: from 2003 to 2011.\nLooking at each season's 'fa cup' result:\n2003: quarter final\n2004: round of 32\n2005: quarter final\n2006: quarter final\n2007: round of 16 (so maybe that's the fourth round or so)\n2008: semi final\n2009: quarter - final\n2010: round of 32\n2011: round of 32\n\nWait, 'round of 16' is a term used in other competitions (like Champions League) but FA Cup typically refers to rounds by number. So perhaps the entries are using different terminology.\n\nIf 'quarter final' implies they reached at least that stage, then:\n\n- Seasons where 'fa cup' is quarter final or semi final would have reached beyond round of 16.\nBut seasons with 'round of 32' and 'round of 16', how do these compare?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the FA Cup doesn't use \"round of 32\" as an official term. So perhaps in this context:\n\n- Round of 32: means they were in a stage with 32 teams left (probably the second or third round)\n- Quarter final is when there are 8 teams\n- Semi final is 4 teams\n\nSo if the claim is that all prior seasons reached at least 'round of 16', which would be having 16 teams, that's an earlier stage than quarter finals.\n\nBut in reality, FA Cup doesn't have a \"Round of 16\"; instead, it has rounds numbered consecutively. So perhaps the data uses non-standard terminology.\n\nIn any case, according to the data:\n\n- For 2003: quarter final\nAssuming that reaching quarter final is beyond round of 16 (as in more advanced), then yes.\nBut for 2004: reached 'round of 32' which is an earlier stage than quarter finals. So if 'round of 32' is before the round where there are 16 teams left, then they didn't reach round of 16.\n\nTherefore, since some seasons (like 2004, 2010, 2011) only reached 'round of 32', which is an earlier stage than quarter final or semi final, the claim that all prior to 2012 reached at least round of 16 would be FALSE.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE. But I need to confirm if \"reaching round of 16\" means being in a round where 16 teams are left (which would be after several rounds) or reaching up to that stage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"round of 16\" refers to having reached at least the 16th match or something else. But more likely, it's about the stage where 16 teams remain. So in FA Cup terms, that would be the fourth round (quarter finals). Therefore, any team reaching quarter final has passed round of 16.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Seasons with 'quarter final' and beyond have reached at least round of 16.\n- Seasons with 'round of 32' haven't. So since some seasons didn't reach quarter final, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo the answer is False, so the boxed answer should be \\boxed{False}.\n\nBut wait, let me check all the prior to 2012 rows:\n\nRow 0: 2003 - quarter final\nRow 1: 2004 - round of 32 \u2192 didn't reach at least quarter\nRow 2: 2005 - quarter final\nRow 3: 2006 - quarter final\nRow 4: 2007 - round of 16 (so is this beyond the 'round of 32'? If round of 16 is earlier than round of 8, then yes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 'round of 16' is more advanced than 'quarter final'.\n\nWait, now I'm confused.\n\nIn FA Cup:\n\n- Preliminary rounds: teams down to ~96\n- Round 1 proper (about 40 clubs): 96 teams\n- Round 2: 48 teams\n- Round 3: 32 teams \u2192 maybe called 'round of 32'\n- Round 4: 16 teams \u2192 maybe called 'quarter finals' because 8 teams progress from 16 (but actually, it's the fifth round that is semi-finals)\n\nWait no:\n\nFA Cup structure typically has:\n- Qualifying rounds to get down to ~96 clubs for the first round proper.\n- Round 1: 96 \u2192 48\n- Round 2: 48 \u2192 24\n- Round 3: 24 \u2192 12 (or 16, depends on byes)\nWait, maybe it's better to look up but I can't right now.\n\nAssuming that 'round of 32' is the third round (since 32 teams left), and 'quarter final' would be when there are 8 teams. So if a team reaches quarter finals, they have passed rounds where there were more than 16 teams.\n\nTherefore, in this context:\n\n- Reaching quarter finals implies having gone through all previous rounds, including the round of 32.\n- Therefore, 'quarter final' is beyond 'round of 32'.\n\nSo if a team is eliminated in 'round of 32', they haven't reached quarter finals. So to have reached at least 'round of 16' (assuming that's when there are 16 teams left, which would be the fourth round), then being in the fifth round (semi-finals) or beyond means you've passed through.\n\nBut if a team is eliminated in the third round ('round of 32'), they haven't reached 'round of 16'.\n\nSo going back to the data:\n\n- For seasons reaching quarter final (rows 0,2,3): have passed 'round of 32' and would be at least in 'round of 16'.\nWait no: if round 4 is when there are 16 teams left (quarter finals), then being eliminated in round 4 means you didn't reach the next stage.\n\nBut this is getting too ambiguous. Maybe another approach:\n\nIf \"reached at least round of 16\" refers to having a certain number of games played, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data uses 'round of 32' as an early round and 'quarter final' as later.\n\nThus, some teams didn't reach quarter finals (like in 2004), so they didn't reach at least quarter finals. Therefore, if the claim is that all prior seasons reached at least quarter finals or further, it's false because some only reached earlier rounds.\n\nTherefore, overall conclusion: The statement is False.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether the given statement about a team reaching the round of 16 in all previous seasons before 2012 is true or false. \n\nAnalysis:\n- Seasons reaching \"quarter final\" imply they advanced beyond the third round (round of 32) and into at least the fourth round, which might correspond to the round of 16.\n- However, some seasons only reached the \"round of 32,\" meaning they were eliminated before advancing to later stages.\n\nConclusion:\nSince not all previous seasons reached beyond the round of 32, the claim that all prior seasons reached at least the round of 16 is false.\n\n\\boxed{False}",
