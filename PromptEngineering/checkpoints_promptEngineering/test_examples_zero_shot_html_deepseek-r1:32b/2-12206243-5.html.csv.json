    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table and a claim about the number of postponed games against the Brewers due to snow. My task is to verify if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the instructions carefully to understand what needs to be done. The key points are:\n\n1. Check each condition in the claim against the table.\n2. Determine which cells are relevant for verification.\n3. Answer with \"TRUE\" if fully supported, otherwise \"FALSE\".\n4. Return a JSON object with the answer and a list of relevant cells.\n\nThe claim states: \"2 of the 6 games against the brewer be postpone due to snow.\"\n\nI need to find out how many games against the Brewers were postponed because of snow. The table has multiple rows, each representing a game against different teams like Brewers, Angels, Mariners, etc. Each row includes details about the game, such as dates and results.\n\nLooking at the \"Opponent\" column (third column), I'll search for entries where the opponent is the Brewers. From the table provided, I see two relevant rows:\n\n- Row 1: April 25th vs. Mariners\n- Wait, no, looking again... Actually, in the given data, the opponents include Brewers on rows with indices 0 and 1.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Let's list out all the opponents:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"angels\" (April 25th vs. Mariners? Wait no, looking back at the table structure, it's actually the opponent column in the rows. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the table provided seems to have the opponent in the third column. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is \"angels\"\n- Row 1: Opponent is \"angels\"\n- Row 2: Opponent is \"angels\"\n- Row 3: Opponent is \"mariners\"\n- Row 4: Opponent is \"mariners\"\n- Row 5: Opponent is \"mariners\"\n- Row 6: Opponent is \"royals\"\n\nWait, no. Wait the initial table starts with April 25th as row index 0. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the provided data, rows are from April 25 to April 30. So actually, in this specific table snippet, I don't see any games against the Brewers. The opponents listed are Angels, Mariners, and Royals.\n\nWait, that's confusing because the claim mentions 6 games against the Brewers, but in the provided table data, there are no entries for the Brewers. This suggests that perhaps the table is incomplete or only a snippet, but based on what's given, I can't find any Brewer opponents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to provide a larger table where there were indeed multiple games against the Brewers, some of which were postponed. But in the data presented here, rows 0 through 14 (assuming) don't show Brewers as an opponent.\n\nTherefore, if the table provided doesn't include any games against the Brewers, how can we verify the claim? It seems the relevant cells are not present in the given table. This implies that either the table is incomplete or perhaps I'm misunderstanding where to look.\n\nWait, let me double-check the initial data. The user provided a table with multiple rows. Let me count each row's opponent:\n\n- Row 0: April 25th vs. Mariners\n- Row 1: April 26th vs. Mariners\n- Row 2: April 27th vs. Mariners\n- Row 3: April 29th vs. Royals\n- Row 4: April 30th vs. Royals\n\nWait, that's only five rows, not six. So perhaps the table is incomplete, or I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the full data (not provided here), there are multiple Brewer games. But based on what's given, there are none.\n\nGiven this confusion and lack of relevant entries, it's impossible to verify the claim from the provided table. Therefore, since there's no data about games against the Brewers being postponed due to snow, the claim can't be supported by the given information.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, as we don't have evidence in the table supporting that two of six Brewer games were postponed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The opponent here is the Rangers, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if this was indeed the game with the highest attendance.

The relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1: Attendance is 34333 (April 20 vs Mariners)\n- Row 10: Attendance is 34333 (April 19 vs Rangers)\n- Other rows have lower attendances, like row 18 has 32160 and row 7 has 31420.\n\nWait a minute, both April 19 and April 20 games have the same attendance of 34333. This means there isn't a single highest; they are tied.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify whether the claim \"the highest scoring game was played against the mariner on april 25\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means:\n\n1. **Highest Scoring Game**: This refers to the game with the most total runs scored by both teams combined.\n2. **Played Against the Mariners**: We're looking for a game where the opponent was the Seattle Mariners.\n3. **On April 25**: The date when this game took place.\n\nNow, let's look at the table structure to see which columns are relevant:\n\n- The table has columns: Date, Opponent, Score, Pitcher, Attendance, and Record.\n\nFrom these, the \"Score\" column is crucial because it shows the runs scored by both teams. For each row, I'll need to parse this score to find the total runs for that game.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the table where the opponent is the Mariners. Looking at the rows:\n\n- April 25: Score is 13 - 8\n- April 26: Score is 4 - 3\n- April 27: Score is 2 - 1\n\nCalculating the total runs for each game:\n\n- April 25: 13 + 8 = 21 runs\n- April 26: 4 + 3 = 7 runs\n- April 27: 2 + 1 = 3 runs\n\nApril 25's game has the highest total runs among these, so it is indeed the highest-scoring game against the Mariners.\n\nTo ensure there isn't a higher-scoring game elsewhere in the table, I'll briefly check other rows. For example:\n\n- April 29: Score 6 - 5 (total 11)\n- April 30: Score 1 - 0 (total 1)\n\nComparing these, none exceed the 21 runs from April 25.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

So, the user has provided a table of games and a claim that \"4 of the game end in a shut out.\" I need to determine if this claim is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a \"shut out\" means in baseball terms. A shutout occurs when one team doesn't score any runs throughout the entire game. So, for each game, I'll check both teams' scores to see if either team scored zero.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple columns: Date, Opponent, Score, Starter (with record), Attendance, and Record. The relevant column here is \"Score\" since it shows the runs each team scored.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **April 4**: Score is 5-3. Neither team scored zero.\n2. **April 5**: Score is 8-6. No shutout.\n3. **April 6**: Score is 7-0. Oh, here the opponent didn't score any runs. That's a shutout for our team. So that's one.\n4. **April 9**: Score is 12-5. No shutout.\n5. **April 10**: Score is 3-2. Neither team scored zero.\n6. **April 11**: Score is 7-5. No shutout.\n7. **April 12**: Score is 8-4. No shutout.\n8. **April 13**: Score is 8-2. Opponent scored, so no shutout for our team here.\n9. **April 16**: Score is 4-2. Neither team has a zero.\n10. **April 17**: Score is 5-3. No shutout.\n11. **April 18**: Score is 4-2. Again, both teams scored.\n12. **April 19**: Score is 7-6. Close game, but no zeros.\n13. **April 20**: Score is 5-4 (13). The 13 might indicate innings, but the scores are 5 and 4\u2014no shutout.\n14. **April 21**: Score is 5-4 (10). Both teams scored; no shutout.\n15. **April 22**: Score is 7-6. Again, both have runs.\n16. **April 23**: Score is 5-4 (10). Still, neither team has a zero.\n17. **April 25**: Score is 13-8. No shutout here.\n18. **April 26**: Score is 4-3. Both teams scored.\n19. **April 27**: Score is 2-1. Opponent scored, so no shutout for our team.\n20. **April 29**: Score is 6-5 (10). Both have runs.\n21. **April 30**: Score is 1-0. Oh, here the opponent didn't score any runs. That's another shutout for our team.\n\nSo, in total, I found two games where our team shut out the opponent: April 6 and April 30. The claim states there are four such games, but according to this table, it's only two. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI also need to note which cells were relevant for this determination. Each row's \"Score\" column was checked to see if either team scored zero.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check the claim: \"less than 1000 crowd attend the game against the white sox make it the least attended game.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the game against the White Sox in the table. Scanning the 'Opponent' column, I see that there's one entry where the opponent is \"white sox\" on row 0. The relevant cell here is the 'crowd' number for that game, which is under the 'Attendance' column. That value is listed as 13413.\n\nNext, the claim says this was the least attended game with less than 1000 attendees. But wait, the attendance is actually over 13,000, which is way more than 1000. So that part of the claim isn't correct. \n\nNow, to find out if it's the least attended, I need to check all other games' attendances and see if there's any game with fewer attendees than this one. Looking through the 'Attendance' column:\n\n- April 21: 13413\n- April 22: 13353\n- April 23: 13117\n- April 25: 31215\n- April 26: 31420\n- April 27: 32160\n- April 29: 12533\n- April 30: 13004\n\nWait, actually the White Sox game on row 0 has attendance of 13413, but looking at other games like April 21 against the Angels is also 13413. So both have the same attendance. Then there are games with lower numbers: April 29 has 12533 and April 30 has 13004, which are higher than 12533 but not as high as 13413.\n\nWait a second, I'm getting confused. Let me list all attendances:\n\nRow 0: 13413\nRow 1: white sox? No, row 0 is the only White Sox game.\nOther rows:\nApril 25: 31215\nApril 26: 31420\nApril 27: 32160\nApril 29: 12533\nApril 30: 13004\n\nSo the lowest attendance is actually 12533 on April 29 against the Royals. The White Sox game had higher attendance than that, so it's not the least attended.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The attendance was over 1000 and it wasn't the least attended because there were games with lower attendances.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the attendance against the White Sox was 13413, which is more than 1000, and other games had even lower attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are Date, Opponent, Result, Starting Pitcher, Attendance, and Win-Loss. Each row represents a game played by the team.\n\nThe claim mentions games against \"the brewer.\" Checking the Opponent column, I see entries like \"brewers\" on April 8, 10, and 11. So there are three games against the Brewers in total, not six as the claim states. This discrepancy already raises a red flag because the claim talks about six games, but only three are present.\n\nNext, I'll check if any of these games were postponed due to cold weather. The Result column for each game shows scores or outcomes like \"6-5 (10)\" which indicates extra innings, not a postponement. There's no mention of any game being postponed; all have results indicating they were played.\n\nThe Starting Pitcher and Attendance columns don't indicate any cancellations either. If games were postponed, I'd expect some notation in these fields or possibly blank spaces where the result wasn't recorded yet. But there's nothing like that here.\n\nLooking at the row indices for the Brewers games: April 8 is row 2 (index starting from 0), April 10 is row 3, and April 11 is row 4.

So, I need to check two things: whether April 26's game against the Mariners had the highest score, and if there are any other games with higher scores.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game against different teams on specific dates.

April 25 vs Mariners: Score is 13-8\n2. April 26 vs Mariners: Score is 4-3\n3. April 27 vs Mariners: Score is 2-1\n\nComparing these, the highest score against the Mariners was on April 25 with a 13-8 game.\n\nNow, checking other opponents to see if any game had a higher score than 13:\n\n- April 21 vs Angels: 5-4 (13)\nWait, that's a 13-inning game with a close score.\nBut the actual runs are 5 and 4.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the game with the highest attendance be on april 18 against the ranger\" is true based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns in the table are relevant. The claim mentions two things: the date (April 18) and the opponent (Rangers). Additionally, it refers to the highest attendance, so I'll need to look at the attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column named \"Attendance\" that likely contains the number of attendees for each game. The other relevant columns are \"Date\" and \"Opponent\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check for the date April 18 and note the attendance figure. Then, I'll compare all the attendances to see if this particular game indeed had the highest.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: April 3, attendance 24,765\n- Row 1: April 4, attendance 39,380\n- ...\n- When I reach row 10 (row index starts at 0), it's April 18 against the Rangers with an attendance of 34,333.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the highest. Looking through all rows:\n- The highest attendance seems to be on April 25 with 31,215, but wait, that's lower than 34,333.\nWait, actually, let me correct that. On April 18, it's 34,333. Then on April 26: 31,420 and April 27: 32,160. So yes, 34,333 is higher than these.\n\nBut wait, there's a row earlier, like April 18 has 34k, but looking back, April 10 (April 25?) Wait, no, the highest seems to be on April 27 with 32,160, which is less than 34,333. So April 18 indeed had higher attendance.\n\nWait a minute, let me check all attendances again carefully:\n- April 3: 24k\n- April 4: 39k (Wait, that's higher)\n- April 5: 30k\n- April 6: 32k\n- April 7: 31k\n- April 8: 32k\n- April 9: 27k\n- April 10: 34k (April 18)\n- Then, after that:\n- April 25: 31k\n- April 26: 31k\n- April 27: 32k\n\nWait a second, row index 9 is April 19? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a date from April 3 to April 30. The rows are ordered by date. So row index 9 would be April 18 against Rangers with attendance 34,333. \n\nNow, checking all other attendances:\n- April 4 has an attendance of 39,380 which is higher than 34,333. That means the claim isn't correct because April 4 had a higher attendance.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. So if row index 1 (April 4) has a higher attendance than row index 9 (April 18), then the highest attendance is not on April 18.

Let me check other rows to confirm if there's another game against them, but it seems only row 0 mentions the White Sox.\n\nNow, checking the attendance for this game: row 0's 'Attend' column shows 13413. Wait, that's way more than 500. The claim says less than 500 attendees, which doesn't match here. So, the first part of the claim is incorrect because the actual attendance was over 13k.\n\nNext, considering if this game was the least attended. I need to check all other 'Attend' numbers in each row to find the minimum. Let me jot down some key attendances:\n\n- Row 0: 13413\n- Row 1: Not applicable since opponent isn't White Sox.\nWait, maybe I should list all attendances regardless of opponents because the claim is about the game against White Sox specifically.\n\nLooking back, row 0's attendance is the only one for the White Sox. But other games have lower attendances. For example:\n\n- April 21: 5-4 (13) with 13413 attendees\n- April 22: 7-6 with 13353 attendees\nWait, those are actually higher than row 0's. Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nRow indexes:\nRow 0: Attend 13413 (White Sox)\nRow 1: Opponent Angels, attend 13353\nRow 2: Attend 13117\nRow 29th April: attend 12533\nApril 30: 13004\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up rows. Let me list all attends:\n\n- Row 0 (White Sox): 13413\n- Row 1: Opponent Angels, attend 13353\n- Row 2: Attend 13117\n- Row 3: April 25 vs Mariners: 31215\n- Row 4: 31420\n- Row 5: 32160\n- Row 6: April 29 vs Royals: 12533\n- Row 7: April 30 vs Royals: 13004\n\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I'm miscounting rows because the table starts from row 0 as White Sox.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nLooking at the provided table structure, each <tr> is a row. The first data row after the header (row index 0) has Opponent: white sox and Attend:13413.\n\nOther attendances include:\n- April 25: 31215\n- April 26: 31420\n- April 27:32160\n- April 29:12533\n- April 30:13004\n\nWait, actually, the attendance numbers vary. The lowest seems to be 12533 on April 29 against Royals.\n\nBut wait, in row index 10 (April 29), Attend is 12533. So that's lower than 13k but higher than 500.\n\nSo the claim says the game against White Sox had less than 500 attendees, which isn't true as it was 13,413. Additionally, looking for any game with less than 500 attendees in the table: all attendances are way above that. The lowest is around 12k.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n\n1. The attendance against White Sox was much higher (over 13k).\n2. There's no game with less than 500 attendees; thus, it can't be the least attended.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a game against the White Sox had less than 500 attendees and was the least attended. However, checking the table:\n\n- The game against the White Sox (row index 0) had an attendance of 13,413.\n- All other games had attendances above this number, with the lowest being around 12,533.\n\nThus, the claim is false because neither part holds true: the attendance was not less than 500, and it wasn't the least attended game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim\": \"less than 500 crowd attend the game against the white sox, make it the least attended game.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 0,\n      \"columns\": [\"Opponent\", \"Attend\"],\n      \"values\": [\"white sox\", 13413]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"result\": \"The claim is false because the attendance was much higher than 500 and it wasn't the least attended game.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"6 of the game end in a shut out\" is true based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a shut-out means in baseball. A shut-out occurs when one team scores zero runs and the opposing team wins with more than zero runs. So, for each game, I need to check if either team scored zero, but only count it as a shut-out if that zero is from the losing team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns relevant here are \"Home Score\" and \"Away Score\". These will tell me the runs each team scored in that particular game.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **April 3**: Home score is 0, Away score is 4. Since the home team scored zero, this could be a shut-out if they lost. The away team won with 4 runs. So yes, this counts as a shut-out.\n\n2. **April 5**: Both teams scored at least one run (3 and 6). No zeros here, so not a shut-out.\n\n3. **April 7**: Home score is 0, Away score is 9. The home team lost with zero runs. This is another shut-out.\n\n4. **April 8**: Home score is 3, Away score is 5. Both teams scored more than zero, so not a shut-out.\n\n5. **April 12**: Home score is 0, Away score is 9. Another shut-out for the home team.\n\n6. **April 14**: Home score is 5, Away score is 3. No zeros; not a shut-out.\n\n7. **April 15**: Home score is 2, Away score is 1. Again, both scored more than zero.\n\n8. **April 16**: Both teams have scores of 0? Wait, that can't be right because you can't have both teams with zero runs and still have a game. But looking at the data, Home Score is 0, Away Score is 4. So this is another shut-out for the home team.\n\n9. **April 18**: Both teams scored 2 each. No shut-out here.\n\n10. **April 19**: Home score is 1, Away score is 5. Neither team has zero runs; not a shut-out.\n\n11. **April 21**: The scores are 4 and 5 (with an overtime indicated by the number in parentheses). Both teams scored more than zero.\n\n12. **April 23**: Another game with scores 4 each after 10 innings. No shut-out.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some games. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the table rows (from index 0 to let's see how many there are), but in the provided data, each row represents a different date and game. Wait, actually, looking again, perhaps the initial assessment was incorrect because April 16 has Home Score 0, Away Score 4? Let me check:\n\nWait no, in the table, the columns after \"April\" don't include scores for all dates as I initially thought. The actual data structure might be different.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misinterpreted the table. Looking again, the table includes rows with \"Home Score\", \"Away Score\", etc., but each row corresponds to a game on a specific date. So let's list out all the games and their scores:\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **April 3**: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out (home team)\n2. **April 5**: Home 3, Away 6 \u2192 No\n3. **April 7**: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out (home)\n4. **April 8**: Home 3, Away 5 \u2192 No\n5. **April 12**: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out (home)\n6. **April 14**: Home 5, Away 3 \u2192 No\n7. **April 15**: Home 2, Away 1 \u2192 No\n8. **April 16**: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out (home)\n9. **April 18**: Home 2, Away 2 \u2192 No\n10. **April 19**: Home 1, Away 5 \u2192 No\n11. **April 21**: Home 4, Away 5 (with extra innings) \u2192 Both scored; no\n12. **April 23**: Home 4, Away 5 (extra innings) \u2192 No\n\nWait, that's only four shut-outs so far: April 3,7,12,16.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some games. Let me recount all rows:\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has a date and then scores. Wait, but in the initial problem, the table seems to have multiple columns, including \"Home Score\" and \"Away Score\". Each row is one game.\n\nLet me list out all the games with their Home and Away Scores:\n\n1. April 3: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n2. April 5: Home 3, Away 6 \u2192 No\n3. April 7: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n4. April 8: Home 3, Away 5 \u2192 No\n5. April 12: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n6. April 14: Home 5, Away 3 \u2192 No\n7. April 15: Home 2, Away 1 \u2192 No\n8. April 16: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n9. April 18: Home 2, Away 2 \u2192 No\n10. April 19: Home 1, Away 5 \u2192 No\n11. April 21: Home 4 (with extra innings), Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n12. April 23: Home 4, Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n\nWait, that's only four shut-outs. But the claim is that six games ended in shut-outs. Did I miss some?\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each row again carefully:\n\nLooking at the table, the \"Home Score\" and \"Away Score\" are two separate columns. Each row represents one game.\n\nLet's list all rows with their Home and Away scores:\n\n1. April 3: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out (home team)\n2. April 5: Home 3, Away 6 \u2192 No\n3. April 7: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n4. April 8: Home 3, Away 5 \u2192 No\n5. April 12: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n6. April 14: Home 5, Away 3 \u2192 No\n7. April 15: Home 2, Away 1 \u2192 No\n8. April 16: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n9. April 18: Home 2, Away 2 \u2192 No\n10. April 19: Home 1, Away 5 \u2192 No\n11. April 21: Home 4 (OT), Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n12. April 23: Home 4, Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n\nWait, that's four shut-outs. But the claim is six. Did I miss two more?\n\nWait perhaps there are other games where either team could have a zero score. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking back at the table, maybe some rows have different structures or perhaps I misread the scores.\n\nWait in the problem statement, the user provided the table as part of their question, but when I look, it's not clear how many games there are because the initial description mentions \"April 3\", \"April 5\", etc., but each row might represent a single game. Let me recount based on the actual data:\n\nThe table in the problem includes multiple rows with \"Home Score\" and \"Away Score\". Each row is one game.\n\nLet me list all games:\n\n1. April 3: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n2. April 5: Home 3, Away 6 \u2192 No\n3. April 7: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n4. April 8: Home 3, Away 5 \u2192 No\n5. April 12: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n6. April 14: Home 5, Away 3 \u2192 No\n7. April 15: Home 2, Away 1 \u2192 No\n8. April 16: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n9. April 18: Home 2, Away 2 \u2192 No\n10. April 19: Home 1, Away 5 \u2192 No\n11. April 21: Home 4 (OT), Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n12. April 23: Home 4, Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n\nThat's still four shut-outs. But the claim is six. Maybe I missed some.\n\nWait perhaps in some games, the away team had zero runs and won? That can't be because if a team has zero runs, they can't win. So only when the losing team has zero runs does it count as a shut-out.\n\nWait let me check each game again for any possibility:\n\n1. April 3: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out (home lost with 0)\n2. April 5: Home 3, Away 6 \u2192 No\n3. April 7: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n4. April 8: Home 3, Away 5 \u2192 No\n5. April 12: Home 0, Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n6. April 14: Home 5, Away 3 \u2192 No (Away has 3, not zero)\n7. April 15: Home 2, Away 1 \u2192 No\n8. April 16: Home 0, Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n9. April 18: Home 2, Away 2 \u2192 No\n10. April 19: Home 1, Away 5 \u2192 No\n11. April 21: Home 4 (OT), Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n12. April 23: Home 4, Away 5 \u2192 Both scored; no\n\nWait that's four shut-outs. So the claim of six must be incorrect unless I've missed some games or misread the scores.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some rows, either home or away has zero runs, and they lost. Let me check again:\n\n- April 3: Home 0 (lost) \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 7: Home 0 (lost) \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 12: Home 0 (lost) \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 16: Home 0 (lost) \u2192 Shut-out\n\nThat's four games where home team had zero runs and lost. Are there any away teams with zero runs and losing? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any game where the away team has zero runs because in such cases, they would have lost. But looking at all rows:\n\n1. April 3: Away scored 4 (won), home 0 (lost)\n2. April 5: Away 6 (won), home 3\n3. April 7: Away 9 (won), home 0\n4. April 8: Away 5 (won), home 3\n5. April 12: Away 9 (won), home 0\n6. April 14: Away 3, home 5 \u2192 Home won with 5 vs away 3\n7. April 15: Away 1, home 2 \u2192 Home won\n8. April 16: Away 4, home 0 \u2192 Away won, home lost with 0\n9. April 18: Both scored 2 \u2192 Tie or maybe OT?\nWait in April 18, it's both 2. Did they go to extra innings? The problem didn't specify, but the scores are 2 each. So no shut-out there.\n\nApril 19: Away 5, home 1 \u2192 Away won with 5 vs home 1\nApril 21: Both scored in OT, so 4 and 5 \u2192 No shut-out\nApril 23: Both scored 4 and 5 \u2192 No\n\nSo in the games where away team won:\n\n- April 3, 5,7,8,16,19. Wait let's see their scores:\n\n- April 3: Away 4, home 0 \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 5: Away 6, home 3 \u2192 No\n- April 7: Away 9, home 0 \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 8: Away 5, home 3 \u2192 No\n- April 16: Away 4, home 0 \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 19: Away 5, home 1 \u2192 No\n\nSo in the away team's wins:\n\nApril 3: Shut-out\nApril 7: Shut-out\nApril 16: Shut-out\n\nThat's three games where away team shut out the home team.\n\nPlus, any other games?\n\nLooking at April 12: Home 0, away 9 \u2192 That's another shut-out, but it's already counted in April 12.\n\nWait no, April 12 is a separate game. So perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me list all the shut-out games:\n\n- April 3: Home 0 (lost), Away 4 (won) \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 7: Home 0 (lost), Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 12: Home 0 (lost), Away 9 \u2192 Shut-out\n- April 16: Home 0 (lost), Away 4 \u2192 Shut-out\n\nThat's four games where the home team was shut out.\n\nBut wait, is there any game where the away team scored zero? Let me check:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- April 3: Away 4, no\n- April 5: Away 6\n- April 7: Away 9\n- April 8: Away 5\n- April 12: Away 9\n- April 14: Away 3\n- April 15: Away 1\n- April 16: Away 4\n- April 18: Away 2\n- April 19: Away 5\n- April 21: Away 5 in OT\n- April 23: Away 5\n\nSo no game where the away team scored zero. So all shut-out games are those four where home team scored zero.\n\nWait but wait, perhaps I'm missing some:\n\nLooking at April 14: Home 5, away 3 \u2192 Not a shut-out.\nApril 15: Home 2, away 1 \u2192 Not a shut-out.\nApril 18: Both 2 \u2192 No\nApril 19: Away 5, home 1 \u2192 Not a shut-out because home scored 1.\n\nSo total shut-outs are four games:\n\nApril 3,7,12,16.\n\nSo the claim of six is incorrect. But perhaps I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that there were two teams with the same number of runs in some game, but that doesn't make sense for a shut-out.\n\nWait another thought: Perhaps each shut-out counts once regardless of home or away. So if a team is shut out, it's counted as one game.\n\nSo in total, how many times did either the home or away team get shut out?\n\nFrom above:\n\n- April 3: Home shut out\n- April 7: Home shut out\n- April 12: Home shut out\n- April 16: Home shut out\n\nThat's four games where home was shut out.\n\nBut if any of these were away being shut out, but as we saw, no game had the away team scoring zero. So total shut-out games are four.\n\nWait perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"shut out\". A shut out in baseball is when a team scores zero runs in a game. So regardless of whether it's home or away, if they scored zero, that counts as one shut-out for them.\n\nSo from the data:\n\n- April 3: Home 0 \u2192 One shut-out\n- April 7: Home 0 \u2192 Second shut-out\n- April 12: Home 0 \u2192 Third shut-out\n- April 16: Home 0 \u2192 Fourth shut-out\n\nTotal of four games where a team was shut out (all home teams).\n\nSo the answer would be four, not six.\n\nWait but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let's go through each game:\n\n1. April 3: H0, A4 \u2192 H shut out\n2. April 5: H3, A6 \u2192 No\n3. April 7: H0, A9 \u2192 H shut out\n4. April 8: H3, A5 \u2192 No\n5. April 12: H0, A9 \u2192 H shut out\n6. April 14: H5, A3 \u2192 No\n7. April 15: H2, A1 \u2192 No\n8. April 16: H0, A4 \u2192 H shut out\n9. April 18: H2, A2 \u2192 No\n10. April 19: H1, A5 \u2192 No\n11. April 21: H4 (OT), A5 \u2192 No\n12. April 23: H4, A5 \u2192 No\n\nYes, that's four games where the home team was shut out.\n\nSo the total number of shut-out games is four.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of games where a team was shut out (scored zero runs), we analyze each game:\n\n1. **April 3**: Home team scores 0 runs \u2192 Shut-out\n2. **April 7**: Home team scores 0 runs \u2192 Shut-out\n3. **April 12**: Home team scores 0 runs \u2192 Shut-out\n4. **April 16**: Home team scores 0 runs \u2192 Shut-out\n\nOther games do not involve a team scoring zero runs.\n\n**Answer:** There were four shut-out games in total.",
