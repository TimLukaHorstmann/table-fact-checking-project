    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the zakspeed 891 chassis have a yamaha v8 engine\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the table. It has five columns: year, chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. The rows correspond to different years from 1985 to 1989. Each row provides specific information about that year's entry.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"zakspeed 891\" chassis in a particular year and whether it has a \"yamaha v8\" engine. So, I need to find the row where the chassis is listed as \"zakspeed 891.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- For 1985: Chassis is zakspeed 841, engine is zakspeed s4 t / c.\n- For 1986: Chassis is zakspeed 861, same engine as 1985.\n- For 1987: Chassis includes both zakspeed 861 and 871. The engine here is still zakspeed s4 t / c.\n- For 1988: Chassis is zakspeed 881, same engine as before.\n- For 1989: Chassis is zakspeed 891, which matches the claim.\n\nIn the 1989 row, under the \"engine(s)\" column, it says \"yamaha v8.\" This directly corresponds to the claim. So, the relevant cell here is in row index 4 (since rows are zero-indexed) and the column name \"engine(s).\"\n\nSince the table explicitly states that in 1989, the zakspeed 891 chassis used a yamaha v8 engine, the claim is fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The rows represent data for each year from 1985 to 1989.\n\nThe claim mentions \"zakspeed 841\" as the chassis and refers to the year 1985. So I need to check if in 1985, the chassis was indeed zakspeed 841.\n\nLooking at row index 0 (since HTML tables start counting from 0), the year is 1985. The chassis column for that row shows \"zakspeed 841\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, column 'year' to confirm it's 1985.\n- Row 0, column 'chassis' to check if it's zakspeed 841.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by these cells.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that there are two Zakspeed chassis made in the year 1987. So, I'm looking for any row in the table where the year is 1987 and check how many chassis entries there are in that row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1985 to 1989. The columns are 'year', 'chassis', 'engine (s)', 'tyres', and 'points'. I'll focus on the 'year' and 'chassis' columns for this claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0**: Year is 1985. The chassis is \"zakspeed 841\". Only one chassis here, so not relevant.\n- **Row 1**: Year is 1986. Chassis is \"zakspeed 861\". Again, only one chassis.\n- **Row 2**: Year is 1987. The chassis entry is \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\". Wait, that looks like two different chassis models listed together: 861 and 871. So in this row for 1987, there are two Zakspeed chassis mentioned.\n- **Row 3**: Year is 1988. Chassis is \"zakspeed 881\". Only one.\n- **Row 4**: Year is 1989. Chassis is \"yamaha v8\", which isn't a Zakspeed model, so irrelevant.\n\nSo, the claim is specifically about 1987, and in that row (row index 2), under 'chassis', there are two entries: zakspeed 861 and zakspeed 871. This means there are indeed two Zakspeed chassis made in 1987.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the year 1987, there were two Zakspeed chassis made. Looking at row 2 of the table (year 1987), the 'chassis' column lists \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\", indicating two different models.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the zakspeed 861 chassis be make in the year 1986 and 1987\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like there's a typo, probably meaning \"made\" instead of \"be make\". So the intended statement is that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was made in both 1986 and 1987.\n\nLooking at the table, it has five rows, each corresponding to a year from 1985 to 1989. The relevant columns are 'year' and 'chassis'. \n\nStarting with the year 1986: Checking row index 1 (since rows start at 0), the 'year' is 1986, and the 'chassis' is listed as \"zakspeed 861\". So that's correct for 1986.\n\nNext, checking 1987 in row index 2. The year is 1987, and the 'chassis' column shows \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\". This indicates that both the 861 and 871 chassis were used in 1987. So yes, the Zakspeed 861 was indeed present in 1987.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table for both years mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the zakspeed 861 chassis was made in 1986 and 1987.

There are five rows corresponding to the years 1985 through 1989.\n\nThe claim is about the year 1985, so I need to focus on that row. In the table, the first row (row index 0) corresponds to 1985. Let me check what the chassis was in that year. The 'chassis' column for 1985 shows \"zakspeed 841\". \n\nNow, the claim states that this is the only chassis from 1985. To verify if it's the only one, I should ensure that there are no other entries for 1985 in the 'chassis' column. Looking through the rest of the table, each subsequent row corresponds to a different year (1986-1989), so none of them overlap with 1985.\n\nAdditionally, since the claim is about uniqueness within 1985 and there's only one entry for that year, it stands true.

Let me start by carefully examining each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It states that the Zakspeed 891 chassis uses multiple Yamaha V8 engines. So I'm looking for two things here\u2014the specific chassis model (Zakspeed 891) and whether it has multiple engines of type Yamaha V8.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it includes columns for \"year\", \"chassis\", \"engine(s)\", \"tyres\", and \"points\". The relevant information will be in the rows where the chassis is Zakspeed 891. Scanning through each row:\n\n- For 1985: Chassis is Zakspeed 841, engine is Zakspeed S4 T/C.\n- 1986: Chassis is Zakspeed 861, same engine as above.\n- 1987: Here, the chassis seems to list two models\u2014Zakspeed 861 and Zakspeed 871. Engine still Zakspeed S4 T/C.\n- 1988: Chassis is Zakspeed 881, engine unchanged.\n- 1989: Finally, the chassis is Zakspeed 891, and the engine listed is Yamaha V8.\n\nSo the claim is about the 1989 row. The engine column for that year is \"Yamaha V8\". Now, does this mean multiple engines? The term \"multiple\" implies more than one. Looking at the data, it just says \"Yamaha V8\", without any indication of quantity. There's no mention of having two or more engines in that row.\n\nIn the other rows where Zakspeed chassis are used, the engine is consistently listed as Zakspeed S4 T/C except for 1989. The 1987 entry has a combined chassis but still uses the same engine type as previous years. \n\nTherefore, based on the table data, there's no evidence that the Zakspeed 891 chassis uses multiple Yamaha V8 engines. It only lists one Yamaha V8 engine for that specific chassis in 1989.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the table shows only one Yamaha V8 engine for the Zakspeed 891 chassis.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine  (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
