    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry, and it claims that they tied for having the lowest 'to par' score. \n\nLooking at the table, each row contains information about a player, including their 'to par' score. The 'to par' column shows how much each player was under or over par during the tournament. A negative number means they were under par, which is better.\n\nI'll need to extract the 'to par' values for Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry from the table. Let's check each row:\n\n- For Mark Brooks (row 0), the 'to par' value is -11.\n- For Kenny Perry (row 1), it's also -11.\n\nNow, I should compare these two scores to determine if they are indeed tied for the lowest. Scanning through all the rows in the table:\n\nRow 2: Steve Elkington has a 'to par' of -10.\nRow 3: Tommy Tolles is also at -10.\nRows 4-6 have players with -9, which is higher than both Brooks and Perry.\nRows 7-12 show scores ranging from -8 upwards.\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the lowest 'to par' score in the table is -11. Both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry share this score, making them tied at the top with the best performance relative to par.\n\nTherefore, the claim accurately reflects the data presented in the table. They do tie for the lowest 'to par' score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry are tied for the lowest \"to par\" score. Both have a \"to par\" of -11, which is indeed the lowest value in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Nick Price is the sole player representing Zimbabwe in the event. To verify this, I should look through the \"country\" column for any mention of Zimbabwe and check if there's only one player associated with it.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player's performance. The relevant columns here are \"player\" and \"country.\" My goal is to see how many players from Zimbabwe are listed.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Mark Brooks - United States\n2.

There are no other rows where the country is Zimbabwe except for this one.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because Nick Price is indeed the only player from Zimbabwe in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Nick Price is the sole representative from Zimbabwe, which is confirmed by examining each row of the \"country\" column and finding only one entry for Zimbabwe corresponding to Nick Price.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The relevant information for this claim will be in the \"player\" and \"money\" columns.\n\nLooking for Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks in the table:\n\n- For Mark Brooks: He's in row 0 (assuming rows start at 0). His money is listed as 430000.\n- For Kenny Perry: He's in row 1. His money is listed as 260000.\n\nNow, to check if Kenny earned 170,000 less than Mark. Let me subtract Kenny's earnings from Mark's:\n\nMark Brooks: $430,000  \nKenny Perry: $260,000  \nDifference: 430,000 - 260,000 = 170,000\n\nSo, the difference is exactly 170,000. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells that were used for this calculation. For Mark Brooks, it's row 0, column \"money\". For Kenny Perry, it's row 1, column \"money\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, money\n- Row 1, money\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is TRUE with those two cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}",

So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brooks. To verify this, I should look into the \"money\" column for both players and compare their earnings.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are two rows relevant here: one for Mark Brooks and another for Kenny Perry. Let's note down their respective money earned.\n\n- For Mark Brooks (row index 0), the money is listed as $430,000.\n- For Kenny Perry (row index 1), the money is $260,000.\n\nNow, let's compute the difference between the two. Subtracting Kenny's earnings from Mark's: 430,000 - 260,000 equals 170,000. Wait a minute, that gives me $170,000, which is exactly what the claim states. But wait, the claim says \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook.\" If Mark has more money, then Kenny hasn't earned more; in fact, he's earned less. \n\nHold on, maybe I misread the claim. Let me check again. The claim is that Kenny Perry earns $170k more than Mark Brooks. But according to the numbers, Mark earned more than Kenny. So, Kenny didn't earn more; instead, he earned less.\n\nTherefore, the difference in their earnings is indeed $170,000, but in the opposite direction of what the claim suggests. Since Kenny earned $260k and Mark earned $430k, the correct statement would be that Mark earned $170k more than Kenny, not the other way around.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it states the reverse of what's true in the table. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the table shows and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, I look at the structure of the table. It has columns for place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The relevant information here is the \"money\" column because that's where each player's earnings are listed. \n\nThe claim specifically mentions Kenny Perry earning the most money.

Scanning through the rows, I see that Kenny Perry is listed as the second player with a row index of 1 (since we start counting from 0). His \"money\" column shows $260,000.\n\nNow, to determine if he earns the most, I need to compare his earnings with all other players' earnings.

Kenny Perry's $260,000 is less than that and also less than Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles who each have $140,000. \n\nTherefore, Kenny Perry does not earn the most money among the players listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The claim mentions two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry, and it says they tie for having the lowest \"to par.\"\n\nI should check the \"to par\" values for both these players. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Mark Brooks is in row 0 (first data row). His \"to par\" is \"-11\".\n- Kenny Perry is in row 1. His \"to par\" is also \"-11\".\n\nSo, both have a \"to par\" of -11. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest value in the entire table.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 2: Steve Elkington has \"-10\"\nRow 3: Tommy Tolles has \"-10\"\nRow 4: Justin Leonard has \"-9\"\nRow 5: Jesper Parnevik has \"-9\"\nRow 6: Vijay Singh has \"-9\"\nRow 7: Lee Janzen has \"-8\"\nRow 8: Per-Ulrik Johansson has \"-8\"\nRow 9: Phil Mickelson has \"-8\"\nRow 10: Larry Mize has \"-8\"\nRow 11: Frank Nobilo has \"-8\"\nRow 12: Nick Price has \"-8\"\n\nAll other players have higher \"to par\" values than -11. Therefore, both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry share the lowest \"to par,\" which is correct.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because they are tied at the lowest \"to par.\" The relevant cells for this determination are the \"to par\" entries of Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tie for the lowest \"to par.\" Both have a \"to par\" value of -11, which is indeed the lowest in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. My focus will be on the 'player' and 'country' columns since they're relevant to the claim about Frank Nobilo being the only Zimbabwean player.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Mark Brooks - United States\n2. **Row 1**: Kenny Perry - United States\n3. **Row 2**: Steve Elkington - Australia\n4. **Row 3**: Tommy Tolles - United States\n5. **Row 4**: Justin Leonard - United States\n6. **Row 5**: Jesper Parnevik - Sweden\n7. **Row 6**: Vijay Singh - Fiji\n8. **Row 7**: Lee Janzen - United States\n9. **Row 8**: Per-Ulrik Johansson - Sweden\n10. **Row 9**: Phil Mickelson - United States\n11. **Row 10**: Larry Mize - United States\n12. **Row 11**: Frank Nobilo - New Zealand\n13. **Row 12**: Nick Price - Zimbabwe\n\nWait, hold on. I think I miscounted the rows earlier. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the HTML table provided, there are 14 rows in total (including the header). Rows start from index 0 to 13.\n\nLet me list each row properly:\n\n- **Row 0**: Mark Brooks - United States\n- **Row 1**: Kenny Perry - United States\n- **Row 2**: Steve Elkington - Australia\n- **Row 3**: Tommy Tolles - United States\n- **Row 4**: Justin Leonard - United States\n- **Row 5**: Jesper Parnevik - Sweden\n- **Row 6**: Vijay Singh - Fiji\n- **Row 7**: Lee Janzen - United States\n- **Row 8**: Per-Ulrik Johansson - Sweden\n- **Row 9**: Phil Mickelson - United States\n- **Row 10**: Larry Mize - United States\n- **Row 11**: Frank Nobilo - New Zealand\n- **Row 12**: Nick Price - Zimbabwe\n\nSo, in Row 12, the player is Nick Price from Zimbabwe. Then, looking at Row 11: Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. So, based on this, Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand, not Zimbabwe. Therefore, he cannot be the only player from Zimbabwe because there's another player, Nick Price, from Zimbabwe in Row 12.\n\nSo, the claim says \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe\". But according to the table:\n\n- Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand (Row 11).\n- Nick Price is from Zimbabwe (Row 12).\n\nTherefore, Frank Nobilo isn't even from Zimbabwe; he's from New Zealand. And there's another player, Nick Price, who is from Zimbabwe. So the claim is incorrect on both counts: Frank isn't from Zimbabwe, and there isn't only one player from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because:\n\n1. Frank Nobilo isn't from Zimbabwe.\n2. There exists another player (Nick Price) from Zimbabwe.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For Frank Nobilo's country, look at Row 11, Column 'country'.\n- For Nick Price's presence as a Zimbabwean player, look at Row 12, Columns 'player' and 'country'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n\nThis helps verify that Frank Nobilo is not from Zimbabwe and there's another player from Zimbabwe.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- Row 12 shows Nick Price as a player from Zimbabwe.\n- Row 11 indicates Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand.\n\nThus, Frank Nobilo isn't from Zimbabwe and isn't alone in representing that country; therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
