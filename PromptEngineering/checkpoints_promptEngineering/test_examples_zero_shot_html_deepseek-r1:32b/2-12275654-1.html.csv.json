    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"xu huaiwen play in the women's single from 2003 to 2006\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Xu Huaiwen and specifies that she played in the women's singles event. The time frame given is from 2003 to 2006. So I'm looking for entries in the table where the year falls within this range, the category is women's singles, and Xu Huaiwen is listed as the participant.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year, with columns for Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. So for each year between 2003 to 2006, I should check the Women's Singles column.\n\nLet me go through each relevant year:\n\n- **2003**: The table shows that in 2003, Xu Huaiwen is listed under Women's Singles. That checks out.\n- **2004**: Moving to 2004, I see that the Women's Singles entry for that year isn't provided in the snippet. Wait, actually, looking back at the table, it seems like each row corresponds to a specific year. Let me double-check if all years are present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the rows. The table starts from 1996 up to 2013. So 2003 would be around row index 7 (since 1996 is 0), but in this provided data, it's cut off. Wait no, looking at the initial part of the table, it's only showing rows from 1995 to 2013, but I don't see all years in between.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nThe rows in the provided table are from 1995 up through 2013, with each row representing one year. So for 2003, that would be row index 8 (since 1995 is 0). Checking row 8: Yes, Xu Huaiwen is listed in Women's Singles.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- **2004**: Row index 9. The Women's Singles column here shows Jiang Yanmei and Li Yujia. No mention of Xu Huaiwen.\n- **2005**: Row index 10. Again, the Women's Singles entry is Jiang Yanmei and Li Yujia, so Xu isn't there either.\n- **2006**: Row index 11. The Women's Singles column lists Robert Mateusiak and Nadie\u017cda Kostiuczyk. Wait, that doesn't make sense because those are men's names. Oh, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong column.\n\nWait no, for each row, the columns are:\n\n0: Year\n1: Men's Singles\n2: Women's Singles\n3: Men's Doubles\n4: Women's Doubles\n5: Mixed Doubles\n\nSo in 2006 (row index 11), the Women's Singles is column 2. Let me check that again.\n\nLooking at row index 11, which corresponds to 2006:\n\n- Column 2 (Women's Singles): It shows \"robert mateusiak nadie\u017cda kostiuczyk\". Wait, those are names from Poland, and they're a mixed doubles pair, but in Women's Singles? That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misreading the table.\n\nWait no, looking back at the 2006 row:\n\n- Year: 2006\n- Men's Singles: micha\u0142 \u0142ogosz robert mateusiak\n- Women's Singles: jiang yanmei li yujia\n\nAh, okay, I think I made a mistake earlier. So in 2006 (row index 11), the Women's Singles column has Jiang Yanmei and Li Yujia again, not Xu Huaiwen.\n\nWait, but going back to row 7: 2003\n\n- Men's Singles: micha\u0142 \u0142ogosz robert mateusiak\n- Women's Singles: xu huaiwen\n- Men's Doubles: micha\u0142 \u0142ogosz robert mateusiak\n- Women's Doubles: jiang yanmei li yujia\n- Mixed Doubles: robert mateusiak nadie\u017cda kostiuczyk\n\nSo in 2003, Xu is there.\n\nThen row 8 (2004):\n\n- Men's Singles: mathias boe carsten mogensen\n- Women's Singles: yang wei\n\nRow index 8 corresponds to 2004? Wait, no. Let me check the years properly:\n\nThe table starts with 1995 as row 0.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: 1995\nRow 1: 1996\n...\nRow 7: 2002 (since 1995 +7=2002)\nWait, no. Let me count correctly:\n\nFrom 1995 to 2013 is 19 years.\n\nSo row 0: 1995\n\nrow 1:1996\n\n...\n\nrow 8: 2003 (because 1995 +8=2003)\n\nWait, no. Wait, if row 0 is 1995, then row n corresponds to 1995 +n.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 7: 1995+7=2002\n\nRow 8: 2003\n\nRow 9: 2004\n\nRow 10:2005\n\nRow 11:2006\n\nOkay, so in row 8 (2003), Women's Singles is Xu Huaiwen.\n\nRow 9 (2004): Women's Singles is yang wei\n\nRow 10 (2005): Women's Singles is jiang yanmei li yujia\n\nRow 11 (2006): Women's Singles is xu huaiwen? Wait, no, in row 11, the Women's Singles column says \"xu huaiwen\" again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look carefully:\n\nIn the provided table data:\n\nLooking at row indices beyond row 7 (2003):\n\nRow 8: Year=2004\n\n- Men's Singles: mathias boe carsten mogensen\n- Women's Singles: yang wei\n\nRow 9: Year=2005\n\n- Men's Singles: jonas rasmussen kai salmenkyla\n- Women's Singles: xu huaiwen\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nActually, the table provided in the initial data seems to have a different structure because it's cut off at row 19 (2013), but let me focus on the relevant years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the rows. Alternatively, maybe the table only includes certain years with participants, and not every year is present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured differently. Let me clarify:\n\nThe user provided a snippet of the table starting from 1995 up to 2013, but it's possible that for some years, the Women's Singles column doesn't have Xu Huaiwen except in specific years.\n\nBut based on the information I have, in 2003 (row index 8), Xu is present. Then in 2004 (row 9), she isn't. In 2005 (row 10), she's not there either. Wait no, perhaps row indices are different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the rows because the initial table starts from 1995 as row 0. So:\n\nRow 0: 1995\n\n...\n\nRow 8:2003 (since 1995+8=2003)\n\nIn that case, in 2003 (row 8), Women's Singles is xu huaiwen.\n\nThen row 9 would be 2004. Let me check:\n\nRow 9: Year=2004\n\nWomen's Singles: yang wei\n\nSo no Xu there.\n\nRow 10: Year=2005\n\nWomen's Singles: xu huaiwen? Wait, in the table snippet provided by the user, row indices beyond 7 (which is 2002) are not shown. So perhaps I don't have data for all years up to 2006.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check each year from 2003 to 2006 in the table.\n\nLooking at the provided rows:\n\nThe user's initial message includes a table with rows starting from Year=1995 (row 0) up to Year=2013 (row 18). So for 2003, it would be row index 8. Let me check that:\n\nRow 8: Year=2003\n\nWomen's Singles: xu huaiwen.\n\nSo yes, she is there in 2003.\n\nThen, I need to check if she appears in the Women's Singles for 2004 (row 9), 2005 (row 10), and 2006 (row 11).\n\nLooking at row 9: Year=2004\n\nWomen's Singles: yang wei.\n\nSo no Xu there.\n\nRow 10: Year=2005\n\nWomen's Singles: xu huaiwen? Let me check the data:\n\nIn the user's table, after row 7 (Year=2002), the next rows are:\n\n8: 2003, Men's Singles: zhang yong; Women's Singles: xu huaiwen.\n\n9: 2004, Men's Singles: mathias boe kai salmenkyla; Women's Singles: yang wei.\n\n10:2005, Men's Singles: peter gade; Women's Singles: xie xiafang.\n\nWait, so in 2005 (row 10), Women's Singles is xie xiafang, not Xu Huaiwen.\n\nThen row 11: Year=2006\n\nMen's Singles: jonas rasmussen kai salmenkyla; Women's Singles: zhang Ning.\n\nSo in 2006, she isn't present either.\n\nTherefore, Xu Huaiwen was only in the Women's Singles for 2003 according to this table. She didn't participate in 2004, 2005, or 2006 as per the data given.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misreading the rows. Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices and years:\n\n0:1995\n\n1:1996\n\n...\n\n8:2003 (Women's Singles: xu huaiwen)\n\n9:2004 (yang wei)\n\n10:2005 (xie xiafang)\n\n11:2006 (zhang Ning)\n\nSo yes, she only participated in 2003.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Xu Huaiwen participated in the Women's Singles event at the BWF World Championships in 2003.\n</think>\n\nXu Huaiwen participated in the Women's Singles event at the BWF World Championships in the year **2003**.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is that \"michael s\u00f8gaard plays in the men's double with both joachim fischer nielsen and michael lamp.\" I need to verify if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is saying. It mentions three people: Michael S\u00f8gaard, Joachim Fischer Nielsen, and Michael Lamp. The claim states that all three are partners in men's doubles, which I assume means they play together in pairs. However, in sports like badminton or tennis, a doubles team typically consists of two players, not three. So having three people as partners would mean S\u00f8gaard has played with both the others at different times.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it seems to list yearly data for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles winners. Each row represents a year from 1990 up to 2013, I think. So each row has columns like Men Singles, Women Singles, Men Doubles, etc.\n\nThe claim is about men's doubles, so I should focus on the \"Men Doubles\" column in each row. The names listed there are pairs of players who won that year.\n\nNow, my task is to check if Michael S\u00f8gaard has played with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in different years for the men's doubles.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **2003 (Row 13)**: Men Doubles - Michael S\u00f8gaard and Joachim Fischer Nielsen are listed here. So this shows they were partners that year.\n\n2. **2004 (Row 14)**: Men Doubles - Again, it's Michael S\u00f8gaard with Joachim Fischer Nielsen. So they partnered again the next year.\n\n3. **Looking for Michael Lamp**: I need to find if there's any row where Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with Michael Lamp in men's doubles. Scanning through the table, I don't see Michael Lamp listed in any of the Men Doubles columns alongside Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed some years. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- 1990: Not relevant.\n- ...\n- Up to 2013. In none of these years do I see Michael S\u00f8gaard paired with Michael Lamp in the Men Doubles column. \n\nSo according to this table, Michael S\u00f8gaard played men's doubles with Joachim Fischer Nielsen in 2003 and 2004 but never with Michael Lamp. Therefore, the claim that he plays with both is partially true regarding Joachim but false about Michael Lamp.\n\nSince the claim requires that he has partnered with both, and one part isn't supported by the table, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Men Doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Men Doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women's double 2 years in a row.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It says that Helle Nielsen and Marie R\u00f8pke were partners in women's doubles for two consecutive years. So I need to check if both of them are listed as women's doubles players in two consecutive years.\n\nLooking at the table structure: each row represents a year, from 2013 down to 1986, but wait no\u2014actually, looking at the data provided, it seems to go up to 2013. Wait, actually, the rows are listed starting from 1985 and going up to 2013.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table in the question starts with a row index of 0 which is 1985, then 1 is 1986, etc., so each row corresponds to a year. The columns are Year, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles.\n\nSo for each year, we can look at the Women's Doubles column to see who the players were.\n\nThe claim is about two consecutive years where Helle Nielsen and Marie R\u00f8pke played together in women's doubles. So I need to find any two consecutive years (like 2010 and 2011, or 2011 and 2012) where both of them are listed as the Women's Doubles pair.\n\nLet me go through each year from top to bottom:\n\n- 1985: Women's Doubles is \"helle nielsen marie roepke\". Wait, no\u2014the row index 0 is Year 1985. The column for Women's Doubles in row 0 (1985) is \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" So they played together in 1985.\n\nNext year, row 1: 1986. Women's Doubles is \"helene pedersen helle nielsen\". Hmmm, so only Helle Nielsen is there with Helene Pedersen. Marie R\u00f8pke isn't listed here. So they didn't play together in consecutive years yet.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for two consecutive years where both are partners. The claim says \"2 years in a row.\" Let me check each pair of consecutive years:\n\nLooking at the data, let's look for rows where the Women's Doubles column has both Helle Nielsen and Marie R\u00f8pke.\n\nRow 0 (1985): \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" \u2013 yes.\n\nRow 1 (1986): \"helene pedersen helle nielsen\" \u2013 only Helle, not Marie.\n\nSo that's just one year. Next:\n\nWait, let me go further down to see if there are any other instances where they played together.\n\nLooking at row 2 (1987): Women's Doubles is \"helene pedersen helle nielsen\" again. No.\n\nRow 3 (1988): Same as above.\n\nContinuing down:\n\nRow 4 (1989): Same, \"helene pedersen helle nielsen\".\n\nRow 5 (1990): \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" \u2013 Oh! So in 1990, they played together again. That's row index 5.\n\nWait a minute: So 1985 and 1990 both have Helle and Marie as partners. But that's not consecutive years. The claim is about two consecutive years.\n\nWait, but in the data, I see other instances:\n\nLooking at rows further down, for example, row index 27 (year 2009): Women's Doubles is \"helle nielsen marie roepke\". Then row index 28 (2010) also has \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" in Women's Doubles. Wait no\u2014checking the data again, I need to be precise.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because when I looked at rows beyond 1985, maybe there are other instances where they played together in consecutive years.\n\nWait, let me list all the rows where Helle and Marie are both in Women's Doubles:\n\n- Row index 0 (1985): yes\n- Row index 5 (1990): yes\n\nThen, looking further down:\n\nRow index 27 is year 2009: \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" \u2013 yes.\n\nRow index 28 is 2010: Women's Doubles is \"tine rasmussen helle nielsen\" \u2013 Helle is there, but with Tine Rasmussen, not Marie. So they didn't play together in 2010.\n\nWait, so row 27 (2009) has them together, and row 28 (2010) doesn't. So that's only one year.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought row index 5 is 1990. Let me confirm the years:\n\nRow index 0: 1985\n\nindex 1: 1986\n\n...\n\nindex 5: 1990 (since 1985 + 5 = 1990)\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo in 1985 and 1990, they played together. But these are not consecutive years. The claim is about two consecutive years.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows where they played together consecutively elsewhere.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row index 27 (2009): Helle and Marie.\n\nRow index 28 (2010): Helle with someone else.\n\nSo no.\n\nWhat about row index 26 (2008)? Let me check: Women's Doubles is \"tine rasmussen helle nielsen\" \u2013 again, not Marie.\n\nWait, perhaps in the earlier years:\n\nRow index 0 (1985): Helle and Marie\n\nRow index 1 (1986): Helle with Helene Pedersen.\n\nSo no consecutive there.\n\nLooking at row index 24: year 2007. Women's Doubles is \"tine rasmussen helle nielsen\" \u2013 again, not Marie.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all the years where they played together:\n\n1985 (row 0)\n\n1990 (row 5)\n\nAnd perhaps in row index 27: 2009\n\nNo others.\n\nSo Helle and Marie played together in 1985, then again in 1990. So that's two times but not consecutive years.\n\nWait, the claim is \"2 years in a row.\" So they need to have been partners in, say, year X and X+1.\n\nLooking at all the data, I don't see any instance where Helle and Marie played together in two consecutive years. They played together in 1985 and then again in 1990 (five years apart), and also in 2009. But none of these are back-to-back.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence of them playing together in women's doubles for two consecutive years as per the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Helle Nielsen and Marie R\u00f8pke played together in women's doubles for two consecutive years. Reviewing the table:\n\n- In 1985, they were partners (row index 0).\n- They were not partners in 1986 (row index 1), as Helle was with Helene Pedersen.\n- The next time they played together was in 1990 (row index 5) and again in 2009 (row index 27).\n\nHowever, these instances are not consecutive years. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** False",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"katrin schmidt plays with both markus keck chen jin in the mixed double\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Katrin Schmidt has played in a mixed doubles match with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin. So, I need to check if there are any rows where Katrin Schmidt is paired with each of these two players separately in the mixed doubles category.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various years with different players in singles and doubles categories. Each row has columns like Year, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. Wait, actually, looking closer, I think the columns might be: Year, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles (maybe as a pair), Women's Doubles (as a pair), and Mixed Doubles (another pair). So each row represents an event in a specific year with the top players or pairs in each category.\n\nSo for mixed doubles, I need to see if Katrin Schmidt is listed alongside both Markus Keck and Chen Jin. Let me go through each row:\n\nStarting from 1987: Mixed Doubles are markus keck chen jin. Wait, that's the first row. So in 1987, mixed doubles are Markus Keck and Chen Jin. Katrin Schmidt isn't listed here.\n\nNext year, 1988: Mixed Doubles are markus keck katrin schmidt. Ah, so here in 1988, she is paired with Markus Keck. So that's one part of the claim.\n\nLooking for when she's paired with Chen Jin. Let me scan through the rows. In 1987, it was Markus and Chen together without Katrin. Then in 1989: Mixed Doubles are markus keck katrin schmidt again. So still not with Chen Jin.\n\nContinuing to later years: I don't see any other instances where Katrin Schmidt is paired with Chen Jin in mixed doubles. The next relevant row might be in 2013, but checking that, the mixed doubles pair is Michael Fuchs and Birgit Michels, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a year. Let me check each Mixed Doubles column for any occurrence of Katrin Schmidt alongside Chen Jin. \n\nLooking back through all the rows:\n\n- 1987: Markus Keck and Chen Jin\n- 1988: Markus Keck and Katrin Schmidt\n- 1989: Markus Keck and Katrin Schmidt again\n- Then in later years, mixed doubles pairs don't involve either of them. So it seems that Katrin Schmidt only played with Markus Keck in mixed doubles, but not with Chen Jin.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because she hasn't played with both; only with Markus Keck.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Katrin Schmidt has played mixed doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin. Checking the table:\n\n- In 1987, mixed doubles were Markus Keck and Chen Jin without Katrin Schmidt.\n- In 1988 and 1989, Katrin Schmidt was paired with Markus Keck in mixed doubles.\n- There's no instance where Katrin Schmidt is paired with Chen Jin.\n\nThus, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Mixed Doubles\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Mixed Doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify the claim: \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women's double 3 years in a row.\" I'll need to check the provided table for relevant information.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that two players, Helle Nielsen and Marie R\u00f8pke, played together in women's doubles for three consecutive years. So, I'm looking for entries where both of these names appear in the \"Women's Double\" column across three sequential years.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: Year, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. The relevant column here is \"Women's Doubles.\"\n\nI'll go through each row of the table starting from 2013 down to earlier years because the latest entry in the table I can see starts from 2013. Wait, actually, looking back, the first rows are from 2010 onwards. Let me check all rows for \"Women's Doubles.\"\n\nStarting with 2013:\n- Women's Double: eefje muskens selena piek\nNo Helle or Marie here.\n\n2012:\n- Women's Double: anders kristiansen julie houmann\nNot relevant.\n\n2011:\n- Women's Double: mizuki fujii reika kakiiwa\nNo match.\n\n2010:\n- Women's Double: pan pan tian qing\nNope.\n\nWait, I think I might have skipped some years. Let me check from 2008 to 2013 again more carefully.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n2007:\n- Women's Double: yang wei zhang jiewen\n\n2008:\n- Women's Double: helle nielsen marie roepke\nAh, here they are. So in 2008, both Helle Nielsen and Marie R\u00f8pke played together.\n\n2009:\n- Women's Double: helle nielsen marie roepke\nThey're still together in 2009.\n\n2010:\n- Women's Double: pan pan tian qing\nNo, they're not here. So it breaks the chain here because 2010 doesn't have them playing together.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed a row or two. Let me go back to 2008:\n\nRow index for 2008: Looking at the table structure provided, each year is in order from top (earlier years) to bottom (later). So 2007 is row index 14, 2008 is 15, 2009 is 16, 2010 is 17, etc.\n\nIn the table provided:\n\n- Row index 15: Year 2008. Women's Double: helle nielsen marie roepke.\n- Row index 16: Year 2009. Women's Double: same pair.\n- But then in 2010 (row 17), it's different players.\n\nSo they played together in 2008 and 2009 but not in 2010. That's only two consecutive years, not three as the claim suggests.\n\nWait a second\u2014maybe I missed some earlier rows where they were playing together? Let me check from the top of the table, which starts at Year 2013:\n\nLooking for \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" in Women's Doubles. Scanning through each year:\n\n- 2013: No\n- 2012: No\n- 2011: No\n- 2010: No\n- 2009: Yes (row index 16)\n- 2008: Yes (row index 15)\n\nBut the claim says \"3 years in a row,\" so we need three consecutive years. From the data, they were together only in 2008 and 2009. So that's two years, not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because they didn't play together for three consecutive years; they played together for two consecutive years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Women's Double\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Women's Double\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"xu huaiwen play in the women's single from 2003 to 2009\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Xu Huaiwen participated in the women's singles event during the years from 2003 to 2009. So, I'm looking for entries in the table where Xu Huaiwen is listed under the women's singles category for those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it seems each row represents a year, with columns for Men's Single, Women's Single, Men's Double, Women's Double, and Mixed Double. The years range from 2003 to 2013. My focus is on the years between 2003 and 2009.\n\nI'll go through each year in that range and check if Xu Huaiwen appears under the Women's Single column.\n\nStarting with 2003:\n- The row index for 2003 is 10 (since counting starts from 0, but looking at the provided table, it seems rows start from 2003 as the first entry after the header). Wait, actually, in the given data, the years start from 2003. So I need to check which row corresponds to each year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the rows. Let me list out the years and their corresponding row indices based on the table provided:\n\n- 2003: Row 10 (since the first data row is 2003)\n- 2004: Row 11\n- 2005: Row 12\n- 2006: Row 13\n- 2007: Row 14\n- 2008: Row 15\n- 2009: Row 16\n\nNow, I'll check each of these rows under the \"Women's Single\" column.\n\nFor 2003 (Row 10), Women's Single is Xu Huaiwen. So that's a match.\n\n2004 (Row 11): Women's Single is Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia. No, not Xu Huaiwen.\n\nWait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake in identifying the row indices because the table starts from 2003 as the first data row after the header. Let me recount properly:\n\nThe table has a header row, then the data rows start with 2003 as the first data row. So the rows are indexed starting from 0 for the header, but since we're focusing on the data, perhaps it's better to consider each year's row index in the data section.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count all rows including the header. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, after the <tbody> tag, the first <tr> is 2003, which would be row index 0 in the tbody. So for each year from 2003 to 2013, they are rows 0 through 10.\n\nWait no, actually, when using JavaScript or similar, tbody rows start at index 0. But perhaps in this case, since we're given a JSON structure with row indices, it's better to consider the rows as per their order in the tbody.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: 2003\nRow 1: 2004\n...\nRow 6: 2009\n\nWait, no. Let me list them properly:\n\nLooking at the provided table data, after the <tbody>, each row is a year from 2003 up to 2013.\n\nSo row indices in the tbody would be:\n\n- Row 0: 2003\n- Row 1: 2004\n- Row 2: 2005\n- Row 3: 2006\n- Row 4: 2007\n- Row 5: 2008\n- Row 6: 2009\n- Row 7: 2010\n- Row 8: 2011\n- Row 9: 2012\n- Row 10: 2013\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the claim is from 2003 to 2009. So rows 0 through 6 correspond to those years.\n\nNow, checking each of these rows under \"Women's Single\":\n\nRow 0 (2003): Women's Single is Xu Huaiwen. That's correct.\nRow 1 (2004): Women's Single is Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia. Not Xu.\nRow 2 (2005): Looking back, I think the table may have different data. Wait, let me check each row correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting because in the provided table, after the header, each row represents a year starting from 2003 as the first data row. So:\n\nRow 0: 2003 - Women's Single: Xu Huaiwen\nRow 1: 2004 - Women's Single: Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia\nRow 2: 2005 - Let me check, no, in the table provided, looking at each row:\n\nLooking back, I think I need to accurately map each year and its corresponding Women's Single participant.\n\nLet me list all rows with their years and Women's Single entries:\n\n- Row 10 (Year 2003): Xu Huaiwen\n- Row 11 (2004): Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia\n- Row 12 (2005): No, actually, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recount properly.\n\nWait, the table provided in the problem has rows starting from 2003, so each row corresponds to a specific year:\n\nFor example, the first data row after the header is 2003, then 2004, and so on up to 2013. So for each year from 2003 to 2009, I need to check if Xu Huaiwen is listed in the Women's Single column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2003: Women's Single is Xu Huaiwen\n- 2004: Women's Single is Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia\n- 2005: I think it's someone else, maybe Xu Huaiwen again?\nWait, let me check the actual table data.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the user provided a table structure but didn't list all entries. So perhaps I should rely on the data given in the initial response where it was mentioned that only 2003 and 2004 have Xu Huaiwen in Women's Single.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that she played from 2003 to 2009, meaning every year in between. If she only appears in some of those years, then the claim isn't fully accurate.\n\nWait, but according to the initial response, the user found that Xu Huaiwen was present only in 2003 and 2004 under Women's Single. So from 2005 to 2009, she wasn't listed there.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she played from 2003 to 2009 is false because she didn't appear every year in that range.\n</think>\n\nBased on the table data provided:\n\n- **2003**: Xu Huaiwen participated in Women's Single (Row 10).\n- **2004**: Xu Huaiwen did not participate; Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia was listed instead (Row 11).\n  \nSince Xu Huaiwen only appeared in the Women's Single event for 2003 and not consistently from 2003 to 2009, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** False",

The claim says: \"michael s\u00f8gaard play in the men's double with both sanave thomas and maneepong jongjit.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Michael S\u00f8gaard is a\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403 player, so I'm looking for instances where he played in men's doubles with Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list years from 1998 to 2013, and each row has several columns: Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. The relevant column here is \"Men's Doubles\" because that's where partnerships would be listed.\n\nI need to check the Men's Doubles entries for any mention of Michael S\u00f8gaard alongside Sanave Thomas or Maneepong Jongjit.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- 1998: Men's Doubles are Kim Jang and Kwon Young. No match.\n- 1999: Park Joon and Hong Hyeon-Kyu. Nope.\n- 2000: Ko Sung Mo and Lee Dong Il. Still no.\n\nContinuing through the years:\n\n- 2001: Chai Biao and Cai Yun. Not relevant.\n- 2002: Tsunekazu Nishida and Keigo Sonoda. No match.\n- 2003: Ko Sung Mo and Kim Dong-Moon. Still no.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- 2004: Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen. Not seeing S\u00f8gaard here.\n- 2005: Kristof Hopp and Bj\u00f6rn Hechler. No match.\n- 2006: Robert Mateusiak and Nadie\u017cda Kostiuczzyk. Wait, this is under Mixed Doubles, so not relevant for Men's Doubles.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake there. Each row has columns for Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, etc. So I need to check each year's Men's Doubles specifically.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- 2007: Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen.\n- 2008: Same pair again.\n- 2009: Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas. Here, I see Sanave Thomas in the Men's Doubles for 2009 with Rupesh Kumar. But where is Michael S\u00f8gaard?\n\nWait, let me look at the years after that:\n\n- 2010: Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen again.\n- 2011: Bodin Isara and Maneepong Jongjit. Here's Maneepong Jongjit in Men's Doubles for 2011.\n\nNow, where is Michael S\u00f8gaard? I don't see him listed in any of the Men's Doubles columns across all the years provided. So if he didn't play in the Men's Doubles at all in these years, he couldn't have partnered with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check each year again for Men's Doubles:\n\n- 1998: Kim Jang/Kwon Young\n- 1999: Park Joon/Hong Hyeon-Kyu\n- 2000: Ko Sung Mo/Lee Dong Il\n- 2001: Chai Biao/Cai Yun\n- 2002: Tsunekazu Nishida/Keigo Sonoda\n- 2003: Ko Sung Mo/Kim Dong-Moon\n- 2004: Yang Wei/Zhang Jiewen\n- 2005: Kristof Hopp/Bj\u00f6rn Hechler\n- 2006: Michael Fuchs/Birgit Michels (Mixed Doubles, not Men's)\nWait, no\u2014each row has separate columns. So in 2006, Men's Doubles were Micha\u0142 \u0141ogosz and Robert Mateusiak.\n- 2007: Mathias Boe/Carsten Mogensen\n- 2008: Same as 2007\n- 2009: Rupesh Kumar/Sanave Thomas\n- 2010: Mathias Boe/Carsten Mogensen\n- 2011: Bodin Isara/Maneepong Jongjit\n- 2012: Ingo Kindervater/Johannes Schoettler\n- 2013: Mads Conrad-Petersen/Mads Pieler Kolding\n\nSo Michael S\u00f8gaard is not listed in any Men's Doubles entries. Therefore, the claim that he played with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit must be false because he isn't even present in the Men's Doubles column for those years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. Based on the table provided, Michael S\u00f8gaard does not appear in any of the Men's Doubles entries across the listed years (1998 to 2013). Therefore, he couldn't have partnered with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit as claimed.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. The table provided does not list Michael S\u00f8gaard in any Men's Doubles entries from 1998 to 2013, so he did not play with either Sanave Thomas or Maneepong Jongjit in men's doubles during those years. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men's double\" is true based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Katrin Schmidt played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in the men's doubles event. Wait a minute\u2014that seems odd because men's doubles typically involve male players. If Katrin Schmidt is involved, she would be a female player, which might indicate mixed doubles instead of men's doubles. But let me check the table to see what information I can find.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1987 to 2013. The columns are Year, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. So for each year, it lists the champions in these categories.\n\nThe claim is about men's doubles. So I should focus on the \"Men's Doubles\" column to find instances where Katrin Schmidt played with Markus Keck and Chen Jin.\n\nWait a second\u2014Katrin Schmidt is listed in the Men's Doubles column for some years. Let me go through each row:\n\n1987: Mark Agte, J\u00f6rg Sprengard\n1988: Joachim Jung, Ralf Ohlsen\n1989: Thomas Lehmann, Michael Stolle\n1990: Joachim Jung, Ralf Ohlsen\n1991: Jan Vasek, Petr Starka\n1992: Mark Agte, J\u00f6rg Sprengard\n1993: Mark Agte, J\u00f6rg Sprengard\n1994: Michael Stolle, Thomas Lehmann\n1995: Peter Huenten, Bj\u00f6rn Steinbach\n1996: Peter Huenten, Bj\u00f6rn Steinbach\n1997: Markus Keck, Katrin Schmidt \u2014 Oh, here's Katrin Schmidt in Men's Doubles with Markus Keck. So that part is true.\n\nBut what about Chen Jin? Looking through the years, I don't see any entry for Chen Jin in the Men's Doubles column. The closest is 1987: Chou Tien-chen and others, but not Chen Jin specifically. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking at each row from 1987 to 2013, the Men's Doubles pairs are as follows:\n\n1987: Mark Agte & J\u00f6rg Sprengard\n1988: Joachim Jung & Ralf Ohlsen\n...\n1995-1996: Peter Huenten & Bj\u00f6rn Steinbach\n1997: Markus Keck & Katrin Schmidt \u2014 This is the only instance where Katrin Schmidt appears in Men's Doubles.\n...\n2004: Michael Fuchs & Birgit Michels (Wait, this is actually Women's Doubles. The Men's Doubles for 2004 isn't listed here. Maybe I need to check all rows again.\n\nUpon reviewing all the data, there's no mention of Chen Jin in any Men's Doubles pairings. Therefore, while Katrin Schmidt did partner with Markus Keck in 1997, she never played with Chen Jin in men's doubles. \n\nSince both conditions (playing with Markus Keck and Chen Jin) aren't fully met, the claim isn't entirely true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Katrin Schmidt played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in men's doubles. From the table, we find that she partnered with Markus Keck in 1997 but there is no record of her playing with Chen Jin in men's doubles.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Men's Doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Men's Doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Thunstr\u00f6m\nRow 6: 1983 | L. Nilsson | Wang Yihan | R. Gudmundsson & A. Hauksson | K. Ohlson & U. Nilsson | T. Ohlson & B. Ohlson\n... and so on until Year=2013.\n\nWait, but in row6 (Year 1983), Women's Singles is Wang Yihan, not Katrin Schmidt or Pi Hongyan. So up to this point:\n\nKatrin Schmidt appears in:\n- 1977\n- 1978\n- 1980\n\nThat's three times so far.\n\nPi Hongyan appears in:\n- 1979\n- 1981\n- 1982\n\nThree times as well.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 7: Year=1984, Women's Singles=Maria Febe Kusumastuti\nRow 8: Year=1985, Women's Singles=Juliane Schenk\nRow 9: Year=1986, Women's Singles=Liu Xin (I think it's Wang Yihan? Wait no, row9 is for 2010. Wait I'm getting confused because the years go from 1977 to 2013, each row increasing by one year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the Women's Singles champions:\n\nLet me compile a list of all \"Women's Singles\" winners from Year 1977 to 2013 as per the table:\n\nYear | Women's Singles\n---|---\n1977 | Katrin Schmidt\n1978 | Katrin Schmidt\n1979 | Pi Hongyan\n1980 | Katrin Schmidt\n1981 | Pi Hongyan\n1982 | Pi Hongyan\n1983 | Wang Yihan\n1984 | Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n1985 | Juliane Schenk\n1986 | [Need to check]\n... up to 2013.\n\nWait, actually, I'm only supposed to look at the provided table, which lists each year with its respective champions. So from row0 (1977) to rowN (2013), I need to list all \"Women's Singles\" champions.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nRow 0: Year=1977, Women's Singles=Katrin Schmidt\nRow 1: 1978, Katrin Schmidt\nRow 2: 1979, Pi Hongyan\nRow 3: 1980, Katrin Schmidt\nRow 4: 1981, Pi Hongyan\nRow 5: 1982, Pi Hongyan\nRow 6: 1983, Wang Yihan\nRow 7: 1984, Maria Febe Kusumastuti\nRow 8: 1985, Juliane Schenk\nRow 9: 1986, [Assuming it's the next in order]\n\nWait no, perhaps each row represents a different year. Let me check:\n\nFrom the initial table data provided by the user:\n\nThe first row (row0) is Year=1977, then row1=1978, etc., up to Year=2013.\n\nSo compiling \"Women's Singles\" champions from 1977 to 2013:\n\n1977: Katrin Schmidt\n1978: Katrin Schmidt\n1979: Pi Hongyan\n1980: Katrin Schmidt\n1981: Pi Hongyan\n1982: Pi Hongyan\n1983: Wang Yihan\n1984: Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n1985: Juliane Schenk\n1986: [Assuming it's someone else, but let me check]\nWait no, in the initial data provided by the user, the table includes more years beyond 1982. Let me see:\n\nThe user's table starts at Year=1977 and ends at Year=2013.\n\nSo to count how many times Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan won, I need to list all \"Women's Singles\" champions from 1977 to 2013 as per the given data.\n\nBut in the initial table, each row represents a year with its respective champions. So let me extract all the Women's Singles champions:\n\nRow 0: 1977 - Katrin Schmidt\nRow 1: 1978 - Katrin Schmidt\nRow 2: 1979 - Pi Hongyan\nRow 3: 1980 - Katrin Schmidt\nRow 4: 1981 - Pi Hongyan\nRow 5: 1982 - Pi Hongyan\nRow 6: 1983 - Wang Yihan\nRow 7: 1984 - Maria Febe Kusumastuti\nRow 8: 1985 - Juliane Schenk\nRow 9: 1986 - [Looking at the data provided by user, I think it's someone else]\nWait no, looking back at the initial data:\n\nThe user's table includes more rows beyond 1982. Let me see:\n\nFrom the user's message, they have a table with multiple rows starting from Year=1977 to Year=2013.\n\nTo accurately count the number of times Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan won Women's Singles titles, I need to list each year's champion as given in the table.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided all the data beyond a certain point, perhaps it's better to note that only up to 1982 do we have multiple entries for Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan. Beyond that, other players won.\n\nFrom the initial rows:\n\n- Katrin Schmidt won in 1977, 1978, 1980: total of 3 times.\n- Pi Hongyan won in 1979, 1981, 1982: also 3 times.\n\nAssuming that from 1983 onwards, other players won and neither Katrin Schmidt nor Pi Hongyan won any more titles, their counts remain at 3 each.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Women's Singles titles for each would be 3.\n</think>\n\nKatrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan each won three Women's Singles titles between 1977 and 1982. \n\n**Answer:**\n\n- Katrin Schmidt won 3 times.\n- Pi Hongyan won 3 times.",
