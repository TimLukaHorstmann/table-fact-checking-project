    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"zo\u00eb wanamaker play the character ariadne oliver\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the table contains.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for actor, character, title/rank, series, and years. Each row represents an actor's role in different series episodes over specific years. \n\nThe claim mentions Zo\u00eb Wanamaker playing Ariadne Oliver. So, I need to check if there is a row where the actor is Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and her corresponding character is Ariadne Oliver.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row has David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.\n2. The second row is Hugh Fraser as Arthur Hastings.\n3. Third row: Philip Jackson as James Japp.\n4. Fourth row: Pauline Moran as Felicity Lemon.\n5. Fifth row: Zo\u00eb Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver. This matches the claim exactly.\n6. Sixth row: David Yelland as George.\n\nSo, there is a direct match in the fifth row where Zo\u00eb Wanamaker's character is indeed Ariadne Oliver. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cell here is from row index 4 (since counting starts at 0) and the column \"character\" which confirms her role as Ariadne Oliver.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the actor of the character ariadne oliver be hugh fraser.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the claim is asking. It's stating that Hugh Fraser is the actor who played Ariadne Oliver in some series. To verify this, I'll look into the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: actor, character, title/rank, series, and years. Each row corresponds to a different actor and their respective roles.\n\nI need to find the row where the character is \"ariadne oliver.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first row mentions Hercule Poirot, played by David Suchet.\n2. The second row has Arthur Hastings, played by Hugh Fraser. Wait, so Hugh Fraser is in this row as Arthur Hastings, but that's a different character.\n3. The third row is James Japp with Philip Jackson.\n4. The fourth row is Felicity Lemon, portrayed by Pauline Moran.\n5. The fifth row lists Ariadne Oliver as the character, and the actor here is Zo\u00eb Wanamaker.\n6. The sixth row mentions George, played by David Yelland.\n\nSo, in the fifth row, the character is indeed Ariadne Oliver, but the actor listed there is Zo\u00eb Wanamaker, not Hugh Fraser. \n\nTherefore, the claim that Hugh Fraser is the actor for Ariadne Oliver doesn't hold true based on this table. The relevant cells are the ones where the character is Ariadne Oliver and her corresponding actor.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hugh Fraser played Ariadne Oliver. Checking the table, we find that Zo\u00eb Wanamaker is the actor for that character.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
