    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"Paul Pierce led the team in points for 5 of the 7 games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's go through each game step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'high points' column for each row (game). The rows are numbered from 0 to 6 since there are 7 games listed.\n\nRow 0: Game 76 against Charlotte\n- High points: Paul Pierce (32)\nSo, Paul led here. That's one game.\n\nRow 1: Game 77 against Atlanta\n- High points: Paul Pierce (21)\nAgain, Paul led. Now two games.\n\nRow 2: Game 78 against New Jersey\n- High points: Rajon Rondo (31)\nPaul didn't lead here. Still at two.\n\nRow 3: Game 79 against Miami\n- High points: Paul Pierce (28)\nHe leads again. Three games now.\n\nRow 4: Game 80 against Cleveland\n- High points: Paul Pierce (14)\nWait, but the team lost this game. Did he lead? The 'high points' are listed as his name with 14, so yes, he led in points here. That's four games.\n\nRow 5: Game 81 against Philadelphia\n- High points: Paul Pierce (31)\nHe leads again. Five games now.\n\nRow 6: Game 82 against Washington\n- High points: Glen Davis (21)\nPaul didn't lead this game. So total is five games where he led.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss anything. Each time Paul's name appears in 'high points', he was the top scorer. \n\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: No\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 4: Yes (even though they lost, points are still about individual performance)\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 6: No\n\nAdding up: Rows 0,1,3,4,5. That's five games where Paul led in points out of seven games total.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The key points are:\n- Rajon Rondo had the highest number of assists.\n- That number was 12.\n- It happened in a single game with the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"high assists\" which is where we can find the number of assists per game. Each row corresponds to a different game (game 76 to 82).\n\nI'll go through each row to check for Rajon Rondo's assist counts:\n\n1. **Game 76**: The high assists are listed as \"rajon rondo (9)\". So, he had 9 assists here.\n2. **Game 77**: He has 6 assists.\n3. **Game 78**: There are multiple players with 5 assists each, but Rondo is mentioned first: \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\".\n4. **Game 79**: Rondo had 12 assists here, which matches the claim.\n5. **Game 80**: He has 6 again.\n6. **Game 81**: Assists are split between two players with 5 each.\n7. **Game 82**: Stephon Marbury had 8, not Rondo.\n\nSo, in Game 79 (row index 3), Rajon Rondo did have the highest assists with 12, which is exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a single game where he had the most assists with 12.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the celtics win all of the game they play at td bank north garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a game played by the Celtics.\n\nThe claim states that all games at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in wins. So I need to check every game where the location is TD Banknorth Garden and see if the result was a win.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0 (Game 76): Location is TD Banknorth Garden, score shows W 111 - 109 (2OT). This is a win.\n- Row 1 (Game 77): Same location, score W 104 - 92 (OT). Another win.\n- Row 2 (Game 78): Location same, score W 106 - 104 (OT). Win again.\n- Row 3 (Game 79): Again at TD Banknorth Garden, score W 105 - 98 (OT). Win.\n- Row 4 (Game 80): The location is Quicken Loans Arena. This is a loss, but since it's not at TD Banknorth Garden, it doesn't affect the claim.\n- Row 5 (Game 81): Location is Wachovia Center, and they won here as well. But again, this isn't relevant to the specific location mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 6 (Game 82): Back at TD Banknorth Garden, score W 115 - 107 (OT). Another win.\n\nSo all games played at TD Banknorth Garden are wins for the Celtics. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells I looked at to verify this. Each relevant cell is where the location was TD Banknorth Garden and whether they won that game. The columns of interest are \"location attendance\" to check the venue and \"score\" to see if it's a win (indicated by 'W').\n\nSo, for each row with \"td banknorth garden\" in \"location attendance,\" I checked the corresponding \"score\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe Celtics won all games played at TD Banknorth Garden. Each game there ended in a victory as indicated by the 'W' in the score column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the celtic win 6 of their 7 game during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what's given and what exactly needs to be checked.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: it has several columns like 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', etc. The key column for determining wins is probably the 'score' column because each row shows whether the team won or lost that game. \n\nThe claim mentions \"7 games\" and says they won 6 of them. So I need to check seven consecutive games in this table and count how many were wins.\n\nLet me look at the rows provided:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 5 (since there are 7 rows, but the last row is index 6). Wait, actually, looking again, the HTML shows 7 rows with game numbers 76 through 82. So each row represents a single game.\n\nThe 'score' column in each row starts with either 'w' for win or 'l' for loss. For example, row 0 has \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\", so that's a win. Similarly, I'll go through each of the seven games:\n\n- Game 76: Win\n- Game 77: Win\n- Game 78: Win\n- Game 79: Win\n- Game 80: Loss\n- Game 81: Win\n- Game 82: Win\n\nCounting the wins: that's games 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, and 82. That's six wins. The loss is game 80.\n\nSo out of seven games, they won six. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this determination. For each row (game), the 'score' column tells us if it was a win or loss. So for all seven rows (indices 0 through 6), the 'score' column is relevant because we're checking each game's outcome.\n\nSo the relevant_ells would be an array of objects, each with row_index from 0 to 6 and column_name \"score\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Celtics won 6 out of 7 games. By examining the 'score' column for each of the seven listed games, we find there are six wins (rows 0-5) and one loss (row 5). Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by paul pierce.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is asserting. It says that Paul Pierce scored the highest points in a single game with 32 points.\n\nNow, I'll check each row of the table to find instances where Paul Pierce has high point totals. The relevant column here is \"high points.\"\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: High points are paul pierce (32). So that's one instance where he scored 32.\n- Row 1: Paul Pierce with 21 points.\n- Row 3: Paul Pierce again with 28.\n- Row 4: Paul Pierce with 14.\n- Row 5: Paul Pierce with 31.\n\nSo the highest point total for Paul Pierce is indeed 32, which occurs in game 76 on April 1 against Charlotte. \n\nNext, I need to ensure that no other player in any of these games scored higher than 32. Scanning through all \"high points\" entries:\n\n- Other players like Rajon Rondo have high point totals (e.g., 31 in row 2), but nothing exceeds 32.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Paul Pierce's highest score in a single game was 32, and no other player scored higher than that in any of these games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"paul pierce lead the team in point for 6 of the 7 game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The relevant columns are \"game,\" \"high points,\" and possibly others, but since the claim is about Paul Pierce leading in points, I can focus on the \"high points\" column for each row.\n\nThe table has 7 rows (games 76 to 82). For each game, I'll check who led in points. The claim says Paul Pierce did this in 6 out of these 7 games. Let's go through each game:\n\n1. Game 76: High points by Paul Pierce (32)\n   - Relevant cell: row 0, column \"high points\"\n\n2. Game 77: High points by Paul Pierce (21)\n   - Relevant cell: row 1, column \"high points\"\n\n3. Game 78: High points by Rajon Rondo (31)\n   - Relevant cell: row 2, column \"high points\"\n\n4. Game 79: High points by Paul Pierce (28)\n   - Relevant cell: row 3, column \"high points\"\n\n5. Game 80: High points by Paul Pierce (14)\n   - Wait, in this game, Paul only scored 14, but the team lost. The high points here are his, so he still led.\n   - Relevant cell: row 4, column \"high points\"\n\n6. Game 81: High points by Paul Pierce (31)\n   - Relevant cell: row 5, column \"high points\"\n\n7. Game 82: High points by Glen Davis (21)\n   - Relevant cell: row 6, column \"high points\"\n\nNow counting how many times Paul led:\n- Games 76, 77, 79, 80, 81: That's 5 games.\nWait, wait. Game 80 is a loss but Paul still had the highest points for his team? Or does leading in points mean the highest overall between both teams? The claim says \"lead the team,\" so it refers to within their own team, not necessarily beating the opponent.\n\nSo, looking again:\n\nGame 76: Pierce leads (32)\nGame 77: Pierce leads (21)\nGame 78: Rondo leads (31) - not Paul\nGame 79: Pierce leads (28)\nGame 80: Pierce leads (14) - even though the team lost, he had the highest points on his team\nGame 81: Pierce leads (31)\nGame 82: Glen Davis leads (21)\n\nSo that's 5 games where Paul led. The claim says 6 of 7. Therefore, it's incorrect.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: Game 76 - Pierce\nRow 1: Game 77 - Pierce\nRow 2: Game 78 - Rondo\nRow 3: Game 79 - Pierce\nRow 4: Game 80 - Pierce\nRow 5: Game 81 - Pierce\nRow 6: Game 82 - Glen Davis\n\nThat's 5 times. So the claim is false because he led in 5, not 6 games.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells are all the \"high points\" entries from each row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Paul Pierce led his team in points for 6 out of 7 games. Reviewing each game's high points:\n\n- **Game 76**: Paul Pierce (32)\n- **Game 77**: Paul Pierce (21)\n- **Game 78**: Rajon Rondo (31) - Not Paul\n- **Game 79**: Paul Pierce (28)\n- **Game 80**: Paul Pierce (14)\n- **Game 81**: Paul Pierce (31)\n- **Game 82**: Glen Davis (21) - Not Paul\n\nPaul led in points for 5 games, not 6.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Kendrick Perkins had the highest number of assists, which was 12, in a single game for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns like \"high points,\" \"high rebounds,\" and \"high assists.\" The relevant column here is \"high assists\" because it mentions who had the most assists in each game. So, I should focus on that column to check if Kendrick Perkins ever reached 12 assists in any game.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (Game 76)**: High Assists are Rajon Rondo with 9.\n- **Row 1 (Game 77)**: Again, Rajon Rondo with 6.\n- **Row 2 (Game 78)**: This time, it's a tie between Rajon Rondo, Stephon Marbury, each with 5.\n- **Row 3 (Game 79)**: Rajon Rondo leads with 12 assists. Oh wait, that's the number mentioned in the claim. But this is Rajon, not Kendrick.\n- **Row 4 (Game 80)**: High Assists are Rajon Rondo with 6 again.\n- **Row 5 (Game 81)**: Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury share with 5 each.\n- **Row 6 (Game 82)**: Stephon Marbury has 8.\n\nIn none of these rows does Kendrick Perkins appear in the \"high assists\" column. The highest number of assists he had was 9 in Game 76, but that's under high rebounds, not assists. So, the claim is incorrect because it attributes 12 assists to Kendrick when actually Rajon Rondo achieved that in Game 79.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kendrick Perkins had the most assists (12) for the Celtics in one game. However, reviewing each row of the \"high assists\" column shows that Rajon Rondo was the player with 12 assists in Game 79. Kendrick Perkins never reached 12 assists as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the celtic lose all of the game they play at td bank north garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all the games played at TD Banknorth Garden because the claim specifically mentions that location. From the table, each row has a \"location attendance\" column. Scanning through these, I see:\n\n- Game 76: April 1 vs Charlotte - Location is TD Banknorth Garden\n- Game 77: April 3 vs Atlanta - Same location\n- Game 78: April 8 vs New Jersey - Also at TD Banknorth Garden\n- Game 79: April 10 vs Miami - Still there\n- Game 82: April 15 vs Washington - Back at TD Banknorth Garden\n\nSo that's five games played at TD Banknorth Garden. Now, I need to check the outcomes of these games. The \"score\" column indicates wins or losses with a 'W' for win and 'L' for loss.\n\nLooking at each game:\n- Game 76: Score is W 111-109 (2OT) - Celtics won\n- Game 77: W 104-92 (OT) - Won again\n- Game 78: W 106-104 (OT) - Another win\n- Game 79: W 105-98 (OT) - Yet another win\n- Game 82: W 115-107 (OT) - Won\n\nWait, all these games ended in wins for the Celtics. The claim says they \"lose all of the game\" at that location, but according to this table, every game played there was a win. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where the location is TD Banknorth Garden. Looking back:\n\n- Game 80: April 12 vs Cleveland - Played at Quicken Loans Arena, so not relevant\n- Game 81: April 14 vs Philadelphia - At Wachovia Center, so also irrelevant\n\nSo only games 76 to 79 and 82 are at TD Banknorth Garden, all of which were wins. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Celtics lost all their games at TD Banknorth Garden, but the table shows they won every game there.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for rows where \"location attendance\" is \"td banknorth garden\".\n   - This applies to rows 0 (Game 76), 1 (77), 2 (78), 3 (79), and 5 (82).\n\n2. **Check Game Outcomes:**\n   - Each of these games has a 'W' in the \"score\" column, indicating wins.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all relevant games were wins, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** The cells checked are the location and score for each game at TD Banknorth Garden.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the celtics lose 6 of their 7 games during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like it's a record of basketball games played by the Celtics. Each row in the table corresponds to a particular game with details like the date, opponent team, score, and other stats.\n\nThe claim says that they lost 6 out of 7 games during this stretch. I need to check how many games they won or lost in the given period.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 8 rows (games) listed from game number 76 to 82. Each row has a 'score' column which indicates whether they won or lost that game. A 'W' means a win and an 'L' means a loss. Let's go through each game:\n\n1. Game 76: April 1 vs Charlotte - Score is W 111-109 (2OT). So that's a win.\n2. Game 77: April 3 vs Atlanta - W 104-92 (OT). Another win.\n3. Game 78: April 8 vs New Jersey - W 106-104 (OT). Win again.\n4. Game 79: April 10 vs Miami - W 105-98 (OT). Fourth win in a row.\n5. Game 80: April 12 vs Cleveland - L 76-107 (OT). First loss here.\n6. Game 81: April 14 vs Philadelphia - W 100-98 (OT). Back to winning.\n7. Game 82: April 15 vs Washington - W 115-107 (OT). Another win.\n\nSo, let's count the wins and losses:\n\nWins: Games 76,77,78,79,81,82. That's six wins.\nLosses: Only Game 80 is a loss.\n\nWait, that's only one loss in seven games. The claim says they lost 6 of 7, but according to the table, it's actually 6 wins and 1 loss. So the claim is not correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miscount. Let me list each game result:\n\n- Game 76: Win\n- Game 77: Win\n- Game 78: Win\n- Game 79: Win\n- Game 80: Loss\n- Game 81: Win\n- Game 82: Win\n\nThat's six wins and one loss in seven games. So the Celtics lost only one game, not six.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they didn't lose six of their seven games; instead, they won six and lost one.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that during this stretch of 7 games (from Game 76 to Game 82), the Celtics lost only once. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The 'score' column in each row indicates whether the Celtics won ('W') or lost ('L').\n2. **Count Wins and Losses:**\n   - Game 76: Win\n   - Game 77: Win\n   - Game 78: Win\n   - Game 79: Win\n   - Game 80: Loss\n   - Game 81: Win\n   - Game 82: Win\n3. **Result:** 6 wins and 1 loss in the 7 games.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by stephon marbury.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what needs to be verified:\n\n1. Is there any Celtic player with 32 points in a single game?\n2. If yes, was that player Stephon Marbury?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The relevant column for checking points is \"high points.\"\n\nI'll go through each row's \"high points\" to find the highest point total:\n\n- Row 0: Paul Pierce (32)\n- Row 1: Paul Pierce (21)\n- Row 2: Rajon Rondo (31)\n- Row 3: Paul Pierce (28)\n- Row 4: Paul Pierce (14)\n- Row 5: Paul Pierce (31)\n- Row 6: Glen Davis (21)\n\nFrom this, the highest points in a single game are 32 by Paul Pierce. \n\nNext, I check if Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in any game. Looking at each row's \"high points,\" Stephon Marbury isn't listed there except for lower point totals like 8 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while there was a high of 32 points, it wasn't by Stephon Marbury but Paul Pierce.\n</think>\n\nThe highest point total in the table is 32 by Paul Pierce, not Stephon Marbury. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
