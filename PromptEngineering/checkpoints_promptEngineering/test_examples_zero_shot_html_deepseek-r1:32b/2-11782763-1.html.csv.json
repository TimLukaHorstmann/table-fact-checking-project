    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"William Adelin be the only one who became heir due to birth\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- **Heir**: Robert Curthose\n- **Reason**: Father became king\nSo, he became heir because his father became king, not just due to birth. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\nNext, the second row seems to indicate that the succession was unclear between 1077 and 1087 under William I. Not relevant here since it's about uncertainty, not someone becoming heir by birth.\n\nThird row:\n- **Heir**: Robert Curthose again\n- **Reason**: By agreement\nThis is because of an agreement, so still not due to birth.\n\nFourth row:\n- **Heir**: Henry Beauclerc\n- **Reason**: Robert's rebellion\nSo, this was due to his brother rebelling, not just being born. Therefore, it doesn't fit the claim either.\n\nFifth row again shows unclear succession under Henry I from 1100-1103. Not relevant as before.\n\nSixth row:\n- **Heir**: William Adelin\n- **Reason**: Born\nThis fits because he became heir simply because he was born, specifically as the only son. So this supports the claim that he is one such person.\n\nSeventh row:\n- **Heir**: Empress Matilda\n- **Reason**: Brother died\nShe became heiress after her brother's death, not just due to birth. Although she was the only child, the reason specified here is different.\n\nNow, checking if William Adelin is the only one who became heir specifically because of birth. Looking through all the rows, only his entry has \"born\" as the reason. Others either have reasons like father becoming king, agreement, rebellion, or brother dying.\n\nTherefore, the claim that William Adelin was the only one to become heir due to birth seems accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because only William Adelin's status as heir was directly attributed to his birth.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking here. They provided an HTML table and a claim about it, and they want me to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"only 2 heir have son as their relationship to monarch.\" So I need to check how many entries in the table list \"son\" under the \"relationship to monarch\" column.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, it's structured with several columns like heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, and monarch. The relevant column here is \"relationship to monarch.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: Robert Curthose has a relationship of \"son.\" That's the first instance.\n2. Second row seems to indicate an unclear succession, so no specific relationship here.\n3. Third row: Robert Curthose again, but this time his relationship is listed as \"elder brother,\" not son.\n4. Fourth row: Henry Beauclerc is the heir, and his relationship is \"younger brother.\"\n5. Fifth row again shows unclear succession details.\n6. Sixth row: William Adelin's relationship is \"only son.\" That's the second instance.\n7. Seventh row: Empress Matilda's relationship is \"only child,\" so not a son.\n\nSo I found two instances where the heir's relationship to the monarch was \"son\": Robert Curthose in 1066 and William Adelin in 1103. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly two heirs have a \"son\" relationship.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. When did Robert Curthose become heir?\n2. When did Henry Beauclerc become heir?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for both names.\n\nFor Robert Curthose:\n- There are two entries. The first is in row 0: he became heir in 1066.\n- Another entry in row 2 shows him as heir presumptive from 1087 to 1088.\n\nBut the claim refers to when he \"became heir,\" so I think it's about when he started being heir. The first time is 1066, but the second time is after William II became monarch in 1087, so Robert was again heir from 1087 until 1088.\n\nFor Henry Beauclerc:\n- Found in row 3: he became heir in 1088. The reason was Robert's rebellion.\n\nThe claim says Henry became heir a year after Robert. If Robert became heir in 1087, then the next year is 1088, which matches Henry's becoming heir that same year. So it's only one year apart.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells:\n- For Robert Curthose in row 2: 'became heir' column (year 1087)\n- For Henry Beauclerc in row 3: 'became heir' column (year 1088)\n\nSo the answer is TRUE with those two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading the claim and then check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"henry beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 august 1100, follow by william adelin 20 year later.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break this down into two main parts:\n\n1. Henry Beauclerc ceased to be heir on August 2, 1100.\n2. William Adelin became the heir 20 years after that date.\n\nLet me check each part step by step using the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows, each representing a different heir and their status. The columns are: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, monarch.\n\nI'll start with Henry Beauclerc. Scanning through the rows, I find Henry Beauclerc in row 3 (index starts at 0). In this row:\n\n- Heir: henry beauclerc\n- Status: heir presumptive\n- Relationship: younger brother\n- Became heir: 1088\n- Reason: robert 's rebellion\n- Ceased to be heir: 2 august 1100\n- Monarch: william ii\n\nSo, according to the table, Henry Beauclerc indeed ceased to be heir on August 2, 1100. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, for the second part: William Adelin became the heir 20 years later. Let's see when that would be. If Henry ceased in 1100, adding 20 years brings us to 1120. But wait, I should check the exact date given in the claim. The claim says \"follow by william adelin 20 year later.\" So if Henry ceased on August 2, 1100, then 20 years later would be August 2, 1120.\n\nLooking for William Adelin in the table, I find him in row 5 (index 5):\n\n- Heir: william adelin\n- Status: heir apparent\n- Relationship: only son\n- Became heir: 1103\n- Reason: born\n- Ceased to be heir: 25 november 1120\n- Monarch: henry i\n\nWait, the became heir date is 1103, which is just three years after Henry ceased in 1100. That's not 20 years later. So according to this, William Adelin became heir in 1103, not 1120.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The claim says 20 years after August 2, 1100, which would be around 1120. But the table shows that William Adelin became heir in 1103. That's only three years later, not 20.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I misread something. The row for Henry Beauclerc says he ceased on August 2, 1100. Then, the next relevant entry is William Adelin, who became heir in 1103. So that's a three-year gap, not 20 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim that William Adelin followed 20 years later isn't supported by the table. Instead, he became heir just three years after Henry ceased being heir.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check other entries. There is an entry for Empress Matilda in row 6:\n\n- Heir: empress matilda\n- Became heir: 25 november 1120 (proclaimed 1127)\n- Ceased to be heir: 1 december 1135\n\nSo, theEmpress became heir in 1120. That's exactly 20 years after August 2, 1100. But the claim mentions William Adelin following 20 years later, not Empress Matilda.\n\nWait, so perhaps there's confusion here between when William Adelin and Empress Matilda became heirs. Let me clarify:\n\n- Henry Beauclerc ceased in 1100.\n- William Adelin became heir in 1103 (so only three years later).\n- Empress Matilda became heir in 1120, which is 20 years after 1100.\n\nSo the claim might be mixing up William Adelin and Empress Matilda. The table shows that it was Empress Matilda who became heir 20 years after Henry ceased, not William Adelin.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect because William Adelin didn't become heir 20 years later; instead, it was Empress Matilda. William Adelin's tenure as heir was much earlier, in 1103.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The first part is correct: Henry ceased in August 1100.\n- The second part is incorrect: William became heir three years later, not 20; the 20-year mark was for Empress Matilda.\n\nThus, the claim as a whole isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I'll note the relevant cells that support this analysis:\n\nFor Henry Beauclerc:\n- Row index 3, column \"ceased to be heir\"\n\nFor William Adelin:\n- Row index 5, column \"became heir\"\n\nSo these are the relevant cells that show the timeline discrepancy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"henry beauclerc be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. The claim states that Henry Beauclerc was the sole individual who became an heir solely because of his birth. So, I need to check each row in the table where someone became a heir and see if their reason for becoming heir is due to birth.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Robert Curthose: Became heir in 1066 because his father became king. The reason is \"father became king,\" which isn't explicitly about birth, but it's because of being a son. However, he was also heir again in 1087 by agreement, so that's not due to birth.\n\n2. Succession unclear entries: These don't provide specific reasons, so they can be ignored for this claim.\n\n3. Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088 because of Robert's rebellion. The reason isn't directly about his birth but because of a rebellion. So, not due to birth.\n\n4. William Adelin was the only son and became heir when he was born in 1103. His reason is listed as \"born,\" which fits the claim of becoming heir due to birth.\n\n5. Empress Matilda became heiress after her brother died. The reason is \"brother died,\" not because she was born.\n\nWait, so William Adelin's reason for becoming heir is specifically due to his birth, making him the only one in this table where the reason is \"born.\" However, Henry Beauclerc's reason wasn't about being born but due to a rebellion. So, the claim that Henry is the only one who became heir due to birth is actually FALSE because William Adelin fits that criteria.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says Henry was the only one who became heir due to birth. From the table, William Adelin's reason is \"born,\" so he did become heir due to birth. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's another individual (William) who also became heir due to birth.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because William Adelin also became heir due to his birth.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time, in 1066 and 1087\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It states that Robert Curthose was the heir twice: once in 1066 and again in 1087. My goal is to verify if this information is accurate by checking each relevant cell in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns of interest: \"heir,\" \"status,\" \"relationship to monarch,\" \"became heir,\" \"reason,\" \"ceased to be heir,\" and \"monarch.\" These will help me identify all instances where Robert Curthose was an heir and determine when he became one.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to find any mentions of Robert Curthose. \n\nStarting with the first row (index 0), I see that Robert is listed as the heir, his status is \"heir presumptive,\" he's the son of William I, he became heir in 1066 because his father became king, and he ceased being heir in 1077. This confirms one instance where Robert was an heir in 1066.\n\nNext, moving to row index 2, Robert is again listed as the heir presumptive. Here, his relationship is noted as \"elder brother,\" and he became heir in 1087 by agreement under William II's reign. He ceased being heir in 1088. This provides the second instance of him being an heir in 1087.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows that mention Robert to ensure I haven't missed anything. Rows 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 do not mention Robert Curthose; instead, they refer to other heirs or periods when the succession was unclear.\n\nSo, from the table, Robert Curthose is listed twice: once in 1066 and again in 1087. This aligns perfectly with the claim made. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nIn terms of relevant cells for each instance:\n- For the first time (1066), the cells are in row 0 under \"heir,\" \"status,\" and \"became heir.\"\n- For the second time (1087), the cells are in row 2 under \"heir,\" \"status,\" and \"became heir.\"\n\nThis thorough examination leads me to conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Then in another row (row index 2), it says he became heir again in 1087 under William II.\n- There's no mention of him becoming heir in 1094.\n\nNow, checking Empress Matilda's entry:\n- She became heiress presumptive on November 25, 1120. The table shows the \"became heir\" column as \"25 november 1120 proclaimed 1127\". So her start year is 1120.\n\nThe claim says Robert became heir in 1094, a year after Matilda. But according to the table, Empress Matilda's heir status started much later (1120), and Robert never became heir in 1094.

It states that there are exactly three heirs who have a 'daughter' as their relationship to the monarch.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns here seem to be \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", and possibly others, but for this claim, I'm focusing on \"relationship to monarch\".\n\nI need to go through each row in the table and check the value under \"relationship to monarch\" to see if it mentions 'daughter'. Let me list out each row's details:\n\n1. Row 0: Robert Curthose - relationship is 'son'\n2. Row 1: Succession unclear - all columns have the same text, which doesn't specify a gender\n3. Row 2: Robert Curthose again - relationship is 'elder brother'\n4. Row 3: Henry Beauclerc - relationship is 'younger brother'\n5. Row 4: Succession unclear under Henry I - no specific relationship\n6. Row 5: William Adelin - relationship is 'only son'\n7. Row 6: Empress Matilda - relationship is 'only child'\n\nNow, looking for any mention of 'daughter' in the \"relationship to monarch\" column. The term 'daughter' doesn't appear anywhere. Instead, we have entries like 'son', 'elder brother', 'younger brother', and 'only child'. The last one mentions 'Empress Matilda' as an heir, but her relationship is listed as 'only child', not specifically a daughter.\n\nTherefore, since none of the rows indicate that the heir's relationship to the monarch was as a daughter, the claim that there are only three such heirs must be false.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time , in 1082 and 1094\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading through the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has several columns: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, and monarch. There are multiple rows of data here.\n\nThe claim says Robert Curthose was an heir twice in 1082 and 1094. I'll need to check each row where Robert Curthose is listed as the heir and see when he became heir.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: heir is Robert Curthose, became heir in 1066.\nRow 2: Again, Robert Curthose as heir, became heir in 1087.\nRow 3: Henry Beauclerc becomes heir in 1088.\nSo Robert is listed twice, but the years are 1066 and 1087. There's no mention of him being heir in 1082 or 1094.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something? Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066. So that's one time.\nThen there's a row with \"succession unclear\" from 1077 to 1087 under William I.\nNext, Row 2 shows Robert again as heir in 1087 under William II.\n\nSo according to the table, Robert was heir in 1066 and then again in 1087. The years mentioned in the claim are 1082 and 1094, which aren't present here. There's a period of unclear succession between 1077-1087 under William I, but that doesn't list Robert specifically as heir during those exact years.\n\nTherefore, the claim mentions 1082 and 1094, which don't appear in the table for Robert Curthose. So the relevant cells are rows 0 and 2 where he's listed as heir, showing he was heir in 1066 and 1087, not the years stated in the claim.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because Robert wasn't heir in 1082 or 1094 according to the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Robert Curthose was an heir twice in specific years (1082 and 1094), but the table shows he became heir in 1066 and 1087. Therefore, the relevant cells don't support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
