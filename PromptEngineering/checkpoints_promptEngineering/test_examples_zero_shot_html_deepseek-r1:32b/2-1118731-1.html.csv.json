    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions the \"power\" of the 1972 engine and states that it's not given in horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw). So my task is to check if the table provides any information about power for the 1972 model.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: generation, years, engine, power, torque, and induction. The relevant column here is \"power.\" Now, I'll scan through each row to find the one(s) that mention the year 1972.\n\nStarting from the top, the first few rows are under generation 'You'. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Years 1968\u20131969. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: 1969. No.\n- Row 2: 1970. No.\n- Row 3: 1971. Close, but not 1972.\n- Row 4: 1972. Here we go.\n\nSo row index 4 corresponds to the year 1972. Now, looking at the \"power\" column for this row, I see that it's marked as \"-\". This typically indicates missing data or not available.\n\nNext, I should check if any other rows might also pertain to 1972. Scanning further down:\n\n- Row 5: 1973. Not relevant.\n- Rows 6 onwards don't mention 1972 again. So row 4 is the only one for 1972.\n\nSince the power value for 1972 is \"-\", it's not provided in horsepower or kilowatts, which supports the claim that the power isn't given in those units. Therefore, the claim appears to be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that for the year 1972, the power information is missing.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
