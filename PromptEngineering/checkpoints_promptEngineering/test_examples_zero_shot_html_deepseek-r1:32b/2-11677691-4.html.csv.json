The relevant cell under the 'college' column for Connor McGovern says \"missouri.\" Since Missouri is a state, and the claim specifies that he went to college in Missouri, this aligns perfectly with the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.

Scanning down:\n\n- The fifth row (row index 4 since indexing starts at 0) has \"trey depriest\" as the player.\n- In that same row, under the 'position' column, it says \"linebacker.\"\n\nSo, this directly supports the claim because Trey Depriest is listed as a linebacker.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in other rows.

Looking at the table, there's a player named Brandon Mullins in row 9 (since counting starts from 0). Now, I need to check his hometown.\n\nIn the table, the columns are: player, position, school, hometown, college. So for Brandon Mullins, I should look at the 'hometown' column of that row.

I need to determine whether the claim \"kevin mcreynolds be from washington dc and go to college at virginia tech\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the HTML table provided. It has columns for player, position, school, hometown, and college. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information about Kevin McReynolds: his hometown and the college he attended.

Scanning down, I find Kevin McReynolds in row index 1 (since counting starts at 0). Let me note this as relevant because it's where I found his details.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Hometown**: The claim states that Kevin is from Washington DC. Looking at the 'hometown' column for his row, it says \"washington , dc\". That matches exactly with what's claimed, so this part checks out.\n\n2. **College**: The claim mentions he went to college at Virginia Tech. However, in the 'college' column of his row, it shows \"ucla\", not Virginia Tech. This is a discrepancy because UCLA is different from Virginia Tech.\n\nSince one part of the claim (hometown) is correct, but the other (college) isn't, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table data. Therefore, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The relevant cells are in row index 1 under 'player', 'hometown', and 'college' columns.\n- The hometown is correctly listed as Washington DC, but the college is incorrectly stated as Virginia Tech instead of UCLA.\n\nThus, based on the mismatch in the college information, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts two facts about Kevin McReynolds: his hometown being Washington DC and attending Virginia Tech.
