    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 golden globes\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about black actresses and their Golden Globe wins up until 2012. I need to check how many times they've won in that period from the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of nominations and wins for various actresses. Each row has details like year, name, category, movie, and result (whether they won or were nominated).\n\nSo my task is to go through each entry and count how many times the result was \"won\" by black actresses before or in 2012.\n\nLet me start from the top of the table. The first row has the year 1968, but it's not a win\u2014it's a nomination. So I can skip that for now.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n- 1975: Tish Thomas, Best Supporting Actress, \"Coffy\" \u2013 result is nominated. Not a win.\n- 1976: Tish Thomas again, same movie, still nominated. No win here either.\n- 1982: Cicely Tyson wins for Best Actress in \"The Trip to Bountiful.\" That's one win.\n\nNext up:\n\n- 1993: Whoopi Goldberg wins Best Actress for \"The Color Purple.\" Two wins now.\n- 1996: Loretta Devine nominated, no win.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson wins Best Supporting Actress for \"Dreamgirls.\" That's three wins.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- 2007 again: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles is nominated. No win there.\n- 2009: Viola Davis is nominated but didn't win.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique wins Best Supporting Actress for \"Precious.\" Now that's four wins.\n\nThen in 2010, Gabourey Sidibe is nominated but didn't win. In 2011, Halle Berry is nominated again. \n\nLooking at 2012:\n\n- Viola Davis is nominated but doesn't win.\n- Octavia Spencer wins Best Supporting Actress for \"The Help.\" That's the fifth win.\n\nWait a second, I only found five wins up to 2012 according to this table: Cicely Tyson (1982), Whoopi Goldberg (1993), Jennifer Hudson (2007), Mo'Nique (2010), and Octavia Spencer (2012). That's a total of five wins.\n\nBut the claim says seven. Hmm, maybe I missed some entries or perhaps there are other actresses in the table who have won beyond what I counted. Let me go through again carefully.\n\nGoing row by row:\n\nRow 3: 1975 \u2013 nominated\nRow 4: 1976 \u2013 nominated\nRow 5: 1982 \u2013 Cicely Tyson, won (count 1)\nRow 6: 1993 \u2013 Whoopi Goldberg, won (count 2)\nRow 7: 1996 \u2013 Loretta Devine, nominated\nRow 8: 2007 \u2013 Jennifer Hudson, won (count 3)\nRow 9: 2007 \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9, nominated\nRow 10: 2009 \u2013 Viola Davis, nominated\nRow 11: 2010 \u2013 Mo'Nique, won (count 4)\nRow 12: 2010 \u2013 Gabourey Sidibe, nominated\nRow 13: 2011 \u2013 Halle Berry, nominated\nRow 14: 2012 \u2013 Viola Davis, nominated\nRow 15: 2012 \u2013 Octavia Spencer, won (count 5)\n\nSo that's only five wins. The claim states seven, so according to the table provided, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, did I miss any other rows where there was a win? Let me check again. From 1968 onwards:\n\n- Row indices: each row starts at 0 or 1? Looking back, in the JSON example, row_index starts at 0. So let's recount with that in mind.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the provided table structure, each row is part of the tbody and has a specific index. Let me recount based on that:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow indices as per the table (assuming starting from 0):\n\n- Row 0: 1968 \u2013 Tish Thomas \u2013 nominated\n- Row 1: 1975 \u2013 Tish Thomas \u2013 nominated\n- Row 2: 1976 \u2013 Tish Thomas \u2013 nominated\n- Row 3: 1982 \u2013 Cicely Tyson \u2013 won (count 1)\n- Row 4: 1993 \u2013 Whoopi Goldberg \u2013 won (count 2)\n- Row 5: 1996 \u2013 Loretta Devine \u2013 nominated\n- Row 6: 2007 \u2013 Jennifer Hudson \u2013 won (count 3)\n- Row 7: 2007 \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles \u2013 nominated\n- Row 8: 2009 \u2013 Viola Davis \u2013 nominated\n- Row 9: 2010 \u2013 Mo'Nique \u2013 won (count 4)\n- Row 10: 2010 \u2013 Gabourey Sidibe \u2013 nominated\n- Row 11: 2011 \u2013 Halle Berry \u2013 nominated\n- Row 12: 2012 \u2013 Viola Davis \u2013 nominated\n- Row 13: 2012 \u2013 Octavia Spencer \u2013 won (count 5)\n\nSo that's five wins. The claim is seven, so the correct answer should be false because only five are listed here.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are other actresses not in this table who have won before 2012? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think again: Cicely (82), Whoopi (93), Jennifer (07), Mo'Nique (10), Octavia (12) \u2013 that's five. So the claim is wrong, meaning the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that until 2012, black actresses had won seven Golden Globes. However, based on the provided table, only five wins are listed: Cicely Tyson (1982), Whoopi Goldberg (1993), Jennifer Hudson (2007), Mo'Nique (2010), and Octavia Spencer (2012). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. Black actresses had won five Golden Globes by 2012 according to the table, not seven.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The table lists wins for black actresses in the following years: 1982 (Cicely Tyson), 1993 (Whoopi Goldberg), 2007 (Jennifer Hudson), 2010 (Mo'Nique), and 2012 (Octavia Spencer).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"the most common Golden Globe for a black actress to win be for best supporting actress.\" I need to verify if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: Year, Name, Category, Movie/Show, and Result. The rows list various actresses with their respective wins or nominations.\n\nThe claim mentions \"most common,\" so I need to count how many times each category appears where a black actress won. Specifically, it's about best supporting actress versus other categories like best actress in drama or musical/comedy.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 2009 and won in 2012 (row 38). Wait, no\u2014actually, checking row indices, I see that in 2012, Octavia Spencer won Best Supporting Actress for \"The Help.\" Viola Davis was also nominated in the same category but didn't win. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices start at 0. So looking through each row where Result is \"Won\":\n\n- Row 4: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress in 2007.\n- Row 12: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress in 2010.\n- Row 35: Octavia Spencer won Best Supporting Actress in 2012.\n\nSo that's three wins for Best Supporting Actress. \n\nNow, checking other categories where black actresses have won:\n\nLooking for \"Best Actress - Drama\" or \"Best Actress - Musical/Comedy\":\n\n- Halle Berry was nominated but didn't win in both 2002 and 2011.\n- Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical/Comedy in 2007 but didn't win. \n- Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in 2010 but didn't win.\n\nWait, are there any wins outside of Best Supporting Actress?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 4: Jennifer Hudson won for Best Supporting Actress.\nRow 12: Mo'Nique won for Best Supporting Actress.\nRow 35: Octavia Spencer won for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nSo that's three wins in Best Supporting Actress. \n\nIs there any other win for black actresses in different categories?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in 2002 and 2011 but didn't win.\n- Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 2003 (row 24), which she didn't win.\n- Viola Davis was nominated multiple times but didn't win except once in supporting.\n\nWait, actually, did any black actress win a Golden Globe in Best Actress categories?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 38: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in 2011 but didn't win. \n\nSo it seems that all the wins by black actresses in this table are for Best Supporting Actress. There are no instances where a black actress won Best Actress - Drama or Musical/Comedy.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, all the Golden Globe wins by black actresses listed here are for Best Supporting Actress. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to verify this claim about the longest drought between nominations in the given table. The claim says there was a six-year gap between 1962-68 and 1975-81. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's meant by \"drought.\" It refers to a period with no nominations. So, I'll check the years when nominations occurred in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the earliest nomination is in 1962 (row 0). Then there are entries every year until maybe 1975? Wait, let me list all the years from the table:\n\n- 1962\n- 1968 (I think row 1)\n- Then I see a jump to 1975, which is in row 4. \n\nWait, how many years are between 1968 and 1975? That's 7 years apart because from 1968 to 1975 is 7 years (including both start and end). But the claim says a 6-year gap between 1962-68 and 1975-81. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the drought refers to no nominations in certain periods. Let me list all the nomination years:\n\nRows with years:\n0: 1962\n1: 1968\n4: 1975\n5: 1975 (another entry)\nThen, later rows have years like 1981 (row 7), but looking at the table data provided, I don't see any nominations between 1962 and 1975 except for 1968. So from 1962 to 1975, there are only two nomination years: 1962 and 1968. Then the next is 1975.\n\nWait, that means between 1968 and 1975, there's a gap of 7 years (from 1968 to 1975). But the claim says the longest drought was 6 years. So maybe I'm miscalculating or misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to no nominations between 1962 and 1968? That can't be right because there's a nomination in 1968. Alternatively, maybe looking at when someone was nominated again after 1962. Let me check each row.\n\nWait, let me list all the years in order:\n\nRow 0: 1962\nRow 1: 1968\nRow 4: 1975\nRow 5: 1975\nRow 7: 1981\n\nSo from 1968 to 1975 is a gap of 7 years. The claim says the longest drought was six years between 1962-68 and 1975-81.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their calculation. Because from 1962 to 1968 is just 6 years apart (from 1962 to 1968 inclusive would be 7 years). Wait no, if you're measuring the gap between nominations, it's from when one ends to the next starts.\n\nSo, from 1962 to 1968: that's a 6-year period with only two nominations. But in reality, there was a nomination every six years? Or perhaps the claim is saying there were no nominations for six consecutive years between certain periods.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe claim states that the longest drought was six years between two periods: 1962-68 and 1975-81. So, it's suggesting that from 1962 to 1968 (a period of six years), there were no nominations? But in the table, there are nominations in 1962 and 1968.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is incorrect because the data shows nominations in 1962 and 1968. Therefore, the gap between those two is only one year (since they're consecutive). Alternatively, maybe the user meant that from 1968 to 1975, there was a gap of seven years without any nominations.\n\nBut according to the table data provided, I can see that in 1975, there are nominations again. So between 1968 and 1975, the gap is actually 7 years. Therefore, the claim mentions six years as the longest drought, but in reality, it's seven years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count the years from 1962 to 1975:\n\n- 1962: nomination\n- 1963: none?\nLooking at the rows, after 1968 (row 1), next is row 4 in 1975. So between 1968 and 1975, that's a gap of seven years.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is referring to two periods: from 1962-68 (which includes nominations) as one period, and then another from 1975-81. Maybe they are considering these as blocks, but I'm not sure how that relates to droughts.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in their claim. The table shows nominations in 1962, 1968, 1975, and 1981. So between 1968 and 1975 is seven years without any other nominations except those two points.\n\nSo the longest drought would actually be seven years, not six as claimed. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that there was a six-year gap between 1962-68 and 1975-81 is incorrect based on the given data. The table shows nominations in 1962, 1968, 1975, and 1981. The longest period without nominations is actually seven years between 1968 and 1975.\n\n**Answer:** No, the claim is incorrect.",

It shows Whoopi Goldberg winning for \"The Color Purple\" in 1986. That's correct.\n\nNext, I'll scan other rows to see if there are any other wins in the same category.\n\n- In Row 45 (assuming it's beyond the given data), I notice Viola Davis was nominated in 2012 for \"The Help,\" but she didn't win.\n- Halle Berry had a nomination in 2002 and 2011, but no wins mentioned.\n- Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated in 2007, but not in the drama category.\n\nWait, looking again at Row 39 (if it's within the given data), Viola Davis was nominated in 2012 for \"The Help\" as Best Actress - Drama. She wasn't the winner though; Octavia Spencer won in that year as Best Supporting Actress.\n\nSo, checking all rows where 'Award Category' is 'Best Actress - Drama', only Whoopi Goldberg has a win in 1986.

The claim is that from the years 2000 to 2012, there have been 6 years where a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe.

The key columns here would be 'Year' (to check the time frame) and 'Category' or 'Role' since we're focusing on acting nominations for actresses. Each row represents a nomination or win by a black actress in these years.\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the necessary information:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** I need to filter rows where the year falls between 2000 and 2012. Scanning through, I find entries from 2002 up to 2012.\n\n2. **List of Years with Nominations:**\n   - 2002: Halle Berry in 'Monster's Ball'\n   - 2003: Queen Latifah in 'Chicago'\n   - 2007: Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n   - 2009: Viola Davis\n   - 2010: Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe\n   - 2011: Halle Berry again\n   - 2012: Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer\n\n3. **Years in the Range Without Nominations:** The range is from 2000 to 2012, which includes 13 years (2000-2012 inclusive).

The claim is stating that there are more than two such periods (drought spells) that each last more than six years.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various years and whether Black actresses were nominated or not. My first step is to identify all the years where Black actresses received nominations. Then, I can look for gaps between these years to determine if there are any periods of over six years without a nomination.\n\nLet's go through each year in the table:\n\n1. 1932: Hattie McDaniel - Best Actress Nominee (Drama). So this is a nomination year.\n2. 1940: No Black actress nominations.\n3. 1954: Juanita Moore - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. Another nomination year.\n4. 1968: Diahann Carroll - Best Actress Nominee (Drama). Nomination year.\n5. 1971: Cicely Tyson - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. Nomination year.\n6. 1973: Butterfly McQueen - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. Nomination year.\n7. 1982: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. Nomination year.\n8. 1984: Oprah Winfrey - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. Nomination year.\n9. 1985: Debbie Allen - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. Nomination year.\n10. 1992: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Supporting Actress Winner. Nomination year.\n11. 1993: Jada Pinkett Smith - Not listed, but looking at the table, I think this might be a typo since she's more active later. Wait, in the table provided by the user, after 1985 it jumps to 2007 with Jennifer Hudson winning Best Supporting Actress. So between 1985 and 2007, are there any nominations?\n\nWait, let me correct that. The table actually starts from 1932 and goes up, but in the initial table, after 1985, it jumps to 2002 with Halle Berry nominated for Best Actress (Drama). Then 2003: Queen Latifah - Best Supporting Actress Nominee. 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated as Best Actress (Musical or Comedy). Then 2010: Viola Davis - Best Supporting Actress Nominee, Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress for \"Precious.\" In 2011: Halle Berry - Best Actress (Drama) nominee. 2012: Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer were both nominated.\n\nSo the gaps I need to look at are between the nomination years:\n\n- Between 1932 and 1940: There's a gap of 8 years without any nominations.\n- Then from 1954 to 1968, that's a 14-year gap with no nominations. Wait, but in 1954 there was a nomination, then the next is in 1968, so 1968 - 1954 = 14 years apart.\n- From 1968 to 1971: Only 3 years, not a drought.\n- 1971 to 1973: 2 years.\n- 1973 to 1982: 9 years without nominations. So that's another gap of over six years.\n- 1982 to 1984: Only 2 years, not a drought.\n- Then from 1985 to 2002: That's 17 years without any nominations listed here. Wait, but in the table provided by the user, after 1985, the next nomination is Halle Berry in 2002. So that's a gap of 17 years between 1985 and 2002.\n- Then from 2003 to 2007: Only 4 years.\n- From 2007 onward, there are continuous nominations each year until at least 2012.\n\nSo now, let's identify the drought spells longer than six years:\n\n1. Between 1954 and 1968: That's a gap of 14 years without any nominations after Juanita Moore in 1954.\n2. Between 1973 and 1982: That's a gap of 9 years.\nWait, but from 1973 to 1982 is actually a span where there were nominations in 1968, 1971, 1973, so between 1973 and the next nomination in 1982, that's 9 years. But I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the nomination years:\n\n- 1932\n- 1940: No nominations? Wait, no, 1932 is Hattie McDaniel, then in 1940, there's no Black actress nominated. Then in 1954, Juanita Moore was nominated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the table starts with 1932, then skips to 1940, which actually doesn't have a nomination for a Black actress. Wait, no: Hattie McDaniel was in 1932, but she won, so that's a nomination. Then in 1940, according to the table, there are no Black actresses nominated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me list all the years with nominations:\n\n- 1932: Hattie McDaniel\n- 1954: Juanita Moore\n- 1968: Diahann Carroll\n- 1971: Cicely Tyson\n- 1973: Butterfly McQueen\n- 1982: Whoopi Goldberg\n- 1984: Oprah Winfrey\n- 1985: Debbie Allen\n- 2002: Halle Berry\n- 2003: Queen Latifah\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n- 2010: Viola Davis and Mo'Nique\n- 2011: Halle Berry\n- 2012: Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer\n\nSo between these, the gaps are:\n\n- From 1932 to 1954: That's a gap of 22 years without any nominations for Black actresses.\nWait, but in 1940, there was no nomination. So from 1932 (nomination) to 1954 (next nomination), that's 22 years with only one nomination in between? Wait no: Hattie McDaniel won in 1932, then the next nomination for a Black actress is Juanita Moore in 1954. So that's a gap of 22 years without any nominations except for 1940 where none were given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The table lists Hattie McDaniel in 1932 as a nominee, but then the next Black actress nomination is Juanita Moore in 1954. So that's a gap of 22 years between 1932 and 1954 without any nominations.\n\nSimilarly, from 1973 to 1982: That's a span where no one was nominated until Whoopi Goldberg in 1982. So 1982 - 1973 = 9 years without nominations.\n\nFrom 1985 to 2002: 17 years without any nominations listed between Debbie Allen in 1985 and Halle Berry in 2002.\n\nSo that's three gaps longer than six years:\n\n1. 1932-1954: 22 years\n2. 1973-1982: 9 years\n3. 1985-2002: 17 years\n\nWait, but the claim says \"more than 2 drought spell span more than 6 year.\" So if there are three such periods longer than six years without nominations, then the claim is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each period:\n\n- After 1932, next nomination in 1954: that's a gap of 22 years (from 1933 to 1954), so that's one drought spell longer than six years.\n- Then from 1973 to 1982: that's a gap of 9 years, another drought spell.\n- From 1985 to 2002: that's 17 years, another drought spell.\n\nSo three periods where there were more than six consecutive years without nominations. Therefore, the claim is correct because there are more than two such periods.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm considering too many periods. Let me think again:\n\n- From Hattie McDaniel in 1932 to Juanita Moore in 1954: that's a gap of 22 years without any nominations for Black actresses.\n- Then from Butterfly McQueen (1973) to Whoopi Goldberg (1982): that's nine years between 1974 and 1982. Wait, no, because 1973 is the last nomination before 1982.\n\nWait, actually, after 1973, the next nomination was in 1982, so that's a gap of eight years (from 1974 to 1982). So nine years without nominations between 1973 and 1982.\n\nThen from 1985 to 2002: That's a span where no Black actresses were nominated for the next 17 years until Halle Berry in 2002.\n\nSo that's three periods longer than six years without nominations. Therefore, the answer is yes, there have been more than two such periods.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there have been more than two instances where a drought of over six years occurred between nominations for Black actresses at the Oscars. By examining the timeline of Oscar nominations, we can identify three distinct periods longer than six years without any Black actress being nominated:\n\n1. **From 1932 to 1954**: Hattie McDaniel's win in 1932 was followed by a 22-year gap until Juanita Moore's nomination in 1954.\n2. **From 1973 to 1982**: Butterfly McQueen's nomination in 1973 was not matched until Whoopi Goldberg's nomination in 1982, a gap of nine years.\n3. **From 1985 to 2002**: Debbie Allen's nomination in 1985 was followed by a 17-year drought until Halle Berry's win in 2002.\n\nThus, the claim is accurate as there have indeed been more than two such periods exceeding six years without nominations for Black actresses at the Oscars.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the award for best actress in comedy have only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that only Whoopi Goldberg has won the Best Actress in Comedy award, and she did so in 1988. \n\nNow, I'll look at the table to see if there are any entries related to Best Actress in Comedy or a similar category. The columns in the table include Year, Title, Actor/Actress, Category, and Result.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find mentions of \"Best Actress\" categories. Let me list out the relevant rows:\n\n1. Row 3: Whoopi Goldberg, Best Supporting Actress for Sister Act, Nominated.\n2. Row 4: Halle Berry, Best Actress - Drama, Monster's Ball, Nominated.\n3. Row 5: Queen Latifah, Best Supporting Actress, Chicago, Nominated.\n4. Row 6: Jennifer Hudson, Best Supporting Actress, Dreamgirls, Won.\n5. Row 7: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Best Actress - Musical or Comedy, Dreamgirls, Nominated.\n6. Row 8: Viola Davis, Best Supporting Actress, Doubt, Nominated.\n7. Row 9: Mo'Nique, Best Supporting Actress, Precious..., Won.\n8. Row 10: Gabourey Sidibe, Best Actress - Drama, Precious..., Nominated.\n9. Row 11: Halle Berry, Best Actress - Drama, Frankie and Alice, Nominated.\n10. Row 12: Viola Davis, Best Actress - Drama, The Help, Nominated.\n11. Row 13: Octavia Spencer, Best Supporting Actress, The Help, Won.\n\nWait a minute, I don't see any entry where someone won Best Actress in Comedy or Musical. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the Category column:\n- Most entries are either Best Actress - Drama, Best Supporting Actress, or Best Actress - Musical or Comedy (like Beyonc\u00e9's nomination). \n\nSo, for \"Best Actress in Comedy\", the only relevant row is Row 7: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated but didn't win. There's no entry where someone won that category.\n\nThe claim mentions Whoopi Goldberg winning in 1988, but looking at the table, I don't see any row with 1988 or a Best Actress - Comedy win by her. The closest is her Best Supporting Actress nomination in 1992 for Sister Act (Row 3).\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data because there's no record of Whoopi Goldberg winning Best Actress in Comedy in 1988, and the table doesn't show anyone else winning that award either. However, since the claim is about her being the only winner, but she didn't even win it, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Whoopi Goldberg was the sole winner of Best Actress in Comedy in 1988. Checking the table, there's no entry for a Best Actress - Comedy award won by anyone, including Goldberg. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the least common Golden Globe category for a Black actress to win is Best Actress. That means among all the categories Black actresses have won, Best Actress has the fewest wins compared to other categories like Best Supporting Actress or others.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an award given to a Black actress. The columns are Year, Name, Category, Movie/Show, and Result. So I need to count how many times Black actresses have won in the Best Actress category versus other categories.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 1968: Diahann Carroll, Best Actress, \"Julia\" - Won\n2. 1973: Cicely Tyson, Best Supporting Actress, \"Sounder\" - Won\n3. 1982: Tina Turner, Best Actress, \"Madame X\" - Nominated\n4. 1983: Whoopi Goldberg, Best Supporting Actress, \"The Color Purple\" - Nominated\n5. 1984: Whoopi Goldberg, Best Actress, \"Soap\" - Won\n6. 1987: Debbie Allen, Best Director, \"Fame\" - Nominated\n7. 1990: Whitney Houston, Best Actress, \"The Bodyguard\" - Nominated\n8. 1993: Thandiwe Newton, Best Supporting Actress, \"Nell\" - Nominated\n9. 2002: Halle Berry, Best Actress, \"Monster's Ball\" - Nominated\n10. 2007: Jennifer Hudson, Best Supporting Actress, \"Dreamgirls\" - Won\n11. 2007: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Best Actress, \"Dreamgirls\" - Nominated\n12. 2010: Viola Davis, Best Supporting Actress, \"Doubt\" - Nominated\n13. 2010: Mo'Nique, Best Supporting Actress, \"Precious\" - Won\n14. 2010: Gabourey Sidibe, Best Actress, \"Precious\" - Nominated\n15. 2011: Halle Berry, Best Actress, \"Frankie and Alice\" - Nominated\n16. 2012: Viola Davis, Best Actress, \"The Help\" - Nominated\n17. 2012: Octavia Spencer, Best Supporting Actress, \"The Help\" - Won\n\nNow, focusing on the wins:\n\n- Best Actress Wins:\n  - Diahann Carroll (1968)\n  - Whoopi Goldberg (1984)\n  \nThat's two wins in Best Actress.\n\nOther Category Wins (Best Supporting Actress):\n- Cicely Tyson (1973) \u2013 Wait, no, she was nominated but didn't win. She won at the Oscars but not here.\nWait, looking back: 1973, Cicely Tyson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and it says \"Won\". So that's a win.\n\nOther wins:\n- Thandiwe Newton (1987) \u2013 No, she was nominated but didn't win. Wait, no, in the table, for 1987: Thandiwe Newton was Nominated.\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recount:\n\nLooking again at each row and their results:\n\n- 1968: Diahann Carroll - Best Actress - Won\n- 1973: Cicely Tyson - Best Supporting Actress - Won\n- 1982: Tina Turner - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 1983: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated\n- 1984: Whoopi Goldberg - Best Actress - Won\n- 1987: Debbie Allen - Best Director - Nominated\n- 1990: Whitney Houston - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 1993: Thandiwe Newton - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated\n- 2002: Halle Berry - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson - Best Supporting Actress - Won\n- 2007: Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 2010: Viola Davis - Best Supporting Actress - Nominated\n- 2010: Mo'Nique - Best Supporting Actress - Won\n- 2010: Gabourey Sidibe - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 2011: Halle Berry - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 2012: Viola Davis - Best Actress - Nominated\n- 2012: Octavia Spencer - Best Supporting Actress - Won\n\nSo the wins are:\n\nBest Actress:\n- Diahann Carroll (1968)\n- Whoopi Goldberg (1984)\n\nThat's two wins.\n\nBest Supporting Actress Wins:\n- Cicely Tyson (1973)\n- Jennifer Hudson (2007)\n- Mo'Nique (2010)\n- Octavia Spencer (2012)\n\nThat's four wins in Best Supporting Actress and one win in Best Director by Debbie Allen, but she was nominated, not won. Wait no, looking at the table again: 1987 - Debbie Allen, Best Director, \"Fame\" - Nominated. So she didn't win.\n\nSo only two Best Actress wins versus four Best Supporting Actress wins. Therefore, Best Actress has fewer wins than Best Supporting Actress for Black actresses in this data.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other categories where they have won. From the table, I see:\n\n- 1968: Best Actress\n- 1973: Best Supporting Actress\n- 1984: Best Actress\n- 2007: Best Supporting Actress\n- 2010: Best Supporting Actress\n- 2012: Best Supporting Actress\n\nSo only two categories are present in the wins: Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn this context, the claim says that \"the least common\" category is Best Actress. Since there are fewer wins (two) in Best Actress compared to four in Best Supporting Actress, it suggests that Best Actress is indeed less common as a winning category for Black actresses in this data set.\n\nHowever, I should consider if other categories exist where they might have won but aren't listed here. The table only includes entries up to 2012, so maybe after that there are more wins. But based on the given data, Best Actress has fewer wins than Best Supporting Actress. Therefore, the claim seems accurate within the scope of this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true based on the provided data. Black actresses have won two Golden Globes in the Best Actress category and four in Best Supporting Actress, making Best Actress the least common category for their wins.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is true. Among the categories listed, Black actresses have fewer wins in Best Actress compared to Best Supporting Actress. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Categories:** The table includes awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, with some entries for other roles or categories.\n\n2. **Count Wins by Category:**\n   - **Best Actress Wins:**\n     - Diahann Carroll (1968)\n     - Whoopi Goldberg (1984)\n     - Total: 2 wins\n   - **Best Supporting Actress Wins:**\n     - Cicely Tyson (1973)\n     - Jennifer Hudson (2007)\n     - Mo'Nique (2010)\n     - Octavia Spencer (2012)\n     - Total: 4 wins\n\n3. **Compare Frequencies:** Best Actress has fewer wins (2) compared to Best Supporting Actress (4).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, Best Actress is the least common category for Black actresses' Golden Globe wins based on this data.\n\n**Answer:** True",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"between 2001 and 2011 there be 5 year where a black actress be not nominate for any award.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked here. We're looking at the years between 2001 and 2011. That would include the years 2001 through 2011, inclusive, right? So that's 11 years in total.\n\nThe claim is stating that there are five years within this span where no black actress was nominated for any award. I need to check each year from 2001 to 2011 and see how many of those years had zero nominations by black actresses.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row and note the years when a nomination occurred. \n\nStarting with 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress in Drama for \"Monster's Ball.\" So that's a nomination in 2002.\n\nIn 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for \"Chicago.\" Another nomination here.\n\n2007 had two nominations: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress for \"Dreamgirls,\" and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress in Musical/Comedy for the same movie. So definitely a nomination year.\n\n2009: Viola Davis was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for \"Doubt.\" That's another year with a nomination.\n\nIn 2010, there were two nominations: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress for \"Precious,\" and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress in Drama for the same film. So 2010 is definitely a nomination year.\n\n2011 saw Halle Berry being nominated again for Best Actress in Drama for \"Frankie and Alice.\" Another nomination year.\n\nNow, let's note which years between 2001 and 2011 are covered: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.\n\nFrom the table, I can see nominations in 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. So that's six years with nominations. That leaves 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008 as the years without any nominations listed in the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says there are five such years where no black actress was nominated. According to the table, that's four years (2004, 2005, 2006, 2008) without nominations. Therefore, the claim is overstating it by one year. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I missed any rows for those years. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 2002: Yes, nomination.\n- 2003: Nomination.\n- 2004: No entry in the table.\n- 2005: No entry.\n- 2006: No entry.\n- 2007: Nomination.\n- 2008: No entry.\n- 2009: Nomination.\n- 2010: Nomination.\n- 2011: Nomination.\n\nSo that's five years without nominations? Wait, no. From the table, between 2001 and 2011, the nominated years are 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011\u2014six years. The remaining five years (2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and perhaps 2001) might not have nominations.\n\nWait, the table starts in 1998, so I need to check all the rows between 2001 and 2011. Let me list them:\n\nLooking at each row's year:\n- 1998: pam grier nominated\n- 2002: halle berry\n- 2003: queen latifah\n- 2007: jennifer hudson and beyonc\u00e9\n- 2009: viola davis\n- 2010: mo'nikue and gabourey\n- 2011: halle berry\n\nSo between 2001 and 2011, the years without nominations in the table are 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008. That's four years.\n\nWait, but does 2001 have any nominations? The table doesn't show any for 2001, so that would be another year without a nomination. So in total, that's five years: 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct\u2014there are five years between 2001 and 2011 where no black actress was nominated for any award as per the table.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the table indeed doesn't have any entries for those years. Let me go through each year from 2001 to 2011:\n\n- 2001: No entry.\n- 2002: Yes.\n- 2003: Yes.\n- 2004: No.\n- 2005: No.\n- 2006: No.\n- 2007: Yes.\n- 2008: No.\n- 2009: Yes.\n- 2010: Yes.\n- 2011: Yes.\n\nSo that's five years without nominations (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008). Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the table provided. So the answer should be that the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that between 2001 and 2011, there were five years where no black actress received a nomination. Based on the provided table:\n\n- **Nominated Years**: 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 (6 years)\n- **Years Without Nominations**: 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 (5 years)\n\nThus, the claim is accurate as there are five years without nominations.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is true. There were five years between 2001 and 2011 where no black actress was nominated for any award based on the provided data.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",
