    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a table of matches and a claim about Librado Andrade losing five fights, one being against Lucian Bute. My task is to verify if the claim is true or false based on the given data.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has several columns: Outcome (win/loss), Opponent's name, Method (how the fight ended like KO, UD), Round details, and Date. The rows represent individual matches.\n\nThe claim mentions that the match against Lucian Bute is one of five fights Librado Andrade lost. So I need to check two things:\n1. Is there a record of Librado Andrade fighting Lucian Bute in the table?\n2. How many losses does Librado Andrade have according to the table?\n\nLooking through each row, I see that all entries show \"win\" as the outcome. This immediately suggests that in this dataset, Librado hasn't lost any matches. But wait, maybe he's not listed here or perhaps only some of his fights are included.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the table doesn't list any losses for Andrade. All outcomes are wins. So if all the entries are wins, there can't be five losses recorded here. Therefore, the claim that he lost five fights isn't supported by this data. Additionally, there's no mention of Lucian Bute in the opponent column, so the specific match against him isn't present either.\n\nSo, putting it together: The table shows all wins for Andrade and doesn't include a loss to Bute or any other fighter. Therefore, the claim can't be supported by this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table with several rows and columns, each representing different aspects of fights, I think. The columns seem to be things like who won or lost, maybe where it took place, date, etc., but without seeing the headers, it's a bit tricky.\n\nThe claim is: \"Librado Andrade win the fight against Otis Grant but lose the fight against Mikkel Kessler.\" My task is to check this claim against the table and determine if it's true or false. If it's true, I should output TRUE with relevant cells; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the table data provided. The table starts from row index 0. Each row represents a fight event. Let me look through each row to find any mention of Librado Andrade and his fights against Otis Grant and Mikkel Kessler.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"otis grant\". The result for this row is a win, I think, because in the first cell under 'Result' it's listed as \"win\".\n\nWait, no, looking back, each row seems to have columns like Result, Opponent, and possibly other details. For example, the first row (row index 0) has \"You are tasked with...\" which might be a description of the task rather than actual data.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The table provided is actually in HTML format. Let me parse it properly. Each <tr> represents a row, and each <td> within is a cell. But without the headers, mapping them to column names is tricky. However, from the context of the problem, the columns are likely \"Result\", \"Opponent\", \"Date\", etc.\n\nWait, in the instructions, when providing the example JSON response, the keys were \"Revenue\" and \"Employees\". That was an example though. In our case, looking at the sample data, it's about fights, so perhaps the relevant columns are like 'Winner' or 'Loser', Opponent, Date, etc.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, each row seems to have four cells: maybe Result, Opponent, some other info, and Date. For example:\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- \"You are tasked with...\" might be a header or description.\n- Then, rows like:\n  - \"win\", \"otis grant\", \"1999-08-14\"\n  - \"win\", \"bernard temple\", etc.\n\nWait no, looking back at the HTML table, each row under tbody starts with <tr> and has several <td>s. Let me count:\n\nThe first data row (assuming after headers) is:\n\n<td>win</td>\n<td>otis grant</td>\n<td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n<td>july 10, 2023</td>\n\nWait, but in the provided table HTML, it's a bit different. Let me look again.\n\nThe user provided an HTML snippet where each row has several cells. From the data given, for example:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>win</td>\n   <td>otis grant</td>\n   <td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n   <td>july 10, 2023</td>\n</tr>\n\nSo each row has four cells: Result, Opponent, Location, Date.\n\nBut in the specific data provided by the user, looking at their HTML snippet, the table rows are as follows:\n\n- Each row starts with \"win\" or \"loss\", then opponent name, some other details (like location and date).\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the first data row is:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>win</td>\n   <td>otis grant</td>\n   <td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n   <td>july 10, 2023</td>\n</tr>\n\nWait, no, in the provided table by the user, it's a different context. Let me parse correctly.\n\nThe user provided an HTML table with rows where each row has four cells:\n\nFor example:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>win</td>\n   <td>otis grant</td>\n   <td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n   <td>july 10, 2023</td>\n</tr>\n\nBut in the actual data provided by the user, each row is structured as:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>win</td>\n   <td>otis grant</td>\n   <td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n   <td>july 10, 2023</td>\n</tr>\n\nWait, no. Let me look again at the user's table.\n\nThe table starts with tbody and several tr tags. Each tr has four td cells:\n\nFor example, first row:\n\n<td>win</td>\n<td>otis grant</td>\n<td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n<td>july 10, 2023</td>\n\nSo the columns are: Result, Opponent, Location, Date.\n\nNow, the claim is about Librado Andrade. I need to check if there's any row where the opponent is Otis Grant and the result is a win for Librado, and another row where the opponent is Mikkel Kessler and the result is a loss.\n\nBut in the provided table data, I see rows like:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>win</td>\n   <td>otis grant</td>\n   <td>mexico city, mexico</td>\n   <td>july 10, 2023</td>\n</tr>\n\nAssuming this is the data, then Librado Andrade's fight against Otis Grant resulted in a win. Now, I need to check if he lost to Mikkel Kessler.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\nI see other opponents like \"bernard temple\", \"mexican national\", etc., but no mention of Mikkel Kessler. So, there's no row where the opponent is Mikkel Kessler and the result is a loss for Librado Andrade.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Librado Andrade won against Otis Grant (which he did) but lost to Mikkel Kessler cannot be verified as true because there's no data on a fight between him and Mikkel Kessler in the provided table. Hence, the second part of the claim is unverified, making the entire statement possibly false based on the given data.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is partially correct (he did win against Otis Grant) but since there's no information about a loss to Mikkel Kessler, we can't confirm the full claim. Therefore, the overall statement might be considered false because it includes an unverified part.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The table does not contain any entries where Librado Andrade fought against Mikkel Kessler, so his loss in that fight cannot be verified.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is \"librado andrade never win the fight against paul jones.\" I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The main points are:\n\n1. **Liberato Andrade**: This refers to a person, likely a fighter.\n2. **Never win the fight against Paul Jones**: The claim states that in all their fights, Liberto Andrade did not win any against Paul Jones.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has columns: Outcome, Opponent, Method, Round, and Date. Each row represents a fight outcome for Liberto Andrade.\n\nTo verify if he ever won against Paul Jones, I need to check if there's any entry in the table where:\n\n- **Outcome** is \"win.\"\n- The **Opponent** is \"Paul Jones.\"\n\nSo, my approach will be:\n\n1. **Scan each row** of the table for entries where the Opponent is Paul Jones.\n2. For those rows, check the Outcome column to see if it's a win.\n\nLet me start by looking through each opponent in the table:\n\n- The first few opponents are Harold Lowe, Bernard Temple, Terry Smith, etc., none of whom are Paul Jones.\n- Scanning further down, I find a row with \"Paul Jones\" as the Opponent. Let's see what the Outcome is for that fight.\n\nLooking at the row where Opponent is Paul Jones:\n\n- **Outcome**: The cell under \"Outcome\" says \"win.\" \n\nSo, according to this table, Liberto Andrade did win against Paul Jones in one of his fights. That directly contradicts the claim which states he never won against Paul Jones.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I misread something. Let's find the exact row:\n\nLooking back, here's the relevant row from the table:\n\n| Outcome | Opponent          | Method | Round | Date       |\n|---------|-------------------|--------|-------|------------|\n| win     | Paul Jones        | ko     | 4 (4) | 2000-02-03 |\n\nYes, it clearly shows that Liberto Andrade won against Paul Jones. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's at least one instance where he won against Paul Jones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"Librado Andrade have a fight with Terry Smith after the fight with Marcus Harvey.\" Hmm, wait, actually, looking back at the table, I don't see any fights involving Librado Andrade. The names listed are different boxers like Terry Smith, Marcus Harvey, etc., but no mention of Librado Andrade. So that's already a red flag.\n\nThe claim says there was a fight between Librado Andrade and Terry Smith after his fight with Marcus Harvey. But since the table doesn't include Librado Andrade at all, I can't find any rows where he's involved. \n\nLooking through each row, Terry Smith does have a fight on 2000-04-13, as per row index 28. He fought against Terry Smith? Wait no, the opponent is Terry Smith in that row, but Librado Andrade isn't there. The opponent column for Terry Smith's fight is Paul Jones earlier. So I don't see any connection between Librado Andrade and Terry Smith.\n\nAlso, Marcus Harvey has fights on 2000-05-18 (row index 30) against Bernard Temple, and another on 1999-08-14 (row index 32) where he fought someone via UD. But again, no Librado Andrade involved.\n\nSo without any entries for Librado Andrade in the table, I can't verify a fight between him and Terry Smith after Marcus Harvey's fight.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"Librado Andrade lose the fight against Otis Grant but win the fight against Mikkel Kessler.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, which has columns like \"Opponent,\" \"Result,\" and others. The rows represent each fight with details about who fought whom and the outcome.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific fights:\n1. Librado Andrade losing to Otis Grant.\n2. Librado Andrade winning against Mikkel Kessler.\n\nI'll start by checking if there's a row where Librado Andrade is listed as fighting Otis Grant. Scanning through the table, I see that in the first row (row index 0), the opponent is \"otis grant.\" The result column shows \"win\" for this fight. Wait, does that mean Librado won or lost? Hmm, the claim says he lost against Otis Grant, but according to this cell, it's a win. That would contradict the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I'll look for any mention of Mikkel Kessler in the opponents' column. Going through all rows, none of them have \"mikkel kessler\" listed as an opponent. So there's no record of Librado fighting Mikkel Kessler here, making the second part of the claim unsupported by the table.\n\nSince the first part is incorrect (Librado won against Otis Grant) and the second part isn't present in the data, the overall claim doesn't hold true based on the information given.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Librado Andrade won against Otis Grant and there's no record of a fight against Mikkel Kessler.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the match against lucian bute be the only fight that librado andrade lose\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check what information is given in the table. The table lists various matches with details like opponent name, result (win or loss), method of victory, round, time, and date. Each row represents a match that Librado Andrade participated in.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. There's a specific match against Lucian Bute.\n2. This is the only fight that Andrade lost.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll start by searching for any entry where the opponent is Lucian Bute. Scanning through all the rows under \"Opponent,\" I don't see \"Lucian Bute\" listed anywhere. The opponents mentioned are names like George Johnson, Paul Jones, Terry Smith, etc., but none of them match Lucian Bute.\n\nSince there's no row in the table with Lucian Bute as the opponent, that means the table doesn't provide any information about a fight against him. Without this data point, I can't confirm whether Andrade lost to Bute or not.\n\nNext, looking at all the results in the \"Result\" column, every entry shows \"win.\" There's no instance of \"loss\" for Librado Andrade in this table. This implies that, according to the provided information, he hasn't lost any fights listed here. However, since the claim refers to a specific loss against Bute which isn't present in the table, I can't validate whether that particular match exists or not.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the data presented, there's no evidence supporting the claim that Andrade lost to Lucian Bute or that this was his only loss. In fact, all listed fights show wins, suggesting he hasn't lost any of them in the provided records.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim isn't supported by the table. The relevant cells would include checking each opponent name and result to see if there's a loss against Bute.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}",

The relevant columns are 'Fighter', 'Opponent', 'Round', 'Method'.\n\nLooking down the list:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is 'Librado Andrade'. He won against 'Sheridan Page'.\n- ...\n- Scanning through, in row 28, I see that Paul Jones is the opponent. The outcome shows Librado Andrade won with a KO in round 4.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other fights between them. Continuing to look for both fighters:\n\nI don't find another entry where they fought each other. So Librado Andrade has one win against Paul Jones.\n\nBut the claim says he \"win all his fight\" against Paul Jones.

The claim says: \"the most recent fight that librado andrade won be on 2011-08-27.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is about. It's talking about Librado Andrade winning a fight on August 27, 2011. So I'm looking for any entries in the table that mention Librado Andrade and check if his most recent win was indeed on that date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see multiple rows with different fighters and dates. Each row has columns like Date, Opponent, Method, Round, Time, etc. But none of these rows have \"Librado Andrade\" as an opponent or participant in any fight. The opponents listed are names like \"harold lowe,\" \"jimmy hagar,\" \"bernard temple,\" and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if Librado Andrade is the fighter whose wins are being listed here. The table's first row mentions \"Librado Andrade\" as the main fighter since it's in the header, but all the opponents under that are other fighters he has fought against. So each row represents a fight where Librado Andrade was the winner.\n\nSo to find his most recent fight, I should look for the latest date in this table. The dates go from 1999 up to 2013 or so. Let me check the last few entries.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- The last row has a date of \"1999-08-14\" where he fought Marcus Harvey via UD.\nWait, but that's in 1999, which is way before 2011. So maybe I missed something. Let me check all the dates.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: 2013-04-27 (Librado Andrade vs. Eric Benito Tzand)\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the table seems to have a mix of dates from as early as 1999 up to 2013.\n\nBut wait, in my initial look, I thought the last row was 1999, but perhaps there are later entries. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- The first few rows go into 2013 (e.g., \"2013-04-27\"), then earlier dates before that, like \"2011-08-27\" is mentioned in a row where he fought against someone. Wait, no\u2014looking back at the data:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The table provided actually ends with rows from 1999 onwards, but looking more carefully, there's a row towards the middle with \"2013-04-27\" and another with \"2011-08-27.\" Let me confirm.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow numbers are tricky because I don't have exact counts. But as per the data provided, each <tr> is a new row starting from index 0.\n\nThe last few rows show dates in 1999 and earlier. Wait, perhaps the table isn't sorted by date? Or maybe it's presented with the latest fights first.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table seems to be in order from top to bottom as per the data given, but when I look, the earliest date is at the top, and later dates are towards the middle. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- The first row after the header is \"2013-04-27\" vs Eric Benito Tzand\nThen \"2011-08-27\" vs someone else.\n\nBut wait, in the data provided, the table actually starts with \"Librado Andrade\" as the fighter and lists his opponents. Let me recount:\n\nThe first row is 2013-04-27 against Eric Benito Tzand.\nThen next rows go back in time: 2013-01-25, 2012-08-25, etc., down to 1999.\n\nWait no, perhaps the table is sorted from earliest to latest. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nRow 0: 2013-04-27\nRow 1: 2013-01-25\nRow 2: 2012-08-25\n...\nBut that can't be, because it goes down to 1999. So actually, the table is sorted from latest to earliest.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the provided data, the first row after the header is \"Librado Andrade\" vs Eric Benito Tzand on 2013-04-27 (row index 0). Then next rows go back in time: 2013-01-25 (row 1), then 2012-08-25 (row 2), etc., until the last row is \"1999-08-14\" (the last row, index maybe around 36 or so).\n\nWait, but in this case, the most recent fight would be the first entry: April 27, 2013. But the claim says August 27, 2011.\n\nSo I need to check if there's a row where the date is 2011-08-27 and whether that was his most recent fight before 2013.\n\nLooking through the rows, yes, there's an entry on \"2011-08-27\" against someone. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, in row index 5 (assuming each <tr> is a row), the date is \"2011-08-27\". The opponent is \"Eduardo Rizo,\" method \"Decision\", round 6, time 3:00.\n\nSo according to this table, Librado Andrade's fights are listed with the latest at the top (April 27, 2013) and then earlier ones. So his most recent fight was in April 2013, which is after August 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim that his most recent fight was on August 27, 2011 is incorrect because he had a later fight in 2013.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I misread the table structure. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nThe first row after the header (row index 0) has date \"April 27, 2013\".\n\nThen row 1: January 25, 2013\n\nRow 2: August 25, 2012\n\n...\n\nContinuing down, there's a row with \"August 27, 2011\" as the date.\n\nSo in this table, the most recent fight is April 27, 2013. Therefore, the claim that his most recent fight was on August 27, 2011 is false because he had a later fight.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the table isn't complete or only shows up to a certain point. But according to the data provided, April 2013 is the latest date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Librado Andrade's most recent fight was on August 27, 2011, is false.

The table has multiple entries from different years: 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and then several from 2011. The first entry in the table is from December 2015, but as I go down, each subsequent row has an earlier date.\n\nLooking through all the dates, I see that the earliest one listed is August 1999. This is much older than 2011-08-27. Therefore, if Librado Andrade's fights are listed in this table and he won a fight in 1999, that would be his oldest win, not in 2011.\n\nSo the claim says his oldest win was in August 2011, but according to the table, there's at least one win before that date. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"Librado Andrade have a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey.\" I need to verify if this claim is supported by the data in the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find entries involving Librado Andrade. Scanning the 'Opponent' column:\n\n1. The first relevant entry is at row 39: \"Terry Smith\" as the opponent, result \"ko\", and date \"2000-04-13\".\n2. Next, looking for fights with Marcus Harvey, I find two entries:\n   - Row 35: Opponent \"Marcus Harvey\", result \"ud\", date \"2000-08-17\".\n   - Another entry at row 44: Opponent \"Marcus Harvey\", result \"ud\", date \"1999-08-14\".\n\nNow, to check the order of these fights. Librado fought Terry Smith on April 13, 2000, and then faced Marcus Harvey on August 17, 2000. This means the fight with Terry Smith did occur before the one with Marcus Harvey in 2000.\n\nHowever, there's another fight against Marcus Harvey on August 14, 1999. Since this is before April 2000, it seems there was a prior engagement with Marcus Harvey before the Terry Smith fight. This suggests that Librado fought Marcus Harvey twice: once in 1999 and again in 2000.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifically mentions \"before the fight with Marcus Harvey,\" which could imply only one such fight. The table shows two fights against Marcus Harvey, so I need to clarify if the claim refers to both or just the first occurrence.\n\nAssuming the claim is about the first fight with Marcus Harvey in 1999, then the fight with Terry Smith in April 2000 would come after that. Therefore, the sequence doesn't support the claim as Terry's fight was after Marcus' initial fight.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the later fight in 2000, then Terry's fight was before Marcus' second fight in 2000. In this case, the claim holds true for the 2000 fights but not for the earlier one.\n\nSince the claim doesn't specify which fight with Marcus Harvey it refers to, I have to consider both possibilities. However, without additional context, it's safer to base the answer on the available data. The key point is whether there was a fight against Terry Smith before a subsequent fight against Marcus Harvey in 2000.\n\nLooking back at the relevant cells:\n\n- Terry Smith: April 13, 2000.\n- Marcus Harvey (row 35): August 17, 2000.\n\nSince April comes before August, the fight with Terry Smith did happen before the second fight with Marcus Harvey. Therefore, the claim is supported for that specific instance.\n\nHowever, I must also consider the earlier fight with Marcus Harvey in 1999, which complicates the timeline. If \"before the fight with Marcus Harvey\" refers to all such fights, including the one in 1999, then the claim isn't fully accurate because Terry's fight was after that.\n\nBut given the context and typical phrasing, it likely refers to the subsequent fight, not the initial one. Therefore, I'll conclude that the claim is TRUE based on the 2000 fights.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
