    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify the claim: \"the 2 round match hold in south dakota, united state, the opponent's name be brian dunn.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is stating. It mentions a match that lasted 2 rounds, took place in South Dakota, United States, and the opponent was Brian Dunn.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if there's a match that meets all these conditions. The relevant columns here are \"Rounds\" (which tells me how many rounds the match had), \"Location\" (to confirm it's in South Dakota, USA), and \"Opponent\" (to find Brian Dunn).\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Rounds: 2, Location: South Dakota, Opponent: brian dunn. This seems to match all the conditions mentioned in the claim.\n2. **Other Rows:** I should also check other rows to ensure there's no other match that fits the description. However, looking through the rest of the table, only Row 0 has Brian Dunn as the opponent and mentions South Dakota.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure. The Rounds column in Row 0 is indeed 2, which aligns with the claim. The Location is correctly listed as South Dakota, United States. And the Opponent is Brian Dunn. \n\nI don't see any other rows that meet all these criteria. So it seems like the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Row 0 matches all specified conditions: a 2-round match against Brian Dunn held in South Dakota, United States.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Rounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Brian Dunn be the opponent of the match in South Dakota, United State, which have 3 round.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n1. Opponent's name: Brian Dunn\n2. Location: South Dakota, United States\n3. Number of rounds: 3\n\nI need to check each part against the table rows.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- The first few rows don't mention Brian Dunn. Moving on.\n- At row index 10 (if starting count from 0), I see a match where Brian Dunn is the opponent. Let me confirm:\n  - Opponent: Brian Dunn\n  - Location: South Dakota, United States\n  - Rounds: The table shows \"2\" in the rounds column for this row.\n\nWait, so according to this, it's only 2 rounds, not 3 as claimed. That would mean part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut I should check if there are other rows with Brian Dunn or matches in South Dakota that have 3 rounds.\n\nContinuing through the table:\n- Row index 12: Opponent is Clint Rather, location is Colorado, so no.\n- Other rows don't list Brian Dunn again. So only row 10 has Brian Dunn as the opponent, and it's in South Dakota with 2 rounds.\n\nSince the claim mentions 3 rounds, but the table shows 2, this makes the claim FALSE.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n- Row index 10: Opponent (Brian Dunn)\n- Row index 10: Location (South Dakota, United States)\n- Row index 10: Rounds (which is 2 instead of 3)\n\nTherefore, answer is \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although Brian Dunn is the opponent in South Dakota, the match had only 2 rounds, not 3.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
