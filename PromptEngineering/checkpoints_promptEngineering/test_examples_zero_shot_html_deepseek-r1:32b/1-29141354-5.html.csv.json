    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are 'episode', 'first broadcast', 'andrew and jacks guest', and others. So, to check the claim, I need to find if Jessica Ennis is listed as a guest in an episode that was first broadcast on 4 May 2012.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\nRow 0: Episode 05x01, broadcast on 20 April 2012. Guest is Georgie Thompson. Not matching.\nRow 1: Episode 05x02, broadcast on 27 April 2012. Guest is Louise Hazel. Doesn't match either.\nRow 2: Episode 05x03, broadcast on 4 May 2012. Here, the guest is Jessica Ennis. This matches both the name and the date mentioned in the claim.\nRows 3 to 6 have other guests and dates, none of which are relevant since we've already found a match.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because Jessica Ennis was indeed the guest on the episode broadcast on 4 May 2012. The relevant cell is in row index 2 under 'andrew and jacks guest'.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Checked each row for the specified date.\n- Found a match with Jessica Ennis in row 2, column 'andrew and jacks guest'.\n- Confirmed that the claim aligns with the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cell is correctly identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the first broadcast with jessica ennis as andrew and jack guest be before may 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n- **Jessica Ennis** being a guest on the show.\n- She was specifically an \"Andrew and Jack guest.\"\n- We're looking for her first broadcast before May 2012.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: episode, first broadcast, Andrew and Jack's guest, Jamie's guests (with Peter Crouch replacing Jamie Redknapp as team captain in series 5, episode 2), and scores.\n\nI need to focus on two columns:\n1. The \"Andrew and jacks guest\" column.\n2. The \"first broadcast\" date.\n\nThe claim mentions that Jessica Ennis was a guest before May 2012. So, I should scan the table for any entry where the Andrew and Jack's guest is Jessica Ennis and check her corresponding first broadcast date.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Georgie Thompson as the guest. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Louise Hazel as the guest. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Jessica Ennis as the guest. The first broadcast date here is April 4, 2012.\n- Row 3: Zo\u00eb Ball as the guest. First broadcast on May 11, 2012.\n- Rows 4 to 6: Other guests, none are Jessica Ennis.\n\nSo, the only occurrence of Jessica Ennis is in row index 2 (assuming rows start from 0). Her first broadcast date was April 4, 2012, which is indeed before May 2012. Therefore, the claim holds true because her guest appearance happened before May 2012.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n- The row where Jessica Ennis appears is index 2.\n- The columns we checked were \"first broadcast\" and \"andrew and jacks guest\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row index 2 for both these columns. But according to the instructions, each object in the list should have a row_index and column_name. Since the claim specifically asks about the first broadcast date when Jessica Ennis was a guest, we need to include the cell with her name (column \"andrew and jacks guest\") as well as the corresponding first broadcast date.\n\nTherefore, two cells are relevant:\n1. Row 2, \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n2. Row 2, \"first broadcast\"\n\nThis confirms that Jessica Ennis was a guest in an episode first broadcasted on April 4, 2012, which is before May 2012.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
