    "claim": "all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporate in malaysia , except for taj madras air catering limit , which be incorporate in india",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of Malaysia Airline be incorporate in Malaysia, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which be incorporate in India.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. All subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are incorporated in Malaysia.\n2. Except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India.\n\nSo, I need to check each company in the table to see if they fit these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 12 rows. Each row has information about a company, including its type (subsidiary or associate) and where it's incorporated.\n\nLet me go through each company:\n\nRow 0: Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd - Type: Subsidiary, Incorporated in: Malaysia \u2192 This fits the claim.\nRow 1: GE Engine Services Malaysia - Type: Joint Venture. Wait, the claim is about subsidiaries and associates, so this one is a joint venture, which isn't covered by the claim. So I can ignore this row for the purposes of verifying the claim.\nRow 2: Maswings Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 3: Firefly Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 4: MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 5: MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 6: Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 7: MAS Academy Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 8: Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Incorporated in? Wait, the table says \"incorporated in\" as Malaysia. But I notice that this row has a different structure\u2014maybe it's incorporated elsewhere. Let me check: No, the cell under \"incorporated in\" is still Malaysia. So it fits.\nRow 9: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited - Type: Associate, Incorporated in India \u2192 This matches the exception stated in the claim.\nRow 10: MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia \u2192 Fits.\nRow 11: LSG Sky Chefs - Type: Associate, Incorporated in Malaysia \u2192 So this associate is in Malaysia.\n\nWait a second. The claim says that all subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in Malaysia except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. But according to the table, there's another associate, LSG Sky Chefs, which is incorporated in Malaysia. That doesn't violate the claim because it's correct for the others. However, I need to ensure that no other subsidiary or associate besides Taj Madras is incorporated outside of Malaysia.\n\nLooking again: All subsidiaries are indeed incorporated in Malaysia except none\u2014because they're all listed as incorporated in Malaysia except row 9 which is an associate in India. So the claim seems correct because it says \"all...except for\" Taj Madras. \n\nWait, but what about LSG Sky Chefs? It's an associate incorporated in Malaysia. The claim doesn't mention any other associates being outside, so that's fine.\n\nSo the only exception is Taj Madras Air Catering Limited in India. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, to note the relevant cells:\n\n- All subsidiaries (rows 0-8, except row1 which is a joint venture) have \"incorporated in\" as Malaysia.\n- The associate rows: row9 is incorporated in India, and row11 is in Malaysia.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all the \"type\" and \"incorporated in\" columns for each company. But to verify the claim, I need to check that every subsidiary and associate (excluding joint ventures) are in Malaysia except Taj Madras.\n\nTherefore, for each company where type is Subsidiary or Associate, check their incorporated location.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include:\n\n- For all subsidiaries: their row index and \"type\" and \"incorporated in\".\n- Similarly, for associates: same.\n\nBut since the claim only specifies that Taj Madras is the exception, perhaps focusing on rows where type is Subsidiary or Associate, checking their incorporation location.\n\nSo I'll list each company's row index with \"type\" and \"incorporated in\" columns. But according to the user instruction, the relevant_cells should be a list of objects each with row_index and column_name. So for each row where type is Subsidiary or Associate, we check both \"type\" and \"incorporated in\".\n\nSo:\n\nFor rows 0 (Subsidiary), 2-8 (all Subsidiaries except row1 which is a joint venture), 9 (Associate), and 11 (Associate):\n\nEach of these rows has their type and incorporation location checked.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are all \"type\" and \"incorporated in\" for each applicable row. But according to the JSON structure, I can list each cell as separate entries.\n\nSo for example:\n\nrow_index 0: columns \"Type\", \"Incorporated in\"\n\nSimilarly for rows 2-11 where type is Subsidiary or Associate.\n\nBut since the user wants a list of all relevant cells that were checked to determine the answer, I'll include each row's \"type\" and \"incorporated in\".\n\nSo:\n\nRows: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (all subsidiaries), 9,11 (associates)\n\nEach has two columns: Type and Incorporated in.\n\nThus, for each of these rows, we'll have entries for both column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. All subsidiaries are incorporated in Malaysia except none, and the only associate outside Malaysia is Taj Madras Air Catering Limited in India.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Incorporated in\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiary",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiary\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the table structure. The table has columns: company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, and group's equity shareholding. Each row represents a different entity with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions two key points:\n1. Malaysia airline has 100% equity in 7 subsidiaries.\n2. There are 9 different subsidiaries in total.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the subsidiaries listed in the table. The 'type' column indicates whether each company is a subsidiary, joint venture, associate, etc. Subsidiaries are those with \"subsidiary\" as their type.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 0: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 1: ge engine services malaysia - joint venture (not a subsidiary)\n- Row 2: maswings sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 3: firefly sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 4: mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 5: mas golden holidays sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 6: malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 7: mas academy sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Row 8: abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary\n- Rows 9,10,11 are not subsidiaries.\n\nWait, let me recount. The table has 12 rows in the tbody, but I think I miscounted earlier. Wait no, looking again:\n\nThe table's tbody starts with row 0 to row 11 (since there are 12 rows), each representing a different company. However, only those marked as \"subsidiary\" are considered subsidiaries.\n\nLet me list all the entries where 'type' is 'subsidiary':\n- malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\n- maswings sdn bhd\n- firefly sdn bhd\n- mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd\n- mas golden holidays sdn bhd\n- malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd\n- mas academy sdn bhd\n- abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd\n\nThat's 8 subsidiaries. So the total number of subsidiaries is 8, not 9 as mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted again. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: subsidiary\nRow 1: joint venture \u2192 not a subsidiary\nRow 2: subsidiary\nRow 3: subsidiary\nRow 4: subsidiary\nRow 5: subsidiary\nRow 6: subsidiary\nRow 7: subsidiary\nRow 8: subsidiary (but wait, abacus is listed as 80% equity)\nRows 9-11: not subsidiaries\n\nSo that's rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. That's 8 subsidiaries in total.\n\nThe claim says \"9 different subsidiaries.\" But according to the table, there are only 8 subsidiaries. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on this point alone. However, let me check if I missed any.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: subsidiary\nRow 1: joint venture \u2192 not a subsidiary\nRow 2: subsidiary\nRow 3: subsidiary\nRow 4: subsidiary\nRow 5: subsidiary\nRow 6: subsidiary\nRow 7: subsidiary\nRow 8: subsidiary (abacus)\nRows 9-11 are associate or other types.\n\nYes, that's 8 subsidiaries. So the total is 8, not 9 as claimed.\n\nNext, for each of these 8 subsidiaries, check if the equity shareholding is 100%. The 'group's equity shareholding' column shows the percentage:\n\nRow 0: 100%\nRow 2: 100%\nRow 3: 100%\nRow 4: 100%\nRow 5: 100%\nRow 6: 100%\nRow 7: 100%\nRow 8: 80% (abacus)\n\nSo out of 8 subsidiaries, 7 have 100% equity. However, since the total number of subsidiaries is 8 and not 9 as claimed, the claim's second part is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me list all the companies with type 'subsidiary':\n\nRow 0: yes\nRow 2: yes\nRow 3: yes\nRow 4: yes\nRow 5: yes\nRow 6: yes\nRow 7: yes\nRow 8: yes\n\nThat's 8, not 9. So the claim states \"9 different subsidiaries,\" which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are wrong: there are 8 subsidiaries, and only 7 have 100% equity (since abacus has 80%).\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because the total number of subsidiaries is not 9. However, if we overlook that and consider that maybe the user meant 8 subsidiaries, then 7 out of 8 have 100%, but the claim says 7 out of 9, which still doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table structure. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's type:\nRow 0: subsidiary\nRow 1: joint venture\nRow 2: subsidiary\nRow 3: subsidiary\nRow 4: subsidiary\nRow 5: subsidiary\nRow 6: subsidiary\nRow 7: subsidiary\nRow 8: subsidiary (abacus)\nRows 9-11: not subsidiaries.\n\nSo yes, 8 subsidiaries. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it mentions 9 instead of 8.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are 9 subsidiaries with 7 having 100% equity. However, the table shows only 8 subsidiaries, and among them, 7 have 100% equity while one has 80%. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"malaysia airline work with 2 different company for catering : taj madras air catering limit and mas cater (sarawak) sdn bhd.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two companies involved in catering services: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) SDN BHD.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find these companies. \n\nLooking at the company names:\n- Row 9: taj madras air catering limited\n- Row 10: mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd\n\nBoth are present in the table. Now, checking their type and principal activities.\n\nFor Taj Madras Air Catering Limited:\n- Type is \"associate\"\n- Principal activity is \"catering\"\n\nFor MAS Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD:\n- Type is \"subsidiary\"\n- Principal activity is \"catering\"\n\nSo both companies are involved in catering. The claim states that Malaysia Airlines works with these two for catering.\n\nNow, checking their shareholding:\n- Taj Madras has a 20% equity share\n- MAS Catering (Sarawak) has a 60% equity share\n\nSince the equity is less than 100%, they are not fully owned subsidiaries but still associated or part of the group.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify whether full ownership is required, just that they work with these two companies.

The claim says: \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MA Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The main subject here is \"subsidiaries\" of Malaysia Airlines. So I need to look at all the rows where the type is 'subsidiary'. Then, among those subsidiaries, check their equity shareholding percentages and see if MA Catering (Sarawak) has the lowest one.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with \"type\" as 'subsidiary'. Let's list them out:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - 100%\n2. maswings sdn bhd - 100%\n3. firefly sdn bhd - 100%\n4. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - 100%\n5. mas golden holidays sdn bhd - 100%\n6. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - 100%\n7. mas academy sdn bhd - 100%\n8. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - 80%\n9. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - 60%\n\nWait, the last one is also a subsidiary with 60% equity.\n\nSo among all subsidiaries, the equity shareholdings are mostly 100%, except abacus at 80% and mas catering sarawak at 60%. So the lowest is 60%.\n\nThe claim says that Malaysia Airlines have the lowest in ma catering (sarawak). Since 60% is indeed lower than all other subsidiaries which have higher percentages, the claim seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that \"subsidiaries\" are correctly identified. All these companies listed under type 'subsidiary' are considered as such. So yes, among them, mas catering sarawak has 60%, which is the lowest.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MA Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd among all subsidiaries. From the table, the subsidiaries' equity shares are checked, and indeed, MA Catering (Sarawak) has the lowest at 60%.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in both lsg sky chef and ge engine service malaysia, which both be not subsidiary.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim into parts to check each against the table.\n\n1. **Equity Shareholding Percentage**: The claim mentions that Malaysia Airlines has a 30% equity shareholding in two companies: LSG Sky Chefs and GE Engine Services Malaysia.\n\n2. **Ownership Type (Subsidiary or Not)**: It also states that both these companies are not subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLet me go through each part step by step using the table data.\n\n**Checking for GE Engine Services Malaysia:**\n- I look for the company \"ge engine services malaysia\" in the table. \n- Found at row index 1.\n- The \"group's equity shareholding\" is listed as 30%, which matches the claim.\n- The \"type\" column shows this company is a joint venture, not a subsidiary.\n\n**Checking for LSG Sky Chefs:**\n- I search for \"lsg sky chefs\" in the table. \n- Found at row index 12 (wait, no, looking again... actually, it's row index 11 because rows are zero-indexed).\n- The equity shareholding is 30%, which aligns with the claim.\n- The type here is \"associate,\" meaning it's not a subsidiary either.\n\nSo both companies have 30% equity and are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures (LSG Sky Chefs is an associate), but wait, GE Engine Services Malaysia is a joint venture. However, the claim says they are \"not subsidiary.\" Since joint ventures aren't subsidiaries in this context, that part holds true.\n\nWait a second, does the type being 'joint venture' affect the interpretation? The claim specifies they're not subsidiaries, which is correct because neither is a subsidiary\u2014GE is a joint venture and LSG Sky Chefs is an associate. So both parts of the claim are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects that Malaysia Airlines holds 30% equity in both companies, which are not subsidiaries but rather a joint venture and an associate company.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"malaysia airline have 100% equity in each of their subsidy, like taj madras air catering limit.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim carefully. It seems to suggest that Malaysia Airlines owns 100% equity in all their subsidiaries, specifically mentioning Taj Madras Air Catering Limited as an example.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check the type and equity shareholding for subsidiaries. The companies listed are:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n2. ge engine services malaysia: Joint venture with 30% equity (so not a subsidiary).\n3. maswings sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n4. firefly sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n8. mas academy sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 80% equity.\n10. taj madras air catering limited: Associate with 20% equity.\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd: Subsidiary with 60% equity.\n12. lsg sky chefs: Associate with 30% equity.\n\nThe claim mentions \"taj madras air catering limit\" as an example of a subsidiary with 100% equity. However, from the table, Taj Madras is categorized as an associate company with only 20% equity shareholding. This directly contradicts the claim that they have 100% equity in this company.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other subsidiaries, I notice that not all have 100% equity. For instance, Abacus Distribution Systems has 80%, and Mas Catering Sarawak has 60%. Therefore, the initial part of the claim is also incorrect because not every subsidiary is fully owned.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are false: Taj Madras isn't a 100% subsidiary, and other subsidiaries don't have full equity either. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of Malaysia Airline be incorporate in India except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which be not from India.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It says that all subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in India, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is not from India.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row to see if they're either a subsidiary or associate and where they're incorporated.\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n   - This contradicts the claim because it's a subsidiary but incorporated elsewhere than India.\n\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia: Joint venture, not relevant to the claim as the claim is about subsidiaries and associates only.\n\n3. MASWings SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n   - Again, another subsidiary not in India.\n\n4. Firefly SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n6. MAS Golden Holidays SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n8. MAS Academy SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: Associate, Incorporated in India.\n    - According to the claim, this should be the only associate incorporated elsewhere, but the claim says it's not from India, which is correct here as it's in India? Wait, no. The claim says that all except Taj Madras are in India, and Taj Madras is not from India. But according to the table, Taj Madras is incorporated in India (20% share). So this contradicts the claim.\n\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD: Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n12. LSG Sky Chefs: Associate, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n    - This associate is not in India either, which again goes against the claim that all except Taj Madras are in India.\n\nSo, from this analysis, multiple subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in Malaysia, not India. The claim incorrectly states that all except Taj Madras are in India, but Taj Madras itself is in India according to the table. Therefore, the claim is false because several entities under subsidiary and associate are incorporated elsewhere besides India, including those outside of the exception mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airline are incorporated in India except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that Malaysia Airlines does NOT hold a 30% equity share in any of their associates.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on two columns: \"type\" and \"group's equity shareholding\". Specifically, I'm interested in rows where the type is \"associate\" because the claim refers to \"associates\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo SDN BHD - type is subsidiary, not associate.\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia - joint venture, 30% equity.\n   But since it's a joint venture, not an associate, I don't consider this for the claim.\n\nNext rows (3-6) are subsidiaries, so they're out.\n\nRow 7: Mas Academy SDN BHD is also a subsidiary.\n\nRow 8: Abacus Distribution Systems - another subsidiary with 80% equity. Not relevant here.\n\nNow, looking at associates:\nRow 9: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited - type associate, equity shareholding 20%. So this is an associate but not 30%.\n\nRow 10: Mas Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD - subsidiary with 60% equity.\n\nRow 11: LSG Sky Chefs - type associate, equity shareholding 30%. Oh, wait! This is an associate and they have a 30% equity. So Malaysia Airlines does have a 30% share in at least one associate (LSG Sky Chefs).\n\nSo the claim says that they don't have any associates with 30%, but according to row 11, there's one with exactly 30%. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to highlight where the type was 'associate' and check their equity. That would be rows 9 and 11. However, since the claim is about having NONE with 30%, but row 11 does have 30%, it's a counterexample.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there exists an associate (LSG Sky Chefs) where Malaysia Airlines holds a 30% equity share.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have equal equity in each subsidy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It claims that Malaysia Airlines has an equal equity shareholding in each of their subsidiaries. So, every subsidiary should have 100% equity according to the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with different companies. The relevant columns here are \"type\" and \"group's equity shareholding.\" I'm focusing on the \"subsidiary\" type because the claim is about subsidies (subsidiaries). \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: Type is subsidiary, equity is 100%.\n2. Ge Engine Services Malaysia: Type is joint venture, so it's not a subsidiary, but their equity is 30%. But since it's a joint venture, maybe it's not part of the claim about subsidiaries.\n3. Maswings Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary with 100% equity.\n5. Mas Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, 100% equity.\n6. Mas Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, 100% equity.\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, 100% equity.\n8. Mas Academy Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, 100% equity.\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, but the equity is 80%, not 100%. This is a problem for the claim because it's less than equal shareholding.\n\nThe other rows are either joint ventures or associates, so they don't count towards subsidiaries. But since there's at least one subsidiary (Abacus) with only 80% equity, the claim that Malaysia Airlines has equal equity in each subsidy isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to list all rows where the type is \"subsidiary\" and check their equity. The ones with different percentages are important. So, row 0 (100%), row 2 (100%), row3 (100%), row4 (100%), row5 (100%), row6 (100%), row7 (100%), and row8 (80%). These rows are relevant because they show the varying equity shares, especially the last one which breaks the equal shareholding.\n\nSo, compiling these into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except taj madras air catering limit\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It seems that Malaysia Airlines collaborates with all their subsidiaries in the catering sector except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. So, my task is to check if this is accurate based on the data given.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows where companies are categorized under different types and activities. Let me focus on the \"type\" and \"principal activities\" columns, as well as the company names.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: It's a subsidiary, activity is cargo. Not related to catering.\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia: Joint venture, engine overhaul. Also not catering.\n3. Maswings Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, airline. Maybe related but the activity isn't specifically catering.\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, airline. Same as above.\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul). Not directly catering.\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, tour operator. Catering might be part of this but not explicitly stated here.\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, engineering. Not catering.\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, flight school. Not catering.\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, computer reservation system. Not catering.\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: Associate, catering. Incorporated in India with 20% equity.\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, catering. 60% equity.\n12. LSG Sky Chefs: Associate, holding company. 30% equity.\n\nNow, focusing on the companies involved in catering:\n\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate with 20% equity and is incorporated in India.\n- MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary with 60% equity, located in Malaysia.\n- LSG Sky Chefs is an associate, holding company with 30% equity.\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines works with all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras. From the table, MAS Catering (Sarawak) is a subsidiary in catering. So, according to the claim, they should work with this one but not with Taj Madras. \n\nWait, but LSG Sky Chefs is an associate and a holding company. It's unclear if it's involved directly in catering operations as a subsidiary.\n\nThe issue here is that Taj Madras is categorized as an associate, not a subsidiary. The claim says \"all subsidiary for cater except taj madras\". But since Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary but an associate, the statement might be incorrect because it's excluding an associate, not a subsidiary. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant all catering-related companies regardless of type.\n\nAnother angle: If Malaysia Airlines works with all subsidiaries in catering, then MAS Catering (Sarawak) should be one they work with. However, Taj Madras is an associate, so it's possible they don't work with them. But the claim says \"all subsidiary for cater except taj madras\", which might not make sense because Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in referring to Taj Madras as a subsidiary. Looking at the table, Taj Madras is an associate, not a subsidiary. So if the claim is that Malaysia Airlines works with all subsidiaries except this one (which isn't even a subsidiary), then the claim might be false because the exception refers to an associate, not a subsidiary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that they work with all subsidiaries in catering except for Taj Madras, which is an associate. But since the company type is different, it's unclear if they should be excluded.\n\nAdditionally, there's LSG Sky Chefs, an associate holding company. It might be involved in catering through its subsidiaries or associates, but it's not directly a catering service provider itself as per the principal activity listed (holding company).\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim says Malaysia Airlines works with all their catering subsidiaries except Taj Madras. But Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary; it's an associate. Therefore, the exception doesn't apply because it's not in the same category. Also, MAS Catering is a subsidiary involved in catering, so they should be working with them.\n\nHence, the claim might be incorrect because it excludes an associate instead of a subsidiary. Or perhaps there's confusion between associates and subsidiaries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines collaborates with all their subsidiaries in catering except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- **MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd** is a subsidiary involved in catering.\n- **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited** is an associate, not a subsidiary.\n\nSince Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary but an associate, excluding it from subsidiaries doesn't align with the claim. Therefore, the statement is false because it incorrectly refers to an associate as a subsidiary and excludes it, which isn't accurate based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
