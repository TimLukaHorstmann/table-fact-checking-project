    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: class, season, race, podiums, and pole. There are five rows, each representing a different motorcycle racing class along with some statistics.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"moto2\" class and refers to \"0 pole.\" So, my task is to check if the 'pole' value for the moto2 class is zero.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are as follows:\n\n1. 125 cc\n2. 250 cc\n3. motogp\n4. moto2\n5. total\n\nI'm interested in the row for moto2. Let's find that row: it's the fourth one with index starting at 0, so row index 3.\n\nIn this row, I need to check the 'pole' column. The value under 'pole' is 0. So according to the table, the moto2 class has zero poles.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows for context: \n- motogp (row index 2) also shows 0 poles.\n- 125 cc (row index 0) and 250 cc (row index 1) both have 0 poles as well.\n- The total row (index 4) sums up all the poles across classes, which is still 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are zero poles in the moto2 class is supported by the data in the table. There's no discrepancy or alternative data suggesting otherwise.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to verify this are the 'pole' column in the row corresponding to the moto2 class.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me carefully analyze this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are 'class', 'season', 'race', 'podiums', and 'pole'. Each row represents different motorcycle racing classes with corresponding data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" To parse this, I think it means that there are 4 poles (maybe starting positions or wins) in the Moto2 class. Alternatively, it could mean that the Moto2 class has made 4 appearances on the pole position.\n\nLooking at the table, under the 'class' column, one of the rows is 'moto2'. Let's find the relevant row index for 'moto2'. Scanning through:\n\nRow indices (assuming starting from 0):\n- Row 0: 125 cc\n- Row 1: 250 cc\n- Row 2: motogp\n- Row 3: moto2\n- Row 4: total\n\nSo, the 'moto2' class is in row index 3. Now, I need to check which column corresponds to poles. The columns are 'class', 'season', 'race', 'podiums', 'pole'. So, the 'pole' column is relevant here.\n\nLooking at row 3 (moto2), under the 'pole' column, the value is 0. That indicates that there were zero pole positions achieved in the Moto2 class according to this table.\n\nThe claim states there are 4 poles for Moto2, but the table shows 0. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided. \n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cell is row 3 under the 'pole' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the number of pole positions in the Moto2 class. Checking row 3, the 'pole' value is 0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
