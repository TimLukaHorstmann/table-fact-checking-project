    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"cruzeiro do less well in the recopa sudamericana 1993 than s\u00e3o paulo do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying Cruzeiro performed worse in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993 compared to S\u00e3o Paulo. So I need to check their respective results in that competition.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team and their performance in various competitions in 1993. The columns are:\n- team\n- copa libertadores 1993\n- supercopa sudamericana 1993\n- copa conmebol 1993\n- recopa sudamericana 1993\n- intercontinental cup 1993\n\nI need to focus on the \"recopa sudamericana 1993\" column for both Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nLet me find the rows for Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nCruzeiro's row is at index 3 (since indexing starts from 0). Their performance in recopa sudamericana is \"runner - up\". So they reached the runners-up position, which means they lost in the final but performed well.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo's row is at index 8. In the same column, their result is \"champions\", meaning they won that competition.\n\nComparing both: S\u00e3o Paulo won (champions), Cruzeiro was runner-up. Therefore, Cruzeiro did not do as well as S\u00e3o Paulo in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor Cruzeiro:\n- row_index 3\n- column_name \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n- row_index 8\n- column_name \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"\n\nSo both these cells are necessary to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each column for Flamengo:\n\n1. **Copa Libertadores 1993**: The cell says \"quarterfinals.\" Reaching quarterfinals means they didn't make it to the final.\n2. **Super Copa Sudamericana 1993**: The result is \"runner-up.\" Runner-up indicates that they reached the final but lost, so they did reach the final here.\n3. **Copa Conmebol 1993**: They didn't qualify, so no participation in this tournament's final.\n4. **Recopa Sudamericana 1993** and **Intercontinental Cup 1993**: Both are marked as \"n/a,\" meaning they didn't participate.\n\nSince the claim is that Flamengo did not reach any finals, but in Super Copa Sudamericana they were runners-up (reached final), the claim is FALSE. \n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Flamengo's row index 4 for each tournament column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"supercopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"copa conmebol 1993\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The rows list various teams with their performance in each competition.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the \"intercontinental cup.\" So, I'll focus on that column to check how many teams participated or qualified for it.\n\nLooking at the \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico mineiro: n/a\n- Botafogo: n/a\n- Bragantino: n/a\n- Cruzeiro: n/a\n- Flamengo: n/a\n- Fluminense: n/a\n- Gr\u00eamio: n/a\n- Internacional: n/a\n- Santos: n/a\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: champions\n- Vasco: n/a\n\nOnly S\u00e3o Paulo is listed as \"champions\" in the intercontinental cup column.

Wait, actually, looking at the HTML, the first data row after the header is Atl\u00e9tico mineiro as row 0, then Botafogo as row 1, and so on.

So yes, Cruzeiro has two, Santos one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they don't qualify for the same number.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider all tournaments where they didn't say \"did not qualify\" and also look at n/a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"n/a\" means they didn't participate in that tournament. So in recopa sudamericana, Cruzeiro was runner-up, meaning they participated (qualified), while Santos had n/a, so maybe they didn't qualify or didn't participate.\n\nSo yes, Cruzeiro qualified for two tournaments: supercopa and recopa.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"4 team play in the intercontinental cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nLooking at the columns: The main column headers include various competitions from 1993. Each row represents a different team and their performance in these competitions.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"intercontinental cup\". I'll check which column corresponds to this. Scanning the headers, I see there's a column named \"intercontinental cup 1993\".\n\nNow, for each team, I need to look at what it says under that column. If the value is something other than \"n/a\", it means they participated in that competition.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Atl\u00e9tico mineiro: intercontinental cup 1993 - n/a\n2. Botafogo: n/a\n3. Bragantino: n/a\n4. Cruzeiro: n/a\n5. Flamengo: n/a\n6. Fluminense: n/a\n7. Gr\u00eamio: n/a\n8. Internacional: n/a\n9. Santos: n/a\n10. S\u00e3o Paulo: champions (so they participated)\n11. Vasco: n/a\n\nOnly S\u00e3o Paulo has a value in the intercontinental cup column, meaning only one team played in it according to this table.\n\nThe claim says four teams played, but according to the data, it's just one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only S\u00e3o Paulo participated in the intercontinental cup 1993. The other entries have \"n/a\", indicating they did not participate. Since only one team is listed as participating, the claim of four teams is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
