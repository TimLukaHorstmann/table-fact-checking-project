    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to verify the claim: \"The Oklahoma City Thunder do not break 100 points at all during March 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided to see if there's any game in March where they scored 100 or more points. The relevant column here is likely the Points column, which probably shows how many points the Thunder scored each game.\n\nLooking through each row, starting from row 1 (since row 0 might be headers), I check the 'Points' value for each date in March. Let me go one by one:\n\nRow 1: 86 points \u2013 that's below 100.\nRow 2: 94 points \u2013 still under 100.\nRow 3: 95 points \u2013 not there yet.\nRow 4: 99 points \u2013 almost, but still under.\nRow 5: 93 points \u2013 nope.\nRow 6: 87 points \u2013 same.\nRow 7: 91 points \u2013 close, but not enough.\nRow 8: 92 points \u2013 still under 100.\nRow 9: 99 points \u2013 again, just shy.\nRow 10: 84 points \u2013 no.\nRow 11: 93 points \u2013 same as before.\nRow 12: 96 points \u2013 almost made it.\nRow 13: 98 points \u2013 not quite.\nRow 14: 95 points \u2013 same as earlier games.\nRow 15: 100 points! Wait, that's exactly 100. But the claim says \"do not break 100,\" so does 100 count? Breaking would mean exceeding, but sometimes people use it to mean reaching or exceeding. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at row indexes. The first row is index 1 with 86 points, and when I get to row 53 (index 52), the Points are 100. So that's a game where they scored exactly 100 points. \n\nSince the claim says \"do not break 100,\" which could imply scoring over 100. But in this case, they hit exactly 100 once and no more than that. However, depending on interpretation, some might consider breaking as reaching or exceeding, so even one instance would make the claim false.\n\nSo, because there's at least one game where they scored exactly 100 points, the claim is not fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cell is row index 52 under Points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 52, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the oklahoma city thunder defeat the san antonio spur 2 time in march of 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It says that Oklahoma City Thunder defeated San Antonio Spurs two times in March 2009. So, I'm looking for games where the Thunder (Oklahoma City) played against the Spurs and won.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows corresponding to games in March 2009. Each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result (Win/Loss), points scored by both teams, etc.\n\nI'll go through each row and check if the opponent is San Antonio Spurs and if the result was a win for Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 53: March 1 vs. San Antonio. The result shows \"W\" which means Win. So that's one win.\n\nRow 67: March 24 vs. LA Lakers, not relevant here.\n\nWait, let me double-check all rows where opponent is San Antonio Spurs.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 53: March 1, Opponent: San Antonio, Result: W (Thunder wins)\n- Row 74: March 31, Opponent: San Antonio, Result: W (Thunder wins)\n\nSo that's two wins against San Antonio in March 2009.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because they defeated San Antonio Spurs twice in that month.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Oklahoma City Thunder defeated San Antonio Spurs on two occasions in March 2009.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"Russell Westbrook led the Oklahoma City Thunder in assists 10 times during March of 2009.\" I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: Game Number, Date, Opponent, Result, Points, Rebounds ( Offensive and Defensive ), Assists, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers, Fouls, and Team Fouls. The rows are numbered from 1 to 74, each representing a game.\n\nThe claim mentions Russell Westbrook leading in assists 10 times. So, I need to check how many times Westbrook had the highest assist count for the Thunder in these games during March 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row and look at the \"Assists\" column. Each entry lists players with their assist counts. For example, in row 3 (Game #5), it says \"Russell Westbrook 10\". That means Westbrook had 10 assists that game. I need to see if he was the leader in that category each time.\n\nI'll scan through all 74 rows. Let's note instances where Westbrook is listed first or has a higher number than others in the Assists column for each game. \n\nAfter reviewing, I find that there are multiple games where Westbrook led the assists. However, upon closer examination, it seems he didn't reach 10 leads as per the claim. Some entries show other players like Kevin Durant or Jeff Green leading with higher assist counts.\n\nGiven this analysis, the number of times Westbrook led in assists during March 2009 does not meet the 10 times stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this claim to verify: \"19136 fan attend Oklahoma City Thunder game at the Ford Center on 4 separate occasions during March 2009.\" I need to check if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's saying that exactly 19,136 fans attended four different games in March 2009 at Ford Center. So, each of those four games had an attendance of 19,136.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns like \"Opponent,\" \"Date,\" and \"Attendance.\" The relevant column for attendance is likely \" Attendance\" since that's where numbers are listed. Also, the venue is Ford Center, so I should check which rows list Ford Center as the location.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find all instances where the venue is Ford Center and the attendance is 19,136.\n\nStarting from Row 0:\n- Opponent: New Orleans Hornets\n- Date: March 2\n- Attendance: 18797\nVenue isn't Ford Center here; it's New Orleans Arena. So not relevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- Opponent: L.A. Clippers\n- Date: March 4\n- Attendance: 18561\nVenue is Staples Center, not Ford Center. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Opponent: Portland Trail Blazers\n- Date: March 7\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is Rose Garden. Nope, not Ford Center.\n\nRow 3:\n- Opponent: Golden State Warriors\n- Date: March 8\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is Oracle Arena. Not Ford Center.\n\nRow 4:\n- Opponent: Sacramento Kings\n- Date: March 10\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is ARCO Arena. Still not Ford Center.\n\nRow 5:\n- Opponent: Phoenix Suns\n- Date: March 12\n- Attendance: 18797\nVenue is US Airways Center. Not Ford Center.\n\nRow 6:\n- Opponent: Dallas Mavericks\n- Date: March 14\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is American Airlines Center. No match.\n\nRow 7:\n- Opponent: Miami Heat\n- Date: March 15\n- Attendance: 18201\nVenue is American Airlines Arena. Not Ford Center.\n\nRow 8:\n- Opponent: Orlando Magic\n- Date: March 16\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is Amway Arena. Not Ford Center.\n\nRow 9:\n- Opponent: Washington Wizards\n- Date: March 20\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is Verizon Center. No match.\n\nRow 10:\n- Opponent: New York Knicks\n- Date: March 21\n- Attendance: 18561\nVenue is Madison Square Garden. Not Ford Center.\n\nRow 11:\n- Opponent: Philadelphia 76ers\n- Date: March 23\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is Wachovia Center. No match.\n\nRow 12:\n- Opponent: Atlanta Hawks\n- Date: March 25\n- Attendance: 18201\nVenue isn't Ford Center; it's Philips Arena.\n\nRow 13:\n- Opponent: Chicago Bulls\n- Date: March 26\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is United Center. Not Ford Center.\n\nRow 14:\n- Opponent: Milwaukee Bucks\n- Date: March 28\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is US Cellular Arena. No match.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that most of the games are listed with different venues, not Ford Center. Let me check if any row actually lists Ford Center as the venue.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 15:\n- Opponent: Detroit Pistons\n- Date: March 30\n- Attendance: 19136\nVenue is The Palace of Auburn Hills. Not Ford Center.\n\nHmm, so I'm not finding any instances where the venue is Ford Center in this table. All the venues listed are different arenas, but none mention Ford Center. That means there's no data here about games played at Ford Center in March 2009 with an attendance of 19,136.\n\nTherefore, since the claim specifies that these four games were held at Ford Center, and the table doesn't show any such entries, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table of basketball games played by the Oklahoma City Thunder in March 2009 and a specific claim about Kevin Durant leading the team in points scored over six consecutive games. My task is to verify if this claim holds true based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents. The columns are: \"Game\", \"Date\", \"Opponent\", \"Result\", \"Points\", \"Rebounds\", and \"Assists\". Each row corresponds to a different game played by the Thunder during that month. The claim is about Durant being the top scorer in six straight games, so I'll focus on the \"Points\" column for each game.\n\nI notice that the table has 74 rows, each representing a different game. However, it's crucial to determine which of these rows pertain to March 2009. Looking at the \"Date\" column, all the dates listed are in March, so I don't need to filter based on date; everything here is relevant.\n\nNext, I'll examine the \"Points\" column across each game to see if Kevin Durant was the leading scorer. From the table:\n\n1. **March 2 (Game 59)**: Durant scored 30 points.\n2. **March 4 (Game 60)**: Durant had 33 points.\n3. **March 6 (Game 61)**: He scored 37 points.\n4. **March 8 (Game 62)**: Durant's points were 39.\n5. **March 10 (Game 63)**: He scored 38 points.\n6. **March 13 (Game 64)**: Durant had another 37-point game.\n\nLooking at these six consecutive games, in each instance, Durant was indeed the highest scorer on his team. There are no other players mentioned in the \"Points\" column who surpass Durant's points in any of these games. Therefore, each of these rows supports the claim that Durant led the Thunder in points for those games.\n\nI should also check if there are six consecutive games where he leads. From Game 59 to Game 64, that's six games in a row without any breaks. Each of these has Durant as the top scorer, so it meets the condition of being consecutive and him leading each game.\n\nIt's worth noting that after this streak, Durant continues to lead in subsequent games (Game 65 onwards), but the claim specifically mentions March 2009 and six consecutive games. Since all games in the table are from March, and we have identified a clear sequence of six games where he led, the claim is fully supported.\n\nIn summary, by examining each relevant cell in the \"Points\" column across these specific rows, it's evident that Kevin Durant was the leading scorer for the Oklahoma City Thunder in six consecutive games during March 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 58, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 59, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the oklahoma city thunder break 100 point 5 time during march\" is true or false based on the provided table. The table seems to list games played by the Oklahoma City Thunder in March, with various statistics for each game.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It says that the team scored over 100 points five times in March. So, I need to check how many times their score was above 100 in the given games.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game. The columns include things like date, opponent, result (win or loss), and the scores for both teams. The relevant column here is probably where the team's points are listed. I think the column named \"Pts\" under \"Oklahoma City Thunder\" would be important because it shows how many points they scored in each game.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"Pts\" value. Let me list out the \"Pts\" for each game:\n\n1. March 3: 95\n2. March 4: 86\n3. March 7: 95\n4. March 9: 105 \u2192 This is above 100, so that's one.\n5. March 11: 100 \u2192 Exactly 100, but the claim says \"break\" which might mean over 100, so not counting this.\n6. March 13: 99\n7. March 14: 103 \u2192 This is above 100, that's two.\n8. March 16: 102 \u2192 That's three.\n9. March 18: 102 \u2192 Four.\n10. March 20: 105 \u2192 Five.\n11. March 23: 97\n12. March 24: 97\n13. March 26: 97\n14. March 28: 97\n15. March 30: 94\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me recount each row from the table:\n\n- Row 0: 95 \u2192 No\n- Row 1: 86 \u2192 No\n- Row 2: 95 \u2192 No\n- Row 3: 105 \u2192 Yes (1)\n- Row 4: 100 \u2192 Exactly, maybe not counted as breaking above.\n- Row 5: 99 \u2192 No\n- Row 6: 103 \u2192 Yes (2)\n- Row 7: 102 \u2192 Yes (3)\n- Row 8: 102 \u2192 Yes (4)\n- Row 9: 105 \u2192 Yes (5)\n- The rest are below or equal to 100.\n\nSo that's five games where they scored over 100 points. Therefore, the claim is true because they broke 100 points exactly five times in March.\n\nI should list each relevant cell that meets this condition. Each of these rows (3,6,7,8,9) has the \"Pts\" column showing above 100.\n</think>\n\nThe Thunder scored over 100 points five times during March, as seen in rows 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 under the \"Pts\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Pts\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Pts\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Pts\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Pts\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Pts\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns include \"Date,\" \"Opponent,\" \"Result,\" and others that might be relevant. Each row represents a game played by the Thunder in March 2009.\n\nThe claim specifies three defeats against the Spurs. So, my goal is to find all instances where the Thunder (Oklahoma City) played against the San Antonio Spurs and check if they won those games.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's \"Opponent\" column to identify games against San Antonio. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is Dallas Mavericks \u2013 Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is Golden State Warriors \u2013 Not relevant.\n3. ...

    "claim": "russell westbrook lead the san antonio spur in assist 10 time during march 2009",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to verify the claim: \"Russell Westbrook led the San Antonio Spurs in assists 10 times during March 2009.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to check if Russell Westbrook played for the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009. Looking at the table provided, there are several entries under the \"Opponent\" column, but none of them mention the Spurs as the opponent when Westbrook was playing. Instead, his team seems to have faced teams like Miami Heat, LA Clippers, etc., but not the Spurs. So this already raises a red flag.\n\nNext, I should look into whether Russell Westbrook had any games where he led in assists during March 2009. The claim says he did this 10 times, so I need to check each game row for his assist counts and see if they are the highest among his team in those games.\n\nLooking through the table, I can see that the \"Assists\" column lists Russell Westbrook's assists per game. For example, on March 1st against Miami Heat, he had 5 assists. Then on March 3rd against LA Clippers, he had 4 assists. In some games, like March 20th against Boston Celtics, he had 7 assists.\n\nHowever, I don't see any instance where his assist count is significantly higher than other players in the team for that game. The \"Assists\" column only shows Westbrook's numbers, but without data on his teammates' assists, it's hard to confirm if he led the team each time. Moreover, the claim specifies 10 times, which would require checking each of those games.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the table again, I notice that the \"Opponent\" column doesn't have any entries for San Antonio Spurs. So Westbrook wasn't playing against the Spurs in March 2009 according to this data. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because he wasn't even with the Spurs then.\n\nAdditionally, considering Westbrook's career timeline, he was playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder around that time, not the Spurs. The Spurs have a different roster, including players like Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, who were more likely to lead in assists rather than Westbrook.\n\nPutting it all together, since there are no games listed where the opponent is San Antonio Spurs with Westbrook as a player, and given his actual team at that time was the Thunder, the claim doesn't hold up. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim mentions Russell Westbrook leading the San Antonio Spurs in assists 10 times during March 2009.\n\n2. **Check Team Affiliation:** Review the table to see if Russell Westbrook played for the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009. No games list the Spurs as opponents, indicating he wasn't with that team then.\n\n3. **Assist Counts:** Examine the \"Assists\" column for each game to find instances where Westbrook had high assists. However, without data on his teammates' assists, it's unclear if he led the team.\n\n4. **Frequency of Leading Assists:** The claim states 10 times, but the table doesn't show consistent evidence of him leading in that many games, especially given no Spurs opponents.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Lack of relevant data supporting the claim and Westbrook's known affiliation with another team make the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "nick collison lead the oklahoma city thunder in point score 6 game in a row in march of 2009",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"Nick Collison led the Oklahoma City Thunder in point scoring in six games in a row in March of 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are \"Date\" and \"Points\". Each row represents a game played by the team.\n\nI need to check each game in March 2009 and see if Nick Collison was the leading scorer in six consecutive games. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 37: March 1, 2009 - Points scored by players are listed as \"Nick Collison (16)\", which seems to be a typo because the points should be separated properly. Assuming it's 16 points for Collison. I'll note this as he led with 16.\n\nRow 38: March 4, 2009 - The points are listed as \"Nick Collison (20)\". So again, Collison scored 20 points and likely led the team.\n\nRow 39: March 7, 2009 - Points are \"Nick Collison (16)\". Another game where he's leading with 16.\n\nRow 40: March 8, 2009 - Here, it says \"Jeff Green (16)\", so Collison didn't lead this game. This breaks the consecutive streak if we were looking for six in a row.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check more games after that. Let me continue.\n\nRow 41: March 10, 2009 - Points are \"Nick Collison (23)\". He leads again with 23 points.\n\nRow 42: March 12, 2009 - \"Jeff Green (18)\" is the leading scorer. So, another break in the streak.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm missing something. The claim says six games in a row, so perhaps it's not necessarily starting from March 1. Maybe there was a stretch later in the month where he led consecutively.\n\nLet me look further down the table:\n\nRow 47: March 20, 2009 - Points are \"Jeff Green (26)\". Not Collison leading here.\n\nRow 48: March 22, 2009 - \"Kevin Durant (30)\" is the top scorer. No Collison lead.\n\nWait, but earlier rows show that in some games, Collison led, and others he didn't. I need to check if there's a sequence of six consecutive games where he was the leading scorer each time.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRow 37: March 1 - Collison leads (assuming 16 points)\nRow 38: March 4 - Collison leads (20)\nRow 39: March 7 - Collison leads (16)\nRow 40: March 8 - Jeff Green leads\nSo, the streak was broken after three games.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 41: March 10 - Collison leads again (23)\nRow 42: March 12 - Jeff Green leads (18)\nStreak broken again after just one game.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 56: March 27, 2009 - \"Nick Collison (21)\" leads with 21 points.\nRow 57: March 29, 2009 - \"Russell Westbrook (23)\" is the top scorer. So, only one game where Collison led.\n\nI don't see any instance where Collison led in six consecutive games. The maximum streak I found was three games from March 1 to March 7, but then it broke on March 8. After that, he led again on March 10 and March 27, but not consecutively for six games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}, {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}, {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}, {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"19136 fan attend San Antonio Spur game at the Air Canada Centre 4 separate occasions during March 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Number of Fans (19136):** We need to check if there's a row where the attendance is exactly 19136.\n2. **San Antonio Spurs:** Identify rows where the opponent is \"san antonio.\"\n3. **Air Canada Centre:** Look for games held at this venue.\n4. **Four Separate Occasions in March 2009:** We need to see if there are four instances of such games.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The relevant columns are:\n  - Column D: Opponent\n  - Column H: Venue (Column name from the initial description; actual column might be different, but based on the data, it's likely the 8th or 9th column)\n  - Column I: Attendance (assuming the columns are ordered as per the example given)\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, each row has:\n\nColumns:\n0. Rank\n1. Opponent\n2. Date\n3. Start Time\n4. Result\n5. Team Points\n6. Opponent Points\n7. Notes\n8. Attendance\n\nSo, Column 1 is Opponent, Column 2 is Date, and Column 8 is Attendance.\n\nNow, let's go through each row to find any games against the San Antonio Spurs at the Air Canada Centre with attendance of 19136.\n\nLooking for \"san antonio\" in the Opponent column:\n\n- Rows where Opponent is \"san antonio\":\n  - Let's see: Scanning through rows, I don't immediately see a row where the opponent is \"San Antonio Spurs.\" Wait, actually, looking at each row:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 73 (March games). Checking for any mention of San Antonio Spurs in Opponent column. \n\nWait, upon closer inspection, I realize that in the table provided, there are no entries with \"san antonio\" as the opponent. All opponents listed are teams like \"miami heat,\" \"cleveland cavaliers,\" etc., but none say \"san antonio.\" So, it seems there are no games against San Antonio Spurs in this table.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking through each row from 0 to 73, looking at the Opponent column (Column 1). For example:\n\n- Row 6: Opponent is \"san antonio\" \u2013 Wait, no, actually, in the provided data, there's a row where opponent is \"san antonio.\" Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Looking back:\n\nLooking at each row, for instance:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"miami heat\"\nRow 1: \"cleveland cavaliers\"\n...\nRow 63: \"phoenix suns\"\nRow 72: \"toronto\"\n\nI don't see any opponent named \"san antonio.\" Wait, perhaps the team name is listed as \"spurs\" or something else? Or maybe it's a typo in the claim.\n\nWait, in the table provided, I see that some venues are \"at&t center,\" which is San Antonio's venue. But looking at the Opponent column, I don't see any mention of San Antonio Spurs.\n\nSo, if there are no games against the San Antonio Spurs in this table, then the claim can't be true because there's no such game to attend four times.\n\nAdditionally, even if there were games against them, we'd have to check the venue. The claim mentions Air Canada Centre, which is in Toronto. In the table, the venue for some games is \"air canada centre\" (e.g., row 72). But if the opponent isn't San Antonio Spurs in any of those games, then it's irrelevant.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a row where Opponent is \"san antonio.\" Scanning through all rows:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 73:\n\n- Row 0: miami heat\n- Row 1: cleveland cavaliers\n- Row 2: new york knicks\n- ...\n- Row 6: dallas mavericks\n- Row 7: oklahoma city thunder\n- Row 8: portland trail blazers\n- ...\n- No, I don't see any row where Opponent is \"san antonio.\"\n\nTherefore, since there are no games against the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009 as per this table, the claim that 19136 fans attended four such games at Air Canada Centre must be false.\n\nAdditionally, checking for attendance of 19136:\n\nLooking through Column 8 (Attendance), I see various numbers. For example, row 7 has an attendance of \"18532\" and row 30 has \"19136.\" Wait, in the table provided, is there a row with attendance exactly 19136?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data:\n\nRow indices (assuming from 0 to 73):\n\n- Row 7: Attendance 18532\n- Row 30: Let me check. The initial table shows rows up to row 73, but the exact numbers aren't provided in the description. However, if in any row, the attendance is 19136 and opponent is San Antonio Spurs at Air Canada Centre, then it could be possible.\n\nBut since there are no opponents listed as \"san antonio,\" even if there's a game with attendance 19136, it's not against them. Therefore, the claim can't be true based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are no games against the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009 according to the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements of the Claim:**\n   - Attendance: 19,136 fans\n   - Opponent: San Antonio Spurs\n   - Venue: Air Canada Centre\n   - Occasions: Four separate games in March 2009\n\n2. **Analyze the Table for Relevance:**\n   - Check each row for opponent being \"San Antonio Spurs\" and venue as \"Air Canada Centre.\"\n   - Verify if any rows have attendance of 19,136.\n\n3. **Findings:**\n   - No row lists the opponent as \"San Antonio Spurs.\"\n   - The venue \"Air Canada Centre\" appears in some rows (e.g., Row 72), but without a game against San Antonio Spurs.\n   - Attendance of 19,136 may exist, but not for games against the claimed opponent at the specified venue.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no games against the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009 as per the table, the claim cannot be true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. There are no entries of games against the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009 according to the provided data.",
