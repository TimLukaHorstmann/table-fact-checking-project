    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table of football match results and a specific claim about a match involving Liverpool on January 30, 1991, with the score being 2-3. My task is to verify if this claim holds true based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The columns are: Round, Home Team, Away Team, Score, and Date. Each row represents a match between two teams, with details about when it took place and the result.\n\nThe claim states that \"the score be 2 - 3 when the away team be Liverpool on the date of 30 / 01 / 1991.\" So, I'm looking for a match where Liverpool is the away team, the date is January 30, 1991, and the score was 2-3.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find any entries that mention Liverpool as the away team. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 0: The away team is Chelsea, so this isn't relevant.\nRow 1: Away team is Tottenham Hotspur, not Liverpool.\nRow 2: West Bromwich Albion are the away team here.\nRow 3: Here it says \"away team be liverpool.\" That matches part of our claim. Let's note this row for further checking.\n\nNow, looking at Row 3 specifically:\n- Home Team: Chelsea\n- Away Team: Liverpool\n- Score: 2 - 3\n- Date: 30 / 01 / 1991\n\nThe date matches exactly what the claim states. The score is indeed 2-3, which aligns with the claim's assertion of a 2-3 result. Since Liverpool is listed as the away team and the date is correct, this row fully supports the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might have Liverpool as the away team on the same date. Scanning through the rest:\n\nRows 4 to 16 don't mention Liverpool in the away team column, so Row 3 is the only relevant one.\n\nTherefore, all conditions of the claim are satisfied by this specific entry in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported as Row 3 meets all specified conditions: away team is Liverpool, date is January 30, 1991, and score is 2-3.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to verify a claim against the provided table and determine whether it's TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly: \"the score be 1 - 0 when the away team be bolton wanderer.\" So, we're looking for a row where the away team is Bolton Wanderers and the score is 1-0. \n\nNow, let's examine the structure of the table. The columns are:\n\n- Row Index\n- Home Team\n- Score\n- Away Team\n- Date\n\nSo, I'll need to look at each row and check two conditions: whether the away team is Bolton Wanderers and if the score in that same row is 1-0.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home Team - Manchester City, Score - 3-0, Away Team - Birmingham City. The away team isn't Bolton, so this doesn't matter.\n2. **Row 1**: Home Team - Liverpool, Score - 1-1, Away Team - Tottenham Hotspur. Again, the away team is not Bolton.\n3. **Row 2**: Home Team - Everton, Score - 0-1, Away Team - Chelsea. The score is reversed here (Away team scored more), and the away team isn't Bolton.\n4. **Row 3**: Home Team - Newcastle United, Score - 3-1, Away Team - Leeds United. Not relevant as the away team isn't Bolton.\n5. **Row 4**: Home Team - Sunderland, Score - 0-2, Away Team - Arsenal. The away team is Arsenal, not Bolton.\n6. **Row 5**: Home Team - West Ham United, Score - 1-2, Away Team - Aston Villa. Not relevant.\n7. **Row 6**: Home Team - Birmingham City, Score - 0-3, Away Team - Manchester United. No.\n8. **Row 7**: Home Team - Tottenham Hotspur, Score - 2-1, Away Team - West Ham United. The away team is West Ham, not Bolton.\n9. **Row 8**: Home Team - Chelsea, Score - 1-0, Away Team - Middlesbrough. Here, the away team isn't Bolton, so this doesn't fit.\n10. **Row 9**: Home Team - Manchester United, Score - 2-0, Away Team - Liverpool. No.\n11. **Row 10**: Home Team - Arsenal, Score - 2-0, Away Team - Everton. The away team is Everton, not Bolton.\n12. **Row 11**: Home Team - Sheffield Wednesday, Score - 4-1, Away Team - Norwich City. Not relevant.\n13. **Row 12**: Home Team - Queens Park Rangers, Score - 0-2, Away Team - Manchester United. No.\n14. **Row 13**: Home Team - Stoke City, Score - 1-0, Away Team - Bolton Wanderers. Ah! Here we go. The away team is Bolton Wanderers, and the score is 1-0. This fits both conditions in the claim.\n\nSo, upon reviewing each row, only Row 13 matches the criteria where the away team is Bolton Wanderers, and the score is 1-0. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data point.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim about Woking is correct based on the table provided. The claim says, \"for the home team of Woking, the tie number be 5 and the score be 0 - 1.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the table to find where Woking is mentioned as the home team. Scanning through the rows, I see that there are several entries with \"Woking\" as one of the teams. Specifically, I notice that in row 4 (assuming the first data row is index 0), the home team is Woking.\n\nNow, let's check what information we have about this tie. The tie number should be 5 according to the claim. Looking at the table structure, I see columns for \"Tie Number\" and \"Score.\" In row 4, the Tie Number is indeed listed as 5. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, examining the score in that same row, it shows \"0 - 1.\" The claim states that the score should be 0-1, which aligns perfectly with what's in the table. \n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, I'll check if there are any other instances where Woking is the home team. Looking through the rest of the rows, I don't see another entry for Woking as a home team. This means that row 4 is the only relevant one.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim\u2014tie number being 5 and score being 0-1\u2014are accurately represented in the table. So, the answer should be \"TRUE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Tie Number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim: \"the score be 1 - 0 when the home team be shrewsbury town.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided and understand its structure. The columns are \"No\", \"Home Team\", \"Score\", \"Away Team\", \"Date\". Each row represents a match with details about the teams and the score.\n\nThe claim is about a specific scenario where the home team is Shrewsbury Town, and the score in that match was 1-0. My task is to check if this is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row of the table to find any entry where the \"Home Team\" is Shrewsbury Town. Let's go through the rows one by one:\n\nRow 0: Home team is Brighton & Hove Albion, so not relevant.\nRow 1: Home team is Brentford, nope.\nRow 2: Home team is Bournemouth, no.\nRow 3: Home team is Colchester United, still no.\nRow 4: Home team is Crewe Alexandra, not Shrewsbury.\nRow 5: Home team is Stoke City, no.\nRow 6: Home team is Watford, nope.\nRow 7: Home team is Walsall, not relevant.\nRow 8: Home team is Rotherham United, no.\nRow 9: Home team is Shrewsbury Town! Okay, this is the row we're interested in.\n\nNow that I've found the row where the home team is Shrewsbury Town (row index 9), I need to check the score. Looking at the \"Score\" column for that row, it says 1 - 2. Wait a minute, that's not 1-0 as claimed. The score here is actually 1-2.\n\nSo the claim states that when Shrewsbury Town was the home team, the score was 1-0. However, according to the table, their score in that match was 1-2. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where Shrewsbury Town is the home team, just to be thorough. Looking through the remaining rows:\n\nRow 10: Home team is Manchester United, no.\nRow 11: Norwich City, not relevant.\nRow 12: Millwall, nope.\nRow 13: Port Vale vs Manchester City, no.\nRow 14: Arsenal vs Leeds United, doesn't apply.\nRows after that don't have Shrewsbury Town as the home team either.\n\nSo there's only one match where Shrewsbury Town was the home team, and in that case, the score wasn't 1-0. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any other matches involving Shrewsbury Town as the home team. Scanning through all rows again confirms there's only one such entry.\n\nTo sum up: The relevant cell for the \"Home Team\" being Shrewsbury Town is row index 9, and the corresponding \"Score\" in that row is 1-2, not 1-0. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the specific match where Shrewsbury Town was the home team and confirming the score.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user has provided a table with various match details and a specific claim they want verified. The claim is: \"the score be 2-2 when the away team be brighton and heave albion.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's stating that there was a game where the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion (I think they meant that but wrote 'heave albion'\u2014probably a typo), and the score in that game was 2-2. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows where the away team is Brighton & Hove Albion and check if the score for that row is indeed 2-2.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's 'Away Team' column. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Away Team is \"brighton and heave albion.\" Wait, the name seems a bit off\u2014it should probably be \"Brighton & Hove Albion,\" but maybe it's just how it's written here. So this might be the team in question.\n\nLooking at the score in row 0, under the 'Score' column, it says \"2-2.\" That matches the claim exactly. \n\nNow, I need to make sure there are no other rows where the away team is Brighton & Hove Albion and the score isn't 2-2. Let me check the rest of the table:\n\nRow 1: Away Team is \"bolton wanderers\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Away Team is \"sheffield wednesday\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 3: Away Team is \"brighton and heave albion\" again, but looking at the score here... Wait, row 3's 'Score' column shows \"1-0.\" So that's a different game where Brighton was the away team and lost 1-0. But in row 0, they drew 2-2.\n\nWait, does the claim specify only one game or all games? The way it's phrased seems to indicate that when the away team is Brighton, the score should be 2-2. However, since there are multiple rows with Brighton as the away team and different scores, this complicates things.\n\nBut looking back at row 0, which does have a 2-2 score with Brighton as the away team, the claim is partially true for that specific game. However, because in another game (row 3), Brighton was the away team but the score wasn't 2-2, this means the claim isn't universally true for all such games.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim might just be making a statement about whether there exists at least one instance where Brighton as the away team had a 2-2 score. So in that case, since row 0 satisfies it, maybe the answer is TRUE. But I'm not entirely sure if the claim is asserting that all such games have a 2-2 score or just that at least one does.\n\nGiven the wording: \"the score be 2-2 when the away team be brighton and heave albion.\" It could be interpreted as whenever Brighton plays away, the score is 2-2. But since row 3 shows a different score for Brighton as away, it's not always true. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported across all relevant instances.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim might just be stating that in at least one game where Brighton was the away team, the score was 2-2. In that case, row 0 supports it, so the answer would be TRUE. However, if the claim is implying that all games with Brighton as away ended 2-2, then it's FALSE because of row 3.\n\nGiven the phrasing, I think it's more likely the former: checking whether there exists a game where the away team was Brighton and the score was 2-2. So in that case, since row 0 exists, the answer would be TRUE. But to be thorough, let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Away Team is \"brighton and heave albion,\" Score is 2-2.\nRow 3: Same away team but score is 1-0.\n\nSo there are multiple games with Brighton as away, some with different scores. So if the claim is that whenever they're the away team, it's 2-2, then it's FALSE because of row 3. But if it's just asking whether there exists at least one instance where they were away and the score was 2-2, then it's TRUE.\n\nI think the claim is likely asserting existence rather than universality. So, given that, I would say the answer is TRUE, with relevant cells in row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"is_claim_supported\": true,\n    \"evidence_rows\": [0]\n  },\n  \"step_by_step_explanation\": \"The claim states that when the away team is 'brighton and heave albion,' the score is 2-2.

(Assuming the table continues with more rows beyond what's visible here)\n\nWait, in the provided HTML table, after row 16, there are no more rows listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with match data and a specific claim about a particular game. My task is to verify whether the claim is true or false based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"2 - 3 be the score when the home team be liverpool after 30 / 01 / 1991.\" So, breaking this down, there are a few key pieces of information we need to check:\n\n1. The home team is Liverpool.\n2. The score was 2-3.\n3. This match occurred on or after January 30, 1991.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different match with details like the home team, away team, and the date of the game. My goal is to find any rows where Liverpool is the home team, check the score, and ensure the date meets the criteria.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Birmingham City, not Liverpool.\n- Row 1: Home team is Liverpool. The score here is 2-3, and the date is 30/01/1991, which matches exactly with the claim's date condition of being \"after\" that date.\n\nWait a second\u2014the date in row 1 is on 30/01/1991. The claim says \"after,\" so does this mean it has to be strictly after that date? Or does it include games on that exact date? Typically, \"after\" can sometimes mean excluding the date itself, but in some contexts, it might include it. However, since the table lists this game on that exact date, and the claim doesn't specify whether it's inclusive or exclusive, I think we should consider this as a valid match because it's on or after 30/01/1991.\n\nLooking further down the table:\n\n- Row 2: Home team is Liverpool again. The score here is 1-0 with a date of 27/01/1991, which is before the target date.\n  \nOther rows either don't have Liverpool as the home team or their dates don't meet the criteria.\n\nSo, focusing back on row 1: Liverpool (home) vs. some away team, score 2-3, and the date is exactly 30/01/1991. Since the claim mentions \"after\" that date, it's a bit ambiguous whether to include games on that day or only those after. However, in most cases, including the exact date is acceptable unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, based on row 1, all conditions of the claim are satisfied: Liverpool as the home team, score 2-3, and the date being 30/01/1991. Thus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: The claim specifies the home team (Liverpool), the score (2-3), and the date (after January 30, 1991).\n\n2. **Locate Liverpool as Home Team**: Scanning the table, row 1 shows Liverpool as the home team.\n\n3. **Check Score**: In row 1, the score is 2-3 against Birmingham City.\n\n4. **Verify Date**: The date for this match is exactly January 30, 1991, which meets the \"after\" condition if inclusive of that day.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: All conditions are met in row 1, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

In the 'Goals For' and 'Goals Against' columns for Bolton Wanderers, we see that they have 47 goals for and 45 against. However, these are cumulative totals for the entire season or competition period, not specific to individual matches.\n\nWithout information about each match's details, such as who was home or away in a particular game, it's impossible to verify if Bolton Wanderers were the home team for the specific 1-0 match mentioned in the claim. The table only provides aggregate statistics, not detailed per-match data.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data indicating that Bolton Wanderers were the home team with a 1-0 score in any specific game, and considering the lack of necessary details in the provided table, the claim cannot be supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the task is to verify a claim based on the given table data. The claim is: \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Hmm, that wording seems a bit off. Maybe it's a translation issue or some kind of typo? I'll need to parse it carefully.\n\nFirst, breaking down the claim: \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" It sounds like there are two parts here:\n1. \"5 be the tie no\" \u2013 perhaps meaning that the fifth (tie number 5) should not exist or is tied.\n2. \"before the away team be woking\" \u2013 maybe indicating that in some matches, the away team is Woking.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about what exactly the claim is asserting. Let's try to interpret it more clearly. Perhaps it means: In tie number 5, the away team should not have been Woking. Or maybe that before tie 5, Woking wasn't involved as an away team. Alternatively, it might be stating that in the fifth row (row index 4, since we start at 0), the away team isn't Woking.\n\nLooking back at the table provided, I'll need to examine each relevant cell to see if the claim holds true. Let's go through the table data step by step.\n\nThe table has several columns: \"Tie No.\", \"Home Team\", \"Away Team\", \"Result\", and \"Date\". Each row represents a match with its details.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the rows and their details for clarity:\n\n1. Row 0:\n   - Tie No.: 1\n   - Home Team: Chelsea\n   - Away Team: Reading\n   - Result: 2-1\n   - Date: 26/01/1991\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - Tie No.: 2\n   - Home Team: Tottenham Hotspur\n   - Away Team: Watford\n   - Result: 4-3\n   - Date: 26/01/1991\n\n3. Row 2:\n   - Tie No.: 3\n   - Home Team: Liverpool\n   - Away Team: Everton\n   - Result: 2-0\n   - Date: 26/01/1991\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - Tie No.: 4\n   - Home Team: Southampton\n   - Away Team: Birmingham City\n   - Result: 3-2\n   - Date: 26/01/1991\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - Tie No.: 5\n   - Home Team: West Ham United\n   - Away Team: Woking\n   - Result: 3-0\n   - Date: 26/01/1991\n\n... and so on for other rows, but the claim specifically mentions tie number 5.\n\nSo, the claim is about tie no. 5. Let's look at row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0). The Tie No. is 5, Home Team is West Ham United, Away Team is Woking, Result is 3-0, Date is 26/01/1991.\n\nNow, the claim says \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" If I interpret this as: Before (i.e., in tie number 5), the away team should not be Woking. But according to row index 4, the Away Team is indeed Woking. So if the claim is stating that in tie 5, the away team shouldn't be Woking, then it's false because they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim means that before tie 5 (i.e., in earlier ties), the away team wasn't Woking. Looking at rows 0-3, the away teams are Reading, Watford, Everton, Birmingham City. So none of them are Woking. That would mean the claim is true because before tie 5, Woking wasn't an away team.\n\nWait, but the way the claim is phrased might be a bit unclear. Let me re-express it: \"In tie no. 5, the away team should not be Woking.\" But according to row index 4, in Tie No. 5, the away team is Woking. So if the claim is that in Tie 5, the away team isn't Woking, then it's false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that before tie no. 5 (i.e., ties 1-4), the away team wasn't Woking. In that case, since none of the earlier ties have Woking as an away team, the claim would be true.\n\nBut the exact wording is: \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Maybe it's trying to say that before Tie 5, there was a tie where the away team was Woking. But in rows 0-4, the first occurrence of Woking as an away team is in Tie 5 (row index 4). So prior to that, they weren't involved.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before the away team be woking\" \u2013 so maybe it's saying that before tie 5, there was a tie where the away team was Woking. But according to the data, in Tie 1-4, the away teams are Reading, Watford, Everton, Birmingham City. No Woking yet. So if the claim is asserting that before tie 5, the away team wasn't Woking, then it's correct because prior ties don't have Woking as an away team.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that in tie no. 5, the away team should not be Woking, but according to row index 4, they are. So the claim would be false in that case.\n\nI think I need to clarify what exactly the claim is asserting. Given the phrasing \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking,\" it seems like two separate statements:\n1. Tie number 5 exists.\n2. Before that (in earlier ties), the away team was Woking.\n\nBut in our table, the first occurrence of Woking as an away team is in Tie 5. So prior to that, they weren't an away team. Therefore, the claim would be incorrect because before tie 5, there's no tie where the away team was Woking. Alternatively, if it's saying that in tie 5, the away team isn't Woking, but according to the data, they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misphrased and meant to say \"In tie number 5, the away team should be Woking,\" which is true. But that doesn't fit with the given phrasing.\n\nWait, maybe the user is trying to say that in tie no. 5, there was a tie before where the away team was Woking. But according to our data, Woking only appears as an away team in Tie 5. So prior to that, they weren't involved. Therefore, the claim would be incorrect because before tie 5, there's no tie with Woking as the away team.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is trying to say that tie number 5 should not exist or shouldn't have happened, but that seems unrelated to the data provided.\n\nGiven all this confusion, I think the best approach is to check if in tie no. 5, the away team is indeed Woking. From row index 4, it is. So if the claim is stating that in tie 5, the away team shouldn't be Woking, then it's false because they are.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is saying that before tie 5, there was a tie where the away team was Woking, which isn't the case here, then the claim would be false.\n\nSo based on this analysis, I think the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should reflect that the claim is not true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Interpreting this as an assertion that in Tie No. 5, the away team should not be Woking or that prior to Tie 5, Woking wasn't an away team. According to the table data:\n\n- In Tie No. 5 (row index 4), the away team is indeed Woking.\n- Before Tie 5 (Ties 1-4), the away teams are Reading, Watford, Everton, and Birmingham City; Woking does not appear as an away team in these earlier ties.\n\nIf the claim implies that before Tie 5, the away team was Woking, it is false because they weren't. However, if it suggests that in Tie 5, the away team shouldn't be Woking, it's also false since they are listed as such.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect based on the provided data. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{False}",
