    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The opponent in week 14 should be the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2. The attendance for that game should be 74,524.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find the one corresponding to week 14.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n- Week 4: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs, attendance 75037.\n- Week 14: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs again. Let me check the details here. The date is December 16, 2001, opponent isKansas City Chiefs, result is L 26 -23, and attendance is77778.\n\nWait, but according to the claim, the attendance should be 74524 for week 14. However, in row index 14 (assuming rows start from 0?), let me count properly:\n\nActually, looking at the table structure, it's better to count each <tr> as a row starting from 0.\n\nLooking through all weeks:\n- Week 4 is at row index 3 (since week 1 starts at index 0). Attendance there is75037.\n- Week 14 would be later. Scanning down, I see a row for week 14: the opponent is Kansas City Chiefs, date December 16, result L26-23, attendance 77778.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each <tr> entry:\n\nRow index breakdown:\n0: Week 1\n1: Week 2\n...\n3: Week4 (opponent K.C. Chiefs, attendance75037)\n...\n12: Week13 (opponent Seattle Seahawks, attendance74524)\nWait, no. Let me recount properly.\n\nThe table has rows for weeks 1 to 17, but looking at the data:\n\nRow index 0: week1\nindex1: week2\nindex2: week3\nindex3: week4 (opponent K.C., attendance75037)\n...\nContinuing down, row index13 is week14.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the rows with their indices:\n\nRow 0: Week1 - Jan 6, 2002? Wait, wait, looking at the last few weeks:\n\nWait, the table's tbody starts from week1 to week17, but in the HTML provided, the rows are listed as:\n\n<tr> for week1 (index0)\n...\nup to row index14: week15?\nWait no, perhaps better to go step by step.\n\nLooking at the <tbody>, each <tr> is a new row. Let's count from 0:\n\nRow 0: Week1\nRow1: Week2\nRow2: Week3\nRow3: Week4 (opponent K.C.)\n...\nContinuing until Row13: week14, which has opponent Kansas City Chiefs and attendance77778.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about week14. So according to the table, week14 is at row index 13 (since weeks start at1), so the row for week14 would be at row index13.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow12: Week13\nOpponent: Seattle Seahawks, attendance74524. That's in row12 (index12). So that's week13 with K.C. as opponent? No, week13 has opponent Seattle Seahawks, not K.C.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again:\n\nIn the table provided, the rows are:\n\nWeek 1: Jan6, opp Indianapolis Colts\n...\nThen there is a row for week4: December2, 2001? Wait, perhaps I should list all weeks correctly.\n\nLooking at each <tr> in order:\n\nRow index and week number:\n\n0: Week1 (Jan6)\n1: Week2 (?)\nWait no, the table's data as per the HTML provided shows that the first row is for week 1 on Jan6? Wait, looking at the last rows:\n\nThe table has 17 weeks, but in the HTML tbody, I see up to row index15 (since there are 17 rows, from 0 to 16). Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each <tr> in the tbody:\n\n<tr> for week1: Jan6? No, looking at the dates, perhaps it's more accurate to check by opponent.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to scan through all the weeks and find where the opponent is Kansas City Chiefs in week14.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two entries for K.C. Chiefs:\n\n- Week4: row index3\n- Week14: row index13\n\nIn row index13 (week14), the opponent is K.C., attendance77778.\n\nBut the claim says that in week14, the opponent was K.C. with attendance74524.\n\nWait, but according to the table, in week14, attendance is77778, not 74524.\n\nLooking again at row index13:\n\nOpponent: Kansas City Chiefs\nAttendance:77778\n\nBut the claim says 74524. Therefore, this part is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, but in another week, perhaps week13?\n\nLooking back, week13 (row index12):\n\nDate: December9, 2001\nOpponent: Seattle Seahawks\nResult: W20-7\nAttendance:74524\n\nSo the attendance of74524 is for a game against Seattle, not K.C.\n\nTherefore, the claim that in week14, opponent was K.C. with attendance74524 is incorrect because:\n\n- Week14's opponent is indeed K.C., but attendance is77778.\n- The attendance of74524 was for a game against Seattle in week13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait no, wait: the claim says \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524\".\n\nSo both conditions must be met:\n\n- Opponent is K.C. in week14: correct\n- Attendance is74524: incorrect (it's77778)\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"in week 14, the opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs with an attendance of 74,524\" is **false**. \n\nIn week 14:\n- The opponent was indeed the Kansas City Chiefs.\n- However, the attendance was **77,778**, not 74,524.\n\nThe correct attendance figure of 74,524 occurred in a different game against the Seattle Seahawks during week 13. Therefore, both conditions in the claim are not simultaneously true, making the statement false.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",
