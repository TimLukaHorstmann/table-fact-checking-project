    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to determine if the claim \"melbourne have the lowest score when playing as the away team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to identify instances where Melbourne was the away team. The columns that matter here are \"away team\" and their corresponding \"away team score.\" \n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Footscray vs St Kilda: Away team is St Kilda with a score of 9.11 (65).\n2. Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: Away team is North Melbourne, but their score isn't relevant since we're looking for Melbourne.\n3. Essendon vs Richmond: Away team is Richmond, so not applicable.\n4. Carlton vs South Melbourne: Again, away team is South Melbourne, not the team in question.\n5. Hawthorn vs Geelong: Away team is Geelong, which doesn't match.\n6. Collingwood vs Melbourne: Here's Melbourne as the away team with a score of 8.10 (58).\n\nNow, I check if there are other rows where Melbourne was the away team. In this table, it only appears once in row index 5. \n\nNext, I compare this score to other away team scores to see if it's indeed the lowest. The scores for away teams are:\n- St Kilda: 65\n- North Melbourne: 66 (from Fitzroy vs North Melbourne)\nWait, actually, no. Wait, each row has an away team and their score. So looking at all rows:\n\n1. Away team score: 9.11 (65) - St Kilda\n2. Away team score: 9.12 (66) - North Melbourne\n3. Away team score: 17.9 (111) - Richmond\n4. Away team score: 8.15 (63) - South Melbourne\n5. Away team score: 15.8 (98) - Geelong\n6. Away team score: 8.10 (58) - Melbourne\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The away teams and their scores are:\n\n- St Kilda: 65\n- North Melbourne: 66\n- Richmond: 111\n- South Melbourne: 63\n- Geelong:98\n- Melbourne:58\n\nSo the scores in order from lowest to highest: 58 (Melbourne), 63, 65, 66, 98, 111. So yes, Melbourne's score of 58 is indeed the lowest among all away teams.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that the \"collingwood v melbourne game have the largest crowd size.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several rows and columns. Each row represents a game between two teams, with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe relevant information here is the \"crowd\" column because that's what determines if one game had a larger audience than another. I'll go through each row to find out which game has the highest crowd number.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Footscray vs St Kilda: Crowd is 18,655.\n2. Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: Crowd is 7,007.\n3. Essendon vs Richmond: Crowd is 22,251.\n4. Carlton vs South Melbourne: Crowd is 14,465.\n5. Hawthorn vs Geelong: Crowd is 12,425.\n6. Collingwood vs Melbourne: Crowd is 30,883.\n\nNow, comparing all these numbers:\n\n- The highest number I see here is 30,883 for the Collingwood vs Melbourne game at VFL Park on July 15, 1972. \n\nSo, this is indeed the largest crowd size among all the listed games. Therefore, the claim that \"the collingwood v melbourne game have the largest crowd size\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this are in row index 5 (since counting starts from 0), specifically the 'crowd' column which shows 30,883 for that particular game.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the crowd at the fitzroy vs north melbourne game be smaller than the crowd at the essendon v richmond game.\"\n\nFirst, I need to locate both games in the table. Let's look through each row:\n\n1. **Fitzroy vs North Melbourne**: Looking for the row where the home team is Fitzroy and the away team is North Melbourne. Scanning the rows:\n   - The second row has Fitzroy as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team. So, that's the first game.\n\n2. **Essendon vs Richmond**: Next, find the row with Essendon as the home team and Richmond as the away team. Checking each row:\n   - The third row lists Essendon as the home team against Richmond. That's our second game.\n\nNow, I need to compare the crowd numbers for these two games.\n\nFor Fitzroy vs North Melbourne:\n- The relevant cell is in the 'crowd' column of that row. The value here is 7007.\n\nFor Essendon vs Richmond:\n- Again, looking at the 'crowd' column for this row. The number listed is 22251.\n\nComparing the two numbers: 7007 (Fitzroy game) and 22251 (Essendon game). Clearly, 7007 is smaller than 22251. Therefore, the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was indeed smaller than that at the Essendon vs Richmond game.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the average of all the home team score be 15.67\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. It looks like a list of football matches with details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd numbers, and date. All these games were played on 15 July 1972.\n\nThe claim is about the average of all the home team scores being 15.67. So I need to extract each home team's score from the table, calculate their average, and then compare it to 15.67.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different match. The \"home team score\" column has entries like \"14.7 (91)\", which I think represents goals and behinds with total points in parentheses. But since the claim is about the average of the scores, I should consider the numerical values.\n\nWait, but how are these scores represented? For example, 14.7 might be 14 goals and 7 behinds, but to get a numerical value for averaging, maybe we need to calculate total points or use the first number (goals) as the score. However, in some sports like Australian Rules Football, the score is often presented as goals.behinds (total points). So perhaps each home team's score should be converted into total points.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n1. Footscray: 14.7 (91)\n2. Fitzroy: 16.14 (110)\n3. Essendon: 13.12 (90)\n4. Carlton: 20.8 (128)\n5. Hawthorn: 19.14 (128)\n6. Collingwood: 10.13 (73)\n\nThe numbers in parentheses are the total points, which is calculated as goals multiplied by 6 plus behinds. So for Footscray, 14*6 +7 = 84 +7=91, which matches.\n\nBut the claim is about the average of the home team scores. The question is whether to take the goals (the first number), or the total points. Since the claim says \"home team score,\" and in sports, the score often refers to the total points, but sometimes just the goals. However, looking at the format, it's possible that the numbers are presented as goals.behinds.\n\nWait, but if we take each home team's score as the first number (goals), then:\n\n1. Footscray: 14\n2. Fitzroy: 16\n3. Essendon:13\n4. Carlton:20\n5. Hawthorn:19\n6. Collingwood:10\n\nAdding these up: 14+16=30, +13=43, +20=63, +19=82, +10=92.\n\nAverage would be total divided by number of teams (6). So 92 /6 = approximately 15.333...\n\nWait, that's about 15.33, which is lower than the claimed 15.67.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider each home team's score as their total points (the numbers in parentheses):\n\n14.7 (91) => 91\n16.14 (110) =>110\n13.12 (90)=>90\n20.8(128)=>128\n19.14 (128)=>128\n10.13 (73)=>73\n\nAdding these: 91+110=201, +90=291, +128=419, +128=547, +73=620.\n\nAverage is 620 /6 = approximately 103.333...\n\nBut the claim says the average is 15.67, which doesn't align with either approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's referring to the numerical value before parentheses, like 14.7 as a decimal number. So treating each home team score as a single numerical value, perhaps combining goals and behinds into a decimal.\n\nFor example:\n\nFootscray: 14.7\nFitzroy:16.14\nEssendon:13.12\nCarlton:20.8\nHawthorn:19.14\nCollingwood:10.13\n\nNow, adding these as decimals:\n\n14.7 +16.14 = 30.84\n+13.12=43.96\n+20.8=64.76\n+19.14=83.9\n+10.13=94.03\n\nTotal is 94.03, divided by 6 gives approximately 15.67.\n\nAh, so that's where the number comes from. The claim is taking each home team score as a decimal (goals.behinds), adding them up, and dividing by six to get an average of approximately 15.67.\n\nSo let's calculate it precisely:\n\nFootscray:14.7\nFitzroy:16.14\nEssendon:13.12\nCarlton:20.8\nHawthorn:19.14\nCollingwood:10.13\n\nAdding them up step by step:\n\nStart with 14.7 +16.14 = 30.84\n30.84 +13.12 = 43.96\n43.96 +20.8 = 64.76\n64.76 +19.14 = 83.9\n83.9 +10.13 =94.03\n\nTotal sum is 94.03.\n\nAverage: 94.03 /6 \u224815.671666...\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's approximately 15.67.\n\nSo the claim is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the average is indeed approximately 15.67.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true. The average of all home team scores, when each score is treated as a decimal (goals.behinds), is approximately 15.67.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Extract Home Team Scores:** Identify the \"home team score\" for each match:\n   - Footscray: 14.7\n   - Fitzroy: 16.14\n   - Essendon: 13.12\n   - Carlton: 20.8\n   - Hawthorn: 19.14\n   - Collingwood: 10.13\n\n2. **Convert to Decimal Values:** Treat each score as a decimal number.\n   \n3. **Sum the Scores:**\n   - 14.7 + 16.14 = 30.84\n   - 30.84 + 13.12 = 43.96\n   - 43.96 + 20.8 = 64.76\n   - 64.76 + 19.14 = 83.9\n   - 83.9 + 10.13 = 94.03\n\n4. **Calculate the Average:**\n   - Total sum = 94.03\n   - Number of scores = 6\n   - Average = 94.03 / 6 \u2248 15.671666...\n\n5. **Round to Two Decimal Places:** The average is approximately 15.67.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the average home team score is approximately 15.67.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"1 / 3 of the away team have a score greater than 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The table has six rows, each representing a game with columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All games are from July 15, 1972.\n\nThe claim is about the away teams' scores. So, I'll focus on the \"away team\" and \"away team score\" columns for each row.\n\nLet me list out the data:\n\nRow 0:\n- Away Team: St Kilda\n- Away Score: 9.11 (65)\n\nRow 1:\n- Away Team: North Melbourne\n- Away Score: 9.12 (66)\n\nRow 2:\n- Away Team: Richmond\n- Away Score: 17.9 (111)\n\nRow 3:\n- Away Team: South Melbourne\n- Away Score: 8.15 (63)\n\nRow 4:\n- Away Team: Geelong\n- Away Score: 15.8 (98)\n\nRow 5:\n- Away Team: Melbourne\n- Away Score: 8.10 (58)\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 0: St Kilda's score is 9.11 (65). The away team is St Kilda.\nRow 1: North Melbourne's score is 9.12 (66).\nRow 2: Richmond as away team scored 17.9 (111).\nRow 3: South Melbourne scored 8.15 (63).\nRow 4: Geelong scored 15.8 (98).\nRow 5: Melbourne scored 8.10 (58).\n\nWait, actually, in the HTML table provided, each row's away team score is as follows:\n\nRow 0: st kilda - 9.11 (65)\nRow 1: north melbourne - 9.12 (66)\nRow 2: richmond - 17.9 (111)\nRow 3: south melbourne - 8.15 (63)\nRow 4: geelong - 15.8 (98)\nRow 5: melbourne - 8.10 (58)\n\nSo, the away team scores are:\n\n- St Kilda: 65\n- North Melbourne: 66\n- Richmond: 111\n- South Melbourne: 63\n- Geelong: 98\n- Melbourne: 58\n\nWait, that can't be right because each row's away score is in the format like \"9.11 (65)\", where I think the number inside the parentheses is the total points.\n\nSo for each away team:\n\nRow 0: st kilda - 65\nRow 1: north melbourne - 66\nRow 2: richmond - 111\nRow 3: south melbourne - 63\nRow 4: geelong - 98\nRow 5: melbourne - 58\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether each away team's score is greater than 10. So, in this context, perhaps it refers to the total points (the number inside the parentheses). Alternatively, sometimes in sports like Australian Rules Football, scores are reported as goals and behinds, e.g., 9.11 means 9 goals (each worth 6 points) plus 11 behinds (each worth 1 point), totaling 9*6 + 11 = 54 + 11 = 65 points.\n\nBut the claim says \"score greater than 10.\" If we're considering just the goals, then 9.11 would be 9 goals. Alternatively, if it's about total points, which is 65 for st kilda.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me clarify: In Australian Rules Football, a team's score is often written as Goals.Behinds (Total Points). So, for example, \"14.7 (91)\" means 14 goals and 7 behinds, totaling 91 points because each goal is 6 points and each behind is 1 point.\n\nSo the claim says that \"1 / 3 of the away team have a score greater than 10.\" Here's where I need to clarify: does it refer to the total points or just goals?\n\nLooking at the way the scores are written, if we consider the total points (the number in parentheses), then all away teams except perhaps those with very low totals would be above 10. But let me check each:\n\nRow 0: st kilda - 65 points\nRow 1: north melbourne - 66 points\nRow 2: richmond - 111 points\nRow 3: south melbourne - 63 points\nRow 4: geelong - 98 points\nRow 5: melbourne - 58 points\n\nAll of these are way above 10. So, all 6 away teams have scores greater than 10 if we consider total points.\n\nBut that would mean the claim is \"1/3 of them\" which is 2 out of 6. But since all 6 have scores >10, this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the claim refers to goals only (the first number before the dot).\n\nSo let's check each away team's goals:\n\nRow 0: st kilda - 9 goals\nRow 1: north melbourne - 9 goals\nRow 2: richmond - 17 goals\nRow 3: south melbourne - 8 goals\nRow 4: geelong - 15 goals\nRow 5: melbourne - 8 goals\n\nSo, in this case, the number of away teams with more than 10 goals:\n\n- St Kilda: 9 (no)\n- North Melbourne: 9 (no)\n- Richmond: 17 (yes)\n- South Melbourne: 8 (no)\n- Geelong: 15 (yes)\n- Melbourne: 8 (no)\n\nSo, out of 6 away teams, Richmond and Geelong have goals greater than 10. That's 2 out of 6.\n\nThe claim is that \"1/3\" of them have scores >10. Since 1/3 of 6 is 2, this matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that one-third (1/3) of the away teams have a score greater than 10. Evaluating each away team's goals:\n\n- St Kilda: 9\n- North Melbourne: 9\n- Richmond: 17 (>10)\n- South Melbourne: 8\n- Geelong: 15 (>10)\n- Melbourne: 8\n\nOut of six teams, two (Richmond and Geelong) have scores above 10. Since 2 is one-third of 6, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE. \\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}",

Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Melbourne has the second-lowest score among all teams that were away teams in their respective matches. So, I need to look at all the away team scores and see where Melbourne stands.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant columns for this claim are \"away team\" and \"away team score.\"\n\nLet me list out all the away teams and their corresponding scores:\n\n1. Footscray vs St Kilda: Away team is St Kilda with a score of 9.11 (65).\n2. Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: Away team is North Melbourne with a score of 9.12 (66).\n3. Essendon vs Richmond: Away team is Richmond with a score of 17.9 (111).\n4. Carlton vs South Melbourne: Away team is South Melbourne with a score of 8.15 (63).\n5.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more attend the fitzroy vs north melbourne game than the essendon v richmond game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game played on the same date, which is 15 July 1972. The key information I need for this claim is the number of attendees (crowd) for both games mentioned: Fitzroy vs North Melbourne and Essendon vs Richmond.\n\nI'll start by locating the relevant rows in the table. Looking through the home and away teams:\n\n- In the second row, the home team is Fitzroy and the away team is North Melbourne. The crowd number here is 7007.\n- In the third row, the home team is Essendon and the away team is Richmond. The crowd for this game is 22251.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 7007 vs. 22251. Clearly, 7007 is less than 22251. This means that more people attended the Essendon vs Richmond game compared to the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game. Therefore, the claim that \"more attend the fitzroy vs north melbourne game than the essendon v richmond game\" is incorrect.\n\nTo ensure I'm accurate, I'll double-check the row indices and column names. The crowd numbers are in the 'crowd' column. For Fitzroy vs North Melbourne, it's row index 1 (since counting starts at 0) and for Essendon vs Richmond, it's row index 2.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, Column: crowd\n- Row 2, Column: crowd\n\nSince the crowd number for Fitzroy is lower than that of Essendon, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the collingwood v melbourne game have the third largest crowd size.\" Okay, so first, I need to look at the table and find which row corresponds to the Collingwood vs Melbourne game.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Let me go through each one:\n\n1. Footscray vs St Kilda: Their crowd was 18655.\n2. Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: Crowd was 7007. That's pretty low.\n3. Essendon vs Richmond: 22251 people attended, that's the highest so far.\n4. Carlton vs South Melbourne: 14465 attendees.\n5. Hawthorn vs Geelong: The crowd was 12425.\n6. Collingwood vs Melbourne: They had a crowd of 30883.\n\nWait, but I just saw that Essendon vs Richmond had the highest at 22251. Then Carlton vs South Melbourne is next with 14465? No, wait, no\u2014hold on, let me list all the crowd numbers again to make sure:\n\n- Footscray: 18655\n- Fitzroy: 7007\n- Essendon: 22251\n- Carlton: 14465\n- Hawthorn: 12425\n- Collingwood: 30883\n\nOh, I missed that Collingwood had a much larger crowd\u201430883. So, the largest is Collingwood with 30883, then Essendon with 22251, followed by Footscray at 18655, then Carlton at 14465, then Hawthorn at 12425, and finally Fitzroy at 7007.\n\nSo the claim is that Collingwood vs Melbourne have the third largest crowd. But according to this, Collingwood's game is actually the largest with 30883, which would be first place. Therefore, the claim that it's third is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are where we can find the crowd sizes for each game. Specifically, I need to look at each row's \"crowd\" column and compare them. The Collingwood vs Melbourne row has 30883, which is higher than others except Essendon (22251) but wait no, actually, Collingwood is the highest. So let me list all crowd sizes again:\n\n- Footscray: 18655\n- Fitzroy: 7007\n- Essendon: 22251\n- Carlton: 14465\n- Hawthorn: 12425\n- Collingwood: 30883\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct myself\u2014Collingwood's crowd is 30883, which is the highest. Then Essendon has 22251 as second. Footscray is next with 18655 as third. So the order from largest to smallest:\n\n1. Collingwood: 30883\n2. Essendon: 22251\n3. Footscray: 18655\n4. Carlton: 14465\n5. Hawthorn: 12425\n6. Fitzroy: 7007\n\nSo the Collingwood vs Melbourne game actually has the largest crowd, not third. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the \"crowd\" column entries because we need to compare each game's attendance to determine the ranking. So I'll list each row's index and the \"crowd\" column as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_0\", \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_1\", \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_2\", \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_3\", \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_4\", \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the average of all the home team score be less than 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should identify which columns are relevant for this claim. The claim mentions the \"home team score,\" so I'll focus on that column.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, the columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. So, the relevant column here is \"home team score.\"\n\nNext, I need to extract all the home team scores from each row. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Footscray's score is 14.7 (91). The number in parentheses is likely the total points, but the claim refers to the average of the home team score, which seems to be before the parentheses. So I'll take 14.7.\n\n2. Second row: Fitzroy scored 16.14, so that's another data point.\n\n3. Third row: Essendon has 13.12.\n\n4. Fourth row: Carlton's score is 20.8.\n\n5. Fifth row: Hawthorn's home team score is 19.14.\n\n6. Sixth row: Collingwood scored 10.13.\n\nNow, I have all the home team scores: 14.7, 16.14, 13.12, 20.8, 19.14, and 10.13.\n\nTo find the average, I'll add them up and divide by the number of teams (which is 6).\n\nAdding them:\n\n14.7 + 16.14 = 30.84\n\n30.84 + 13.12 = 43.96\n\n43.96 + 20.8 = 64.76\n\n64.76 + 19.14 = 83.9\n\n83.9 + 10.13 = 94.03\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n94.03 / 6 \u2248 15.67\n\nSo the average home team score is approximately 15.67, which is greater than 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the average is less than 12 is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the \"home team score\" entries across each row, so I'll note their row indices from 0 to 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the away teams in the table and their scores. The claim states that more than half of these away teams scored over 10 points. So, I need to check each row for the away team's score, see if it's greater than 10, count how many meet this condition, and then compare that number to half of the total away teams.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, so six games. That means there are six away teams' scores I need to evaluate.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Away team is St Kilda with a score of 9.11 (65). Wait, how do these numbers work? In Australian Rules Football, the score is usually presented as Goals.Behinds (Total Points). So 9 goals and 11 behinds equal 9*6 + 11 = 54 + 11 = 65 points. But the claim is about the score being greater than 10. If we're talking about goals, then 9 would be less than 10. However, if it's total points, 65 is way more than 10. The wording is a bit ambiguous here. The user wrote \"score\", which could refer to either the total points or just the goals. But given that in sports stats, when they say 'score' without specifying, sometimes they mean the total points. However, looking at the claim again: it says \"score greater than 10\". If we consider just the goals part (the first number before the dot), then 9 is less than 10. But if considering total points, all these are way over 10. So I need to clarify what's meant by 'score' here.\n\nWait, in the table, each team's score is written as two numbers and a total in parentheses. For example, \"14.7 (91)\" where 14 is goals, 7 is behinds, totaling 91 points. So when the claim says \"have a score greater than 10\", it's unclear whether they're referring to goals or total points. However, given that all away teams have scores in parentheses that are over 50 (except maybe one), but let me check each.\n\nWait no, actually looking at the numbers:\n\n- Row 0: Away team St Kilda has score 9.11 (65). So if considering goals, 9 is less than 10. If considering total points, 65 > 10.\n- Row 1: North Melbourne scored 9.12 (66) as the away team. Again, 9 goals <10, but 66>10.\n- Row 2: Richmond is the away team with 17.9 (111). Goals are 17 >10, so yes regardless.\n- Row3: South Melbourne scored 8.15 (63) as away. So goals=8 <10, but points=63>10.\n- Row4: Geelong is the away team with 15.8 (98). Goals=15 >10.\n- Row5: Melbourne has score 8.10 (58). Goals=8<10, points=58>10.\n\nSo the confusion arises whether \"score\" refers to goals or total points.\n\nBut looking at the claim again: it says \"more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10\". It's more likely referring to their total score in terms of points because otherwise, if considering only goals, let me count:\n\nIf we take 'score' as goals:\n- Row0:9 <10\n- Row1:9 <10\n- Row2:17>10\n- Row3:8<10\n- Row4:15>10\n- Row5:8<10\n\nSo how many have score (goals) >10? Rows 2 and 4. That's two out of six, which is not more than half.\n\nBut if we take 'score' as total points, then all except maybe none are above 10. All teams scored over 50, so definitely more than 10.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"greater than 10\", and all the away team's scores in parentheses are way above 10 (e.g., 65, 66, etc.), so if 'score' refers to total points, then all six teams have a score greater than 10. Thus more than half.\n\nBut that interpretation might be a stretch because usually when people refer to a team's \"score\", they mean goals and behinds, not the total points. But given the format in the table, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'score' is considered as the number of goals plus behinds? No, that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe just the goals, because in some contexts, people talk about a team's score being 9 for example meaning 9 goals.\n\nWait, but let me check: In Australian rules football, the term \"score\" can sometimes refer to just the number of goals scored by a player or the team. So if someone says \"the team scored 9\", they might mean 9 goals. But when looking at match statistics, often the total score is in points.\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. However, given that all the away teams have scores (points) way above 10, but their goal counts vary between 8 to 17. So if the claim refers to points, then all of them are over 10, so more than half. If it refers to goals, only two out of six.\n\nBut since in the parentheses, they list the total points, maybe the claim is referring to that. Let's assume that 'score' refers to total points because otherwise, if it's just goals, then less than half have a score over 10.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the table:\n\nAway teams and their scores (points):\n\nRow0: St Kilda - 65\nRow1: North Melbourne - 66\nRow2: Richmond - 111\nRow3: South Melbourne - 63\nRow4: Geelong - 98\nRow5: Melbourne - 58\n\nSo all of these are over 50, which is way above 10. So if 'score' refers to total points, then all six away teams have a score greater than 10.\n\nTherefore, more than half (all) meet the condition. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the wording says \"more than half\". Since there are six teams, half of six is three. More than half would be four or more. If all six have scores over 10, then yes, it's more than half.\n\nAlternatively, if 'score' refers to goals:\n\nRow0:9<10\nRow1:9<10\nRow2:17>10\nRow3:8<10\nRow4:15>10\nRow5:8<10\n\nSo only two teams have scores (goals) over 10. So more than half would require four or more, which isn't the case.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think it's important to clarify what 'score' refers to. However, since the claim doesn't specify, but in the table, each team has their score written with goals.behinds (total points), perhaps the term 'score' is intended to refer to the total points, which are all over 10.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is TRUE because all six away teams have a score (points) greater than 10, which is more than half.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10.\" \n\nAnalyzing each row for the away teams' scores:\n\n- **Row 0**: St Kilda - 65 points\n- **Row 1**: North Melbourne - 66 points\n- **Row 2**: Richmond - 111 points\n- **Row 3**: South Melbourne - 63 points\n- **Row 4**: Geelong - 98 points\n- **Row 5**: Melbourne - 58 points\n\nAll scores exceed 10. Therefore, all six away teams meet the condition.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",
