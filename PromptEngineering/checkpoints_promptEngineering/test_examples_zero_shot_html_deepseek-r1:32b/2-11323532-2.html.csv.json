    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the show in Israel be in the Hebrew language and be ongoing.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to Israel. Scanning through the rows, I find that Israel is listed as one of the countries. Now, let's check each condition mentioned in the claim.\n\n1. **Language Check**: The first part of the claim states that the show is in Hebrew. In the table, the column \"Language\" for Israel has \"Hebrew.\" This matches the claim, so this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. **Status Check**: The second part claims the show is ongoing. Looking at the \"Status\" column for Israel, it says \"discontinued.\" This directly contradicts the claim that the show is ongoing.\n\nSince both conditions are supposed to be met according to the claim but only one (language) is true while the other (status) is false, the overall claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- For the language, it's in row 12 under \"Language.\"\n- For the status, it's also in row 12 under \"Status.\"\n\nThese are the key cells that determine whether the claim holds true or not.\n</think>\n\nThe show in Israel is indeed in Hebrew but is marked as discontinued, which makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Language\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Status\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning down, I find a row where the 'Country/Region' column has \"Vietnam\".\n\nIn that same row, under the 'Language(s)' column, it lists \"vietnamese\". This directly matches the claim's assertion about the language spoken.\n\nThere are no discrepancies here; the table clearly states that Vietnam's people speak Vietnamese. No other languages are mentioned for this country, so the information fully supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Country/Region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Language(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
