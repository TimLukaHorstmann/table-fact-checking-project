    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"ensign race field a f1 car for 10 years, from 1973 through 1982\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the table has data from 1973 to 1982. That's 10 years in total (since 1982 minus 1973 is 9 years, but including both endpoints gives us 10 years). So at a glance, the time span seems correct.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 1973: The chassis is ensign n173. That's one model.\n- 1974: Chassis is ensign n174. Again, one model.\n- 1975: Two chassis models listed (n174 and n175).\n- 1976: Also two models (n174 and n176).\n- 1977 to 1980: Each year has a single chassis except 1979, which has two.\n- 1981: Chassis is ensign n180b.\n- 1982: Two models again (n180b and n181).\n\nNow, the claim says Ensign \"field\" an F1 car for these years. From the data, each year has at least one chassis, so they did have cars in all those years.\n\nWait a minute, but looking closely at points: some years like 1973 and 1974 have zero points. Does that mean they didn't compete or didn't score? Or maybe they participated but didn't earn any points. The claim doesn't specify about winning points, just having the car fielded.\n\nSo considering all years from 1973 to 1982 are present in the table with at least one chassis each year, it seems Ensign did have cars for each of those years. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ensign fielded an F1 car over a period of ten years from 1973 through 1982. The table shows entries for each year in this range, indicating that Ensign indeed had cars each year during this period.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ensign race cars is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states that Ensign exclusively used Ford V8 engines but changed tire manufacturers several times.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the \"engine (s)\" column across all rows. From the data:\n\n- 1973: Ford V8\n- 1974: Ford V8\n- 1975: Ford V8\n- 1976: Ford V8\n- 1977: Ford V8\n- 1978: Ford V8\n- 1979: Ford V8\n- 1980: Ford V8\n- 1981: Ford V8\n- 1982: Ford V8\n\nSo, every year Ensign used a Ford V8 engine. That part of the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I'll examine the \"tyres\" column to see if they changed manufacturers. The tyre types listed are:\n\n- 1973: F\n- 1974: F\n- 1975: G\n- 1976: G\n- 1977: G\n- 1978: G\n- 1979: G\n- 1980: G\n- 1981: M A\n- 1982: P\n\nLooking at these, the tyre manufacturers change from F to G starting in 1975. Then in 1981, it's M A, and in 1982, it's P. This indicates multiple changes over the years, so Ensign did switch tyre manufacturers several times.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"In half of its season, Ensign Racing earn zero points on the F1 circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that in half of Ensign's seasons, they earned zero points. So, I should check each year listed and see how many seasons had zero points versus those that didn't.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows, each representing a different year from 1973 to 1982. The relevant column here is \"points.\" My goal is to count how many of these years have zero points and see if that number equals half of the total seasons.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **1973**: Points = 0\n- **1974**: Points = 0\n- **1975**: Points = 1 \u2192 Not zero\n- **1976**: Points = 2 \u2192 Not zero\n- **1977**: Points = 10 \u2192 Not zero\n- **1978**: Points = 1 \u2192 Not zero\n- **1979**: Points = 0\n- **1980**: Points = 0\n- **1981**: Points = 5 \u2192 Not zero\n- **1982**: Points = 0\n\nNow, let's count the zeros: 1973, 1974, 1979, 1980, and 1982. That makes five seasons with zero points.\n\nThe total number of seasons listed is 10. Half of 10 is 5. So, exactly half (five years) had zero points. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true based on this data.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that all these rows are indeed Ensign Racing seasons. Looking at the \"chassis\" column, it consistently mentions \"ensign n173,\" \"ensign n174,\" etc., which confirms that these are Ensign's entries each year.\n\nSo, putting it all together, five out of ten seasons had zero points, which is exactly half. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported as 5 out of 10 seasons have zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ensign Race's most successful season is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"Ensign race's most successful season was 1977, when it earned 10 points on the F1 race circuit.\" \n\nI'll start by identifying the key elements in the claim. The main points are:\n1. The most successful season for Ensign Race.\n2. This occurred in 1977.\n3. They earned 10 points that year.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided to see if these points hold true.\n\nLooking at the \"year\" column, each row corresponds to a different year from 1973 to 1982. The claim mentions 1977, so I'll focus on that specific row.\n\nIn the table, for the year 1977:\n- Chassis: ensign n177\n- Engine(s): ford v8\n- Tyres: g\n- Points: 10\n\nThe points column shows 10 for 1977. Now, to confirm if this was indeed their most successful season, I need to check the points for all other years.\n\nLet's go through each year:\n- 1973: 0 points\n- 1974: 0 points\n- 1975: 1 point\n- 1976: 2 points\n- 1977: 10 points\n- 1978: 1 point\n- 1979: 0 points\n- 1980: 0 points\n- 1981: 5 points\n- 1982: 0 points\n\nComparing all these, 1977 has the highest points with 10. The next highest is 1981 with 5 points, and others have lower or zero points.\n\nSo, both conditions are satisfied:\n- In 1977, Ensign earned 10 points.\n- This was their most successful season as it had the highest points compared to other years listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. I'll start by carefully reading and understanding both the claim and the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"In the 6 year run on Goodyear, they earn points in 4 years, whereas in the 4-year run with other tires, they take zero points.\" \n\nI need to break this down into two parts:\n1. For the 6 years when they used Goodyear tires (marked as 'g'), how many of those years did they earn points?\n2. For the 4 years when they used other tires (not 'g', which in the table are marked as 'f' or 'm a' or 'p'), how many of those years did they earn zero points?\n\nLooking at the table, let's first identify the years and corresponding tire types.\n\nYears with Goodyear ('g'):\n- 1975: tyres = g, points = 1\n- 1976: tyres = g, points = 2\n- 1977: tyres = g, points = 10\n- 1978: tyres = g, points = 1\n- 1979: tyres = g, points = 0\n- 1980: tyres = g, points = 0\n\nSo that's six years in total. Now, counting the points earned each year:\n- 1975: 1 point (earned)\n- 1976: 2 points (earned)\n- 1977: 10 points (earned)\n- 1978: 1 point (earned)\n- 1979: 0 points\n- 1980: 0 points\n\nOut of these six years, they earned points in four years (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978) and zero in two years (1979, 1980). So the first part of the claim holds true: in the 6-year Goodyear run, they earned points in 4 years.\n\nNow, for the other tires. The table shows tyres as 'f', 'm a', or 'p'. Let's see how many years these were used and whether any points were earned.\n\nYears with non-Goodyear tyres:\n- 1973: tyres = f, points = 0\n- 1974: tyres = f, points = 0\n- 1981: tyres = m a, points = 5 (Wait, this is a point here. Hmm.)\n- 1982: tyres = p, points = 0\n\nWait, in 1981, they used 'm a' tyres and earned 5 points. That's conflicting with the claim which says \"they take zero points\" during those years.\n\nLet me recount:\nYears with non-Goodyear tyres:\n- 1973: f, 0\n- 1974: f, 0\n- 1981: m a, 5 (earned)\n- 1982: p, 0\n\nSo that's four years in total. However, in one of those years (1981), they earned points. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that in all four years with other tires, they took zero points.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the years and tyre types:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n- 1973: tyres = f\n- 1974: tyres = f\n- 1981: tyres = m a\n- 1982: tyres = p\n\nYes, that's four years. In those four years, in 1981 they earned 5 points, so the claim that \"they take zero point\" during these four years is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted the runs. The claim says a \"6-year run on Goodyear\" and a \"4-year run other tire\". Let me check if the runs are continuous or just any six years with Goodyear and four years without.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFrom 1975 to 1980: that's six consecutive years, all with 'g' tyres except for 1973-74 which are 'f'. Wait, no. Let me list the years in order:\n- 1973: f\n- 1974: f\n- 1975: g\n- 1976: g\n- 1977: g\n- 1978: g\n- 1979: g\n- 1980: g\n- 1981: m a\n- 1982: p\n\nSo the six-year run on Goodyear is from 1975 to 1980, inclusive. That's six years (1975,76,77,78,79,80). In these years, as I noted earlier, they earned points in four of them.\n\nThe other tires would be the years before and after this run:\n- 1973: f\n- 1974: f\n- 1981: m a\n- 1982: p\n\nThat's four years. However, in 1981, they earned 5 points with 'm a' tyres. Therefore, the claim that during these four years (the other tires), they took zero points is incorrect because they did earn points in 1981.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe it's not about all non-Goodyear years but specifically about consecutive runs. Let me see:\n\nThe Goodyear run is six years (1975-1980). The other tires are used in 1973, 1974, 1981, 1982. So that's four years total. In those four years, they earned zero points except for 1981.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because during the non-Goodyear run (four years), they did earn points in one year.\n\nSo the first part of the claim holds: six-year Goodyear run with points earned in four years. The second part does not hold because in the four non-Goodyear years, they didn't take zero points every time; they took 5 points in 1981.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"runs\". Maybe it's not about consecutive runs but any six years with Goodyear and four years without. Let me check:\n\nTotal years with 'g' tyres: from 1975 to 1980 inclusive is six years. Years without 'g': 1973, 1974, 1981, 1982. So that's four years.\n\nIn those four non-Goodyear years, they earned points only in 1981. Therefore, the claim that \"in the 4-year run with other tires, they take zero points\" is false because one year (1981) had points.\n\nHence, the overall claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two parts: a six-year Goodyear period where points were earned in four years, and a four-year non-Goodyear period with zero points. The first part holds true, but the second does not because they earned 5 points in one of those years.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

Each row represents a year, so I can go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **1973**: Yes, there's a row with chassis \"ensign n173\".\n- **1974**: Chassis is \"ensign n174\".\n- **1975**: The claim says they didn't have a car this year. Let me check the points column for 1975. It shows 1 point, which suggests Ensign did participate in 1975.\n  \nWait, but the claim is that they were present from 1973 to 1982 except 1975. However, according to the table, they had points in 1975 (points = 1). This contradicts the claim because if they scored a point, they must have participated.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because Ensign did have an F1 car in 1975. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are from 1973 to 1982, but specifically focusing on whether there's a chassis entry each year and if 1975 has any points or not.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Ensign did have an F1 car in 1975 as indicated by the points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Ensign race is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step and check against each row in the table.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Ensign used a Ford V8 engine in every race except for 2.\n2. They used the same manufacturer every time.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'engine (s)' column to see if Ford V8 is consistent across all years except two. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1973: Ford V8\n- 1974: Ford V8\n- 1975: Ford V8\n- 1976: Ford V8\n- 1977: Ford V8\n- 1978: Ford V8\n- 1979: Ford V8\n- 1980: Ford V8\n- 1981: Ford V8\n- 1982: Ford V8\n\nWait, all entries have Ford V8 as the engine. That means they used it in every race except for zero years, not two. So the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking if they used the same manufacturer every time. The 'chassis' and 'tyres' columns can indicate this. Looking at 'chassis':\n\n- 1973: ensign n173\n- 1974: ensign n174\n- 1975: ensign n174, n175\n- ... and so on.\n\nThe chassis models change each year but all are Ensign models. So the manufacturer for chassis is consistent as Ensign.\n\nLooking at 'tyres':\n\n- 1973: f\n- 1974: f\n- 1975: g\n- 1976: g\n- 1977: g\n- 1978: g\n- 1979: g\n- 1980: g\n- 1981: m a\n- 1982: p\n\nHmm, the tyres change from 'f' to 'g', then in 1981 they have 'm a', and 1982 'p'. This suggests that the tyre manufacturer changed over time. So while the chassis manufacturer is consistent, the tyres (which might be another manufacturer) are not always the same.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect: they used Ford V8 every year, not excepting two, and they didn't use the same tyre manufacturer consistently.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"ensign race's most successful season be 1980, when it earn 10 point on the f1 race circuit.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: year, chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. Each row represents a different year from 1973 to 1982.\n\nThe claim mentions two main things: that 1980 was Ensign's most successful season, and that they earned 10 points in that year. I need to check both parts.\n\nStarting with the year 1980. Looking at the table, there is a row for 1980. Let me see what the points column says for that year. The points are listed as 0. So in 1980, Ensign earned zero points according to the table.\n\nNext, checking if any other years have higher points than 1980. Scanning through the points column: 1975 has 1 point, 1976 has 2, 1977 jumps up to 10, then drops in 1978 to 1, and so on. The highest points are 10 in 1977.\n\nSo according to the table, Ensign's most successful season was actually 1977 with 10 points, not 1980 as the claim states. Also, the claim says they earned 10 points in 1980, which is incorrect because it was 0.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are false. The relevant cells to check this would be the points for 1977 and 1980. Specifically:\n\n- For 1977 (row index 4), column 'points' has 10.\n- For 1980 (row index 8), column 'points' shows 0.\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format with \"answer\" as FALSE and listing these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the given claim about Ensign Racing's points in F1 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"In every season but 1, Ensign racing earn zero point(s) on the F1 circuit.\" So, according to this, Ensign should have earned zero points in all seasons except one. \n\nNext, I need to examine the table provided. The table has rows from 1973 to 1982 and columns for year, chassis, engine, tyres, and points. The key column here is \"points,\" as it directly relates to the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the points:\n\n- **1973**: Points = 0 \u2192 This supports the claim.\n- **1974**: Points = 0 \u2192 Supports the claim.\n- **1975**: Points = 1 \u2192 Here's a non-zero point. That means Ensign earned points this season, which is one instance where they didn't earn zero.\n- **1976**: Points = 2 \u2192 Another non-zero point. This contradicts the initial reading because we already have two seasons with points.\n  \nWait, hold on. The claim says \"every season but 1.\" So only one season should have non-zero points. However, looking at the table:\n\n- **1975**: 1\n- **1976**: 2\n- **1977**: 10\n- **1981**: 5\n\nSo actually, Ensign earned points in multiple seasons (1975, 1976, 1977, and 1981). That's four seasons where they didn't earn zero. \n\nThis means the claim isn't accurate because there are more than one season with non-zero points. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list all rows where points are not zero:\n\n- Row 2 (1975): Points = 1\n- Row 3 (1976): Points = 2\n- Row 4 (1977): Points = 10\n- Row 8 (1981): Points = 5\n\nEach of these rows has a non-zero points value, which directly contradicts the claim that only one season had non-zero points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ensign Racing earned zero points in all but one season. However, upon reviewing the table, it's clear that they accumulated points in multiple seasons (1975: 1 point, 1976: 2 points, 1977: 10 points, and 1981: 5 points). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "in the 6 year run on goodyear , ensign racing earn point in 3 year",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"in the 6 year run on goodyear, ensign racing earn point in 3 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a 6-year period where Ensign Racing used Goodyear tires and earned points in 3 of those years.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"tyres\" column indicates which tire brands were used each year. The relevant rows are from 1975 to 1980 because that's when they switched to 'g' tyres, which I assume stands for Goodyear. So the period in question is from 1975 to 1980, which is indeed 6 years.\n\nNext, I need to check how many of these years Ensign Racing earned points. Let's go through each year:\n\n- 1973: tyres 'f' (not Goodyear), so irrelevant.\n- 1974: same as above.\n- 1975: 'g' tyre, points = 1. So they earned points here.\n- 1976: 'g', points = 2. Earned points again.\n- 1977: 'g', points = 10. Points earned.\n- 1978: 'g', points = 1. Points again.\n- 1979: 'g', points = 0. No points here.\n- 1980: 'g', points = 0. No points.\n\nWait, from 1975 to 1980 is 6 years (1975,1976,1977,1978,1979,1980). Now checking the points:\n\n- 1975: 1 point\n- 1976: 2 points\n- 1977: 10 points\n- 1978: 1 point\n- 1979: 0\n- 1980: 0\n\nSo in the years using Goodyear, they earned points in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978. That's four years where they scored points. The claim says they earned points in 3 of the 6 years. But according to this, it's actually four years.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me recount:\n\n- 1975: yes (points)\n- 1976: yes\n- 1977: yes\n- 1978: yes\n- 1979: no\n- 1980: no\n\nThat's four years with points. So the claim says \"earn point in 3 year\", which is less than what actually happened.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each year again:\n\n- 1975: 1 point \u2192 yes\n- 1976: 2 points \u2192 yes\n- 1977: 10 points \u2192 yes\n- 1978: 1 point \u2192 yes\n- 1979: 0 \u2192 no\n- 1980: 0 \u2192 no\n\nSo that's four years where they earned points. The claim says three, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. It says \"in the 6 year run on goodyear, ensign racing earn point in 3 year\". So according to the table, it's actually four years with points, not three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they earned points in more than three years.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the starting and ending years of the Goodyear run. The first 'g' tyre is in 1975, then continues until 1980. So that's six consecutive years: 1975-1980 inclusive. In those years:\n\n- 1975: points\n- 1976: points\n- 1977: points\n- 1978: points\n- 1979: no points\n- 1980: no points\n\nThat's four years with points. So the claim is wrong because it says three, but it's actually four.\n\nWait again, maybe I miscounted. Let me list them:\n\nYear | Points\n-----|-------\n1975 | 1 \u2192 yes\n1976 | 2 \u2192 yes\n1977 |10 \u2192 yes\n1978 |1 \u2192 yes\n1979 |0 \u2192 no\n1980 |0 \u2192 no\n\nSo four years with points. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states three years when actually it's four.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"6-year run on Goodyear\". Perhaps they didn't start using Goodyear in 1975 and continue until 1980 without interruption? Let me check each year:\n\n- 1973: f\n- 1974: f\n- 1975: g\n- 1976: g\n- 1977: g\n- 1978: g\n- 1979: g\n- 1980: g\n\nYes, from 1975 to 1980 is six years of Goodyear use. So the period is correct.\n\nTherefore, since they earned points in four of those six years, not three, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during a six-year period using Goodyear tires (from 1975 to 1980), Ensign Racing earned points in three of those years. However, examining each year:\n\n- **1975**: 1 point\n- **1976**: 2 points\n- **1977**: 10 points\n- **1978**: 1 point\n- **1979**: 0 points\n- **1980**: 0 points\n\nPoints were earned in four of the six years, not three.
