    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 13 tour match in the last 3 month of 1978\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that there are 13 tour matches in the last three months of 1978. The last three months would be October, November, and December 1978.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a match with columns: opposing team, against, date, venue, status. My focus is on the 'status' column to identify tour matches and the 'date' column to check if they fall within October, November, or December 1978.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is 18 October 1978. Status is \"tour match.\" This counts.\n2. **Row 1**: 21 October 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n3. **Row 2**: 25 October 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n4. **Row 3**: 28 October 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n5. **Row 4**: 31 October 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n6. **Row 5**: 4 November 1978. Status is \"test match.\" Not a tour match. Doesn't count.\n7. **Row 6**: 7 November 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n8. **Row 7**: 11 November 1978. Test match. Doesn't count.\n9. **Row 8**: 29 November 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n10. **Row 9**: 2 December 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n11. **Row 10**: 5 December 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n12. **Row 11**: 9 December 1978. Test match. Doesn't count.\n13. **Row 12**: 13 December 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n14. **Row 13**: 16 December 1978. Tour match. Counts.\n\nNow, let's tally the tour matches in the last three months:\n\n- October: 5 tour matches (Rows 0-4)\n- November: 2 tour matches (Rows 6 and 8)\n- December: 4 tour matches (Rows 9,10,12,13)\n\nAdding them up: 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 tour matches.\n\nWait, that's only 11, but the claim is for 13. Did I miss any? Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- October has 5 (correct).\n- November: Row 6 and Row 8 are correct.\n- December: Rows 9,10,12,13 \u2013 that's four.\n\nHmm, total is indeed 11. But the claim says 13. Did I miscount?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nOctober:\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 4: Yes \u2192 5\n\nNovember:\nRow 6: Yes\nRow 8: Yes \u2192 2\n\nDecember:\nRow9,10,12,13: 4\n\nTotal is 5+2+4=11.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let's check all rows again:\n\nRows with status \"tour match\":\n\n0: yes\n1: yes\n2: yes\n3: yes\n4: yes\n6: yes\n8: yes\n9: yes\n10: yes\n12: yes\n13: yes\n\nThat's 11 rows. So the claim is incorrect; there are only 11 tour matches, not 13.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misread some of the dates. Let me check each date again:\n\nRow 5: November 4th \u2013 test match.\nRow7: November 11th \u2013 test match.\n\nRows in December:\n9: Dec 2nd\n10: Dec 5th\n12: Dec 13th\n13: Dec 16th\n\nYes, all these are in the last three months. But total tour matches are 11, not 13.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows 11 \"tour match\" entries between October and December 1978, not 13 as claimed.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 4 test match in the last 2 month of 1978\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that there were four test matches in the last two months of 1978. So, my goal is to check how many test matches occurred in November and December 1978 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like opposing team, against points, date, venue, and status (which indicates whether it's a test match or a tour match). I'm interested in the 'status' column because that tells me if an entry is a test match. Additionally, the 'date' column will help me determine which matches fall within November and December 1978.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to identify all the test matches. The 'status' column has entries either as \"test match\" or \"tour match\". I need to pick out those rows where the status is a test match.\n\nGoing through the table:\n\n1. Cambridge University: Status is tour match.\n2. Cardiff: Tour match.\n3. West Wales XV: Tour match.\n4. London Counties: Tour match.\n5. Munster: Tour match.\n6. Ireland: Test match (date 4 November).\n7. Ulster: Tour match.\n8. Wales: Test match (11 November).\n9. South and South-West Counties: Tour match.\n10. Midland Counties: Tour match.\n11. Combined Services: Tour match.\n12. England: Test match (25 November).\n13. Monmouthshire: Tour match.\n14. North of England: Tour match.\n15. North and Midland of Scotland: Tour match.\n16. Scotland: Test match (9 December).\n17. Bridgend: Tour match.\n18. Barbarians: Tour match.\n\nSo, the test matches are rows 5 (Ireland), 8 (Wales), 12 (England), and 16 (Scotland). That's four test matches in total. Now I need to check if all these dates fall within November or December 1978.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n- Ireland: 4 November 1978\n- Wales: 11 November 1978\n- England: 25 November 1978\n- Scotland: 9 December 1978\n\nAll these dates are within the last two months of 1978, which are November and December. Therefore, there are indeed four test matches in the specified period.\n\nTo compile the relevant cells for this conclusion, I need to include each row where a test match occurred and note the 'status' column for each of those rows. The row indices for these test matches are 5 (Ireland), 8 (Wales), 12 (England), and 16 (Scotland). Each entry has the status as \"test match,\" which is crucial to verifying the claim.\n\nIn summary, after carefully reviewing each row, identifying the test matches, and confirming their dates fall within November and December 1978, it's clear that the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be 4 team that score exactly 12 against cambridge university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions four teams scoring exactly 12 points against Cambridge University. So, I need to find all rows in the table where the opposing team is \"cambridge university\" and see how many matches they played with a score of 12.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to identify which ones have \"cambridge university\" as the opposing team. From the HTML provided, the first row shows that Cambridge University was the opposing team on October 18, 1978, and the score against them was 12. \n\nWait a second, but in the table, each row represents a match where another team is playing against someone else. The \"against\" column likely shows how many points were scored by the opposing team. So for example, when it says \"cambridge university\" in the opposing team column and the against value is 12, that means Cambridge University scored 12 points.\n\nSo, I need to check all rows where the opposing team is Cambridge University. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opposing team is Cambridge University, score against is 12.\nRows 1-4 don't have Cambridge as the opposing team. \nRows 5 onwards also don't mention Cambridge in the opposing team column.\n\nSo there's only one entry where Cambridge University was playing, and they scored exactly 12 points. \n\nThe claim says there are four teams that scored exactly 12 against Cambridge. But according to the table, it's just one match involving Cambridge with a score of 12. Therefore, there isn't evidence of four different teams scoring 12 against them.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opposing team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Looking through the table, each row has an 'against' number, date, venue, and status. The rows from index 0 onwards have dates in October, like row 0 (18 Oct), row 1 (21 Oct), etc. Their statuses are all \"tour match\" except for some test matches later on.\n\nSecond part is a test match held in November at Twickenham, London. Scanning the table, I see that England's test match on 25 Nov 1978 was at Twickenham. That fits because it's a test match and location matches.\n\nSo both conditions are met: there's a tour match in October (like row 0) and a test match in November at Twickenham, London (row 13).

The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 5 match hold in october of 1978\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the table and what information each column holds. The table has columns: opposing team, against (which likely refers to points), date, venue, and status.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions matches held in October 1978. So my focus is on the 'date' column for this analysis. I need to check each row's date to see if it falls within October 1978 and count how many such matches there are.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has a date of \"18 october 1978\" \u2014 that's in October.\n2. The second row is \"21 october 1978\" \u2014 also October.\n3. Third row: \"25 october 1978\" \u2014 October again.\n4. Fourth row: \"28 october 1978\" \u2014 still October.\n5. Fifth row: \"31 october 1978\" \u2014 October.\n6. Sixth row is \"4 november 1978\" \u2014 November, so not relevant.\n\nContinuing further down the table, all subsequent dates are in November and December 1978, which are outside the timeframe we're interested in (October). \n\nSo, counting the matches from rows 0 to 4 (indexes starting at 0), there are exactly five matches held in October 1978. Each of these entries has their date in October, making the claim correct.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells part. I need to list each cell that contributed to this count. Since we're looking at the 'date' column, each relevant row's 'date' is key. Therefore, the rows from 0 to 4, all under the 'date' column, are relevant.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is saying that in all matches where Cambridge University was the opposing team, no other team scored more than 10 points. So I need to check if any team scored above 10 against them.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column named \"against\" which likely represents the score of the opposing team. The \"opposing team\" column shows who they played against, and we're interested in rows where the opposing team is Cambridge University.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find where the opposing team is Cambridge University. From the table provided, I see one such entry:\n\n- Row 0: Opposing team is Cambridge University, score against them is 12.\n\nSo, the \"against\" column for this row has a value of 12. That means the team playing against Cambridge scored 12 points in that match. Since 12 is more than 10, this contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell here is the \"against\" score for the Cambridge University row, which is at row index 0 and column name \"against\". \n\nSince there's a score of 12 against Cambridge, the claim that no team scored more than 10 is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows a match where Cambridge University was the opposing team with an \"against\" score of 12.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"all 4 test match take place in october of 1978\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that there are four test matches, and all of them occurred in October 1978. To verify this, I'll look through each row of the table and check for two things: whether the match is a test match and whether it took place in October.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns for opposing team, against (which might be scores), date, venue, and status. The 'status' column indicates whether it's a test match or a tour match.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Cambridge University**: Status is \"tour match\" \u2013 not relevant.\n2. **Cardiff**: \"tour match\" \u2013 irrelevant.\n3. **West Wales XV**: \"tour match\" \u2013 nope.\n4. **London Counties**: \"tour match\" \u2013 same as above.\n5. **Munster**: Also a tour match.\n6. **Ireland**: Here, the status is \"test match\". Let's check the date: 4 November 1978. That's in November, not October.\n7. **Ulster**: Tour match again.\n8. **Wales**: Another test match on 11 November 1978 \u2013 also November.\n9. **South and South-West Counties**: Tour match, so no.\n10. **Midland Counties**: Tour match.\n11. **Combined Services**: Tour match.\n12. **England**: Test match on 25 November 1978 \u2013 still November.\n13. **Monmouthshire**: Tour match.\n14. **North of England**: Tour match.\n15. **North and Midland of Scotland**: Tour match.\n16. **Scotland**: Test match on 9 December 1978 \u2013 in December.\n17. **Bridgend**: Tour match.\n18. **Barbarians**: Tour match.\n\nSo, going through all the rows, I found four test matches:\n\n- Ireland vs...?

The tenth row is \"midland counties\" on November 18 at Welford Road, Leicester\u2014still not our venue.\n6. The eleventh row is \"combined services\" on November 21 at Aldershot Military Stadium\u2014not relevant.\n7. The twelfth row is \"england\" on November 25 at Twickenham, London. The status here is a test match, which means it's not a tour match.\n\nSo, there's at least one match in November at Twickenham that isn't a tour match\u2014the England vs Barbarians or whatever team was playing on the 25th. This single instance contradicts the claim, making the overall statement FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are from the twelfth row where the date is in November and venue is Twickenham, showing it's a test match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"All 5 matches held in October of 1978 take place after the 25th of the month.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that every match that happened in October 1978 has a date later than the 25th. So I need to check all entries where the date is in October 1978 and see if their dates are after the 25th.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like opposing team, against, date, venue, and status. The column names are \"opposing team\", \"against\", \"date\", \"venue\", and \"status\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find all matches in October 1978.\n\nRow 0: Date is 18 October 1978.\nRow 1: 21 October 1978.\nRow 2: 25 October 1978.\nRow 3: 28 October 1978.\nRow 4: 31 October 1978.\n\nSo, there are five matches in October 1978. The claim says all five take place after the 25th. But looking at the dates:\n\n- 18 Oct is before the 25th.\n- 21 Oct is also before.\n- 25 Oct is exactly the 25th, not after.\n- 28 and 31 are after.\n\nSo three of them (rows 0, 1, 2) have dates on or before the 25th. Therefore, the claim isn't true because not all five matches in October were after the 25th. At least three happened on or before that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells are the 'date' column of each of these rows (0 to 4), as we checked each match's date in October.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
