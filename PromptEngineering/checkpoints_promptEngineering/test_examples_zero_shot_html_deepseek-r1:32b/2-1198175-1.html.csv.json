    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"According to Cass Technical High School, Joseph Barksdale be the third heaviest player.\" Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems that Joseph Barksdale is being identified as the third heaviest player from Cass Technical High School based on some data. But looking at the table provided, it doesn't mention Cass Technical High School anywhere. So my first thought is that there's no direct information linking Joseph Barksdale to Cass Tech in this table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a list of players with their respective details like position, height, weight, birthdate, school, and draft info. The last few rows include Joseph Barksdale, who attended LSU according to the table. His weight is listed as 325 pounds. There's another player, Clarence Williams, but he went to Michigan, not Cass Tech.\n\nWait a second, there are no players from Cass Technical High School in this table. All the schools mentioned are different: Mizzou, LSU, Michigan, etc., but none say Cass Tech. So if Joseph Barksdale is supposed to be from Cass Tech according to the claim, that's already conflicting because he attended LSU.\n\nMoreover, even if we were to consider only players who went to Cass Tech (which there aren't any in this table), the third heaviest would require knowing at least three players and their weights. Since the table doesn't include Cass Tech players, we can't determine anything about their weights or rankings.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided because Joseph Barksdale is listed as attending LSU, not Cass Tech, and there are no other Cass Tech players in this table to establish a ranking of heaviest players. So the claim doesn't hold up based on the information given.\n</think>\n\nThe claim references Cass Technical High School, which isn't present in the table. Joseph Barksdale attended LSU, so the claim can't be verified here.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"School\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Weight\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the claim: \"from ca technical high school harlan huckleby be 1 inch taller then walter clago\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided and see if there's any mention of Harlan Huckleby. Scanning through the rows, I find that there is a player named Harlan Huckleby. His height is listed as 5'9. So, he is 5 feet 9 inches tall.\n\nNext, I need to check who Walter Clago is and his height. However, when I go through the table again, I don't see any entry for Walter Clago. This is a problem because if Walter Clago isn't in the table, we can't compare their heights as per the claim.\n\nSince the claim refers to both Harlan Huckleby and Walter Clago, but only Harlan's data is available, there's not enough information to confirm whether Harlan is indeed 1 inch taller than Walter. Without Walter Clago's height from the table, I can't verify this statement.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell here is just Harlan Huckleby's height because that's all we have to go on. Since Walter Clago isn't in the table, the claim can't be fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Harlan Huckleby being taller than Walter Clago by 1 inch. Checking the table, only Harlan Huckleby is listed with a height of 5'9. Walter Clago's information is not present.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Height\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is that \"aaron kyle, guy frazier, and vernon gholston all go to wyoming college.\" I need to verify if each of these individuals attended Wyoming College based on the information in the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate each person in the table. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Aaron Kyle**:\n   - Scanning the \"Name\" column, I find Aaron Kyle in row 7.\n   - The relevant columns are \"College\" and \"Draft.\"\n   - Checking the \"College\" column for Aaron Kyle shows it says \"wyoming.\"\n\n2. **Guy Frazier**:\n   - Looking through the names, Guy Frazier is in row 15.\n   - Again, checking the \"College\" column, it also lists \"wyoming.\"\n\n3. **Vernon Gholston**:\n   - Vernon Gholston appears in row 19.\n   - His \"College\" entry is \"ohio state,\" not Wyoming.\n\nSo, Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier both attended Wyoming College, but Vernon Gholston did not; he went to Ohio State.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"will campbell be 1 of 6 student that go to michigan college\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Will Campbell in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find his name in the last row before the closing </tbody> tag. His details are:\n\n- Name: will campbell\n- Position: og\n- Height: 6'4\"\n- Weight: 311\n- Birthdate: july 6, 1991\n- College: michigan\n- Draft info: 2013, r6, p10\n\nSo, Will Campbell attended the University of Michigan. Now, I need to check how many other students in this table also went to Michigan.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first player is named \"You are tasked...\", which seems like a placeholder and not an actual player.\n2. Next, John Smith: College is MIT.\n3. Jane Doe: Attended Stanford.\n4. Bob Wilson: University of Texas.\n5. Alice Brown: Harvard.\n6. Charlie Davis: Columbia.\n7. David Miller: Michigan.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted because the table has more rows. Let me recount properly:\n\nLooking again, each row corresponds to a player with their respective details. The relevant column is \"College\" which indicates where they attended.\n\nGoing through each player's college:\n\n- Row 0: John Smith - MIT\n- Row 1: Jane Doe - Stanford\n- Row 2: Bob Wilson - Texas\n- Row 3: Alice Brown - Harvard\n- Row 4: Charlie Davis - Columbia\n- Row 5: David Miller - Michigan\n- Row 6: Will Campbell - Michigan\n\nWait, that's only two players from Michigan.

Will Campbell: Michigan\n\nSo, only two players attended the University of Michigan: David Miller and Will Campbell.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some rows? Let me count all the rows in the table body:\n\nThe table has multiple <tr> elements. Each player is a row from index 0 onwards.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: John Smith (MIT)\nRow 1: Jane Doe (Stanford)\nRow 2: Bob Wilson (Texas)\nRow 3: Alice Brown (Harvard)\nRow 4: Charlie Davis (Columbia)\nRow 5: David Miller (Michigan)\nRow 6: Will Campbell (Michigan)\n\nSo, only two players went to Michigan. The claim says Will is one of six, but according to the table, only two attended. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I sure? Let me double-check each row's college:\n\n- Row 0: MIT\n- Row 1: Stanford\n- Row 2: Texas\n- Row 3: Harvard\n- Row 4: Columbia\n- Row 5: Michigan\n- Row 6: Michigan\n\nYes, only two from Michigan. So the claim that Will is one of six students who went to Michigan is incorrect. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Will Campbell is one of six students from Michigan, but the table shows only two students attended Michigan.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table of student data with various columns and a specific claim about four students from \"ca technical high school\" being undrafted. My task is to verify whether this claim holds true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the table. Looking at it, there are several rows, each representing a student, and multiple columns with details like Name, Position (Pos), Height (Ht.), Weight (Wt.), Date of Birth (DOB), High School, College, and Draft Info. The claim is about students from \"ca technical high school\" who were undrafted.\n\nI need to check each row to see if the student's high school is listed as \"ca technical high school\" and whether their draft status is \"undrafted.\" If I find four such students, then the claim would be true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. The first row mentions \"calabasas high school,\" which isn't \"ca technical.\"\n2. The second row lists \"westchester hs\" as the high school.\n3. The third row has \"chatsworth hs.\"\n4. Fourth row: \"canyon hs.\"\n5. Fifth row: \"santa clarita valley hs.\"\n6. Sixth row: \"northridge high.\" Still not matching.\n7. Seventh row: \"canoga park hs.\"\n8. Eighth row: \"simi valley hs.\"\n9. Ninth row: \"simi valley hs.\"\n10. Tenth row: \"chatsworth hs.\"\n11. Eleventh row: \"simi valley hs.\"\n12. Twelfth row: \"simi valley hs.\"\n13. Thirteenth row: \"westchester hs.\"\n14. Fourteenth row: \"northridge high.\"\n15. Fifteenth row: \"south gate high school.\"\n16. Sixteenth row: \"south gate high school.\"\n17. Seventeenth row: \"south gate high school.\"\n18. Eighteenth row: \"south gate high school.\"\n19. Nineteenth row: \"chatsworth hs.\"\n\nNone of these rows have the high school listed as \"ca technical high school.\" Therefore, there are zero students from that specific high school in the table. Since the claim states four such students exist and none do, the claim is false.\n\nI should also ensure that I'm checking the correct columns. The relevant columns here are 'High School' to verify the institution and 'Draft Info' to check if they were undrafted. Each row's High School column was reviewed for \"ca technical high school,\" but it wasn't found in any of them.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the Draft Info column, even if a student had \"undrafted\" status, their high school would still need to be \"ca technical.\" Since no students match both criteria, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nIn conclusion, after reviewing all relevant cells, there are zero students from \"ca technical high school\" who were undrafted in the provided table. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"will campbell and arnie simkus be 2 of 6 students that go to michigan college.\" I need to verify if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows in the table correspond to Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Looking for \"will campbell\": Found at row index 23.\n- Looking for \"arnie simkus\": Found at row index 10.\n\nNext, I need to check their college information.

Row 5: Vernon Gholston - Ohio State.\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount properly.\n\nLet's list each player and their college:\n\n- Row 0: College not specified?

Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the provided HTML table, the columns are Name, Position, Height, Weight, Birthday, College, Draft. So for each player, their college is specified in the column named \"College.\"\n\nSo let's list all players and check if they went to Michigan:\n\n1. Row 0: Name not listed here, but looking at the data, it's actually row-wise from index 0 to 23.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me re-examine each player's college:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Player name is \"will campbell\"? Wait no, let me correct myself. The rows are from index 0 to 23.\n\nWait, in the HTML table provided, the first data row is for \"vernon gholston\" at row index 18? Or perhaps I'm miscounting because of how the tbody is structured.\n\nWait, actually, looking back: The table has a tbody with multiple tr elements. Each tr represents a player. So let's list each player and their college:\n\nRow indices (0-based):\n\n- Row 0: Joseph Barksdale - LSU\n- Row 1: Clarence Williams - Michigan\n- Row 2: Vernon Gholston - Ohio State\nWait, no, perhaps I need to recount properly.\n\nWait, the table starts with:\n\n<tr>\n   <td>vernon gholston</td>\n   ...\n</tr>\n\nBut that's row index 17? Or is it starting from 0?\n\nActually, in HTML tables, tbody contains rows. The first tr inside tbody is row index 0.\n\nSo let me list all players with their colleges:\n\nRow 0: Thomas Sidney Sims - Pittsburgh\nRow 1: Pat Ivey - Mizzou\nRow 2: AJ Ofodile - Mizzou\nRow 3: Clarence Williams - Michigan\nRow 4: Vernon Gholston - Ohio State\nRow 5: Joseph Barksdale - LSU\nRow 6: Will Campbell - Michigan\nRow 7: Arnie Simkus - Michigan\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

Let me count correctly.\n\nActually, the tbody has 23 tr elements (from index 0 to 22). Each represents a player. So:\n\nRow 0: Vernon Gholston - Ohio State\nRow 1: Joseph Barksdale - LSU\nRow 2: Will Campbell - Michigan\nRow 3: Clarence Williams - Michigan\nRow 4: Thomas Sidney Sims - Pittsburgh\nRow 5: AJ Ofodile - Mizzou\nRow 6: Pat Ivey - Mizzou\nRow 7: Arnie Simkus - Michigan\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each row systematically:\n\nLooking at the HTML tbody:\n\n1. <tr> <td>vernon gholston</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row index 0: Vernon Gholston, college \"ohio state\"\n2. <tr> <td>joseph barksdale</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 1: Joseph Barksdale, college \"LSU\"\n3. <tr> <td>clarence williams</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 2: Clarence Williams, college \"michigan\"\n4. <tr> <td>thomas sidney sims</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 3: Thomas Sims, college \"pittsburgh\"\n5. <tr> <td>aj ofodile</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 4: AJ Ofodile, college \"mizzou\"\n6. <tr> <td>pat ively</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 5: Pat Ivey, college \"mizzou\"\n7. <tr> <td>will campbell</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 6: Will Campbell, college \"michigan\"\n8. <tr> <td>arnie simkus</td> ... </tr> \u2192 Row 7: Arnie Simkus, college \"michigan\"\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the initial count because the HTML tbody starts with Vernon Gholston as the first row (index 0), then Joseph Barksdale (index 1), Clarence Williams (index 2), etc.\n\nSo let's correct:\n\n- Row index 6: Will Campbell - Michigan\n- Row index 7: Arnie Simkus - Michigan\n\nNow, checking all rows for players who attended Michigan:\n\nLooking through each row from 0 to 23:\n\nRow 2: Clarence Williams - Michigan (count = 1)\nRow 6: Will Campbell - Michigan (count = 2)\nRow 7: Arnie Simkus - Michigan (count = 3)\n\nWait, that's only three players.

Let me recount correctly:\n\nActually, the table starts from row index 0 as Vernon Gholston and goes up to row index 23 for Will Campbell.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's list all players who attended Michigan:\n\nFrom the HTML table, scanning through each row:\n\n- Clarence Williams: Michigan\n- Will Campbell: Michigan\n- Arnie Simkus: Michigan\n\nThat's three players.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"from ca technical high school joseph barksdale be the heaviest player.\" I need to verify if this claim is true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two main points:\n1. Joseph Barksdale attended CA Technical High School.\n2. He is the heaviest player in the dataset.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different player with various attributes like position, height, weight, birthdate, high school, college, and draft details. My task is to check if Joseph Barksdale's information supports both parts of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: Did Joseph Barksdale attend CA Technical High School? I'll scan through each row in the table. Scanning down, I find a player named \"joseph barksdale\" at row index 25 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). His high school is listed as LSU, not CA Technical High School. Wait, that's confusing because LSU is a college, specifically Louisiana State University. So perhaps there's an error here.\n\nWait, looking again: the \"high school\" column for Joseph Barksdale in the table says \"lsu.\" But LSU is a university, not a high school. That seems inconsistent. Maybe it's a typo or misentry in the data. Alternatively, perhaps he attended a high school named LSU? That doesn't seem likely because LSU is known as a college.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was confusion between his high school and his college. His college is listed as \"lsu\" (Louisiana State University). So if the table's 'high school' column has an error, it might have mistakenly put his college instead of his high school. Therefore, in the given data, Joseph Barksdale's high school isn't CA Technical High School but rather LSU.\n\nMoving to the second part: Is he the heaviest player? Let's check the weight column for all players. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The weights vary from 193 lbs (Clarence Williams) up to higher numbers. Joseph Barksdale's weight is listed as 325 lbs. Now, looking at other players:\n  - Clarence Williams: 193\n  - Vernon Gholston: 264\n  - Joseph Barksdale: 325\n  - Will Campbell: 311\n\nSo 325 is the highest weight in the table. Therefore, based on the data, he is indeed the heaviest player.\n\nBut wait, the first part of the claim isn't supported because his high school isn't listed as CA Technical High School but rather LSU. So even though he's the heaviest, since he didn't attend that high school, the entire claim isn't fully true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: Joseph Barksdale attended CA Technical High School and is the heaviest player.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"aaron kyle and guy frazier both go to wyoming college\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two people: Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier. It states that both attended Wyoming College. So, I need to check if both of these individuals have \"wyoming\" listed as their college in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different person with various attributes like Name, Position, Height, Weight, Date of Birth, College, and Draft Info. The columns are: Name, Position, Height, Weight, Date of Birth (DOB), College, Draft Info.\n\nLet's start by locating Aaron Kyle in the table. I'll scan through each row's Name column until I find him. \n\nRow 6: Clarence Williams? No. Row 7: Vernon Gholston? No. Row 8: Joseph Barksdale? No. Row 9: Will Campbell? No. Hmm, wait, maybe I missed earlier rows. Let me go back.\n\nLooking again from the top:\n\nRow 0: Aaron Kyle isn't here. Row 1: Thomas Sims? No. Row 2: Pat Ivey? No. Row 3: AJ Ofodile? No. Row 4: Clarence Williams? No. Row 5: Vernon Gholston? No. Wait, perhaps I'm looking too far ahead. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the table starts with Aaron Kyle as the first row after the header. So, Row 0 is Aaron Kyle. Let me confirm:\n\n- Name: Aaron Kyle\n- College: wyoming\n\nSo, Aaron Kyle's college is indeed Wyoming, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to find Guy Frazier in the table. Scanning through each row's Name column again:\n\nRow 13: Clarence Williams? No. Row 14: Vernon Gholston? No. Row 15: Joseph Barksdale? No. Row 16: Will Campbell? No. Hmm, perhaps I missed him earlier.\n\nWait, maybe Guy Frazier is in an earlier row. Let me check each name:\n\nRow 0: Aaron Kyle\nRow 1: Thomas Sidneysims\nRow 2: Pat Ivey\nRow 3: AJ Ofodile\nRow 4: Clarence Williams\nRow 5: Vernon Gholston\nRow 6: Joseph Barksdale\nRow 7: Will Campbell\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nThe table has multiple rows; let me count them:\n\n1. Aaron Kyle (row index 0)\n2. Thomas Sidneysims (row 1)\n3. Pat Ivey (row 2)\n4. AJ Ofodile (row 3)\n5. Clarence Williams (row 4)\n6. Vernon Gholston (row 5)\n7. Joseph Barksdale (row 6)\n8. Will Campbell (row 7)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me check again.\n\nActually, looking back, the table starts with Aaron Kyle as row index 0, and then each subsequent player is listed down to row 21 or so? Wait, no, let me recount properly:\n\nThe table has the following rows (from the provided HTML):\n\nRow indices start at 0. Let's list them all:\n\n- Row 0: Aaron Kyle\n- Row 1: Thomas Sidneysims\n- Row 2: Pat Ivey\n- Row 3: AJ Ofodile\n- Row 4: Clarence Williams\n- Row 5: Vernon Gholston\n- Row 6: Joseph Barksdale\n- Row 7: Will Campbell\n\nWait, that's only 8 rows. Hmm, perhaps the table was cut off in the provided HTML. Alternatively, maybe I need to check all rows again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the names are listed as follows:\n\nLooking at the table body, each <tr> represents a row. Let me list them out with their indices:\n\n0: Aaron Kyle\n1: Thomas Sidneysims\n2: Pat Ivey\n3: AJ Ofodile\n4: Clarence Williams\n5: Vernon Gholston\n6: Joseph Barksdale\n7: Will Campbell\n\nWait, that's 8 rows. But the claim is about Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier. So perhaps I'm missing some rows or miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes more players beyond what's shown here. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the provided HTML, the <tbody> has multiple <tr> elements. Each <tr> contains a player's data. Let me count how many there are.\n\nFrom the HTML, each player is listed as a separate row. So starting from Aaron Kyle (row 0), then Thomas Sidneysims (row1), Pat Ivey(row2), AJ Ofodile(row3), Clarence Williams(row4), Vernon Gholston(row5), Joseph Barksdale(row6), Will Campbell(row7). That's only 8 rows, but perhaps the table is longer elsewhere.\n\nWait, no. Looking again at the provided HTML, after row index 0 (Aaron Kyle), there are more rows:\n\n1: Thomas Sidneysims\n2: Pat Ivey\n3: AJ Ofodile\n4: Clarence Williams\n5: Vernon Gholston\n6: Joseph Barksdale\n7: Will Campbell\n\nWait, that's only 8 players. But the claim is about Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table was truncated in the provided HTML, but for the purpose of this task, we have to work with what's given. Let me check again each row:\n\nLooking at each <tr> in the tbody:\n\n1. Aaron Kyle (row 0)\n2. Thomas Sidneysims (row1)\n3. Pat Ivey (row2)\n4. AJ Ofodile (row3)\n5. Clarence Williams (row4)\n6. Vernon Gholston (row5)\n7. Joseph Barksdale (row6)\n8. Will Campbell (row7)\n\nWait, that's 8 rows, so perhaps the table only includes these players.\n\nBut then where is Guy Frazier? He's not in any of these rows. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing him or there was a typo in the name.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about two different people: Aaron Kyle and another person named Guy Frazier who attended Wyoming College. But based on the provided table, only Aaron Kyle has \"wyoming\" as his college.\n\nWait, looking back at each row's College column:\n\nRow 0: Aaron Kyle - College: wyoming\nRow1: Thomas Sidneysims - College: not sure, but let me check:\nLooking at the HTML, for each player, the College is listed in the 6th cell (since there are 7 columns: Name, Pos, Ht, Wt, DOB, College, Draft).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse each row correctly.\n\nLet me reconstruct each row properly:\n\nRow 0:\n- Name: Aaron Kyle\n- Position: ?\n- Height: ?\n- Weight: ?\n- DOB: ?\n- College: wyoming\n- Draft Info: ?\n\nBut from the HTML provided, each row's data is in <td> elements. Let me extract them.\n\nFor example, the first row:\n\n<tr>\n<td>Aaron Kyle</td>\n<td>Pos</td>\n<td>Ht</td>\n<td>Wt</td>\n<td>Dob</td>\n<td>wyoming</td>\n<td>Draft info</td>\n</tr>\n\nSo yes, Aaron Kyle's college is wyoming.\n\nLooking for Guy Frazier in the table:\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow0: Aaron Kyle - College: wyoming\nRow1: Thomas Sidneysims - College: ?\nRow2: Pat Ivey - College: ?\nRow3: AJ Ofodile - College: ?\nRow4: Clarence Williams - College: ?\nRow5: Vernon Gholston - College: ?\nRow6: Joseph Barksdale - College: ?\nRow7: Will Campbell - College: ?\n\nWait, perhaps the HTML includes more players beyond what I can see here. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided HTML, it seems that each row is a player with their details. So perhaps the table only includes these 8 players, and thus Guy Frazier is not present in this table. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified as both Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier attending Wyoming based on this data because Guy Frazier isn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, if the table was supposed to include more players but the HTML provided doesn't show them, I can only work with what's given. So, in the provided table, Aaron Kyle attended Wyoming, but there is no row for Guy Frazier, so we cannot confirm that he attended Wyoming as well.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier attended Wyoming College. Based on the provided table:\n\n- **Aaron Kyle** is listed with \"wyoming\" as his college.\n- **Guy Frazier** does not appear in the provided table.\n\nSince only Aaron Kyle's information is available, we cannot confirm that both attended Wyoming College. Therefore, the claim is partially true for Aaron Kyle but cannot be confirmed for Guy Frazier based on this data.\n\nAnswer: The claim is only partly supported by the data; while Aaron Kyle did attend Wyoming College, there is no information provided about Guy Frazier in the table to verify his college attendance.\n\nHowever, according to the instructions, I need to provide a concise answer within a box. Since only Aaron Kyle's college is confirmed and Guy Frazier isn't listed, the correct conclusion is that the claim cannot be fully verified with the given data.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\text{Only Aaron Kyle attended Wyoming College; there is no information about Guy Frazier.}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the claim: \"According to Cass Technical High School, Harlan Huckleby is 1 inch shorter than Walter Clago.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if both Harlan Huckleby and Walter Clago are in the table provided. Let me look through the names.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- The first row mentions \"Harlan Huckleby\" as a player with position RB, height 5'9\", weight 193 lbs.\n- I don't see any mention of \"Walter Clago\" in the table. All other players have different last names like Hackett, Cagle (which is similar but not Clago), Higgs, etc.\n\nSince Walter Clago isn't listed in the table, there's no data to compare their heights. Without both individuals' information, I can't verify if Harlan Huckleby is indeed 1 inch shorter than Walter Clago based on this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the given data because one of the subjects isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as Walter Clago is not listed in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
