    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether the claim \"mcg be the venue when the crowd be more than 29000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. It has seven columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows of data, each representing a game played on 8 July 1961 at different venues.\n\nThe claim is about two conditions:\n1. The venue must be \"mcg\".\n2. The crowd size must be more than 29000.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if there's any instance where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is western oval, crowd is 16648. Both conditions not met.\n- Row 1: Venue is windy hill, crowd is 12800. Conditions not met.\n- Row 2: Venue is victoria park, crowd is 20700. No match.\n- Row 3: Princes park with 14636. Still no.\n- Row 4: Lake oval and 13860. Not relevant.\n- Row 5: The venue here is mcg, and the crowd is 29947.\n\nNow, checking the crowd in row 5: 29947. Is this more than 29000? Yes, it's over by 947 people. So both conditions are satisfied here: venue is mcg and crowd exceeds 29000.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because there exists at least one instance where mcg was the venue with a crowd exceeding 29000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks each row for mcg as the venue and crowd over 29000. Only row 5 meets both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"north melbourne be the away team when the crowd be least\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's saying that North Melbourne was the away team in the game where the crowd size was the smallest. So, two things: identify the row where the away team is North Melbourne and check if it has the least crowd number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, etc. All games are on 8 July 1961.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team Footscray vs Away team Richmond. Crowd is 16,648.\n2. Second row: Home team Essendon vs Away team North Melbourne. Crowd here is 12,800.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs Geelong, crowd 20,700.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs St Kilda, crowd 14,636.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne vs Hawthorn, crowd 13,860.\n6. Sixth row: Melbourne vs Fitzroy at the MCG with a crowd of 29,947.\n\nNow, I need to find which game had the least crowd. Looking at all the crowd numbers:\n\n- 16,648\n- 12,800 (this is the second row)\n- 20,700\n- 14,636\n- 13,860\n- 29,947\n\nThe smallest crowd is 12,800 in the second row. In that game, North Melbourne is indeed the away team.\n\nSo, the claim checks out because when North Melbourne was the away team (second row), the crowd was the least at 12,800.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"away team score be 6.8 (44), when melbourne play home game in mcg\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is stating. It mentions that Melbourne is playing a home game at the MCG and asks if the away team's score was 6.8 (44) during that match.\n\nLooking at the table, I should scan each row to find where the home team is Melbourne and the venue is the MCG. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has Footscray as the home team, not Melbourne.\n2. The second row is Essendon vs North Melbourne; again, not Melbourne.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs Geelong, nope.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs St Kilda, still not.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne vs Hawthorn, incorrect.\n6. Sixth row: Melbourne as the home team, venue is MCG.\n\nSo, in the sixth row, Melbourne is the home team, and the venue is indeed the MCG. Now, looking at the away team score for this match: it's 6.8 (44), which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- The row where Melbourne is the home team at MCG (row index 5).\n- The \"away team score\" column in that row.\n\nThis confirms that when Melbourne played at the MCG, the away team's score was 6.8 (44).

The claim is \"all the match be hold on different day.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in HTML format. It seems to list several matches with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd numbers, and dates. My task is to check if all these matches were held on different days as per the claim.\n\nI notice that each row in the table represents a match. Each row has a 'date' column, which should indicate when each match took place. To verify the claim, I need to check the dates for each match and see if they are all unique\u2014meaning no two matches were held on the same day.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row shows the date as \"8 july 1961.\"\n2. The second row also has the date \"8 july 1961.\"\n3. The third row's date is again \"8 july 1961.\"\n4. Similarly, the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows all list the same date: \"8 july 1961.\"\n\nWait a minute... So every single match listed in this table took place on July 8th, 1961. That means they were held on the same day, not different days.\n\nThe claim says \"all the matches be hold on different day.\" Based on the data, since all dates are the same, the claim is false because they weren't held on different days\u2014they were all on July 8th.\n\nSo, I'll mark this as FALSE.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"north melbourne be the home team where the attendance be lowest\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It seems there are two main parts:\n1. Is North Melbourne the home team?\n2. Does this game have the lowest attendance?\n\nI need to check each of these against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', 'away team score', 'venue', 'crowd', and 'date'. The rows represent different games played on 8 July 1961.\n\nLet me go through each row to find where North Melbourne is the home team. \n\n- Row 0: Home team is Footscray. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Home team is Essendon. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Home team is Collingwood. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: Home team is Carlton. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Home team is South Melbourne. Not relevant.\n- Row 5: Home team is Melbourne. Not relevant.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows have North Melbourne as the home team. In all cases, North Melbourne appears only in the 'away team' column for row 1.\n\nSo, if North Melbourne isn't listed as a home team anywhere, they can't be the home team with the lowest attendance because there's no such game where they are the home team.\n\nTherefore, the first condition of the claim is not met. Since North Melbourne isn't the home team in any of these games, the entire claim doesn't hold true.\n\nAdditionally, just to confirm about the attendance part\u2014looking at the 'crowd' column\u2014the lowest number is 12800 in row 1 where the home team was Essendon against North Melbourne. So even if North Melbourne were a home team, they aren't, and the lowest crowd isn't associated with them.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that North Melbourne is the home team with the lowest attendance.

The claim states: \"the away team score be 9.9 (63), when north melbourne play away at windy hill.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim carefully. It mentions that North Melbourne played away and their score was 9.9 (63) at Windy Hill. So my task is to check if there's a row in the table where the away team is North Melbourne, they were playing at Windy Hill, and their score was indeed 9.9 (63).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All these rows have the same date of 8 July 1961.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: Home team is Footscray vs Away team Richmond at Western Oval. The away team here is Richmond, not North Melbourne, so this isn't relevant.\n\n2. **Second Row**: Home team is Essendon vs Away team North Melbourne at Windy Hill. This looks promising because it mentions North Melbourne as the away team and the venue is Windy Hill. Let me check their score: away team score is 3.10 (28). Wait, that's not matching the claim which says 9.9 (63). So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\n3. **Third Row**: Home team Collingwood vs Away team Geelong at Victoria Park. Neither the away team nor the venue matches the claim.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: Home team Carlton vs Away team St Kilda at Princes Park. Again, neither the away team nor venue matches.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: Home team South Melbourne vs Away team Hawthorn at Lake Oval. Doesn't match the claim.\n\n6. **Sixth Row**: Home team Melbourne vs Away team Fitzroy at MCG. Neither matches.\n\nWait a minute, I've checked all rows and only the second row has North Melbourne as the away team at Windy Hill, but their score was 3.10 (28), not 9.9 (63). So the claim is incorrect based on this data.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check. The claim says \"the away team score be 9.9 (63)\" when North Melbourne played at Windy Hill. Looking back at row 2: North Melbourne's away score was indeed 3.10 (28). So no, that doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because in the table, North Melbourne as the away team at Windy Hill scored 3.10 (28), not 9.9 (63).\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to North Melbourne playing away at Windy Hill with a score of 9.9 (63). Checking the table, row index 1 shows North Melbourne as the away team at Windy Hill but their score was 3.10 (28), not matching the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_ index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
