Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nThe table lists weekly games with details like week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The claim compares the attendance between week 2 and week 1. So, I need to find the attendance figures for both weeks and see if week 2's attendance was higher than week 1's.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row corresponds to a week. Week 1 is in the first row, and week 2 is in the second row. The relevant column here is \"attendance,\" which shows the number of people who attended each game.\n\nFor week 1, I'll check the attendance value. From the table, week 1 has an attendance of 44773. For week 2, the attendance is listed as 46460. Now, comparing these two numbers: 46460 (week 2) versus 44773 (week 1). \n\nIs 46460 greater than 44773? Yes, it is. So week 2 had a higher attendance than week 1.\n\nTo make sure I'm accurate, I'll double-check the row indices. Week 1 is in row index 0 and week 2 in row index 1. The column name we're looking at is \"attendance.\" \n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- For week 1: row 0, attendance column.\n- For week 2: row 1, attendance column.\n\nSince both attendances are correctly retrieved and compared, and week 2's number is higher, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE with the specified relevant cells included in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the highest number of crowd attend be on week 4\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, to check the attendance for each week, I need to look at the 'attendance' column for each row corresponding to each week.\n\nThe claim is about week 4 having the highest attendance. So, I'll start by finding the attendance number for week 4. Looking at the table, week 4 has an attendance of 80291. That's a pretty high number, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions without checking other weeks.\n\nNext, I'll go through each week and note down their attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nNow, I'll compare these numbers. The highest among them is indeed 80291 from week 4. However, I should also check if any other week has a higher attendance than that.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- The next highest after week 4 is week 3 with 59983.\n- Week 8 has 56191, which is less than week 4's number.\n- Week 14 has 65649, but that's still lower than 80291.\n\nSo, no other week exceeds the attendance of week 4. Therefore, the claim that week 4 had the highest attendance is true.\n\nI'll make sure I didn't miss any weeks or misread any numbers. Week 4 has the highest number listed as 80291, and none of the others surpass it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by comparing all the attendance figures across each week. Week 4's attendance is the highest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"week 9 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in HTML format. It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. My focus will be on the 'attendance' column since that's what the claim is about.\n\nThe claim compares the attendance of week 9 with week 10. So, I need to find the attendance numbers for both weeks.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For week 9, I'll check row index 8 (since HTML tables start counting from 0). The attendance listed there is 52,060.\n  \n- For week 10, that's row index 9. The attendance here is 46,264.\n\nNow, to verify the claim: Is week 9's attendance 5,796 more than week 10's? Let's calculate the difference.\n\n52,060 (week 9) minus 46,264 (week 10) equals 5,796. So yes, the claim is accurate because subtracting the two attendances gives exactly 5,796 more attendees in week 9 compared to week 10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the attendance numbers for weeks 9 and 10, which are found at row indices 8 and 9 respectively under the 'attendance' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, for each week, we can see how many people attended that game.\n\nThe claim is about week 13 having the least attendance. I'll need to look at all the attendance numbers in the 'attendance' column across all weeks and find out which week had the smallest number. \n\nLet me list out the attendance figures:\n\n- Week 1: 44,773\n- Week 2: 46,460\n- Week 3: 59,983\n- Week 4: 80,291\n- Week 5: 47,583\n- Week 6: 46,751\n- Week 7: 44,487\n- Week 8: 56,191\n- Week 9: 52,060\n- Week 10: 46,264\n- Week 11: 46,032\n- Week 12: 47,234\n- Week 13: 30,936\n- Week 14: 65,649\n- Week 15: 42,202\n- Week 16: 51,064\n\nNow, looking for the smallest number.

The claim states that week 2 has less attendance than week 1. However, 46460 is actually higher than 44773.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"week 13\" refers to the row in the table where week is number 13. Looking at the table, I'll scan down the 'week' column until I find week 13. From the HTML provided, I can see that week 13 corresponds to November 30, 1980, against the New Orleans Saints with a result of W 23-20 and an attendance of 30936.\n\nThe next part is \"most crowd attend.\" That means we're looking for which week had the highest attendance. So I need to check all the 'attendance' values in each row to see which one is the largest.\n\nLet me list out the attendance numbers from each week:\n\nWeek 1: 44773\nWeek 2: 46460\nWeek 3: 59983\nWeek 4: 80291\nWeek 5: 47583\nWeek 6: 46751\nWeek 7: 44487\nWeek 8: 56191\nWeek 9: 52060\nWeek 10: 46264\nWeek 11: 46032\nWeek 12: 47234\nWeek 13: 30936\nWeek 14: 65649\nWeek 15: 42202\nWeek 16: 51064\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance seems to be Week 4 with 80,291 attendees. That's way higher than week 13's 30,936.\n\nWait a minute, so if week 4 has the highest attendance, then week 13 doesn't have the most crowd attend. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because week 4 had more people attending than any other week, including week 13.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, let me go through each week's attendance again:\n\n- Week 1: ~45k\n- Week 2: ~46k\n- Week 3: ~60k\n- Week 4: ~80k (highest so far)\n- Week 5: ~47k\n- Week 6: ~46k\n- Week 7: ~44k\n- Week 8: ~56k\n- Week 9: ~52k\n- Week 10: ~46k\n- Week 11: ~46k\n- Week 12: ~47k\n- Week 13: ~31k (lowest so far)\n- Week 14: ~65k\n- Week 15: ~42k\n- Week 16: ~51k\n\nYep, week 4 still holds the highest attendance. So week 13 is definitely not the one with the most crowd attend.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that week 13 has the most attendance, but upon reviewing all weeks, week 4 had the highest attendance of 80,291.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"week 8 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It states that the attendance for week 8 is 5,796 higher than that of week 10. To verify this, I'll need to find the attendance numbers for both weeks from the table and calculate the difference between them.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, attendance.\n\nI'll start by locating week 8. Scanning through the rows, I find that week 8 is on October 26, 1980, against the Green Bay Packers, with a loss of 16-3 and an attendance figure of 56,191.\n\nNext, I'll look for week 10. Week 10 is on November 9, 1980, against the Detroit Lions, resulting in a win with a score of 34-0, and the attendance is listed as 46,264.\n\nNow, to check if week 8's attendance is indeed 5,796 more than week 10's. I'll subtract week 10's attendance from week 8's: 56,191 - 46,264 = 9,927. \n\nHmm, that's a difference of 9,927, which is much higher than the claimed 5,796. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate because the actual difference is greater than stated.\n\nSo, based on this calculation, the claim should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
