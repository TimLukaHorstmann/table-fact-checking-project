    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an HTML table and a claim about it. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"there be currently 12 t - 260 eu aircraft in service\". Okay, so I'm looking for two pieces of information here. The first is the specific aircraft model mentioned, which is 't - 260 eu'. The second part is about how many are currently in service.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table to find any entries that match this aircraft. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. Cessna A-37 Dragonfly \u2013 doesn't match.\n2. FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e3\u00a1 \u2013 nope.\n3. Lockheed C-130 Hercules \u2013 not it.\n4. Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante \u2013 no match.\n5. Beechcraft Twin Bonanza \u2013 no.\n6. CASA C-212 Aviocar \u2013 doesn't fit.\n7. Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia \u2013 not this one either.\n8. Cessna 206 Stationair \u2013 still no.\n9. Beechcraft B58 Baron \u2013 not relevant here.\n10. British Aerospace 125 \u2013 nope.\n11. Aermacchi SF260 \u2013 hmm, this looks promising because 't - 260 eu' is mentioned in the versions column.\n\nLooking at row 11 (assuming rows are zero-indexed), under the \"versions\" column, it says \"t - 260 eu\". That's a match. Now, checking the \"in service\" column for this row: it shows '12'. So according to the table, there are currently 12 of these aircraft in service.\n\nWait a second, I should make sure that the model matches exactly. The claim says 't - 260 eu', and the table has 't - 260 eu' under versions for Aermacchi SF260. So yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's all the necessary information. No other rows mention 't - 260 eu', so this must be the relevant one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows 12 T-260 EU aircraft in service under Aermacchi SF260.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Looking through each row:\n\n- The first few rows are about different aircraft types and their versions. I'm looking for \"t - 260 eu\" in the 'versions' column.\n- Scanning down, I notice a row with \"aermacchi sf260\". Under this row:\n  - The 'aircraft' is \"aermacchi sf260\"\n  - The 'origin' is Italy\n  - The 'type' is trainer\n  - The 'versions' column shows \"t - 260 eu\"\n  - The 'in service' number is 12.\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 13 (counting from 0). \n\nThe claim states that there are 12 T-260 EU aircraft in service.

Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Target Model:** The claim mentions \"t - 260 eu\" and we look for this exact version in the 'versions' column.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Row:** Find the row where versions = \"t - 260 eu\". This is found in row index 13.\n\n3. **Check In Service Count:** The 'in service' value for that row is 12, which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the number of aircraft currently in service as per the table aligns with the claim, it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So I need to find if there are any entries in the table that match these criteria: origin is Brazil and version is C-95. Also, check how many of them are currently in service.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row's \"origin\" column for Brazil. The rows with origin as Brazil are:\n\n1. embraer emb 110 bandeirante (row index 3)\n2. embraer emb 120 brasilia (row index 6)\n\nNow, I need to check the versions of these aircraft.

So there are 3 C-95 Embraer emb 110 bandeirante aircraft currently in service from Brazil.\n\nSince the table directly supports that there are indeed 3 of these Brazilian aircraft with version C-95 in service, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, column \"versions\" which shows 'C-95'\n- Row 3, column \"in service\" showing '3'\n\nSo I'll note these as the relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"With 2 in service by the US, the Beechcraft represent the B58 model aircraft.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the claim. So, there are two main points here:\n\n1. There are 2 Beechcraft planes in service with the US.\n2. These Beechcraft planes are of the B58 model.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find any entries related to Beechcraft and check their details.\n\nStarting from the top, I see a few rows:\n\n- Row 0: Cessna A-37 Dragonfly (US, Attack/Fighter)\n- Row 1: FMA IA58 Pucar\u00e1 (Argentina, Attack)\n- Row 2: Lockheed C-130 Hercules (US, Transport/Utility)\n- Row 3: Embraer Bandeirante (Brazil, Transport/Utility)\n- Row 4: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza (US, Transport/Utility) with version D50 and in service count of 1.\n- Then there's another Beechcraft entry at row 8: Beechcraft B58 Baron (US, Trainer/Liaison), version B-58, in service is 2.\n\nWait, so the claim mentions \"Beechcraft represent the B58 model aircraft\" with 2 in service by the US. So I need to check which Beechcraft models are listed and their in-service counts.\n\nLooking at row 4: It's a Twin Bonanza, version D50, only 1 in service. That doesn't match B58 or count of 2.\n\nBut then row 8 is Beechcraft B58 Baron. Here, the origin is US, versions are B-58, and in service it says \"2\". So that fits both parts: 2 in service by US, and model B58.\n\nSo the claim seems to be correct because there's a Beechcraft B58 with exactly 2 units in service by the US. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"origin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"bell uh - 1 iroquois be the version of b - 58 aircraft model originate in the united state which have 2 in service.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Aircraft Model**: Bell UH-1 Iroquois.\n2. **Version**: B-58.\n3. **Origin Country**: United States.\n4. **In Service Count**: 2.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row for \"bell uh  - 1 iroquois.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The first relevant entry is under the aircraft name \"bell uh  - 1 iroquois\" in row index 14 (since counting starts from 0). Let me check each column for this row.\n\n**Row Index 14:**\n- **aircraft**: bell uh  - 1 iroquois\n- **origin**: united states\n- **type**: transport / utility\n- **versions**: uh  - 1h\n- **in service**: 13\n\nSo, from this row:\n- The origin is indeed the United States. That matches.\n- The in-service count here is 13, not 2. So that doesn't match the claim.\n\nNext, let's look for \"b-58\" as a version. Scanning through the versions column:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 0: a - 37b\n- Row 1: a - 58\nWait, row 1 has \"a - 58\" in versions, but that's for FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e3\u00a1. Not related to Bell.\n\nLooking further down, another mention is in row 9: beechcraft b58 baron, with version \"b - 58\". That's different from Bell. \n\nSo the \"b-58\" version is associated with Beechcraft, not Bell UH-1 Iroquois.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- The claim states that Bell UH-1 Iroquois is a B-58 model from the US with 2 in service.\n- In reality, the UH-1 Iroquois has version uh -1h and 13 in service. The B-58 version belongs to another aircraft (Beechcraft), not Bell.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n- The version number doesn't match (uh-1h vs b-58)\n- The in-service count is 13, not 2\n- The model B-58 is a different aircraft altogether.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes the B-58 version and service count to the Bell UH-1 Iroquois. \n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n1. **Aircraft Check**: The Bell UH-1 Iroquois is correctly identified in row 14.\n2. **Version Mismatch**: Its version is uh -1h, not B-58.\n3. **Service Count**: It has 13 units in service, not 2.\n4. **B-58 Version**: This version belongs to the Beechcraft b58 baron (row 9), not Bell.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says \"ebraer\" instead of \"embraer,\" and \"basilia\" instead of \"brasilia.\" I think it's referring to the Embraer EMB 120 Bras\u00edlia.\n\nLooking at the table, let me scan each row for this aircraft. \n\nI see a row with \"embraer emb 110 bandeirante\" from Brazil, which is transport/utility.

But according to the table, the EMB 120 Bras\u00edlia is made by Brazil. So the origin doesn't match.

For example, another Bell aircraft, the \"bell uh-1 iroquois,\" has a different type listed as \"transport / utility\" as well, which isn't related to training.\n\nSo, since the 'type' for bell 212 twin huey is transport/utility and not trainer, the claim is false. The relevant cells are the aircraft name and its type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
