Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, let me find the row where the romanized title is \"arienai kisu.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- The second row (row index 1) has \"arienai kisu\" as the romanized title.\n\nNext, I need to identify which episode has the earliest broadcast date. Let's list out the broadcast dates from each episode:\n\n- Episode 1: May 10, 2010\n- Episode 2: May 17, 2010\n- Episode 3: May 24, 2010\n- Episode 4: May 31, 2010\n- Episode 5: June 7, 2010\n- Episode 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to Episode 1.\n\nNow, I need the ratings for both \"arienai kisu\" (Episode 2) and the episode with the earliest date (Episode 1).\n\n- Episode 2's rating: 19.2%\n- Episode 1's rating: 22.4%\n\nThe claim states that \"arienai kisu\" has 3.2% less than the earliest episode. Let me calculate the difference:\n\n22.4% - 19.2% = 3.2%.\n\nSo, yes, Episode 2's rating is exactly 3.2% lower than Episode 1's rating.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For \"arienai kisu\": row index 1, column \"ratings\"\n- For the earliest broadcast date: row index 0 (Episode 1), column \"ratings\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"arienai kisu be broadcast 7 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two main things: a specific episode titled \"arienai kisu\" and its broadcast date in relation to another episode that has the earliest broadcast date. The claim states that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast 7 days after the one with the earliest broadcast date.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six episodes listed from ep1 to ep6. Each episode has a \"broadcast date.\" My first task is to identify which episode has the earliest broadcast date because the claim refers to that as the starting point.\n\nLet me list out all the broadcast dates:\n\n- Ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- Ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- Ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- Ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- Ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- Ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nFrom this list, the earliest broadcast date is clearly May 10, 2010, which corresponds to ep1 titled \"omae ga hosii.\"\n\nNow, the claim mentions that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast seven days after this earliest date. Ep2 is titled \"arienai kisu,\" so I need to check its broadcast date.\n\nEp2's broadcast date is May 17, 2010. Let me calculate the number of days between May 10 and May 17. Counting each day: May 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\u2014wait, that's six days in between, making it seven days including both start and end dates? Wait no, actually, when counting the difference between two dates, if you subtract May 10 from May 17, you get exactly seven days. So May 10 plus seven days is May 17.\n\nSo ep2 was broadcast exactly one week after ep1, which had the earliest broadcast date. Therefore, the claim that \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) was broadcast 7 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date is correct.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. The key information comes from the broadcast dates of ep1 and ep2, as well as their respective titles to confirm which episode we're talking about.\n\nFor ep1 (row index 0), the relevant columns are \"episode title\" and \"broadcast date.\" For ep2 (row index 1), again, it's the same two columns. So the cells I need to reference are:\n\n- Row 0: \"episode title\" and \"broadcast date\"\n- Row 1: \"episode title\" and \"broadcast date\"\n\nThese four cells provide all the necessary information to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Looking at the table, each row has an \"episode title\" and a \"romanized title.\" The romanized titles are given, so I can match the claim's phrase to the romanized titles. \n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Episode 1: ome ga hosii\n- Episode 2: arienai kisu\n- Episode 3: fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\n- Episode 4: konna ni suki dattanda\u2026\n- Episode 5: suki to ietara iinoni\n- Episode 6: saish\u016bsh\u014djomakuwakare\n\nSo, the fifth episode has the romanized title \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" That's a match. Now, I need to check the broadcast dates for each episode to determine if this is the second most recent.\n\nThe broadcast dates are:\n\n- Episode 1: May 10, 2010\n- Episode 2: May 17, 2010\n- Episode 3: May 24, 2010\n- Episode 4: May 31, 2010\n- Episode 5: June 7, 2010\n- Episode 6: June 14, 2010\n\nTo find the most recent and second most recent dates, I can order them chronologically:\n\n1. June 14, 2010 (Episode 6) - Most recent\n2. June 7, 2010 (Episode 5) - Second most recent\n3. May 31, 2010 (Episode 4)\n4. May 24, 2010 (Episode 3)\n5. May 17, 2010 (Episode 2)\n6.

Therefore, the claim that \"suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table. The relevant information comes from the row where the romanized title matches and its corresponding broadcast date. That's row index 4 (since rows start at 0) for the \"romanized title\" column and the same row index for the \"broadcast date\" column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 4, column \"romanized title\"\n- Row 4, column \"broadcast date\"\n\nI can represent these in JSON as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"romanized title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 2.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\" \n\nSo, there are two main parts here:\n1. Identify the rating for \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\"\n2. Determine which episode has the most recent broadcast date and its corresponding rating.\n3. Compare these two ratings to see if the difference is 2.2%.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating each piece of information.\n\nFor part 1: The episode titled \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" is in row index 2 (since counting starts from 0). Its rating is 15.6%, as shown under the \"ratings\" column.\n\nNext, for part 2: I need to find the most recent broadcast date. Scanning through the \"broadcast date\" column:\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe most recent date is June 14, 2010, which corresponds to episode 6. The rating for this episode is 13.4%.\n\nNow, comparing the two ratings:\n\"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has a rating of 15.6%, and the most recent episode has a rating of 13.4%. To find the difference: 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2%.\n\nWait, that's exactly a 2.2% higher rating.

The goal is to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 4% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\" \n\nI need to parse this correctly. It seems like it's saying that the episode titled \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a rating that is 4 percentage points higher than the episode with the lowest rating.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details including the title and ratings. The columns are: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which episode has the title \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Episode 1: omae ga hosii\n- Episode 2: arienai kisu\n- Episode 3: fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\n- Episode 4: konna ni suki dattanda\u2026\n- Episode 5: suki to ietara iinoni\n- Episode 6: saish\u016bsh\u014djomakuwakare\n\nSo, the title \"suki to ietara iinoni\" is in row 4 (index starting at 0, so row index 4). The rating for this episode is 17.4%.\n\nNext, I need to find the episode with the lowest rating. Looking through the ratings:\n\n- Episode 1: 22.4%\n- Episode 2: 19.2%\n- Episode 3: 15.6%\n- Episode 4: 15.5%\n- Episode 5: 17.4%\n- Episode 6: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating is 13.4% for episode 6.\n\nNow, the claim states that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a 4% higher rating than this lowest-rated episode. Let's compute the difference:\n\n17.4% (episode 5) - 13.4% (episode 6) = 4%.\n\nSo, the difference is exactly 4%. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- Episode 5's rating: row index 4, column \"ratings\".\n- Episode 6's rating: row index 5, column \"ratings\".\n\nThese are the two data points needed to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"arienai kisu be broadcast 14 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two things: \"arienai kisu\" and another episode which has the earliest broadcast date. It claims that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast 14 days after the one with the earliest date.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are six episodes listed from ep 1 to ep 6. Each row has details like episode title, romanized title, translation, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nI need to identify which episodes correspond to \"arienai kisu\" and the earliest broadcast date.\n\nStarting with \"arienai kisu\", I'll look for that in the 'romanized title' column. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- ep 1: ome ga hosii\n- ep 2: arienai kisu \u2192 This matches.\n  \nSo, \"arienai kisu\" is episode 2.\n\nNext, find the earliest broadcast date. The 'broadcast date' for each episode is as follows:\n\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to episode 1.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"arienai kisu\" (ep 2) was broadcast 14 days after the earliest date. Let's calculate the number of days between May 10 and May 17, 2010.\n\nMay has 31 days, so from May 10 to May 17 is 7 days later because:\n\n- May 10 \u2192 next day is May 11 (1)\n- Then adding 6 more days: May 12 (2), 13 (3), 14 (4), 15 (5), 16 (6), and 17 (7).\n\nSo, the broadcast date of ep 2 is exactly one week (7 days) after the earliest date. The claim says it's 14 days later, which would be two weeks.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that ep 2 was broadcast 14 days after May 10, but according to the table, it's only 7 days later. So, the claim is incorrect.\n\nIn terms of relevant cells:\n\n- For \"arienai kisu\", we look at row index 1 (since ep 2 is the second row, starting from 0) in 'romanized title'.\n- The earliest broadcast date is in row 0 ('broadcast date' column).\n- Ep 2's broadcast date is in row 1.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: 'broadcast date'\n- Row 1: 'romanized title' and 'broadcast date'\n\nWait, but when checking the claim, we need to compare the two dates. So, the earliest date is in ep 1 (row 0), and the broadcast date of ep 2 is row 1.\n\nSo, relevant cells are:\n\n- row 0: 'broadcast date'\n- row 1: 'romanized title' (to confirm it's arienai kisu)\n- row 1: 'broadcast date' (to check when it was aired)\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because it was only 7 days after, not 14.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"romanized title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"arienai kisu have 5.8% more rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify which episode has the highest ratings and which one was aired first.\n\nLooking at the table, the episodes are listed from ep1 to ep6. Each has a broadcast date, so I'll check those dates to find the earliest one. The broadcast dates are May 10, 2010 (ep1), then May 17, May 24, May 31, June 7, and June 14. So the earliest is definitely ep1 on May 10.\n\nNow, what's the rating for ep1? It says 22.4%. \n\nNext, I need to find the episode titled \"arienai kisu.\" Looking through the romanized titles, I see that ep2 has that exact title with a rating of 19.2%.\n\nThe claim is that \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) has 5.8% more than the earliest broadcasted episode. Wait, the earliest is ep1 at 22.4%, and ep2 is 19.2%. Let me calculate the difference: 19.2 - 22.4 = -3.2%. That's a decrease, not an increase.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. The claim says \"5.8% more,\" so if the earliest had X%, then ep2 should be X + 5.8. But 22.4 + 5.8 is 28.2, which isn't what ep2 has. Alternatively, perhaps it's a percentage increase relative to the earliest? Let me check: (19.2 / 22.4) * 100 = about 85.7%, so that's actually a decrease of around 14.3%. So the claim is wrong because ep2 has a lower rating, not higher.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check: The earliest broadcast date is May 10 (ep1) with 22.4%. \"arienai kisu\" is ep2 with 19.2%. So the claim says that ep2 has 5.8% more than ep1, but actually, it's less by about 3.2 percentage points.\n\nSo the relevant cells are: ep1's rating (row 0, column 'ratings') and ep2's rating (row 1, same column).

Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Identify \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\":** Looking at the table, each row has a column called \"romanized title\". Scanning through those, I see that episode 3 is titled \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" which translates to \"the proposal out of revenge.\" So, this is referring to Episode 3.\n\n2. **Determine its rating:** The ratings are in the \"ratings\" column. For Episode 3, the rating is 15.6%.\n\n3. **Find the title with the most recent broadcast date:** The broadcast dates are listed in the \"broadcast date\" column. I'll need to look through each episode's date and find which one is the latest. \n\n   - Ep 1: May 10, 2010\n   - Ep 2: May 17, 2010\n   - Ep 3: May 24, 2010\n   - Ep 4: May 31, 2010\n   - Ep 5: June 7, 2010\n   - Ep 6: June 14, 2010\n   \n   The most recent broadcast date is June 14, 2010, which corresponds to Episode 6.\n\n4. **Check the rating of that episode:** Looking at Episode 6's rating in the \"ratings\" column, it's 13.4%.\n\n5. **Calculate the difference:** Now, I need to see if fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu (Episode 3 with 15.6%) is 3.2% higher than Episode 6 (13.4%). \n\n   Let's subtract Episode 6's rating from Episode 3's: \n   15.6% - 13.4% = 2.2%\n\n6. **Compare the difference to 3.2%:** The claim states that it's higher by 3.2%, but according to the calculation, it's only a 2.2% difference. \n\nTherefore, the claim is not accurate because the actual difference is less than what was claimed. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that were used in this analysis:\n\n- For \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\", the relevant cell is Episode 3's rating, which is row index 2 (since counting starts at 0) and column name \"ratings\".\n- The most recent broadcast date is Episode 6, so its rating is in row index 5 and column name \"ratings\".\n\nThese two cells are essential to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading the claim and then checking each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify which episode has the title \"suki to ietara iinoni\". Looking at the 'romanized title' column, in row index 4 (since rows start from 0), it's listed as \"suki to ietara iinoni\". So that's episode 5.\n\nNext, I need to find out what its rating is. In the same row, under the 'ratings' column, it's 17.4%.\n\nNow, I have to determine which episode has the lowest rating because the claim compares \"suki...\" to this title. Looking through all the ratings:\n\n- ep1: 22.4%\n- ep2: 19.2%\n- ep3: 15.6%\n- ep4: 15.5%\n- ep5: 17.4%\n- ep6: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating is 13.4%, which is for ep6.\n\nSo the claim is saying that \"suki...\" has a rating that's 5.8% higher than ep6. Let me check the difference between 17.4% and 13.4%. \n\n17.4 - 13.4 = 4.0%\n\nThe actual difference is 4%, but the claim states it's 5.8% higher. That doesn't match, so the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting \"higher than\". Let me recalculate. If ep6 has 13.4%, adding 5.8% would be 19.2%. But \"suki...\" has 17.4%, which is less than 19.2%, so the claim isn't true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the claim is that the difference is exactly 5.8%. So 17.4 - X =5.8, which would mean X=11.6. But no episode has a rating of 11.6. The lowest is 13.4, so again, not matching.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because \"suki...\" does not have a rating that's 5.8% higher than the lowest-rated episode; it's only 4% higher.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the ratings for \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (ep5) and the episode with the lowest rating, which is ep6.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Episode with Title**: Locate \"suki to ietara iinoni\" in the 'romanized title' column at row 4.\n2. **Find Its Rating**: The corresponding rating is 17.4% in the same row under 'ratings'.\n3. **Determine Lowest Rated Episode**: Scan all ratings; ep6 has the lowest at 13.4%.\n4. **Calculate Difference**: Subtract 13.4 from 17.4 to get a difference of 4.0%, not 5.8% as claimed.\n\nSince the actual difference is less than what's stated, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
