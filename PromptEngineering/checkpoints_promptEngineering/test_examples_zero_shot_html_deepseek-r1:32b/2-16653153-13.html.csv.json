    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game with a score of 103 - 101.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It seems like there might be some confusion in wording. I think it's saying that the 'box score' is present for every entry in the table, including the specific game where the score was 103-101.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has a 'box score' column. So, my first step is to check if all entries under this column are filled as \"box score.\" \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: The 'box score' cell says \"box score\" \u2013 that's correct.\nRow 1: Same here, it's \"box score.\"\nRow 2: Also \"box score.\"\nRow 3: Again, \"box score.\"\nRow 4: Still \"box score.\"\nRow 5: It's \"box score.\"\nRow 6: Yes, \"box score.\"\nRow 7: And this one too.\n\nSo every row has the 'box score' as expected. Now, I need to check if the game with a score of 103-101 is included in these entries.\n\nLooking through the scores:\n- Row 0 shows \"103 - 101\" between Townsville Crocodiles and Sydney Spirit.\nSo that specific game is present and its 'box score' entry is correctly filled as \"box score.\"\n\nSince all entries have 'box score' and the specific game in question also has it, the claim holds true. There's no exception or missing data that would make the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because every row in the table lists 'box score', including the one with the 103-101 score.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"box score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like the user is saying that every entry (row) in the table has an entry labeled \"box score,\" including specifically the row where the away team is Sydney Spirit.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column named \"box score.\" Each row under this column has the value \"box score.\" So, at first glance, it seems like all entries have that label. But wait, I need to make sure about two things: \n\n1. Does every single row in the \"box score\" column say \"box score\"? \n2. Is there a specific game where Sydney Spirit is the away team and does its corresponding \"box score\" cell also say \"box score\"?\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Townsville Crocodiles, away team is Sydney Spirit. The box score column says \"box score.\"\n- Rows 1 to 6: Checking all rows, the box score column in every case has \"box score.\"\n- Row 7: Home team is Sydney Spirit, away team is Wollongong Hawks.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The table has columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report. There are 8 rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things:\n1. Melbourne Tigers as a team.\n2. Their home game location being the State Netball and Hockey Centre.\n\nI'll need to find any row where Melbourne Tigers are listed as the home team because that would indicate their home venue. Let's scan through each row.\n\nLooking at row indexes from 0 to 7:\n\nRow 0: Home team is Townsville Crocodiles.\nRow 1: Home team is Cairns Taipans.\nRow 2: Home team is Wollongong Hawks.\nRow 3: Home team is Adelaide 36ers.\nRow 4: Home team is Gold Coast Blaze.\nRow 5: Here, the home team is Melbourne Tigers. Let me check the venue for this row. The venue is listed as \"state netball and hockey centre\". So that's a match.\n\nWait, but does this mean they played their home game there? Yes, because in the table, the 'home team' column lists them as playing at that venue on 25 October.\n\nSo the relevant cell here is row index 5, under the 'venue' column.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"gold coast blaze have their home game in the venue of gold coast convention centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's stating that Gold Coast Blaze play a home game at the Gold Coast Convention Centre. To verify this, I should look for rows where 'Gold Coast Blaze' is listed as the home team and check if their venue matches 'Gold Coast Convention Centre'.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 2 (index 4) has 'gold coast blaze' as the away team, so that's not a home game.\n- There's another row with 'gold coast blaze' but I need to ensure it's the home team. Checking each row:\n  - Rows: \n    0: Townsville Crocodiles vs Sydney Spirit\n    1: Cairns Taipans vs New Zealand Breakers\n    2: Wollongong Hawks vs Gold Coast Blaze (Blaze is away)\n    3: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats\n    4: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers (Blaze is home)\n    5: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles\n    6: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans\n    7: Sydney Spirit vs Wollongong Hawks\n\nWait, actually in the provided table, each row's 'home team' and 'away team' are listed.

The venue here is 'gold coast convention centre'.\n\nSo in this case, when Gold Coast Blaze is the home team, they are playing at their home venue, which is listed as 'gold coast convention centre'.

Date: 24 October\n2. Venue: State Netball and Hockey Centre\n3. Score: 113 - 116\n4. Home Team: Melbourne Tigers\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to see if there's a match.\n\nLooking at the first row (index 0):\n- Date: 22 October \u2192 Doesn't match.\n  \nSecond row (index 1):\n- Date: 22 October \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nThird row (index 2):\n- Date: 24 October \u2192 Matches.

Let me double-check all rows for the date 24 October. Only row index 2 has that date, but its venue doesn't match. So there's no match on 24 October at State Netball and Hockey Centre with a score of 113-116.\n\nBut let me check other rows again in case I missed any. For example, row index 5 has Melbourne Tigers as the home team, but their date is 25 October, and the venue there is State Netball and Hockey Centre. The score there is 110 - 97, not 113-116.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- No match on 24 October at that specific venue.\n- Melbourne Tigers were home on 25 October at that venue but with a different score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a match on 24 October at \"state netball and hockey centre\" with a score of 113-116 and Melbourne Tigers as the home team. However, checking the table:\n\n1. The only match on 24 October (row index 2) was between Wollongong Hawks and Gold Coast Blaze at Win Entertainment Centre, not the specified venue.\n2. A match involving Melbourne Tigers occurred on 25 October (row index 5), but it's at the correct venue with a different score.\n\nThus, no matching row in the table satisfies all conditions of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the match on 26 october have box score type of box score with south dragon as home team and score of 103 - 101\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the date is 26 October. Scanning through the table rows:\n\n- The first six rows are from 22nd to 25th October.\n- The seventh row (index 7) has the date as 26 October.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim against this row.\n\n1. **Box score type**: The 'box score' column for this row is listed as \"box score\". So that matches.\n\n2. **Home team**: The home team in this row is \"sydney spirit\", not \"south dragons\". This doesn't match the claim.\n\n3. **Score**: The score here is 99 - 86, which isn't 103 - 101 as claimed.\n\nAlso, looking through all other rows for any mention of \"south dragons\" as home team:\n\n- Row index 5: Home team is \"gold coast blaze\".\n- Row index 6: Home team is \"melbourne tigers\".\n- Wait, no. Let me check again. Oh, row index 6 has the home team as \"south dragons\". But that's on 25 October, not 26.\n\nSo in the 26 October match, south dragons are not involved; it's between Sydney Spirit and Wollongong Hawks with a different score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks three aspects: date, home team, box score type, and score.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the match on 25 october have gold coast blaze as home team with score of 93 - 104 at venue gold coast convention centre\"\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of this statement against the table data.\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim mentions the date is 25 October. Looking through the table, there are multiple entries on 25 October. Let's note those rows: row indices 3, 4, 5, and 6 (since counting starts at 0). \n\n2. **Home Team Check**: The claim says \"gold coast blaze\" is the home team. I'll look for any of the 25 October rows where the 'home team' column matches this. Looking through rows:\n   - Row 3: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats (not relevant)\n   - Row 4: Gold Coast Blaze as home against New Zealand Breakers\n   - So, row index 4 has gold coast blaze as the home team.\n\n3. **Score Check**: The claim states the score is 93-104. Let's check row 4's 'score' column. It shows 113-116. That doesn't match. Wait, that might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong row? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in row index 4 (which is the fifth row), the score is indeed 113 - 116, so that's not matching 93-104. Maybe there's another row on 25 October where gold coast blaze is the home team with a different score? \n\nWait no, only row 4 has gold coast blaze as home team. So their score was 113-116, which doesn't match the claim's 93-104.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made an error in looking at the rows. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices for 25 October are:\n- Row 3: Adelaide vs Perth\n- Row 4: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers (score 113-116)\n- Row 5: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles\n- Row 6: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans\n\nSo, the only row with gold coast blaze as home is row 4. Their score was 113-116, not 93-104. Therefore, the claim's score doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the score format. The table shows scores like \"103 - 101\" which seems to be home team vs away team. So in row 4, gold coast blaze is home and scored 113, away team New Zealand Breakers scored 116. But the claim says the score was 93-104, which would imply home team (gold coast) scored 93 and away scored 104. That's different from what's in the table.\n\nSo, this suggests that the claim is incorrect because the actual score for gold coast blaze as home on 25 October was 113-116, not 93-104.\n\nAdditionally, checking the venue: The claim says \"gold coast convention centre\". In row 4, the venue is indeed \"gold coast convention centre\", so that part matches. But since the score doesn't match, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss another row where gold coast might be home with a different score. Looking again, no other rows on 25 October have gold coast as home team except row 4.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 4, 'home team' (to confirm it's gold coast)\n- Row index 4, 'score' (to check against claim)\n- Row index 4, 'venue' (matches)\n\nSince the score doesn't match, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"when the gold coast be the away team the score be 101 - 92.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully. It mentions two conditions:\n1. Gold Coast is the away team.\n2. The score is 101 - 92.\n\nI'll look through each row of the table to find any instance where Gold Coast Blaze is listed as the away team and check if their score matches 101-92.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Date 22 October, Home Team: Townsville Crocodiles vs Away Team: Sydney Spirit. Not relevant since Gold Coast isn't involved here.\n\nRow 1: Date 22 October, Home Team: Cairns Taipans vs Away Team: New Zealand Breakers. Again, Gold Coast isn't the away team here.\n\nRow 2: Date 24 October, Home Team: Wollongong Hawks vs Away Team: Gold Coast Blaze. The score is 98 - 96. Wait, that's not 101-92. So this row shows Gold Coast as the away team with a different score.\n\nRow 3: Date 25 October, Home Team: Adelaide 36ers vs Away Team: Perth Wildcats. No Gold Coast here.\n\nRow 4: Date 25 October, Home Team: Gold Coast Blaze vs Away Team: New Zealand Breakers. Wait, but in this case, Gold Coast is the home team, not away. So that doesn't fit our first condition.\n\nRow 5: Date 25 October, Home Team: Melbourne Tigers vs Away Team: Townsville Crocodiles. Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Date 25 October, Home Team: South Dragons vs Away Team: Cairns Taipans. No Gold Coast here either.\n\nRow 7: Date 26 October, Home Team: Sydney Spirit vs Away Team: Wollongong Hawks. Doesn't involve Gold Coast.\n\nSo, the only row where Gold Coast is involved as an away team is Row 2 (index 2). The score there is 98-96, not 101-92. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other rows where Gold Coast might be the away team with a different date or venue. But from my initial scan, Row 4 is when Gold Coast is at home, and that's it. So no other instances.\n\nTherefore, since the claim requires Gold Coast to be the away team with a specific score of 101-92, but in reality, their score as an away team was lower, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that when Gold Coast is the away team, the score should be 101-92. Checking all relevant rows where Gold Coast Blaze is listed as the away team (only Row 2), we find the actual score was 98-96. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
