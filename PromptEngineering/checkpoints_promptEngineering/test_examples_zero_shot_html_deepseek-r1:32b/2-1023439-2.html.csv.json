    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It's talking about the year 1986 and two specific values: US Dance being 6 and US R&B being 9. The structure seems to imply that in 1986, when the US R&B value is 9, the US Dance should be 6.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple rows for 1986. Let me check each one:\n\nRow 2 (index 2): Year 1986, Title \"under the influence\", US=56, US R&B=9, US Dance=6.\nRow 3 (index 3): Year 1986, Title \"animals\", all columns are '-', which I assume means no data or not applicable.\n\nSo for 1986, there's only one row with actual numbers where US R&B is 9. In that same row, the US Dance value is indeed 6. The other row for 1986 doesn't have any values, so it can't be considered here.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because in the row where US R&B is 9 during 1986, the US Dance is exactly 6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are from row index 2 where both the US R&B and US Dance values meet the conditions stated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\".\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts that can be checked against the table. The claim mentions a specific album title, \"under the influence\", which should have charted at position 56 in the US in both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, title, us, us r&b, and us dance. So, I'll focus on the 'year', 'title', and 'us' columns to verify this claim.\n\nNow, let's go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0 (1984):** The title is \"pretty mess\". This doesn't match \"under the influence\", so we can skip this row.\n\n2. **Row 1 (1985):** The title here is \"mechanical emotion\". Again, not matching the claim's title. However, looking at the 'us' column, it has a value of 107. But since the title doesn't match, this isn't relevant to our claim.\n\n3. **Row 2 (1986):** The title is \"under the influence\". This matches the claim's title. The 'us' column here shows 56, which aligns with the claim that it charted at 56 in 1986. So this part of the claim is supported by Row 2.\n\n4. **Row 3 (1986):** The title is \"animals\". Doesn't match, so we can ignore this row.\n\n5. **Row 4 (1988):** Title is \"undress\", which doesn't match either.\n\nNow, the claim mentions both 1985 and 1986. We've found that in 1986, \"under the influence\" charted at 56. But what about 1985?\n\nLooking back at Row 1 (1985), the title is different, so there's no data here for \"under the influence\". There's also no other row with the year 1985 that has this title. Therefore, there's no evidence in the table to support that \"under the influence\" charted at 56 in 1985.\n\nSo, while part of the claim is correct (the 1986 data), the part about 1985 isn't supported by the table. Since the claim asserts both years, but only one year is confirmed, the entire claim can't be fully supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"under the influence\" charted at position 56 in the US in both 1985 and 1986. Checking the table:\n\n- In 1986, \"under the influence\" is listed with a US chart position of 56 (Row 2).\n- There's no entry for \"under the influence\" in 1985.\n\nSince the claim isn't fully supported for both years, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
