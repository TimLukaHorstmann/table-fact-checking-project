    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"game 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and series. There are five rows of data, each corresponding to a different game.\n\nThe claim is about Game 4's date. So, I'll focus on finding which row corresponds to Game 4. Looking at the \"game\" column, I see that the games are numbered from 1 to 5 in separate rows. So, Game 4 should be in the fourth row (index starting at 0, so row index 3).\n\nNext, I need to check the date for Game 4. In the table, each game's date is listed under the \"date\" column. For row index 3, which is Game 4, the date is April 25. The claim states that Game 4 was on April 25, so this matches exactly.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, I'll double-check other relevant cells just in case there's any inconsistency. However, since the focus is on the game number and its corresponding date, and both align correctly, it seems solid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Game 4 was indeed played on April 25 according to the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions three main pieces of information: game number (4.0), series status (1-4), and the date (April 25). I'll need to check if all these details align with the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like \"game\", \"date\", \"series\" among others. Each row corresponds to a specific game. Since games are numbered from 1 to 5, game 4.0 would refer to the fourth game.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for Game 4. Scanning through, I see that in the first column (\"game\"), the entry is \"4\" which matches game number 4. Now, looking at other columns in this row:\n\n- The date is listed as \"april 25\". This matches the claim's date of April 25.\n- Under the \"series\" column, it shows \"1 - 3\". Wait a minute, that doesn't match the claim which states \"1 - 4\".\n\nSo, according to this row, after game 4, the series is at 1-3, not 1-4. The claim suggests that after game 4 on April 25, the series was 1-4, but in reality, it's 1-3.\n\nI should double-check if there might be any confusion between row indices and game numbers. In the table, each \"game\" is numbered sequentially starting from 1, so game 4 corresponds to row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0). However, regardless of how I look at it, the series after game 4 is still 1-3.\n\nTherefore, since the claim states that the series was 1-4 on April 25 when in fact it's 1-3, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data. This makes the claim FALSE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index for game 4 is 3 (since rows are zero-indexed: games 1 to 5 correspond to rows 0 to 4). Wait, no\u2014actually, in the provided table, each \"game\" entry directly corresponds to its number. So, game 4 is the fifth row if counting from 1, but in programming terms, it's index 3 when starting at 0.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made an error here. Let me recount:\n\nThe rows are:\n1: Game 1 (row 0)\n2: Game 2 (row 1)\n3: Game 3 (row 2)\n4: Game 4 (row 3)\n5: Game 5 (row 4)\n\nSo, game 4 is indeed at row index 3. The series in that row is \"1 - 3\", not \"1 - 4\" as the claim suggests.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the date: April 25 is in column \"date\" of row 3.\n- For the series status: \"1 - 3\" is in column \"series\" of row 3.\n\nSo, I'll include both these cells to show where the discrepancy lies.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on April 25 (game 4), the series was 1-4. However, the table shows the series as 1-3 after game 4. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"game 4 have a location attendance of at&t center 20491 and the series be 1 - 1\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts to check each against the table.\n\nPart 1: Game 4's location attendance is \"at&t center 20491\".\n- I'll look for row where game number is 4. Checking the rows, game 4 is in row index 3 (since counting starts at 0; row indices are 0 to 4). The column for \"location attendance\" should have this value.\n- In row 3, under \"location attendance\", it's listed as \"american airlines center 20829\". This doesn't match the claim which says \"at&t center 20491\".\n\nPart 2: The series is \"1 - 1\".\n- Still in game 4 (row index 3), the \"series\" column shows \"1 - 3\", not \"1 - 1\". So this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nWait, did I check correctly? Let me cross-verify. Game 2 is row index 1, where series becomes \"1 - 1\". So in game 4, it's actually \"1 - 3\". Therefore, both parts of the claim are wrong for game 4.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because:\n- The location attendance is incorrect.\n- The series score is not 1 - 1 but 1 - 3.\n\nRelevant cells checked are from row index 3 (game 4) in columns \"location attendance\" and \"series\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to game 4, so I check the corresponding row. Both location attendance and series do not match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
