    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the partner for both the championship in rome in 2003 and the championship in toronto in 2003 be martina navratilova.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It mentions two championships in 2003: one in Rome and another in Toronto. The claim is that Martina Navratilova was the partner for both of these events.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like outcome, year, championship location, surface type, partner, opponents, and score. I need to check the rows where the year is 2003 because the claim specifies that.\n\nThe relevant columns here are 'year', 'championship', and 'partner'. For each championship in Rome and Toronto in 2003, I'll look at their respective partners.\n\nLet's go through the table row by row:\n\n1. First row: outcome is winner, year 2003, championship Rome, surface clay, partner Martina Navratilova. So this matches the first part of the claim\u2014partner was indeed M. Navratilova for Rome in 2003.\n\n2. Second row: also a winner, same year 2003, championship Toronto, hard surface, partner is again Martina Navratilova. This matches the second part of the claim\u2014the partner in Toronto in 2003 was M. Navratilova as well.\n\nThe other rows are from 2004 and 2005, so they're not relevant to this claim since we only care about 2003.\n\nSo both relevant championships (Rome and Toronto) in 2003 have Martina Navratilova as the partner. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both entries for 2003 show Martina Navratilova as the partner.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the player be the runner-up at the 2004 Indian Well championship, and also be the runner-up at the 2004 Miami championship.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into two parts:\n1. The player was a runner-up in the 2004 Indian Wells championship.\n2. The same player was a runner-up in the 2004 Miami championship.\n\nI need to check both conditions against the table provided. Let's look at each row of the table one by one.\n\nLooking at the first row (index 0): It shows that in 2003, the player won the Rome championship on clay with Martina Navratilova as a partner. This doesn't pertain to 2004 events, so I can skip this.\n\nThe second row (index 1) is another 2003 win in Toronto on hard court. Again, not relevant for 2004, so moving on.\n\nThird row (index 2): Outcome is runner-up in 2004 Indian Wells on a hard surface with Elena Likhovtseva as the partner. Opponents are Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Su\u00e1rez. The score shows two sets: 6-1, 6-2. This directly supports the first part of the claim\u2014the player was a runner-up in Indian Wells in 2004.\n\nFourth row (index 3): Outcome is runner-up in 2004 Miami on hard surface with Elena Likhovtseva again as the partner. Opponents are Nadia Petrova and Meghann Shaughnessy, with scores of 6-2 and 6-3. This supports the second part of the claim\u2014the same player was a runner-up in Miami in 2004.\n\nFifth row (index 4) is about a win in 2005 at Miami, which doesn't relate to 2004 events.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by rows 2 and 3. Each has \"runner-up\" as the outcome, correct years (2004), correct championships (Indian Wells and Miami), same partner in both cases, and relevant scores. \n\nI don't see any discrepancies or missing information that would make either part of the claim false. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe player was a runner-up in both the 2004 Indian Wells and 2004 Miami championships as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championship\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

In 2005, the opponents are Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\n2. In Rome in 2003, the opponents are Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nLet me check each part one by one.\n\nStarting with the first part: Opponents in 2005. Looking at the table, I see that there's a row for the year 2005 (row index 4). The 'opponents' column in this row lists \"lisa raymond rennae stubbs.\" That matches exactly what the claim says. So this part seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: Opponents in Rome in 2003. Scanning through the rows, I find the first row (row index 0) which is for Rome in 2003. The 'opponents' column here has \"jelena doki\u0107 nadia petrova.\" Again, this matches what the claim states.\n\nI should also make sure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. Checking other rows, especially those from 2003 or mentioning Rome, but in this table, only row 0 is for Rome in 2003. Similarly, all other opponent entries don't interfere with these two points.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

The claim mentions 2003 but then talks about championships in 2004. That's odd because the years don't match up.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two things: whether the player was a winner in Miami and Indian Wells in 2004.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is from 2003 (Rome), outcome winner.\n2. Second row, 2003 (Toronto), outcome winner.\n3. Third row, 2004 (Indian Wells), outcome runner-up.\n4. Fourth row, 2004 (Miami), outcome runner-up.\n5. Fifth row, 2005 (Miami), outcome winner.\n\nThe claim says the player was a winner in both Miami and Indian Wells in 2004. But according to the table:\n\n- In 2004, at Indian Wells, the outcome is runner-up.\n- In 2004, at Miami, also runner-up.\n\nSo, in both cases, the player didn't win; they were runners-up. Therefore, the claim that the player was a winner in those two championships in 2004 is false.\n\nAdditionally, the initial part of the claim mentions \"in 2003,\" which doesn't align with the years mentioned for Miami and Indian Wells (both are 2004). So, there's inconsistency in the years as well.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the partner for both the championship in rome in 2003 and the championship in toronto in 2003 be alicia molik\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table correspond to the championships in Rome and Toronto in 2003. Looking at the table:\n\n- The first row has year 2003, championship Rome.\n- The second row also has year 2003, but the championship is Toronto.\n\nSo both of these are relevant because they're from the same year (2003) and different championships: Rome and Toronto.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'partner' column for both these rows to see if Alicia Molik is mentioned there. \n\nLooking at row 0:\n- Partner is Martina Navratilova.\n\nRow 1:\n- Partner is also Martina Navratilova.\n\nAlicia Molik isn't listed as a partner in either of these rows. Instead, it's Martina Navratilova for both championships in 2003. Therefore, the claim that Alicia Molik was the partner in both cases is false.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells from the table.

In 2003, at the Toronto Championship, the partner was Lisa Raymond.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows.

Looking at row index 1 (the second row), which is for 2003, Toronto. The partner there is Martina Navratilova. Wait, but the claim says Lisa Raymond was the partner in 2003 at Toronto.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match. So the first part of the claim is incorrect because the partner in 2004 Indian Wells was Elena Likhovtseva, not Martina Navratilova. And the second part says the 2003 Toronto partner was Lisa Raymond, but according to the table, it's Martina Navratilova.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor the first part (Indian Wells 2004), the row index is 2, column 'partner'.\n\nFor the second part (Toronto 2003), the row index is 1, column 'partner'.\n\nSo both these cells are relevant to assess the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
