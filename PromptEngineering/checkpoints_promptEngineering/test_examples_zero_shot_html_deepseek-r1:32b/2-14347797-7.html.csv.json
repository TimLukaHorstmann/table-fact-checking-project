The columns are: game, february, opponent, score, record, points. Each row represents a different game with various details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"february 21\". Looking at the 'february' column, each cell indicates the date in February when the game was played. I'll scan through this column to find any entry where the value is 21.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 0: february=2\n- Row 1: february=4\n- Row 2: february=5\n- Row 3: february=10\n- Row 4: february=12\n- Row 5: february=14\n- Row 6: february=16\n- Row 7: february=17\n- Row 8: february=19\n- Row 9: february=21 \u2192 This is the one.\n\nSo, row index 9 (0-based counting) has 'february' value 21. Now, I'll check the 'score' column in this row to see if it's 5 - 4.\n\nLooking at row 9, the 'score' is indeed \"5  - 4\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cell for verification is row 9, columns 'february' and 'score'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the score be 5 - 4 on february 24\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It mentions a specific date, February 24, and a score of 5-4. So, my goal is to check if on that date in the table, there's a game where the score was exactly 5-4.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: game, february, opponent, score, record, points. The rows go from game 54 up to 67, each with corresponding data.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows that have \"february\" equal to 24. Scanning through the \"february\" column:\n\n- Game 54: February 2\n- Game 55: February 4\n- Game 56: February 5\n- Game 57: February 10\n- Game 58: February 12\n- Game 59: February 14\n- Game 60: February 16\n- Game 61: February 17\n- Game 62: February 19\n- Game 63: February 21\n- Game 64: February 24\n- Game 65: February 26\n- Game 66: February 28\n- Game 67: February 29\n\nSo, the only row with february as 24 is row index 12 (since counting starts from 0; let's confirm that). Wait, looking at the table HTML, the first data row is game 54, which is row index 0. Then each subsequent row increments by one. So for February 24, it's in game 64, which should be row index 12 (as rows go from 0 to 13). Let me check: game 64 is the 13th data row if starting count at 0? Wait no, let me recount:\n\nGame 54 is row 0.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: Game 54\nRow 1: Game 55\n...\nRow 12: Game 64 (since 54 +12 =66? Wait that can't be right. Let's count correctly.\n\nWait, the rows are from 0 to 13 because there are 14 games listed (from game 54 to game 67). So:\n\nRow 0: Game 54\nRow 1: Game 55\n...\nRow 9: Game 63\nRow 10: Game 64 (February 24)\nWait, no. Let me check the HTML again.\n\nLooking at the tbody section:\n\n<tr>\n<td>54</td><td>2</td><td>...</tr>\n...\nContinuing until:\n<tr>\n<td>64</td><td>24</td><td>chicago blackhawks</td><td>3 - 1</td>...\n\nYes, so game 64 is row index 10 because counting from 0:\n\nGame 54: 0\n...\nEach subsequent game increments the row by 1. So February 24 is at row index 10.\n\nNow, checking the \"score\" column for that row. The score in row 10 (game 64) is listed as \"3 - 1\". \n\nThe claim says the score should be \"5 - 4\" on February 24. But according to the table, it's 3-1 on that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no game with a 5-4 score on February 24; instead, it was 3-1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",
