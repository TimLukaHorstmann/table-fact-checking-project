The claim states: \"phyllis nelson make the us hot 100 2 time.\" So, it seems like Phyllis Nelson had two entries in the US Hot 100 chart.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has columns for year, single, US Hot 100, US dance, US R&B, and album. I need to check if there are any singles by Phyllis Nelson that entered the US Hot 100 twice.\n\nBut wait, looking through the \"single\" column in each row:\n- First row: \"don't stop the train\"\n- Second row: \"move closer\"\n- Third row: \"i don't know\"\n- Fourth row: \"i like you\"\n- Fifth row: \"move closer (re-issue)\"\n\nNone of these singles are attributed to Phyllis Nelson. All entries seem to be songs by other artists or perhaps another performer, but the table doesn't specify the artist's name beyond the single titles.\n\nSince there's no mention of Phyllis Nelson in the table, and all the singles listed don't indicate her as the artist, it seems like there are zero instances where she made the US Hot 100. Therefore, the claim that she did so twice is not supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The columns are year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. Each row represents a different record with these attributes.\n\nThe claim mentions two singles: \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\". I'll check each of these in the table to see their rankings in the \"us dance\" column.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first relevant single is \"i don't know\". It's listed in row 2 (since we start counting from 0, so index 2). In that row, under \"us dance\", it shows a ranking of 1. So this single did hit number 1 in US Dance charts.\n\n2. The second single is \"i like you\". This is found in the next row, index 3. Checking the \"us dance\" column here as well, it also has a 1. So this one also reached number 1.\n\nBoth singles have a '1' under \"us dance\", which means both did hit number 1 in the US Dance charts according to the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should make sure there are no other instances of these singles that might contradict this. Looking through all rows, these are the only entries for \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\". There's a row with \"move closer (re-issue)\" in 1994, but it doesn't affect our claim as it's about different singles.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- For \"i don't know\": row index 2, column us dance.\n- For \"i like you\": row index 3, column us dance.\n\nBoth have value '1', confirming the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a table is true or false. The table is provided in HTML format, and the claim is: \"move closer and move  (re - issue) be the only single not to make it to the chart.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the table correctly. Let me look at the structure of the table. It has columns for year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. There are five rows of data.\n\nThe claim is about two singles: \"move closer\" and \"move (re - issue).\" The statement says they are the only singles that didn't make it to any chart. So I need to check each single in the table and see if their corresponding chart positions are marked with a dash (\"-\"), which likely means they didn't chart.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: Single is \"don' t stop the train.\" The charts for us hot 100, us dance, and us r&b are \"-\", 20, and \"-\". Since it has a position in dance chart (20), it did make it to that chart.\n\n2. Row 1: Single is \"move closer.\" All chart positions are \"-\" except the album column. So this single didn't make any charts.\n\n3. Row 2: Single is \"i don' t know.\" The charts show 61, 1, and 65 in respective columns. So it did chart.\n\n4. Row 3: Single is \"i like you.\" Similar to row 2, it has positions 61, 1, 65. Therefore, it charted as well.\n\n5. Row 4: Single is \"move closer (re - issue).\" All chart positions are \"-\", so this single didn't make any charts either.\n\nNow, the claim says these two singles (\"move closer\" and \"move (re - issue)\") are the only ones not making it to the charts. From the table:\n\n- Rows 1 and 4 have \"-\" in all chart columns.\n- The other rows (0,2,3) have at least one chart position that isn't \"-\".\n\nTherefore, there are two singles that didn't make it to any chart: \"move closer\" (row 1) and \"move closer (re - issue)\" (row 4). \n\nWait a second. In the claim, the singles mentioned are \"move closer\" and \"move (re - issue).\" However, in row 4, the single is actually \"move closer (re - issue),\" not just \"move.\" So maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps the user meant to refer to that specific version.\n\nAssuming that \"move (re - issue)\" is intended to be \"move closer (re - issue),\" then the claim holds. Both these singles didn't chart, and no others did either because all other singles have at least one chart position.\n\nSo I think the answer should be TRUE, but wait\u2014let me double-check if any other single has a \"-\" in all charts except maybe not? Let's see:\n\n- Row 0: \"don' t stop the train\" made it to dance chart (20).\n- Row 1: \"move closer\" didn't chart anywhere.\n- Row 2 and 3: Both charted in us hot 100, dance, and r&b.\n- Row 4: \"move closer (re - issue)\" also didn't chart.\n\nSo indeed, only rows 1 and 4 are the ones without any chart positions. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because those two singles are the only ones that didn't make it to any charts.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are in the 'us hot 100', 'us dance', and 'us r&b' columns for the singles \"move closer\" (row 1) and \"move closer (re - issue)\" (row 4). Since both have dashes indicating they didn't chart, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about F Phyllis Nelson's singles is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"only 1 of F Phyllis Nelson's single, don't stop the train make it to the us dance chart, but not the us hot 100 or us r&b.\" So, breaking this down, it's saying that out of her singles, only one (\"don't stop the train\") reached the US Dance chart, but didn't reach the US Hot 100 or US R&B charts.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to see which singles are listed. The table has several rows:\n\n1. In 1981, there's a single titled \"don't stop the train.\" Let me check its chart positions:\n   - US Hot 100: \"-\"\n   - US Dance: \"20\"\n   - US R&B: \"-\"\n   \nSo, this single made it to the dance chart at position 20 but didn't make it to Hot 100 or R&B.\n\nNext, looking for other singles by F Phyllis Nelson. The table has:\n- In 1985, \"move closer\" and \"i don't know,\" as well as \"i like you.\" Wait, let me check each row:\n\nSecond row (index 1):\n- Year: 1985\n- Single: \"move closer\"\n- US Hot 100: \"-\"\n- US Dance: \"-\"\n- US R&B: \"-\"\nSo this single didn't chart in any of these categories.\n\nThird row (index 2):\n- Single: \"i don't know\"\n- US Hot 100: 61\n- US Dance: 1\n- US R&B: 65\nThis means it did make all three charts, so this is another single that's charted, but the claim says only one (don't stop the train) did. Wait, but according to the table, \"i don't know\" also made it to dance chart at position 1 and Hot 100 at 61.\n\nFourth row (index 3):\n- Single: \"i like you\"\n- US Hot 100: 61\n- US Dance: 1\n- US R&B: 65\nSame as above; this single also charted in all three categories.\n\nFifth row (index 4):\n- Year: 1994\n- Single: \"move closer (re-issue)\"\n- Charts: All \"-\"\nSo, no charting here.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says only one single made it to the dance chart but not Hot 100 or R&B. However, in the table, both \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" from 1985 are listed as singles that charted in all three categories (Hot 100, Dance, and R&B), each at positions 61, 1, and 65 respectively. So this contradicts the claim because it's not only one single; there are two more that made it to dance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's actually three singles: \"don't stop the train\" (dance chart) and \"i don't know,\" \"i like you\" which also reached the dance chart along with others. So more than one single made it to the dance chart.\n\nWait, but looking back, the claim says only 1 single (\"don't stop the train\") made it to dance, but according to the table, there are two other singles that also charted in dance. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not just one; three singles reached the dance chart.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only \"Don't Stop The Train\" reached the US Dance chart without making it to Hot 100 or R&B. However, the table shows two additional singles (\"I Don't Know\" and \"I Like You\") also charted in the US Dance along with others. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"out of the 7 chart placements achieved by Phyllis Nelson, 6 were in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the table structure. The table has columns: year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. Each row represents a different record entry with details about singles released in specific years and their chart positions.\n\nThe claim mentions Phyllis Nelson achieving 7 chart placements, 6 of which were in 1985. I need to check how many entries there are in the table for each year and how they relate to chart placements.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. **Row 0 (1981)**: Single \"don't stop the train\" with a US dance chart position of 20.\n2. **Row 1 (1985)**: Single \"move closer\". However, all chart positions are \"-\", meaning no placement in any charts.\n3. **Row 2 (1985)**: Single \"i don't know\" has US Hot 100 at 61, US Dance at 1, and US R&B at 65.\n4. **Row 3 (1985)**: Single \"i like you\" with the same chart positions as row 2: 61, 1, 65.\n5. **Row 4 (1994)**: Single \"move closer (re-issue)\" with all \"-\" in charts.\n\nNow, let's count the valid chart placements:\n\n- For each single, if any of the chart columns have a number (not \"-\"), that counts as a placement.\n\n**Row 0**: dance = 20 \u2192 one placement.\n**Row 1**: All \"-\", so no placements.\n**Row 2**: Hot 100=61, Dance=1, R&B=65 \u2192 three placements.\n**Row 3**: Same as row 2 \u2192 another three placements.\n**Row 4**: All \"-\" \u2192 no placements.\n\nTotal placements: 1 (from 1981) + 3 (row2, 1985) + 3 (row3, 1985) = 7 placements total.\n\nNow, how many of these are in 1985? Rows 2 and 3 each have three placements, so that's 6 placements in 1985. Row 0 is from 1981 with one placement.\n\nSo the claim says out of 7 chart placements, 6 were in 1985. That matches exactly because there are 6 placements in 1985 (rows 2 and 3) and 1 in 1981 (row0).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"don' t stop the train , record in 1985 never hit the us dance list\". \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that the song \"Don't Stop the Train\" recorded in 1985 did not make it onto the US Dance chart.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are five rows of data. Let's go through each row to find any entries related to \"Don't Stop the Train\" and the year 1985.\n\nStarting with the first row (row index 0): The song is \"don' t stop the train\" from 1981. Since this is in 1981, not 1985, it doesn't apply to our claim. \n\nNext, row 1 (index 1) has a song called \"move closer\" released in 1985. That's not the song we're interested in.\n\nRow 2 (index 2): The song is \"i don' t know\", also from 1985. Again, not our target song.\n\nRow 3 (index 3): Another 1985 entry with \"i like you\". Still not relevant.\n\nFinally, row 4 (index 4) mentions \"move closer (re-issue)\" from 1994.

Since there's no record of this song being released in 1985, it can't have charted on the US Dance list that year either.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because the song wasn't even released in 1985 as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"move closer, along with i like you be rank number 1 for us dance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two singles: \"move closer\" and \"i like you.\" The claim states that both of these songs are ranked number 1 in the US Dance chart.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with information about singles, their rankings in different charts (US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B), and the album they belong to. I need to find the entries for \"move closer\" and \"i like you\" and check their rankings under the \"us dance\" column.\n\nStarting with \"move closer.\" I see a few entries:\n\n- In row 0: \"don't stop the train\" is the single, so not relevant.\n- Row 1: Single is \"move closer,\" but the US Dance rank is \"-\" which means no chart position or not applicable. So this doesn't support being number 1.\n- Row 4: Another entry for \"move closer (re-issue),\" and again the US Dance rank is \"-.\" So still, nothing indicating a rank of 1.\n\nNext, looking at \"i like you,\" found in row 2 and 3. Wait, no, actually checking the table:\n\nWait, rows are as follows:\n- Row 0: year 1981, single \"don't stop the train\"\n- Row 1: 1985, \"move closer\"\n- Row 2: 1985, \"i don't know\" with US Dance rank 1\n- Row 3: 1985, \"i like you\" with US Dance rank 1\n- Row 4: 1994, re-issue of \"move closer\"\n\nSo the single \"i like you\" is in row 3, and under the \"us dance\" column, it's ranked 1. That part checks out.\n\nNow, for \"move closer,\" looking back at rows where the single is \"move closer.\" In row 1: US Dance rank is \"-\", so no data there. Row 4 also has \"-\" for US Dance. So neither of these entries show a rank of 1 in US Dance. The claim says both should be rank 1, but only \"i like you\" is rank 1.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions both \"move closer\" and \"i like you.\" Since \"move closer\" doesn't have a ranking here as per the table, it's not number 1 in US Dance. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because one of the two singles mentioned doesn't achieve rank 1.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because while \"i like you\" is rank 1 in US Dance, \"move closer\" does not have a ranking listed as 1 here; it's either \"-\" or missing.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states both \"move closer\" and \"i like you\" are ranked number 1 in US Dance. Checking the table: \n\n- \"i like you\" is ranked 1 (row 3, US Dance column).\n- \"move closer\" entries show \"-\" for US Dance rank.\n\nThus, only one of the two singles meets the claim, so it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Since there's no artist column, maybe the single names themselves indicate the artists? For example, \"move closer\" appears in multiple rows. But I'm not sure if \"Phyllis Nelson\" is associated with any of these singles. Without explicit information about who sang each single, it's hard to connect them directly to Phyllis Nelson.\n\nLooking at the \"us hot 100\" column, the entries are either numbers or dashes. Dashes likely mean that the song didn't chart on the US Hot 100. The singles with a rank in this column are \"i don't know\" and \"i like you,\" both appearing twice (rows 2 and 3). Each of these has a ranking of 61 in the US Hot 100.\n\nSo, how many times do they chart? For each single that appears multiple times, if it's reissued or remixed, does that count as separate entries? The table shows \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" both have two rows with the same name but perhaps different releases. However, their US Hot 100 rankings are the same in each case. It seems like they might be separate entries for different years or versions.\n\nBut wait, all these singles (rows 2 and 3) are from 1985. So \"i don't know\" is listed once with a rank of 61, and \"i like you\" is also listed once with the same rank. Does that count as two entries each? Or maybe each single appearing twice?\n\nActually, looking at rows 2 and 3: both singles have the same US Hot 100 ranking (61). So if a song charted multiple times in the same year but with different versions, does that count as separate instances? The table seems to list them separately. But since they're both from 1985, maybe each single is being counted twice.\n\nSo for \"i don't know,\" there's one row (row index 2) with a rank of 61, and another row (index 3) also with 61. That might mean two chart entries. Similarly, \"move closer\" appears multiple times but doesn't have a US Hot 100 ranking\u2014it has dashes.\n\nPutting it together: the only singles that made the US Hot 100 are \"i don't know\" and \"i like you,\" each appearing twice in the table with rankings of 61. So that's four entries total where the US Hot 100 is populated with a number (rows 2,3). But wait, rows 2 and 3 both have \"us hot 100\":61. That would be two instances each for those singles.\n\nBut does that mean Phyllis Nelson made it four times? Because each of these singles charted once, but perhaps the table is listing different releases or versions as separate entries. So maybe \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" each charted once, making a total of two instances. Or are they considered multiple times because they're listed twice in the table?\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. The claim says four times. Let's count: rows 2 and 3 both have \"us hot 100\":61 for two different singles\u2014\"i don't know\" and \"i like you.\" Each single charted once, so that's two total entries. Unless each row is a separate entry, making it four (rows 2 and 3 each have two singles). Wait no, each row corresponds to one single.\n\nSo, in rows 2 and 3, we have two singles, each with a US Hot 100 rank of 61. So that's two entries on the chart. Unless the table is showing multiple versions or releases leading to more chart entries. But since both are from 1985, it might just be two unique entries.\n\nBut the claim says four times. There's no indication in the table that any single made it into the US Hot 100 more than once. So unless \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" each charted twice (once per row), making a total of four, but I'm not sure if the table treats each row as a separate chart entry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the artist in question is associated with these singles, and each single appearing once counts as one chart. So two charts in total. But that wouldn't make four times.\n\nWait, looking again: rows 2 and 3 have \"i don't know\" and \"i like you,\" both from 1985, each ranked at 61 on the US Hot 100. That's two entries. Are there any other rows where the US Hot 100 is not a dash? Rows 0: dash; row 1: dash; row 4: dash. So only rows 2 and 3 have numbers in the US Hot 100 column.\n\nTherefore, Phyllis Nelson, if associated with these singles, made it into the US Hot 100 twice, not four times. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two entries for the US Hot 100 chart: \"i don't know\" and \"i like you,\" each ranked at position 61 in 1985. This indicates only two instances where the artist (assuming Phyllis Nelson) made it onto the chart, not four times as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": false,\n  \"explanation\": \"The US Hot 100 rankings are present for 'i don't know' and 'i like you', each appearing once in 1985.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"in 1985, phyllis nelson be able to chart 2 time with her song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that in 1985, Phyllis Nelson was able to chart twice with her songs. Charting usually refers to having a song appear on music charts like the US Hot 100, dance charts, or R&B charts. So, the claim suggests that she had two hits in 1985.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's an HTML table with columns: year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. Each row represents a different song release along with their chart positions and other details.\n\nThe claim is about Phyllis Nelson, but I notice that the table doesn't mention her name anywhere. The singles listed are \"don't stop the train,\" \"move closer,\" \"i don't know,\" \"i like you,\" and \"move closer (re-issue).\" There's no information linking these songs to Phyllis Nelson.\n\nSince the claim refers to an artist who isn't present in the table, there's no data here that can support or refute it. The relevant cells would be those under the 'single' column for the year 1985 to see if any of them are by Phyllis Nelson, but none of the singles listed match her name.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot confirm that Phyllis Nelson charted twice in 1985. In fact, since there's no mention of her, it leans towards the claim being FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't list any songs by Phyllis Nelson for the year 1985. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"single\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table in HTML format is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"Phyllis Nelson be unable to hit the US Hot 100 and US dance chart for both 'I like you', as well as don't stop the train.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems that Phyllis Nelson has two songs mentioned: \"I like you\" and \"Don't stop the train.\" The claim states that she was unable to hit (i.e., chart on) both the US Hot 100 and the US Dance charts with these two songs.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns for year, single, US Hot 100, US dance, US R&B, and album. Each row represents a different song or reissue. \n\nLet me break down the relevant information:\n\n1. **Don't stop the train (1981):**\n   - Single: \"don' t stop the train\"\n   - US Hot 100: \"-\"\n   - US Dance: \"20\"\n   - Album: \"move closer\"\n\n   So, for this song, it charted at position 20 on the US Dance chart but did not chart on the US Hot 100 (indicated by \"-\").\n\n2. **I don't know (1985):**\n   - Single: \"i don' t know\"\n   - US Hot 100: \"61\"\n   - US Dance: \"1\"\n   - Album: \"i don' t know\"\n\n   This song charted at position 61 on the US Hot 100 and number 1 on the US Dance chart.\n\n3. **I like you (1985):**\n   - Single: \"i like you\"\n   - US Hot 100: \"61\"\n   - US Dance: \"1\"\n   - Album: \"i like you\"\n\n   Similarly, this song also charted at position 61 on the US Hot 100 and number 1 on the US Dance chart.\n\n4. **Move closer (re-issue) in 1994:**\n   - Single: \"move closer (re-issue)\"\n   - All charts: \"-\"\n\nSo, focusing back on the claim which mentions both \"I like you\" and \"Don't stop the train.\" \n\nFor \"Don't stop the train,\" as seen in row index 0:\n- US Hot 100 is \"-\", meaning it didn't chart.\n- US Dance charted at position 20.\n\nTherefore, for this song, she did hit the US Dance chart but not the US Hot 100. \n\nFor \"I like you,\" which is in row index 3:\n- US Hot 100: \"61\"\n- US Dance: \"1\"\n\nSo, both charts were achieved with these positions.\n\nThe claim says that she was unable to hit both charts for both songs. However, looking at the data:\n\n- For \"Don't stop the train,\" while it didn't chart on US Hot 100, it did on US Dance.\n- For \"I like you,\" it charted on both.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not entirely accurate because one of the songs (\"I like you\") did hit both charts. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim states she was unable to hit both charts for both songs. So, if either song failed to chart on both, does that mean the overall claim is true? Or does it require that neither song charted on both?\n\nThe wording says \"unable to hit the US Hot 100 and US dance chart for both 'I like you,' as well as don't stop the train.\" So, it seems she couldn't get either of these two songs onto both charts. But since \"I like you\" did chart on both, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread: maybe the claim is that she was unable to hit both charts for each song, meaning neither song made it to both. Since one song (\"I like you\") did make both charts, the claim is false.\n\nWait, no. Let me parse the sentence again: \"be unable to hit the US Hot 100 and US dance chart for both I like you, as well as don't stop the train.\" So it's saying she couldn't get either of these two songs onto both charts. But since one song did make both, the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because at least \"I like you\" did hit both charts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Phyllis Nelson was unable to chart on both US Hot 100 and US Dance charts for both songs mentioned. However, \"I like you\" did chart on both, so the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** The entries for \"Don't stop the train\" (row 0) and \"I like you\" (row 3) in the US Hot 100 and US Dance columns.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
