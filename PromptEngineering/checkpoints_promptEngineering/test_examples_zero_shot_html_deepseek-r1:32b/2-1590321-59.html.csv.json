    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"active from 1947 - 1964 , titus ozon score 157 goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. The player is active from 1947 to 1964.\n2. Titus Ozon has scored 157 goals.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table for a player named Titus Ozon. Scanning the \"name\" column, I see that in row 10 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or one-indexed?), but let me check: The first row is rank 1, so each subsequent row increments the rank. Looking at the last row, it's rank 10 with name Titus Ozon.\n\nNow, checking the years for Titus Ozon. In the \"years\" column of that row, it says 1947 - 1964. That matches the claim exactly. So the activity period is correct.\n\nNext, looking at the goals. The \"goals\" column in that same row shows 157. That also matches the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are the ones for Titus Ozon's years and goals.\n\nWait, but the rows start from index 0 or 1? In the provided JSON example, it uses row_index starting at 0. Let me check: in the HTML, the first data row is rank 1, which would be row index 0 in zero-based indexing. So Titus Ozon is in the last row, which would be row index 9 (since there are 10 rows of data).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 9, column \"years\" for the activity period.\n- Row index 9, column \"goals\" for the number of goals.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correctly represented in the table. Thus, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is about a specific time frame: from 1950 to 1965. So I should look for players who were active during those years. The relevant columns in the table are \"years\" and \"goals.\"\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0 (index 0): Dudu Georgescu, active from 1970-1986. That's after 1965, so not relevant.\n- Row 1: Ionel Danciulescu, 1993-present. Way too recent, doesn't apply.\n- Row 2: Rodion Camataru, 1974-1989. Again, starts in 1974, which is after 1965.\n- Row 3: Marin Radu, same as above, starts in 1974.\n- Row 4: Ion Oblemenco, active from 1964-1976. His years include up to 1965? Wait, his start is 1964, so he was active during part of the claim's time frame (1964 is within 1950-1965). He has 170 goals.\n- Row 5: Florea Dumitrache, 1966-1983. His earliest year is 1966, which is just after 1965, so he doesn't overlap with the claim's time frame.\n- Rows 6 to 9 have players active starting from 1970 onwards or ending before 1965.\n\nWait, row 4: Ion Oblemenco was active until 1976, but his start is 1964. So during 1964, he was active. The claim's time frame includes up to 1965. Therefore, in 1964 and part of 1965, he was playing. His goal count is 170, which is more than 160.\n\nSo the claim states that during 1950-1965, goals were less than 160. However, Ion Oblemenco scored 170 goals during his time, which includes part of the claim's period. Therefore, this contradicts the claim.\n\nLooking for any other players active during 1950-1965: Titus Ozon (row 9) was active until 1964 but started in 1947. Wait, no\u2014Titus Ozon's years are 1947-1964, so he was active up to 1964, which is within the claim's time frame. His goals were 157, which is less than 160.\n\nWait, but Ion Oblemenco also overlaps with part of that period and has more than 160 goals. So the claim says \"the goal score be less than 160\" during those years, but there's at least one player who scored more in that timeframe. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. For Ion Oblemenco (row 4), both his years and goals are relevant because they show he was active within the time frame and exceeded the goal threshold. Titus Ozon's goals were under 160, but since there's at least one counterexample, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
