    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that Magdalena Maleeva's professional tennis career spanned 12 years, beginning in 1993 and ending in 2005. I need to verify this using the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table structure. It appears each row represents a match or an event in her career. The relevant columns for verifying the claim would be \"Year\" (to check when she started and ended) and possibly other details like dates of matches to confirm her active years.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The earliest year mentioned is 1993, which aligns with the start of her career as per the claim.\n- The latest years in the table are 2005. However, I notice that the match on July 9, 2005, and July 10, 2005, might be part of a series or a particular tournament, but it's crucial to determine if this marks her last professional appearance.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\n- Rows with \"Year\" as 1993: There are entries starting from April 1993. This supports the claim that she began in 1993.\n- The years continue through 2005, but I need to ensure there's no activity beyond 2005. Since all matches listed end in July 2005, it suggests her career ended around that time.\n\nCalculating the span: From 1993 to 2005 is indeed 13 years (including both start and end years). However, the claim states a 12-year span. This discrepancy might be due to whether she played actively throughout each year or if there were gaps. But since the table shows matches every year up until 2005, it's reasonable to consider her career as spanning at least 12 years.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, the claim appears to be supported.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells include all entries from 1993 to 2005, confirming her active participation over that period. The span calculation might have minor discrepancies due to the exact start and end points within those years, but overall, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     ...

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"magdalena maleeva play more match in the europe/affrica group than any other edition.\" First off, I notice there's a typo in the claim\u2014\"affrica\" should probably be \"Africa,\" but assuming that's just a mistake and the intended reference is to the Europe/Africa group.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several matches with details like the year, group type (e.g., Europe/Africa Group), opponent names, dates, surface types, and scores. The claim mentions Magdalena Maleeva, but when I scan through all the rows in the table, there's no mention of her name at all. That's a red flag because if she didn't play any matches listed here, it would be impossible for her to have played more than others.\n\nNext, I need to verify each part of the claim against the data. The claim states two things: that Magdalena Maleeva participated in matches and that she did so more times within the Europe/Africa group compared to other editions or groups.\n\nSince there's no entry for Magdalena Maleeva in the table, the first condition isn't met. Without any of her matches recorded, we can't compare her number of appearances to others. This lack of data directly contradicts the claim because it implies she didn't participate at all in these tournaments as per the given information.\n\nAdditionally, even if we consider that there might be a typo or an alternative spelling, looking through all the players listed (like Aiko Nakamura and Akiko Morigami) doesn't reveal any name resembling Maleeva. This reinforces the idea that she isn't part of this dataset.\n\nMoreover, the claim is about her playing more matches within one specific group edition compared to others. Without any data on her participation, we can't determine whether she played more or fewer matches than others in different editions.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the information provided in the table, the claim cannot be supported. There's no evidence of Magdalena Maleeva participating in any matches within the Europe/Africa group or any other edition.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim that \"Magdalena Maleeva played more matches in the Europe/Africa group than any other edition,\" we need to check the table for her participation.\n\n1. **Check for Magdalena Maleeva's Name**: Scanning through all rows, there are no entries with her name. The players listed include Aiko Nakamura and Akiko Morigami but not Magdalena Maleeva.\n\n2. **Evaluate Participation in Europe/Africa Group**: Since she isn't listed in any row, we can't confirm any matches played by her in the Europe/Africa group or compare it to other editions.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Without any data on her participation, the claim cannot be supported. Thus, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether Magdalena Maleeva played more matches on clay surfaces compared to hard and carpet combined. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"Magdalena Maleeva play more match on clay than on hard surface or carpet combine.\" So basically, we're comparing the number of matches she played on clay versus the sum of those on hard and carpet surfaces. If there are more clay matches, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various tournaments with details like year, type (e.g., World Group II playoffs), dates, surface types, opponents, and scores. My task is to extract all the relevant data points about Magdalena's matches on different surfaces.\n\nWait a second\u2014I notice that in the table, the player names are listed under the \"Opponent\" column. So each row represents a match where she played against someone else. That makes sense because it's showing her opponents and the outcomes of those matches.\n\nNow, I need to check how many times she played on clay versus hard or carpet surfaces. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 2016 World Group II Play-offs, opponent Aiko Nakamura, surface Hard (I), date July 9, 2016. Wait, no\u2014the data seems to be about different tournaments and opponents over several years. But in the table provided earlier, I don't see any mention of Magdalena Maleeva herself as a player; instead, it's showing her matches against others.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is listing all her matches as an opponent? So each row represents a match she played where she faced someone else. Therefore, to find out how many matches she had on each surface, I need to look at the \"Surface\" column for each match and count them accordingly.\n\nLet me start counting:\n\n1. Looking through each row's Surface column:\n   - Row 0: Carpet (I)\n   - Row 1: Carpet (I)\n   - Row 2: Hard (I)\n   - Row 3: Clay\n   - Row 4: Clay\n   - Row 5: Clay\n   - Row 6: Clay\n   - Row 7: Hard (I)\n   - Row 8: Clay\n   - Row 9: Clay\n   - Row 10: Clay\n   - Row 11: Hard (I)\n   - Row 12: Hard (I)\n   - Row 13: Carpet (I)\n   - Row 14: Carpet (I)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me recount more carefully.\n\nActually, looking back at the table, it's a bit confusing because each row represents an opponent and the surface type for that particular match. So I need to go through each row and tally how many times she played on clay versus hard or carpet.\n\nLet me list out each match with its surface:\n\nRow 0: Carpet (I)\nRow 1: Carpet (I)\nRow 2: Hard (I)\nRow 3: Clay\nRow 4: Clay\nRow 5: Clay\nRow 6: Clay\nRow 7: Hard (I)\nRow 8: Clay\nRow 9: Clay\nRow 10: Clay\nRow 11: Hard (I)\nRow 12: Hard (I)\nRow 13: Carpet (I)\nRow 14: Carpet (I)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the table has more rows. Let me recount properly.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided earlier, each row in the tbody corresponds to a match with columns: Year, Type, Date, Surface, Opponent, Score. So each of those 15 rows is a separate match she played.\n\nSo let's list them all:\n\nRow 0: Carpet (I)\nRow 1: Carpet (I)\nRow 2: Hard (I)\nRow 3: Clay\nRow 4: Clay\nRow 5: Clay\nRow 6: Clay\nRow 7: Hard (I)\nRow 8: Clay\nRow 9: Clay\nRow 10: Clay\nRow 11: Hard (I)\nRow 12: Hard (I)\nRow 13: Carpet (I)\nRow 14: Carpet (I)\n\nWait, but I think I miscounted. Let me list all the surfaces:\n\n1. Row 0: Carpet (I) \u2192 Carpet\n2. Row 1: Carpet (I) \u2192 Carpet\n3. Row 2: Hard (I) \u2192 Hard\n4. Row 3: Clay \u2192 Clay\n5. Row 4: Clay \u2192 Clay\n6. Row 5: Clay \u2192 Clay\n7. Row 6: Clay \u2192 Clay\n8. Row 7: Hard (I) \u2192 Hard\n9. Row 8: Clay \u2192 Clay\n10. Row 9: Clay \u2192 Clay\n11. Row 10: Clay \u2192 Clay\n12. Row 11: Hard (I) \u2192 Hard\n13. Row 12: Hard (I) \u2192 Hard\n14. Row 13: Carpet (I) \u2192 Carpet\n15. Row 14: Carpet (I) \u2192 Carpet\n\nWait, but in the initial table provided earlier, there are only 15 rows? Let me check:\n\nLooking back at the user's message, under the table, it says \"tbody\" with multiple tr elements. Each tr has td for Year, Type, Date, Surface, Opponent, Score.\n\nYes, each row is a separate match.\n\nSo let's count each surface type:\n\nClay surfaces:\nRows 3,4,5,6,8,9,10 \u2192 that's 7 matches on clay.\n\nHard surfaces:\nRows 2,7,11,12 \u2192 4 matches on hard.\n\nCarpet surfaces:\nRows 0,1,13,14 \u2192 4 matches on carpet.\n\nSo total on non-clay (hard + carpet): 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nClay: 7 matches.\n\nWait, that means clay has 7, and hard+carpet have 8. So 7 vs 8. Therefore, she played more on hard and carpet combined than on clay. That would mean the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount. Let's recount:\n\nClay surfaces:\nRow 3: Clay\nRow 4: Clay\nRow 5: Clay\nRow 6: Clay\nRow 8: Clay\nRow 9: Clay\nRow 10: Clay \u2192 7 matches.\n\nHard surfaces:\nRow 2: Hard (I)\nRow 7: Hard (I)\nRow 11: Hard (I)\nRow 12: Hard (I) \u2192 4 matches.\n\nCarpet surfaces:\nRow 0: Carpet (I)\nRow 1: Carpet (I)\nRow 13: Carpet (I)\nRow 14: Carpet (I) \u2192 4 matches.\n\nSo total non-clay: 4 + 4 = 8. Clay:7. So clay is less than hard+carpet combined. Therefore, the claim that she played more on clay than on hard and carpet together is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Magdalena Maleeva played more matches on hard and carpet surfaces (8) than on clay (7).\n\n**Answer:** The claim is FALSE.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the data**: Each row in the table represents a match where Magdalena Maleeva played against an opponent, with details including surface type.\n\n2. **Categorize each match by surface**:\n   - Clay: Rows 3,4,5,6,8,9,10 \u2192 7 matches.\n   - Hard: Rows 2,7,11,12 \u2192 4 matches.\n   - Carpet: Rows 0,1,13,14 \u2192 4 matches.\n\n3. **Calculate totals**:\n   - Clay total: 7\n   - Hard + Carpet total: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n4. **Compare the totals**: Since 7 (clay) < 8 (hard + carpet), the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Final Answer:** The claim is FALSE. Magdalena Maleeva did not play more matches on clay surfaces than on hard and carpet combined.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"magdalena maleeva never play against the same opponent 2 time\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for all entries where Magdalena Maleeva is involved in a match. The table lists various matches with details like date, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a specific match that Magdalena played.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: 2005 World Group II Play-offs, July 9, 2005 against Aiko Nakamura.\n2. **Row 1**: Same play-offs on July 10, 2005 against Akiko Morigami.\n\nWait a second, I don't see Magdalena Maleeva mentioned here. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check each row again carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rows from 0 to 23 (as there are 24 entries), I notice that none of them mention \"Magdalena Maleeva\" as a participant. Each match lists different opponents like Aiko Nakamura, Akiko Morigami, Natalie Grandin, etc., but not Magdalena.\n\nSince the claim is about Magdalena never playing against the same opponent twice, and there are no entries where she's involved, it implies that either:\n\n- She didn't participate in any of these matches.\n- The table doesn't include her matches at all.\n\nTherefore, since there are no instances where she played against anyone, let alone the same opponent twice, the claim is technically true based on the given data. However, if Magdalena did play other matches outside this table, we wouldn't know from here. But within the scope of this table, there's no evidence to contradict the claim.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because the table doesn't show any instances where she played against someone twice.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Surface is clay. Hmm, but who played here? The opponent is Magdalena Maleeva. Wait, so does that mean she's the one playing on clay?\n- Row 3: Surface is clay again.

Some rows have surface as 'hard (i)' or 'clay' but I don't see more entries with Magdalena.\n\nWait, in row 2 and row 3, the opponents are listed as Magdalena Maleeva.

So, I need to check if all her appearances are indeed in the World Group I category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match or participation. The relevant columns here would be \"Edition\" and \"Player.\" The player's name isn't directly listed in the table as Magdalena Maleeva; instead, the players she played against are mentioned in the \"Opponent\" column.

Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim suggests that Magdalena Maleeva played twice as many matches on a hard court surface compared to clay courts. To verify this, I need to look into the table and count how many times she played on each surface.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the table rows to find any entries where Magdalena Maleeva is involved. However, looking at the data provided in the table, there are no mentions of \"Magdalena Maleeva.\" All the player names listed under the 'Player' column (third column) don't include her name.\n\nSince there's no data about her matches in the table, I can't gather any information about how often she played on hard surfaces versus clay. Without this data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be supported.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because there are no relevant entries for Magdalena Maleeva in the table to verify her playing frequency on different surfaces.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"petra schmitt be magdalena maleeva's opponent 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that Petra Schmitt was Magdalena Maleeva's opponent four times in matches. So, I need to check how many times these two faced each other according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns like \"Year,\" \"Tournament,\" \"Round,\" \"Surface,\" and \"Opponent.\" The relevant information about opponents is in the \"Opponent\" column, which lists who the player played against in each match. However, I notice that the current table provided doesn't include any entries for Petra Schmitt or Magdalena Maleeva. Each row under the \"Opponent\" column has names like Aiko Nakamura, Akiko Morigami, etc., but none of them are either Petra Schmitt or Magdalena Maleeva.\n\nSince there's no data in the table about these two players facing each other, I can't find any matches where they were opponents. Without any entries indicating that Petra Schmitt was an opponent four times against Magdalena Maleeva, it's impossible to support the claim with the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided table, there is no evidence of four encounters between them as stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
