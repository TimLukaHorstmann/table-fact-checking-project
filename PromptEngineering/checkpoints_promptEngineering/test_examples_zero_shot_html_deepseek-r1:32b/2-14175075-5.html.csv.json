    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cedar rapid be the site with the earliest date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The claim is saying that Cedar Rapids was the site of the event on the earliest (oldest) date in the table. So I need to check two things: what's the earliest date in the table, and which site corresponds to that date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'date' column and a 'site' column. I'll start by examining all the dates in the 'date' column to identify the earliest one.\n\nThe dates listed are:\n- september 4, 2007\n- september 8, 2007\n- september 9, 2007\n- september 15, 2007\n- november 10, 2007 (appears twice)\n- december 5, 2007\n- december 7, 2007\n- december 8, 2007\n- december 9, 2007\n- february 22, 2008\n- march 7, 2008\n- april 1, 2008\n\nLooking at these dates in order from earliest to latest: September comes first, followed by November, December, then February next year, March, and April. So the earliest date is September 4, 2007.\n\nNow, I need to check which site corresponds to this date. Looking at row index 0 (the first row), the 'site' column says \"cedar rapids\". Wait a minute, but in the table, it's written as \"cedar rapids\" with two words, not \"cedar rapid\" as in the claim. That might be a typo or variation in spelling.\n\nAssuming that \"cedar rapid\" is meant to refer to the same place as \"cedar rapids\", then yes, the earliest date's site is Cedar Rapids. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because the earliest date is September 4, 2007, and the corresponding site is cedar rapids.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there are any other entries with an earlier date than September 4. Scanning through all the dates again: No, September 4 is indeed the earliest. All other dates are later in 2007 or 2008.\n\nSo the relevant cell for this claim is row 0, column 'date' to confirm the earliest date and row 0, column 'site' to confirm the site name. \n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, supported by these two cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cedar Rapids was the site of the earliest event in the table. The earliest date is September 4, 2007, located at Cedar Rapids.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"softball be the sport with the latest date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that softball is the sport with the latest date in the table. So I need to check two things: which sports have entries and their corresponding dates. Then, identify the latest date and see if the sport associated with that date is softball.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: date, site, sport, winning team, series. There are multiple rows, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nLet me list out all the sports along with their dates:\n\n1. September 4, 2007 - m golf\n2. September 8, 2007 - volleyball\n3. September 9, 2007 - w soccer\n4. September 15, 2007 - football\n5. November 10, 2007 - m cross country\n6. November 10, 2007 - w cross country\n7. December 5, 2007 - w basketball\n8. December 7, 2007 - w swimming\n9. December 8, 2007 - m basketball\n10. December 9, 2007 - wrestling\n11. February 22, 2008 - w gymnastics\n12. March 7, 2008 - w gymnastics\n13. April 1, 2008 - softball\n\nNow, I need to find the latest date in this table. The dates go from September 4, 2007, up to April 1, 2008. Among these, April 1, 2008, is the latest date because it's after March and February.\n\nLooking at row index 12 (assuming starting count from 0), which corresponds to April 1, 2008, the sport listed there is softball. The winning team was Iowa, but that doesn't matter for this claim since we're only concerned with the date and the sport.\n\nSo, checking if softball has the latest date: Yes, it does. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nTo verify, I'll check all other sports to ensure no later dates exist beyond April 1, 2008. The next possible after that would have been in 2009 or later, but there are none here. So softball is indeed associated with the latest date in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because softball is listed on April 1, 2008, which is the latest date in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"sport\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"volleyball be the sport with the 2nd earliest date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about volleyball being the second earliest in terms of dates listed in the table. That means I need to look at all the sports and their corresponding dates to see where volleyball falls.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple entries with different sports and dates. The first step is to list out all the sports along with their dates to determine the order.\n\nThe table has the following rows:\n\n1. September 4, 2007 - m golf\n2. September 8, 2007 - volleyball\n3. September 9, 2007 - w soccer\n4. September 15, 2007 - football\n5. November 10, 2007 - m cross country\n6. November 10, 2007 - w cross country\n7. December 5, 2007 - w basketball\n8. December 7, 2007 - w swimming\n9. December 8, 2007 - m basketball\n10. December 9, 2007 - wrestling\n11. February 22, 2008 - w gymnastics\n12. March 7, 2008 - w gymnastics\n13. April 1, 2008 - softball\n\nNow, I need to determine the earliest and second earliest dates.\n\nThe earliest date is September 4, 2007, which is for m golf.\n\nNext, looking for the next earliest date after that. The next entry is September 8, 2007, which is volleyball. Then comes September 9, 2007, so volleyball is indeed the second earliest sport in terms of dates.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure there are no other entries before September 8. Let me check all rows again:\n\n- The first row is September 4 (earliest)\n- Second is September 8\n- Third is September 9\n\nYes, so volleyball on September 8 is the second earliest date.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"volleyball be the sport with the 2nd earliest date\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for this conclusion. The key information needed was the dates and corresponding sports. So I need to look at each row's 'date' and 'sport' columns.\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Row 0: date is September 4, sport m golf\n- Row 1: date September 8, sport volleyball\n- Row 2: September 9, w soccer\n\nThese are the first three rows which contain the earliest dates. Since I needed to determine the second earliest, looking at these rows was sufficient.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 0, columns 'date' and 'sport'\n\nRow 1, columns 'date' and 'sport'\n\nRow 2, columns 'date' and 'sport'\n\nWait, but the claim is about volleyball being the 2nd earliest. So perhaps I only need to look at the first three rows because after that, dates are later or same as September 8.\n\nSo yes, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For row 0: date (earliest)\n- For row 1: date and sport (volleyball)\n- For row 2: date (next day)\n\nBut maybe to confirm, I can include all rows that have dates in September. Let me check if there are any other entries before November.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows 0-3 are in September. Rows 4-5 are November, which is after September, so they don't affect the earliest and second earliest.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the first three rows' 'date' and 'sport' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because volleyball on September 8, 2007, is the second earliest date in the table. The relevant cells include the first three rows to confirm the order of dates.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"wrestling be the sport with the latest date in 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that wrestling is the sport that occurred on the latest date in 2007 according to the table. So, my task is to check all the entries in the table for the year 2007 and see which one has the most recent date.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple rows with different dates. Each row represents an event with a specific sport. The relevant columns here are \"date\" and \"sport\". My first thought is to list out all the entries from 2007 along with their sports and dates.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. September 4, 2007 - Golf\n2. September 8, 2007 - Volleyball\n3. September 9, 2007 - Women's Soccer\n4. September 15, 2007 - Football\n5. November 10, 2007 - Men's Cross Country\n6. November 10, 2007 - Women's Cross Country\n7. December 5, 2007 - Women's Basketball\n8. December 7, 2007 - Women's Swimming\n9. December 8, 2007 - Men's Basketball\n10. December 9, 2007 - Wrestling\n\nWait, hold on. The claim mentions \"in 2007\", but looking at the dates, some are in February and March 2008, like row 11 (February 22, 2008) and row 12 (March 7, 2008). Similarly, April 1, 2008 is also present. So I need to make sure I only consider events in 2007.\n\nSo focusing on rows up to December 9, 2007:\n\nThe last date in 2007 from the table is December 9, 2007, which is row index 9 (since counting starts at 0). The sport for that row is wrestling. \n\nNow, checking if any other event happened later than December 9, 2007 but still within 2007? Let me double-check the dates:\n\n- September 4,8,9,15 are all in '07\n- November 10 is in '07\n- December 5,7,8,9 are all in '07\n\nThe next event after December 9 is February 22, 2008, which is outside of 2007. So within 2007, the latest date is December 9.\n\nSo the sport on that date was wrestling. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because wrestling did occur on the latest date in 2007 according to the table.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any other event with a later date in 2007. Looking back:\n\nThe last entry in 2007 is row index 9 (December 9, Wrestling). The next one is December 10 or later? No, the next entries are all in early 2008.\n\nSo yes, wrestling on December 9, 2007 is indeed the latest date in that year from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that wrestling is the sport with the latest date in 2007. From the table, the last entry for 2007 is December 9, 2007, which corresponds to wrestling. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"sport\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It's stating that \"ames\" is the location (site) with the earliest date in the table. So my task is to check each row of the table and see which site corresponds to the earliest date.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: date, site, sport, winning team, series. The relevant columns for this claim are \"date\" and \"site\".\n\nI'll start by identifying all the dates in the table and their corresponding sites. Let's list them out:\n\n1. September 4, 2007 - Cedar Rapids\n2. September 8, 2007 - Des Moines\n3. September 9, 2007 - Iowa City\n4. September 15, 2007 - Ames\n5. November 10, 2007 - Peoria (two entries)\n6.

April 1, 2008 - Ames\n\nNow, I need to find the earliest date in this list. The earliest date is September 4, 2007, which corresponds to the site \"Cedar Rapids\". The next earliest dates are all after that.\n\nThe claim says that \"ames\" is the site with the earliest date. However, from the table, the earliest date is associated with Cedar Rapids, not Ames. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the earliest date doesn't belong to Ames but to another site.\n\nTo verify this, I'll check each relevant cell in the table:\n\n- For row 0 (the first data row), the date is September 4, 2007, and the site is Cedar Rapids.\n- Other rows with earlier dates also have sites that are not Ames. The earliest occurrence of \"ames\" as a site appears in row 3 on September 15, 2007, which is later than September 4.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the earliest date does not correspond to Ames.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"w gymnastics be the sport with the earliest date in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the instructions carefully. I need to check each condition in the claim against the table and identify the relevant cells that support or refute it. Then, if the claim is fully supported by the data, the answer should be \"TRUE\"; otherwise, it's \"FALSE\". The final output needs to be a JSON object with an \"answer\" key and a list of \"relevant_ cells\".\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it has multiple rows with different dates ranging from September 2007 to April 2008. My focus is on the year 2008 since the claim specifically mentions \"the earliest date in 2008\". So, I'll go through each row and pick out those with a date in 2008.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. September 4, 2007 \u2013 that's before 2008.\n2. September 8, 2007 \u2013 same year.\n3. September 9, 2007 \u2013 still 2007.\n4. September 15, 2007 \u2013 also 2007.\n5. November 10, 2007 \u2013 same year.\n6. November 10, 2007 \u2013 same row as above but different sport.\n7. December 5, 2007 \u2013 still 2007.\n8. December 7, 2007 \u2013 again, 2007.\n9. December 8, 2007 \u2013 2007.\n10. December 9, 2007 \u2013 same year.\n11. February 22, 2008 \u2013 this is the first date in 2008 I encounter.\n12. March 7, 2008 \u2013 next date in 2008.\n13. April 1, 2008 \u2013 last entry.\n\nSo, rows 10, 11, 12, and 13 are the ones with dates in 2008. Now, I need to find which sport has the earliest date among these. \n\nLooking at row 10 (index 9), the date is December 5, 2007 \u2013 wait, no, that's still 2007. Wait, let me recount because sometimes it's easy to miscount rows when starting from zero.\n\nWait a second, in programming, indexes usually start at zero. So the first row is index 0, next index 1, and so on. Let me correct that:\n\nRow indices for dates in 2008:\n- February 22, 2008: This is row index 10 (since rows before are from 0 to 9).\n- March 7, 2008: Row index 11.\n- April 1, 2008: Row index 12.\n\nWait, no. Let's recount correctly:\n\nLooking back, the table has 13 rows (indices 0 through 12). So row 0 is September 4, 2007; row 11 is February 22, 2008; row 12 is March 7, 2008; and row 13 would be beyond the table's length. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the last row is April 1, 2008, which should be index 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting earlier. Let me list all rows with their indices:\n\nRow 0: Sep 4, 2007\nRow 1: Sep 8, 2007\nRow 2: Sep 9, 2007\nRow 3: Sep 15, 2007\nRow 4: Nov 10, 2007\nRow 5: Nov 10, 2007 (duplicate date but different sport)\nRow 6: Dec 5, 2007\nRow 7: Dec 7, 2007\nRow 8: Dec 8, 2007\nRow 9: Dec 9, 2007\nRow 10: Feb 22, 2008 (w gymnastics)\nRow 11: Mar 7, 2008 (w gymnastics again)\nRow 12: Apr 1, 2008 (softball)\n\nSo the earliest date in 2008 is February 22, 2008, which is row index 10. The sport for that row is \"w gymnastics\".\n\nNow, checking if any other sports have an earlier date in 2008. Since February 22 is the first occurrence of a 2008 date in the table and it's w gymnastics, there can't be an earlier date.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"softball be the sport with the second latest date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that softball is the sport with the second latest date in the table. So I need to identify all the dates and sports, then sort them by date to find out which ones are the latest and second latest.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 13 rows of data. Each row has a 'date' and a 'sport'. My plan is:\n\n1. Extract each date along with its corresponding sport.\n2. Convert the dates into a comparable format (like day numbers) to sort them.\n3. Identify the latest and second latest dates.\n4. Check which sports correspond to those dates.\n\nLet's list out all the dates and their corresponding sports:\n\n- September 4, 2007: m golf\n- September 8, 2007: volleyball\n- September 9, 2007: w soccer\n- September 15, 2007: football\n- November 10, 2007: m cross country\n- November 10, 2007: w cross country\n- December 5, 2007: w basketball\n- December 7, 2007: w swimming\n- December 8, 2007: m basketball\n- December 9, 2007: wrestling\n- February 22, 2008: w gymnastics\n- March 7, 2008: w gymnastics\n- April 1, 2008: softball\n\nNow, let's order these dates from earliest to latest. Considering the months and days:\n\nJanuary (not present), February 22, March 7, April 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the years, all are in 2007 except February, March, April which are in 2008. So 2008 comes after 2007. Therefore, within 2007:\n\n- September 4\n- September 8\n- September 9\n- September 15\n- November 10 (twice)\n- December 5\n- December 7\n- December 8\n- December 9\n\nThen in 2008:\n\n- February 22\n- March 7\n- April 1\n\nSo the latest date is April 1, 2008. The second latest would be March 7, 2008.\n\nLooking at the dates, the entries for March 7 are w gymnastics in iowa city, and April 1 is softball in ames.\n\nThus, the second latest date is March 7, which corresponds to w gymnastics, not softball. Softball is on April 1, the latest date.\n\nTherefore, the claim that softball is the sport with the second latest date is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"softball be the sport with the second latest date.\" Upon examining the table, the latest date is April 1, 2008, which is for softball. The second latest date is March 7, 2008, corresponding to w gymnastics. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Extract Dates and Sports:**\n   - Gather all dates with their respective sports from the table.\n\n2. **Identify Latest and Second Latest Dates:**\n   - April 1, 2008 (softball) is the latest.\n   - March 7, 2008 (w gymnastics) is the second latest.\n\n3. **Compare Claim with Extracted Information:**\n   - The claim attributes softball to the second latest date, which it does not; instead, it's the latest.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The row for April 1, 2008 (softball).\n- The row for March 7, 2008 (w gymnastics).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"sport\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"w gymnastics be the sport with the earliest date in 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that women's gymnastics (abbreviated as 'w gymnastics' in the table) is the sport with the earliest date listed for 2007. So, my task is to check which sport has the earliest date in the year 2007 and see if it's w gymnastics.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying all the sports and their corresponding dates. The table has multiple rows with different sports and dates from September 2007 onwards. I need to list out each sport along with its date.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **September 4, 2007**: Sport is 'm golf' (men's golf).\n2. **September 8, 2007**: Sport is 'volleyball'.\n3. **September 9, 2007**: Sport is 'w soccer' (women's soccer).\n4. **September 15, 2007**: Sport is 'football'.\n5. **November 10, 2007**: There are two entries here: one for 'm cross country' and another for 'w cross country'. Both have the same date.\n6. **December 5, 2007**: Sport is 'w basketball'.\n7. **December 7, 2007**: Sport is 'w swimming'.\n8. **December 8, 2007**: Sport is 'm basketball'.\n9. **December 9, 2007**: Sport is 'wrestling'.\n10. **February 22, 2008**: This is in 2008, so I can ignore this since we're only looking at 2007.\n11. **March 7, 2008**: Also 2008, so not relevant.\n12. **April 1, 2008**: Again, 2008.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 2007. So I should focus only on dates within 2007 and ignore any entries from 2008. That means rows with dates in September, November, December 2007 are relevant.\n\nNow, let's list all sports in 2007 along with their earliest date:\n\n- **m golf**: September 4\n- **volleyball**: September 8\n- **w soccer**: September 9\n- **football**: September 15\n- **m cross country**: November 10\n- **w cross country**: November 10\n- **w basketball**: December 5\n- **w swimming**: December 7\n- **m basketball**: December 8\n- **wrestling**: December 9\n\nLooking through these, the earliest date in 2007 is September 4 for 'm golf'. \n\nThe claim states that 'w gymnastics' has the earliest date. However, looking back at the table, I don't see any entry for 'w gymnastics' until February 22, 2008, which is outside of 2007. Therefore, there's no record of a w gymnastics event in 2007, let alone being the earliest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something? Let me double-check all rows to ensure 'w gymnastics' isn't listed earlier within 2007.\n\nReviewing each row again:\n\n- September entries: m golf, volleyball, w soccer. No w gymnastics.\n- November and December entries: m cross country, w cross country, w basketball, etc., but no w gymnastics until February 2008.\n\nSo, it's clear that 'w gymnastics' isn't present in the table for any date in 2007. The earliest sport is 'm golf' on September 4, 2007. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because 'w gymnastics' wasn't the earliest; in fact, there are no entries for it in 2007.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because w gymnastics does not have any entries in 2007 and the earliest sport is m golf on September 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"wrestling be the sport with the latest date in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and check the 'date' and 'sport' columns. My goal is to find all the entries where the date is in 2008 because the claim specifically mentions \"latest date in 2008.\" \n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n1. September 4, 2007 \u2013 that's 2007, so not relevant.\n2. September 8, 2007 \u2013 same year, 2007.\n3. September 9, 2007 \u2013 still 2007.\n4. September 15, 2007 \u2013 again, 2007.\n5. November 10, 2007 \u2013 2007.\n6. November 10, 2007 \u2013 same as above.\n7. December 5, 2007 \u2013 still 2007.\n8. December 7, 2007 \u2013 again, 2007.\n9. December 8, 2007 \u2013 nope, 2007.\n10. December 9, 2007 \u2013 same year.\n11. February 22, 2008 \u2013 this is in 2008. The sport here is w gymnastics.\n12. March 7, 2008 \u2013 another entry from 2008. Sport is w gymnastics.\n13. April 1, 2008 \u2013 last one in 2008. Sport is softball.\n\nNow, among these 2008 entries, the latest date is April 1, 2008. The sport on that date was softball. \n\nThe claim says \"wrestling\" is the sport with the latest date in 2008. But according to the table, wrestling occurred on December 9, 2007, which is actually in 2007, not 2008. So in 2008, the last event was softball, not wrestling.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the latest date in 2008 corresponds to softball, not wrestling.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the 'date' column falls within 2008.\n   - February 22, 2008 (row index 10)\n   - March 7, 2008 (row index 11)\n   - April 1, 2008 (row index 12)\n\n2. **Determine the Latest Date in 2008:**\n   - Among these dates, April 1, 2008 is the latest.\n\n3. **Check the Sport for That Date:**\n   - On April 1, 2008, the sport was 'softball' (row index 12).\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states 'wrestling' as the sport on the latest date in 2008.\n   - However, wrestling occurred on December 9, 2007 (row index 9), which is outside of 2008.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is FALSE because the latest event in 2008 was softball, not wrestling.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"sport\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
