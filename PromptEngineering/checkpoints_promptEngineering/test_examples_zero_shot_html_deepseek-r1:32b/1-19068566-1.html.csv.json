    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"don whitehead holly henderson be the writer for production code 3t7458\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The claim mentions two writers: Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson, and a specific production code, 3t7458. So I'm looking for a row where both these writers are listed under the \"Writer\" column and the production code matches.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns like \"Production Code\", \"Director\", and \"Writer\". The claim is about the writer(s) for a particular production code. \n\nI'll scan through the rows to find where the Production Code is 3t7458. Scanning down, I notice that in row index 10 (assuming rows are zero-indexed), the production code is 3t7458. Let me check the \"Writer\" column for that row.\n\nIn row 10, under the Writer column, it says \"Don Whitehead, Holly Henderson\". That matches exactly with the claim. So both writers are correctly attributed to that production code.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. I'll note the relevant cells: the Writer and Production Code columns for row index 10.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson are listed as writers for production code 3t7458 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Writer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to verify the claim: \"Glen Winter be the director for production code 3t7461.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim is referring to in the table provided. The table has several columns: Production Code, Title, Director, Writer(s), Original Air Date, and Rating.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Glen Winter\" as the director for a specific production code, which is 3t7461. So my task is to check if this production code exists in the table and whether Glen Winter is indeed listed as the director for that row.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll go row by row to find any instance where the Production Code matches 3t7461. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few rows don't have 3t7461.\n- As I scroll down, I notice row 170 (assuming the count starts at 0), which has a Production Code of 3t7468 and is directed by James Marshall. That's not it.\n- Then I see row 169 with Production Code 3t7467, directed by Mairzee Almas. Not matching either.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it earlier. Let me go back a bit. \n\nRow 168 has Production Code 3t7466. Still not the one.\nRow 167: 3t7465. No match there.\nRow 166: 3t7464. Not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 'Glen Winter' in the Director column instead of searching for the production code first. \n\nLooking through the Director column:\n- Row 0 has Glen Winter as director with Production Code 3t7459. That's close but not 3t7461.\n- Next, row 1: same as above, maybe a typo? No, it's 3t7459 again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me check each production code carefully:\n\nLooking back, Production Code increments by 1 or sometimes higher numbers. \n\nI find that in row 16 (assuming starting from 0), the Production Code is 3t7461. Checking the Director column for that row: it's Glen Winter. \n\nSo yes, the claim is supported because in that specific row, Glen Winter is listed as the director for production code 3t7461.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Director\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning the \"Production Code\" column, I see that in row 169 (which is row index 168 if counting from 0), the Production Code is 3t7463. \n\nNext, I'll check who wrote the song for that production code. The relevant columns are \"Composer(s)\" and \"Writer(s)\". For row 169, looking at \"Writer(s)\", it's listed as bryan miller. There's no mention of don whitehead or holly henderson in this row. \n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because neither Don Whitehead nor Holly Henderson wrote the song with production code 3t7463; Bryan Miller did.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 168, \"column_name\": \"Writer(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 168, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided a table with various details about songs or episodes, each identified by a production code and other attributes like the song name, director, writer, air date, and U.S viewers. \n\nThe claim is: \"the song with production code 3t7471 have 4.11 viewer in the us\". So I need to check if this is true or false based on the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the Production Code is 3t7471. Scanning through the rows, I find that production code 3t7471 is in row 172 (since counting starts at 0, but looking at the HTML, it's actually row index 172). \n\nIn this row, the U.S viewers are listed as 3.39 million. The claim says it has 4.11 viewers, which doesn't match.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mairzee almas be the director for production code 3t7461\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Mairzee Almas is the director for a specific production code, which is 3t7461. To verify this, I need to look into the table and see if there's an entry where both the Director column has \"mairzee almas\" and the Production Code column has \"3t7461\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, it seems that each row represents a different episode or production with several details. The relevant columns here are likely the Director and the Production Code.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the Production Code column to find where 3t7461 appears. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 0: Production code is 3t7452\n- Row 1: 3t7453\n- ...\n- Row 15: 3t7466\n- Row 16: 3t7467\n- Row 17: 3t7468\n- Row 18: 3t7469\n- Row 19: 3t7470\n- Row 20: 3t7471\n\nWait, I don't see 3t7461 in the list. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss it.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow numbers go from 158 up. Wait, no\u2014actually, each row is numbered starting from 0 in the table body. So let's recount:\n\n- Row 0: production code 3t7452\n- Row 1: 3t7453\n- ...\n- Row 16 (row index 16): production code 3t7467\n- Row 17: 3t7468\n- Row 18: 3t7469\n- Row 19: 3t7470\n- Row 20: 3t7471\n\nHmm, I don't see 3t7461 in any of the rows. That's odd because if it's not present, then the claim can't be true.\n\nWait a second, maybe I miscounted or missed a row. Let me go through each row systematically:\n\nRow 0: 3t7452\nRow 1: 3t7453\nRow 2: 3t7454\nRow 3: 3t7455\nRow 4: 3t7456\nRow 5: 3t7457\nRow 6: 3t7458\nRow 7: 3t7459\nRow 8: 3t7460\nRow 9: 3t7461 \u2190 Wait, here it is! Row index 9 has production code 3t7461.\n\nNow that I've found the correct row (row index 9), let's check who the director is for this production code. In column \"Director\", what does row 9 say? Looking at the data:\n\nRow 9: Director is \"glen winter\"\n\nSo, according to the table, the director for production code 3t7461 is Glen Winter, not Mairzee Almas.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Mairzee Almas directed production code 3t7461 is false because the actual director listed in the table is Glen Winter.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mairzee Almas is the director for production code 3t7461. Checking the table, production code 3t7461 is found in row index 9, where the director is Glen Winter, not Mairzee Almas. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
