Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully both play the end position.\n2. Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position.\n\nI'll start by looking at the table to verify these statements.\n\nLooking at the \"position\" column, I see that the first row has \"ends\" as the position. In the \"name\" column of that same row, it lists \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully.\" So both of them are under the \"ends\" position. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, looking at the second row, the position is \"tackles,\" and the names listed are \"ed weir ralph chase.\" This aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Benny Friedman of Michigan plays the quarterback position while Edward L McMILLAN of Princeton plays center.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and find the relevant rows for each person mentioned in the claim. The table has several rows with different positions like ends, tackles, guards, etc., each listing names, schools, whether they were unanimous, and if they're in the college hall of fame.\n\nLet's start with Benny Friedman. I'm searching for his name in the \"name\" column. Scanning through the rows, I see that under the position \"quarterback,\" the name listed is Benny Friedman, and his school is Michigan. So, according to the table, Benny Friedman does play the quarterback position for Michigan. That part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, I need to verify Edward L McMILLAN. Looking through the names again, I find Edward L McMILLAN under the \"center\" position. His school is listed as Princeton. The claim states that he plays center for Princeton, which matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nNow, checking both parts of the claim: Benny Friedman being a quarterback at Michigan and Edward L McMILLAN being the center at Princeton. Both details align perfectly with the information provided in the table.\n\nI should also ensure there are no discrepancies or other entries that might contradict this information. Scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see any other mentions of these individuals, so there's no conflicting data.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim are fully supported by the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified against the table as both Benny Friedman and Edward L McMILLAN are correctly listed with their respective positions and schools. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, college hall of fame. Each row represents a different position with corresponding names of players associated with that position.\n\nThe claim states: \"carl diehl ed hess both play the guard position and ed weir ralph chase play the tackle position.\" So, I need to verify two parts here:\n\n1. Do Carl Diehl and Ed Hess both play the guard position?\n2. Do Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position?\n\nLet me go through each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: Checking if Carl Diehl and Ed Hess are guards. Looking at the table, I'll scan for the 'guards' position. Scanning down the rows:\n\n- The third row has position \"guards\" with names \"carl diehl ed hess\". So yes, both of them are listed under guards. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: Checking if Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play tackles. Looking for the 'tackles' position in the table:\n\n- The second row has position \"tackles\" with names \"ed weir ralph chase\". So they are indeed listed as tacklers.\n\nWait a moment, I should double-check to make sure there are no other rows or players that might affect this. For example, ensuring that Ed Weir isn't in another position elsewhere. But looking through the table, each row is for a specific position, and each name appears only once under their respective positions. So it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Carl Diehl and Ed Hess: They're in the 'guards' row (row index 2) under the 'name' column.\n- For Ed Weir and Ralph Chase: They're in the 'tackles' row (row index 1) under the 'name' column.\n\nSo, all relevant cells have been checked and support the claim.

Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"ed weir ralph chase be from nebraska and pittsburgh respectively, and benny friedman be from michigan.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse this into two parts:\n1. Ed Weir is from Nebraska.\n2. Ralph Chase is from Pittsburgh.\n3. Benny Friedman is from Michigan.\n\nWait, actually, the claim combines these points, so it's about both Ed Weir being from Nebraska and Ralph Chase from Pittsburgh, as well as Benny Friedman being from Michigan.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different position with multiple names under the \"name\" column. The relevant columns for this claim are \"position,\" \"name,\" and \"school.\"\n\nLet's check each part:\n\n1. **Ed Weir**: Looking through the rows, I see that in the second row (row index 1), the position is \"tackles.\" The names listed there are \"ed weir ralph chase.\" So both Ed Weir and Ralph Chase are under this position.\n\n   Under the \"school\" column for this row, it says \"nebraska pittsburgh.\" That means each name corresponds to their respective schools. So Ed Weir is from Nebraska, and Ralph Chase is from Pittsburgh. This matches the claim's first two points.\n\n2. **Benny Friedman**: Now, checking Benny Friedman. I look through the rows and find him in the fifth row (row index 5), under the position \"quarterback.\" The school listed there is \"michigan,\" which aligns with the claim that he's from Michigan.\n\nSo each part of the claim is supported by the table.

Let me scan the 'name' column. In row 6 (assuming the first data row is index 0), I see \"ernie big dog nevers\". The school for this row is Stanford, and the position is fullback. So that matches.\n\nNow for the second part: andy swede oberlander red grange playing halfback. Scanning the 'name' column again, I find these names in row 5.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a position in football, with details about the players, their schools, whether they were unanimous picks, and their college hall of fame status. The columns are: position, name, school, unanimous, college hall of fame.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Friedman and McMillan. I need to check what positions each of them played according to the table.\n\nFirst, let's find Benny Friedman. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see that in row 4 (assuming rows are zero-indexed), the name is \"benny friedman\". The position listed there is \"quarterback\". So according to the table, Friedman plays quarterback.\n\nNext, let's check Edward L McMillan. Looking at the names, in row 3, the name is \"edward l mcmillan\", and his position is \"center\". So McMillan plays center, not quarterback.\n\nThe claim says that Friedman played fullback and McMillan played quarterback. But from the table, Friedman is a quarterback and McMillan is a center. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify if there's any other row where either Friedman or McMillan might be listed under different positions. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: end position; names are Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully.\n- Row 1: tackles; Ed Weir and Ralph Chase.\n- Row 2: guards; Carl Diehl and Ed Hess.\n- Row 3: center; Edward L McMillan.\n- Row 4: quarterback; Benny Friedman.\n- Row 5: halfbacks; Andy Swede Oberlander and Red Grange.\n- Row 6: fullback; Ernie Big Dog Nevers.\n\nSo, Friedman is only in row 4 as a quarterback, and McMillan is only in row 3 as a center.
