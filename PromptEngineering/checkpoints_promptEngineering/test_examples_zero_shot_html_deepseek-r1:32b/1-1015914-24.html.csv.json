    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"when the case or suffix be loc, ngalbeniya mean we two.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two parts: when the case/suffix is 'loc', does 'ngalbeniya' correspond to 'we two'? So I need to check in the table where the row corresponds to 'loc' and see what term is under the 'we two' column.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: case / suffix, we two, you and i, you two, them two (the two), who - two. The rows represent different cases or suffixes like nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc.\n\nI'll start by finding the row where 'loc' is specified. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"nom - acc - inst\" as the case.\n2. The second row is for 'gen'.\n3. Third row is 'dat', fourth is 'abl', and the fifth row is 'loc'.\n\nSo, the relevant row index here is 4 (since indexing starts at 0; rows are 0 to 4). In this row, under the 'we two' column, the value is 'ngalbeniya'. \n\nNow, checking if that's correct: yes, in the loc row, the we two column has 'ngalbeniya'. Therefore, when the case is 'loc', 'ngalbeniya' does mean 'we two'.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows or columns that might affect this conclusion. Looking through the other rows for 'loc' but only one such row exists. \n\nTherefore, the claim holds true based on the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"we two\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"when the case / suffix be loc , we two be ngalbeniya\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table and what each part represents. The table has a header row with categories like \"case / suffix,\" \"we two,\" \"you and i,\" etc. Each subsequent row under these headers provides specific forms corresponding to different cases (nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc) for each category.\n\nThe claim is making a statement about the form when both the case/suffix is \"loc\" and the subject is \"we two.\" So I need to check the cell where these two conditions intersect in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows correspond to different cases: the first row covers \"nom-acc-inst,\" followed by gen, dat, abl, and loc. The columns are for different subjects or pronouns: \"we two,\" \"you and i,\" etc.\n\nTo verify the claim, I should find the cell in the \"loc\" row under the \"we two\" column. According to the table:\n\n- Under \"case / suffix,\" the last row is \"loc.\"\n- In that same row, the value under \"we two\" is \"ngalbeniya.\"\n\nThis matches exactly what the claim states: when the case/suffix is \"loc,\" \"we two\" corresponds to \"ngalbeniya.\" \n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. I can conclude that the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells needed to verify this:\n\n1. The row index for \"loc\" is 4 (since counting starts at 0: nom-acc-inst is 0, gen is 1, dat is 2, abl is 3, loc is 4).\n2. The column name we're looking at is \"we two.\"\n\nSo the relevant cell is in row 4 under the \"we two\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly references the form \"ngalbeniya\" for \"we two\" when the case is loc.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"we two\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided an HTML table and a claim about it, and I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table structure. It seems to be a grammatical case table for different pronouns with various suffixes. The rows represent different cases like nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc, and so on. The columns correspond to different pronouns such as \"we two,\" \"you and i,\" etc.\n\nThe claim given is: \"when we two be ngalbelpa , them two (the two) be palamulpa (boigu palemulpa).\" \n\nI need to break down the claim into parts and check each against the table. The claim mentions two specific forms: \"ngalbelpa\" for \"we two\" and \"palamulpa\" (with an alternate form in parentheses) for \"them two.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"we two be ngalbelpa.\" I'll look at the column named \"we two.\" Scanning down this column, I see entries like \"ngalbe,\" \"ngalben,\" \"ngalbelpa,\" etc. The claim states that \"we two\" corresponds to \"ngalbelpa.\" Looking at the rows, \"ngalbelpa\" is in the third row under \"dat\" case. So that's one relevant cell: row index 2 (since we start counting from 0) and column name \"we two.\"\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"them two (the two)\" as \"palamulpa.\" I check the column titled \"them two (the two).\" In this column, under each case, there are values like \"palai (boigu pale),\" \"palamun (boigu palemun),\" and so on. Specifically, in the third row under \"dat\" case, it's \"palamulpa (boigu palemulpa).\" So that matches the claim exactly.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"when you and i be ngoeblngu , them two (the two) be palamulngu (boigu palemulngu)\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to see which parts correspond to rows and columns in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. \"you and i\" being \"ngoeblngu\"\n2. \"them two (the two)\" being \"palamulngu (boigu palemulngu)\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with different cases/ suffixes in the rows and different pronouns (like 'we two', 'you and i', etc.) as columns.\n\nThe first part: \"you and i\" is a column name. The second part of their claim refers to \"them two (the two)\" which also corresponds to another column in the table.\n\nNow, I need to check what suffix each pronoun uses. In the claim, both are using the suffix \"ngu\". Looking at the rows, the 'abl' case has entries ending with 'ngu'. Let me verify this.\n\nIn the 'ABL' row:\n- For \"you and i\", the entry is \"ngbalngu\".\n- For \"them two (the two)\", it's \"palamulngu\" (and in parentheses, \"(boigu palemulngu)\").\n\nComparing these with the claim: The pronoun \"you and i\" should correspond to \"ngbalngu\", but the claim says \"ngoeblngu\". Hmm, that's different. 'e' vs. 'a'. So maybe a typo? Or perhaps I'm misreading it.\n\nWait, looking back at the table for \"you and i\" in the ABL row, it is indeed \"ngbalngu\", which doesn't match \"ngoeblngu\". That discrepancy could mean that either there's a typo in the claim or I'm misunderstanding the pronouns.\n\nHowever, perhaps I should check other cases to see if they might fit. For instance, looking at other rows like 'gen', 'dat', etc., but each has different suffixes.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe \"ngoeblngu\" is a typo for \"ngbalngu\". If so, then the first part would match. Let's assume that and proceed.\n\nThen, checking the second part: \"them two (the two)\" should be \"palamulngu\", which matches exactly with the entry in the ABL row under their column. So if I overlook the typo in \"you and i\" part, then both parts align correctly.\n\nBut since the claim states \"ngoeblngu\" instead of \"ngbalngu\", this might be a mistake. However, considering that 'e' and 'a' could be similar sounds or possible typos, perhaps it's intended to refer to the same thing. Alternatively, maybe I should consider if another row might have the correct form.\n\nLooking through other rows:\n- In 'nom - acc - inst', \"you and i\" is \"ngba\".\n- In 'gen', it's \"ngban\".\n- In 'dat', it's \"ngbalpa\".\n- So none of these seem to match \"ngoeblngu\" except possibly the ABL row with \"ngbalngu\".\n\nGiven that, perhaps the claim has a typo, but the intended reference is to the ABL case. Therefore, both pronouns are correctly mapped under the 'ABL' row.\n\nThus, despite the potential typo in the claim, it seems to refer to the 'ABL' case for both pronouns, making the claim TRUE based on the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"you and i\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"them two (the two)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"we two be ngalben when you two be ngipen\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are 'case / suffix', followed by different pronouns: 'we two', 'you and i', 'you two', etc. The rows under each case (nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc) provide specific forms for each pronoun.\n\nThe claim mentions \"we two\" and \"you two,\" so I'll focus on those columns. It also uses the terms \"be ngalben\" and \"be ngipen.\" The word 'be' in this context likely refers to a form of verb agreement, possibly indicating some grammatical case or suffix.\n\nLooking at the first row, which is labeled 'nom - acc - inst', I see that for 'we two', the entry is 'ngalbe'. For 'you two', it's 'ngipel'. However, the claim uses 'ngalben' and 'ngipen', which don't exactly match these.\n\nNext, I check the second row, labeled 'gen'. Here, 'we two' corresponds to 'ngalben', and 'you two' is 'ngipen'. This matches the forms mentioned in the claim: \"we two be ngalben\" and \"you two be ngipen\". \n\nSo, according to this, when the case is genitive (gen), the forms are indeed ngalben for we two and ngipen for you two. Therefore, the claim seems to correctly reference these entries.\n\nI don't see any other rows that would contradict this information. The dat, abl, and loc cases have different endings, but since the claim specifically uses 'be' which aligns with the genitive case forms, it's accurate based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in the gen row, \"we two\" corresponds to ngalben and \"you two\" to ngipen.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"we two\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"you two\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

However, according to the table, it's \"ngalbeniya\" in the \"we two\" column for the loc case, not just \"ngalben\". So there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows might help. For example, in the first row (nom-acc-inst), \"we two\" is \"ngalbe\", which is similar but not the same as ngalben. In the second row (gen), it's \"ngalben\".

The claim says: \"when the case/suffix be loc, we two be ngalbeniya and you two be ngipel.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two conditions under the 'loc' case (which I assume stands for locative case). The first part is about \"we two\" being \"ngalbeniya,\" and the second part is about \"you two\" being \"ngipel.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: \"case / suffix,\" \"we two,\" \"you and i,\" \"you two,\" etc. Each row under these columns corresponds to different cases.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to 'loc' case. In the table, 'loc' is listed as a row in the first column (row index 4). Let me check what values are under this row for each of the relevant columns.\n\nFor \"we two\" when case is 'loc', the value should be in the second column of that row. Looking at the table, in row 4 (since indexing starts at 0, so row index 4), under \"we two,\" it's \"ngalbeniya.\" That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, for \"you two\" under 'loc' case. The relevant column is \"you two.\" In row 4, under this column, the value is \"ngipeniya.\" Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says \"ngipel.\"\n\nWait, but in the previous rows, under the 'nom-acc-inst' case (row index 0), \"you two\" was \"ngipel.\" So for row 4, it's different.\n\nSo according to the table, when the case is 'loc,' \"we two\" is indeed \"ngalbeniya,\" which is correct. However, \"you two\" under 'loc' is \"ngipeniya,\" not \"ngipel.\" The claim says \"you two be ngipel,\" which is incorrect based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is true, but the second part isn't.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. It looks like a grammatical suffixes table for different pronouns and cases in a particular language, maybe from Papua New Guinea given the terms \"boigu.\" The columns are different subject-object combinations: case/suffix, we two, you and i, you two, them two (the two), who - two. The rows represent different grammatical cases: nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc.\n\nThe claim is: \"when we two be ngalbelpa , them two or the two be palamulpa (boigu palemuniya)\" \n\nWait, I think there might be a typo in the claim. It says \"be\" which doesn't quite fit grammatically. Maybe it's supposed to say something like \"is\" or \"are,\" but since I'm focusing on the values, perhaps it's referring to the suffixes for certain cases.\n\nLet me parse the claim: when we two are ngalbelpa (which is in a specific case), then them two or the two are palamulpa or palemuniya. So I need to check if these forms correspond correctly according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find where ngalbelpa appears. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: nom-acc-inst\n  - we two: ngalbe\n  - you and i: ngba\n  - you two: ngipel\n  - them two (the two): palai (boigu pale)\n  - who - two: ngawal\n\n- Row 1: gen\n  - we two: ngalben\n  - you and i: ngban\n  - you two: ngipen\n  - them two (the two): palamun (boigu palemun)\n  - who - two: as for singular\n\n- Row 2: dat\n  - we two: ngalbelpa\n  - you and i: ngbalpa\n  - you two: ngipelpa\n  - them two (the two): palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\n  - who - two: as for singular\n\nWait, so in the dat row, under \"we two\" it's ngalbelpa. So when we're in the dative case, the suffix for we two is ngalbelpa.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"when we two be ngalbelpa\". That would correspond to the dat row because that's where \"we two\" has ngalbelpa.\n\nThen, it says \"them two or the two be palamulpa (boigu palemuniya)\". Let me check what the suffix is for them two in the same case (dat). In row 2 (dat), under \"them two (the two)\" it's palamulpa (boigu palemulpa). So that matches. But wait, the claim mentions palemuniya as well. Looking at other rows:\n\nIn loc row, them two is palemuniya (boigu palemuniya). So in the dat case, they have palamulpa, but in loc they have palemuniya.\n\nSo according to the table, when \"we two\" is ngalbelpa (dat), then \"them two\" should be palamulpa. But the claim also includes palemuniya which is from a different case (loc). So that part might not be accurate.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"them two or the two be palamulpa (boigu palemuniya)\". Perhaps it's trying to say that either of those forms applies, depending on something else? Or perhaps it's a typo and should only refer to one form?\n\nLooking back: The relevant cell for them two in dat is palamulpa. So the claim correctly states that when we two are ngalbelpa (dat), them two are palamulpa. However, the parentheses mention palemuniya which is from loc. So maybe the claim is incorrect because it's combining two different cases.\n\nWait, no\u2014perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The table shows for them two in dat as palamulpa (boigu palemulpa). The claim says \"(boigu palemuniya)\" which seems to refer to a different form. So that part doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parentheses are just additional info and not part of the required check. Let me focus on the main part: them two be palamulpa. From the table, in dat case, yes, that's correct. The other part in parentheses might be a misstatement or perhaps it's from another case.\n\nWait, but if the claim is \"them two or the two be palamulpa (boigu palemuniya)\", then maybe both forms are acceptable? Or perhaps it's mixing up cases. Let me check each relevant cell:\n\n- For \"we two\" being ngalbelpa: row 2, column \"we two\"\n- For them two in dat case: row 2, column \"them two (the two)\" is palamulpa\n- The claim also mentions palemuniya which is from row 4 (loc) for them two.\n\nSo the correct form for dat is palamulpa, but palemuniya is loc. Therefore, if the claim states that in the same context where we have ngalbelpa (dat), them two are both palamulpa and palemuniya, that's incorrect because palemuniya is a different case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is whether when \"we two\" is ngalbelpa (dat), then \"them two\" should be palamulpa. The parentheses may just be providing the boigu form, which in dat is palemulpa, not palemuniya.\n\nLooking at row 2: them two is palamulpa (boigu palemulpa). So the correct form is palemulpa, but the claim says palemuniya. Therefore, that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that either of those forms can be used, which might not be accurate because they belong to different cases.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n- \"we two\" ngalbelpa is correct for dat case (row 2).\n- \"them two\" should be palamulpa (not palemuniya) in the same case.\n- Therefore, the claim has an error regarding them two's form.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check if palemuniya is a variant or perhaps it's correct in another context.\n\nLooking at row 4: loc case for them two is palamulpa (boigu palemuniya). Wait, no\u2014row 4 shows \"paleuniya\" as the boigu form. So when the main term is palemuli, the boigu form is palemuniya? Or maybe it's a typo.\n\nWait, in row 2: them two is palamulpa (boigu palemulpa). In row 4, it's palemuniya. Hmm, perhaps these are different forms for different contexts or numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because when we're in dat case, \"them two\" should be palamulpa, not palemuniya.\n\nSo overall, while part of the claim is correct (we two as ngalbelpa in dat), the them two part includes an incorrect form from loc. Therefore, the entire statement isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when \"we two\" are ngalbelpa, then \"them two or the two\" should be palamulpa (boigu palemuniya). However, according to the table:\n\n1. **We Two as_ngalbelpa**: This is correct for the dative case (dat) in row 2.\n\n2. **Them Two in_dat Case**: The suffix should be palamulpa (boigu palemulpa), not palemuniya. Palemuniya corresponds to the locative case (loc) in row 4, not dat.\n\n**Conclusion**: While \"we two\" being ngalbelpa is accurate for the dative case, the claim incorrectly includes palemuniya, which belongs to a different case. Therefore, the statement is partially correct but contains an error regarding the form of \"them two.\"\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect because when \"we two\" are ngalbelpa in the dative case, \"them two\" should be palamulpa (boigu palemulpa), not palemuniya.",

So I need to check if this statement aligns with the data in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns:\n- case / suffix\n- we two\n- you and i\n- you two\n- them two (the two)\n- who - two\n\nAnd rows that represent different grammatical cases: nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"we two\" being \"ngalbeniya\". Let me check the \"we two\" column to see where this form appears. Scanning down, I see:\n\n- In row 0 (nom-acc-inst), \"we two\" is ngalbe\n- Row 1 (gen) has ngalben\n- Row 2 (dat): ngalbelpa\n- Row 3 (abl): ngalbelngu\n- Row 4 (loc): ngalbeniya\n\nSo, \"ngalbeniya\" corresponds to the locative case for \"we two\". That makes sense.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"them two (the two)\" should be \"palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\". Let me check the \"them two (the two)\" column:\n\n- Row 0: palai (boigu pale)\n- Row 1: palamun (boigu palemun)\n- Row 2: palamulpa (boigu palemulpa) \n- Row 3: palamulngu (boigu palemulngu)\n- Row 4: palamuniya (boigu palemuniya)\n\nWait, the claim says \"palamulpa\" for them two. Looking at row 2 under \"them two\", it's palamulpa with a note about boigu palemulpa. So that matches exactly.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, when is this happening? The first part is about \"we two\" being ngalbeniya which is locative case (row 4). But the second part is \"them two\" as palamulpa, which is dat case (row 2). That seems inconsistent because if one is locative, the other should match in case.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim doesn't specify the case, just uses the forms. So perhaps it's correct regardless of case? Or maybe each pronoun is taking its own case?\n\nWait, looking back: \"when we two be ngalbeniya\", which is locative, and \"them two be palamulpa\" (dat). That might not align correctly because in a sentence structure, the cases should correspond. But since the claim doesn't specify the context of the sentence, just the forms.\n\nSo focusing on whether each part of the claim exists in the table:\n\n- \"we two\" as ngalbeniya is correct under loc case (row 4).\n- \"them two\" as palamulpa is correct under dat case (row 2).\n\nBut does this combination make sense? If someone says \"we are here\" and \"they are there\", maybe the cases would be different. But without more context, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the claim, both parts are using different cases. So if the statement is about their respective forms regardless of case agreement, then each part is correct on its own. However, combining them might not make grammatical sense because they're in different cases.\n\nBut the question isn't about whether the sentence makes sense syntactically; it's whether the claim correctly references the table entries. So as long as ngalbeniya and palamulpa are both present in their respective columns, regardless of case alignment.\n\nSo \"we two\" ngalbeniya is correct (row 4). \"them two\" palamulpa is correct (row 2). Therefore, each part of the claim correctly references the table. Hence, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies the forms for \"we two\" and \"them two\" in their respective cases within the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"we two\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"them two (the two)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"when you and i be ng\u0153ba , them two  (the two) be palamulngu  (boigu palemulngu)\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components. It mentions two parts:\n1. When \"you and i\" are referred to by a certain suffix.\n2. Then \"them two (the two)\" is referred to by another suffix.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different cases or suffixes: nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc. The columns represent different pronouns like 'we two', 'you and i', etc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"you and i\" being ng\u0153ba. I'll check the table for this value. In the column labeled \"you and i\", looking at each row:\n\n- nom-acc-inst: ngba\n- gen: ngban\n- dat: ngbalpa\n- abl: ngbalngu\n- loc: ngbaniya\n\nWait, the claim says 'ng\u0153ba', but in the table it's written as 'ngba' for the nominative case. I think that might be a typo or just a different orthography. So assuming it's referring to the same thing, 'you and i' in the nom-acc-inst row is 'ngba'. \n\nNext part of the claim: \"them two (the two)\" being 'palamulngu'. Looking at the column for \"them two  (the two)\":\n\n- nom-acc-inst: palai (boigu pale)\n- gen: palemun (boigu palemun)\n- dat: palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\n- abl: palamulngu (boigu palemulngu)\n- loc: palamuniya (boigu palemuniya)\n\nThe claim uses 'palamulngu', which matches the 'abl' row in that column. So, for \"them two\", when it's in the ablative case, the suffix is 'palamulngu'.\n\nPutting it together:\n- \"you and i\" being 'ngba' corresponds to the nom-acc-inst row.\n- However, the claim then mentions \"them two\" as 'palamulngu', which is from the abl row.\n\nWait a second. The claim seems to link \"you and i\" (which would be in the subject or object case) with \"them two\" being in the ablative case. But does that make sense grammatically? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how cases are used here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both parts of the claim refer to the same row. Let me check again. If \"you and i\" is 'ngba' in the nom-acc-inst row, then for \"them two\", in the same row, it's 'palai'. But the claim says 'palamulngu', which isn't in that row.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The claim mentions \"them two\" as 'palamulngu' from the ablative row, but if \"you and i\" is from the nom-acc-inst row, then \"them two\" shouldn't be from the same row unless both are using different cases.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the claim isn't specifying the case. Let me re-examine the structure of the table and the claim.\n\nThe claim says: when \"you and i\" is 'ng\u0153ba', which as per the table would be in the nom-acc-inst row (since that's where it's 'ngba'). So, for the same row, what is \"them two\"? It's 'palai'. But the claim states 'palamulngu', which is from the ablative case.\n\nThis suggests a mismatch because if \"you and i\" are in the nominative/accusative/instrumental case (using 'ngba'), then \"them two\" should be 'palai' in that same row. But the claim says it's 'palamulngu', which is from the ablative case.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly associates \"you and i\" with the nom-acc-inst suffix but \"them two\" with an ablative suffix. This inconsistency makes the claim FALSE because both parts should be in the same case if they're being used together in a sentence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about how these cases work. Maybe the claim is referring to different uses of 'you and i' and 'them two', but based on the table, it seems inconsistent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim links \"you and i\" with the nom-acc-inst case suffix 'ngba' and incorrectly associates \"them two\" with the ablative case suffix 'palamulngu'. Since these cases don't align within the same row, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"you and i\"},\n     {\"row_3\", \"column_name\": \"them two (the two)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a table in HTML format and a claim that I need to verify as TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has headers: \"case / suffix\", \"we two\", \"you and i\", \"you two\", \"them two (the two)\", and \"who - two\". There are five rows under these headers, each corresponding to different grammatical cases: nom-acc-inst, gen, dat, abl, loc.\n\nThe claim given is: \"ngalben be the we two for the you two ngipeniya\"\n\nI need to break this down into parts and check each against the table.\n\n1. **Identifying each part of the claim:**\n   - The first part is \"ngalben be the we two\". This seems to link the word \"ngalben\" with \"we two\".\n   - The second part is \"for the you two ngipeniya\", which connects \"you two\" with \"ngipeniya\".\n\n2. **Checking \"ngalben\" for \"we two\":**\n   - I'll look through the table's rows under the column \"we two\" to find if \"ngalben\" appears there.\n   - Scanning each row:\n     - Row 0 (nom-acc-inst): ngalbe\n     - Row 1 (gen): ngalben\n     - Rows 2,3,4 don't have this exact form under \"we two\".\n   - So, \"ngalben\" is in the \"gen\" case for \"we two\".\n\n3. **Checking \"ngipeniya\" for \"you two\":**\n   - Now, I'll check the \"you two\" column for \"ngipeniya\".\n   - Scanning each row:\n     - Row 0: ngipel\n     - Row 1: ngipen\n     - Row 2: ngipelpa\n     - Row 3: ngipelngu\n     - Row 4: ngipeniya\n   - \"ngipeniya\" is found in row 4 under the \"loc\" case for \"you two\".\n\n4. **Evaluating the claim's structure:**\n   - The claim seems to suggest a direct equivalence where \"ngalben\" corresponds to \"we two\" and \"ngipeniya\" to \"you two\". However, each of these forms appears in different grammatical cases.\n   - In the table, \"ngalben\" is under the genitive case (\"gen\") for \"we two\", while \"ngipeniya\" is under the locative case (\"loc\") for \"you two\".\n\n5. **Determining relevance and accuracy:**\n   - The relevant cells are:\n     - Row 1, column \"we two\": ngalben\n     - Row 4, column \"you two\": ngipeniya\n   - However, since these forms belong to different cases, the claim as stated doesn't correctly pair them under the same case or context. It seems to mix up different grammatical contexts.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim incorrectly pairs terms from different cases. Therefore, it's not fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for \"we two\" in gen and \"you two\" in loc, but they don't support the claim together.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"we two\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"you two\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
