The claim says: \"the highest attendance be 16150 and it happen 3 time and the lowest attendance 16005 and it happen 3 time.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'attendance' column in the table to check the numbers.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0 (May 2): Attendance is 16150\n- Row 1 (May 5): Attendance is 16150\n- Row 2 (May 7): Attendance is 16005\n- Row 3 (May 9): Attendance is 16005\n- Row 4 (May 11): Attendance is 16150\n- Row 5 (May 13): Attendance is 16005\n\nSo, the attendance values are either 16150 or 16005. Let's count how many times each occurs.\n\nFor 16150:\n- Rows 0, 1, and 4 have this value. That's three occurrences.\n\nFor 16005:\n- Rows 2, 3, and 5 have this value. Also three occurrences.\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance is 16150 happening 3 times, which matches what I found. It also says the lowest attendance is 16005 happening 3 times, which also matches.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the highest and lowest attendances each occur three times as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me read through the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the series be 1 - 0 the attendance be 16150 and when the series be 1 - 1 the attendance be 16150\". Hmm, that seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it's saying that on the dates where the series is 1-0, the attendance was 16150, and similarly for 1-1.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Each row has columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, series.\n\nI need to check each condition in the claim against the table. So first, find all the rows where the series is 1-0 and see if their attendance is 16150. Then do the same for 1-1.\n\nStarting with series 1-0: Let's scan through the 'series' column.\n\nRow 0: series is 1 - 0. The attendance in this row is 16150. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, check if there are other rows where series is 1-0. Looking down:\n\nRow 1: series is 1 - 1\nRow 2: 1 - 2\nRow 3: 2 - 2\nRow 4: 2 - 3\nRow 5: 2 - 4\n\nSo only row 0 has series 1-0, and its attendance is indeed 16150.\n\nNow for the second part of the claim: when series is 1-1, attendance should be 16150.\n\nLooking through 'series' column again:\n\nRow 1: series 1 - 1. Attendance here is 16150. That's correct per the claim.\n\nAny other rows with series 1-1? Let me check:\n\nNo, only row 1 has series 1-1. Its attendance matches the claim.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are satisfied by their respective rows. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked. For each condition:\n\n- Series 1-0 and attendance 16150: row 0, columns 'series' and 'attendance'.\n- Series 1-1 and attendance 16150: row 1, columns 'series' and 'attendance'.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies two separate conditions. So each part of the claim refers to different rows. Therefore, I should include all relevant cells that were checked.\n\nSo for row 0:\n- column 'series' (value '1 - 0')\n- column 'attendance' (16150)\n\nFor row 1:\n- column 'series' (1 - 1)\n- column 'attendance' (16150)\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows 0 and 1 for both series and attendance.\n\nSo compiling that into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the attendance against each specified series result. Both conditions hold true as shown in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step and check each condition against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the decision be mclean with the series at 2-4 and the home team be los angeles, be the score be 3-5 with a date of may 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. Decision is 'mclean'.\n2. Series is at 2-4.\n3. Home team is Los Angeles.\n4. Score is 3-5.\n5. Date is May 13.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to find a match for all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 5 (since there are 6 rows).\n\nLet's check each condition one by one:\n\nCondition 1: Decision is 'mclean'. From the table, every row has \"mclean\" under the decision column. So this condition is met in all rows.\n\nCondition 2: Series at 2-4. Let me look through the 'series' column:\n- Row 0: 1-0\n- Row 1: 1-1\n- Row 2: 1-2\n- Row 3: 2-2\n- Row 4: 2-3\n- Row 5: 2-4\n\nSo, the series is at 2-4 only in row 5.\n\nNow, check condition 3 for this row: Home team is Los Angeles. In row 5, 'home' column shows 'los angeles'. So yes, home team is LA here.\n\nCondition 4: Score is 3-5. Looking at the 'score' column in row 5, it's \"3 - 5\". That matches.\n\nCondition 5: Date is May 13. The 'date' column in row 5 is 'may 13', which is correct.\n\nSo all conditions are met in row 5. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll list the relevant cells from this row:\n\n- Decision (column_name): row 5\n- Series: row 5\n- Home: row 5\n- Score: row 5\n- Date: row 5\n\nEach of these corresponds to the conditions in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

The highest scores are 7-2 and 6-3.\n2. These scores occurred on May 9 and May 5 respectively.\n3. The attendances for these games were 16005 and 16150.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table to find rows where the score is either 7-2 or 6-3.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 0 (May 2): Score is 2-5. Not relevant.\n- Row 1 (May 5): Score is 6-3. This matches one of the high scores mentioned in the claim. The attendance here is 16150, which is also part of the claim. So this row seems to support the claim.\n- Row 2 (May 7): Score is 4-7. Not relevant as it's not one of the highest mentioned.\n- Row 3 (May 9): Score is 7-2. This matches the other high score in the claim. The attendance here is 16005, which also aligns with the claim. So this row supports the claim.\n- Rows 4 and 5: Scores are 4-3 and 3-5 respectively. These aren't part of the highest scores mentioned.\n\nNext, I'll confirm that these are indeed the highest scores in the table. Scanning through all the scores:\nThe scores are 2-5, 6-3, 4-7, 7-2, 4-3, 3-5. The highest scores here are 6-3 and 7-2, which are both present in rows May 5 and May 9.\n\nNow, checking the attendance for these two games:\n- May 5: Attendance is 16150.\n- May 9: Attendance is 16005.\n\nThe claim mentions attendances of 16005 and 16150, which matches exactly with these two rows.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that these are the only instances where those scores occurred. Looking through all the rows again, there's no other occurrence of 7-2 or 6-3.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the series be 1 - 1 the attendance be 16150 and when the series be 1 - 1 the attendance be 16005\". So, it's saying that for any instance where the series is 1-1, the attendance should be both 16150 and 16005. This seems a bit confusing because it implies two different attendances for the same series status, which might not make sense.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where the series is 1-1. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Series is 1-0 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 1: Series is 1-1 \u2192 Relevant. Attendance here is 16150.\nRow 2: Series is 1-2 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 3: Series is 2-2 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 4: Series is 2-3 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 5: Series is 2-4 \u2192 Not relevant.\n\nSo, the only row where the series is 1-1 is Row 1. In that case, the attendance is 16150. \n\nThe claim mentions two different attendances (16150 and 16005) for the same series status of 1-1. However, in reality, only one row meets this condition with an attendance of 16150. There's no other row where the series is 1-1 with a different attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is making contradictory statements. It says that when the series is 1-1, attendance should be both 16150 and 16005, which isn't supported by the data.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states two things: first, that \"the decision be always mclean in the 1992-93 vancouver canuck season,\" and second, that \"only few date take place in may.\" \n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. Each row represents a game from May. Let me go through each part of the claim.\n\nFor the first part about the decision always being Mclean: I'll check the \"decision\" column in each row. All rows have \"mclean\" as the decision-maker, so this part holds true.\n\nNext, regarding only a few dates taking place in May: The table lists games on May 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13\u2014six different dates. While it's a short span within a month, considering the context of a hockey season (which typically runs from fall to spring), having multiple games in May isn't unusual for a playoff or series setup.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"only few date take place in may.\" If by \"few\" they mean just a couple, then six dates might not qualify as few. But without a specific number defined, it's subjective. Given that all dates are within May and there aren't many rows, perhaps the claim is implying that most games happened in May, but I need to see if other months are involved. \n\nWait, the table only shows May dates, so all games took place in May. The claim says \"only few date take place in may,\" which could be misleading because it's all in May. But since the table doesn't have data from other months, we can't confirm if there were more games outside May. \n\nConsidering that, but focusing on what's given: all games are in May with decisions by Mclean. The first part is fully supported; the second is also true as per the data provided. Therefore, I'll mark it as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the highest score between vancouver and los angeles be 7  - 2 and 4  - 3 and it occur on may 9 and may 13 with attendance of 16005 and 16150\". \n\nI need to break down this claim into its components. It mentions two specific scores: 7-2 and 4-3, occurring on May 9 and May 13 respectively. The attendances for these games are stated as 16005 and 16150.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the table provided in HTML format. Let me examine each row of the table to find matches for these scores and their corresponding dates and attendances.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: May 2, Los Angeles vs Vancouver with a score of 2-5, attendance 16150.\n- Row 1: May 5, Los Angeles vs Vancouver with a score of 6-3, attendance 16150.\n- Row 2: May 7, Vancouver vs Los Angeles with a score of 4-7, attendance 16005.\n- Row 3: May 9, Vancouver vs Los Angeles with a score of 7-2, attendance 16005.\n- Row 4: May 11, Los Angeles vs Vancouver with a score of 4-3, attendance 16150.\n- Row 5: May 13, Vancouver vs Los Angeles with a score of 3-5, attendance 16005.\n\nThe claim states that the highest scores are 7-2 and 4-3. Let's check these:\n\n1. Score of 7-2 occurs on May 9 (Row 3). The attendance for this game is 16005.\n2. Score of 4-3 occurs on May 11 (Row 4). The attendance here is 16150.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says these scores occurred on May 9 and May 13. However, looking at Row 5 (May 13), the score is 3-5, not 4-3. So there's an inconsistency here. The score of 4-3 happened on May 11, but the claim incorrectly attributes it to May 13.\n\nAdditionally, checking the attendances: for May 9, attendance was 16005 as claimed, and for May 11 (which is where 4-3 actually occurred), the attendance was 16150. But since the claim mistakenly refers to May 13 for the 4-3 score, which doesn't match the table, this affects the truthfulness of the entire statement.\n\nTherefore, while part of the claim is correct (the scores and their attendances on May 9 and May 11), the dates mentioned in the claim don't align with the table data. Since the claim incorrectly states that both high-scoring games occurred on May 9 and May 13, it's not fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions two specific scores (7-2 and 4-3) and associates them with May 9 and May 13. However, in the table:\n\n- The score of 7-2 does occur on May 9 with attendance 16005.\n- The score of 4-3 is listed on May 11, not May 13, where the score was actually 3-5.\n\nThus, the claim's dates are incorrect for one of the scores. \n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 3 (May 9) with columns 'score' and 'attendance'.\n- Rows 4 and 5 (May 11 and May 13) to check the scores against the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the decision be mclean with the series at 2 - 3 and the home team be vancouver be the score be 3  -5 with a date of may 13\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify each condition mentioned in the claim:\n1. Decision is 'mclean'\n2. Series is '2 - 3'\n3. Home team is 'vancouver'\n4. Score is '3 - 5'\n5. Date is 'may 13'\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows with indexes from 0 to 5 (since there are six rows). I'll go through each row and see if any of them match all the criteria.\n\nStarting with row index 5:\n- Decision: 'mclean' \u2013 matches.\n- Series: '2 - 4' \u2013 doesn't match '2 - 3'. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I should check other rows in case there are multiple entries with the same decision and series.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all rows where decision is 'mclean', series is '2 - 3', home team is 'vancouver', score is '3 -5', and date is 'may 13'.\n\nLet me scan each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Decision: mclean\n- Series: 1 - 0\n- Home: vancouver\n- Score: 2 - 5\n- Date: may 2\n\nNot matching series or score.\n\nRow 1:\n- Decision: mclean\n- Series: 1 -1\n- Home: vancouver\n- Score:6-3\n- Date: may 5\n\nNo match.\n\nRow 2:\n- Decision: mclean\n- Series:1-2\n- Home:vancouver\n- Score:4-7\n- Date:may7\n\nNope.\n\nRow3:\n- Decision: mclean\n- Series:2-2\n- Home:los angeles\nWait, home is 'los angeles', not vancouver. So this row's home team doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow4:\n- Decision:mclean\n- Series:2-3\n- Home:vancouver? Let me check: visitor is los angeles, so home must be vancouver? Wait no, in this table, 'home' column shows who is the home team. So row4's home is 'vancouver'? No, wait row4 has 'home' as 'vancouver'? Wait looking at row4:\n\nRow4:\n- date: may 11\n- visitor: los angeles\n- score:4 -3\n- home: vancouver? Wait no, the 'home' column for row4 is 'vancouver'? Let me check again.\n\nWait in the table, row4's home team is 'vancouver' because it says 'home: vancouver'. So let me verify:\n\nRow4:\n- decision:mclean\n- series:2 -3 (matches)\n- home:vancouver (matches)\n- score:4 -3. The claim says 3-5, so that doesn't match.\n- date: may11, not may13.\n\nSo row4 partially matches but the score and date don't fit.\n\nNow row5:\n- date:may13\n- visitor:vancouver\n- score:3-5 (matches)\n- home: los angeles? Wait no, looking at row5's 'home' column. Wait in row5:\n\nRow5:\n- date: may 13\n- visitor: vancouver\n- score:3 -5 (this matches the claim's score)\n- home: los angeles? Because 'visitor is vancouver', so home would be los angeles. But the claim says home team is vancouver, which would mean that the home column should be vancouver. So in row5, home is los angeles, not vancouver. Therefore, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each cell again for row5:\n\nRow5:\n- date: may13 (matches)\n- visitor:vancouver\n- score:3-5 (matches)\n- home:los angeles (does NOT match the claim's 'vancouver')\n- decision:mclean (matches)\n- series:2 -4 (doesn't match 2-3)\n\nSo row5 has date may13, score 3-5, decision mclean, but the home team is los angeles, not vancouver. So it doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding which rows have 'home' as vancouver. Let me recheck all rows:\n\nRow0: home is vancouver\nRow1: home is vancouver\nRow2: visitor is vancouver, so home is los angeles?\nWait no, the table's structure is that each row has 'visitor' and 'home' columns. So for example, in row2, visitor is vancouver and home is los angeles.\n\nSo row0:\nvisitor: los angeles\nhome: vancouver\n\nRow1:\nvisitor:los angeles\nhome:vancouver\n\nRow2:\nvisitor:vancouver\nhome:los angeles\n\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\nIn row2, it's visitor: vancouver, home: los angeles.\n\nSo in row5, visitor is vancouver, so home must be los angeles. So that row doesn't have 'vancouver' as home team.\n\nThus, the only rows where home is vancouver are rows0,1, and perhaps others?\n\nWait let me list all home teams:\n\nRow0: home: vancouver\nRow1: home: vancouver\nRow2: home: los angeles\nRow3: home: los angeles (since visitor is vancouver)\nRow4: home: vancouver\nRow5: home: los angeles\n\nSo in row4, home is vancouver.\n\nSo looking for rows where:\n\nhome = vancouver,\n\nseries=2-3,\n\ndecision=mclean,\n\nscore=3-5,\n\ndate=may13.\n\nLooking at row4:\n\nhome: vancouver (matches)\n\nseries: 2-3 (matches)\n\ndecision: mclean (matches)\n\nscore:4-3. Doesn't match 3-5.\n\nDate: may11, not may13.\n\nThus, no match in row4.\n\nRow0 and row1 have home=vancouver but series is lower than 2-3, so can't be.\n\nWait maybe there's a mistake in the table or I'm misreading it. Let me double-check each cell:\n\nLooking at the provided table:\n\nrow0: may2, visitor=los angeles, score=2-5, home=vancouver\n\nseries=1-0 (probably after this game)\n\nrow1: may5, visitor=los angeles, score=6-3, home=vancouver\n\nseries=1-1\n\nrow2: may7, visitor=vancouver, score=4-7, home=los angeles\n\nseries=1-2\n\nrow3: may ?, I don't have exact data for row3 but series becomes 2-2.\n\nWait perhaps in the problem description, all rows are given. Let me recount:\n\nFrom initial problem statement, the table has these six rows:\n\n0: date: may2; visitor: los angeles; score:2-5; home:vancouver; series:1-0\n\n1: may5; visitor:los angeles; score:6-3; home:vancouver; series:1-1\n\n2: may7; visitor:vancouver; score:4-7; home: los angeles; series:1-2\n\nWait, perhaps not. The exact details might vary based on the data provided.\n\nBut in any case, after reviewing all rows, it appears that there is no row where:\n\n- decision is mclean,\n\n- series is 2-3,\n\n- home team is vancouver,\n\n- score is 3-5,\n\n- date is may13.\n\nTherefore, no such row exists. But the user's task was to determine if such a row exists or perhaps find which row it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread one of the rows.\n\nWait in row4: series=2-3, home=vancouver, score=4-3, date=may11. So this row has decision mclean, series 2-3, home vancouver, but the score is 4-3 instead of 3-5 and date is may11.\n\nRow5: home=los angeles, so that's not matching.\n\nSo perhaps there's no such row, meaning the answer would be that no row matches all conditions. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in interpreting which team is home or away based on the 'visitor' column.\n\nWait another approach: Perhaps for each row where decision is mclean and series=2-3, check if any of those rows have home=vancouver, score=3-5, date=may13.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow0: series=1-0 \u2013 no\n\nRow1: series=1-1 \u2013 no\n\nRow2: series=1-2 \u2013 no\n\nRow3: series=2-2 \u2013 no\n\nRow4: series=2-3 (yes)\n\nRow5: series=2-4 (no, because 2-4 isn't equal to 2-3)\n\nSo only row4 has series=2-3.\n\nIn row4:\n\nhome=vancouver,\n\nscore=4-3,\n\ndate=may11.\n\nWhich doesn't match score 3-5 or date may13.\n\nThus, no matching row exists that fulfills all five conditions. Therefore, the answer is that there's no such row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThere is no row in the table where the decision is 'mclean', series is '2 - 3', home team is 'vancouver', score is '3-5', and date is 'may13'. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No such row exists}}",
