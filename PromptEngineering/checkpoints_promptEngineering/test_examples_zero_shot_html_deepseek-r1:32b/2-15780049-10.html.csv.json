    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says there's a list of 5 games with dates April 21, April 24, April 27, April 29, and May 2. Let me look at the table step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check how many games are listed in the table. Looking at the \"game\" column, it goes from 1 to 5, so that's five games total. That matches the claim of having a list of 5 games.\n\nNext, I need to verify each date mentioned in the claim against the table. The claim lists the dates as April 21, April 24, April 27, April 29, and May 2. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Game 1: April 21 \u2013 that's correct.\n- Game 2: April 24 \u2013 also matches.\n- Game 3: April 27 \u2013 yes, that's in the table.\n- Game 4: April 29 \u2013 found here too.\n- Game 5: May 2 \u2013 which is listed as \"may 2\" in the table. The capitalization doesn't matter since it's referring to the same date.\n\nSo all five dates mentioned in the claim are present in the table. Each row corresponds correctly, and there are no extra games or missing dates. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo summarize, I checked each game number against its corresponding date and found that all five dates listed in the claim are accurately represented in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are 5 games with specific dates, which matches exactly what's shown in the table across rows 0 to 4 under the \"date\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Chris child have the high in assist 2 time with 14 and 10 and share the high in assist 1 time with alvin williams with 6.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. Chris Childs had the highest assists twice: once with 14 and another with 10.\n2. He also shared the assist lead once with Alvin Williams, each having 6.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll check the \"high assists\" column for each game.\n\nLooking at row 2 (game 2), under \"high assists\", it says Chris Childs (14). So that's one instance of him leading with 14.\n\nIn row 3 (game 3), \"high assists\" is again Chris Childs with 10. That's another instance, so he led twice as claimed.\n\nNow for the shared high: in row 5 (game 5), under \"high assists\", it says Chris Childs and Alvin Williams both have 6. So they tied here, which means each had 6 assists.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- Chris led with 14 once.\n- He led with 10 once.\n- They shared the high assist of 6 once.\n\nSo the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chris Childs led in assists twice (with 14 and 10) and tied for the lead once with Alvin Williams at 6.

The claim states: \"in the may 2 game, the high point for the toronto raptor be dell curry (17) and high rebound be antonio davis (12).\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the HTML table provided. It has columns like 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', 'high points', 'high rebounds', etc. The rows represent different games.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"may 2 game,\" so I should find which row corresponds to May 2. Looking through the dates in each row:\n\n- Row 1: April 21\n- Row 2: April 24\n- Row 3: April 27\n- Row 4: April 29\n- Row 5: May 2\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 5 (index 4 if starting from 0). Now, checking the details of that game.\n\nThe team in this row is \"detroit,\" as per the 'team' column. The claim mentions \"toronto raptor,\" but in the table, all games are for the Detroit team. Wait, does that matter? Let me think. If the high points and rebounds are listed regardless of the opposing team, then maybe it's about which player had those stats in that particular game.\n\nLooking at the 'high points' column in row 5: \"dell curry (17)\"\u2014so Dell Curry scored 17 points, which is the highest for that game. The 'high rebounds' are \"antonio davis (12)\"\u2014Antonio Davis had 12 rebounds, leading in that category.\n\nThe claim attributes both high points and rebounds to Dell Curry and Antonio Davis respectively. Since the table shows these as correct for the May 2 game, it seems accurate.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the team is Detroit in all rows, but the claim refers to \"toronto raptor.\" I'm not sure if that's a typo or if the table only lists one team's stats. Let me check again. The 'team' column says \"detroit\" for each row. So perhaps the table is from Detroit's perspective, listing their games against other teams.\n\nIf the claim refers to Toronto Raptors as the opponent, but the table is about Detroit's games, then maybe the high points and rebounds are still correct regardless of which team they're on. Alternatively, if the claim is mistakenly referencing another team, that could be an issue. However, since the table doesn't list other teams' stats, I can only go by what's provided.\n\nAssuming the table lists Detroit's games, and in their May 2 game, Dell Curry had high points (17) and Antonio Davis had high rebounds (12), then the claim is correct based on that data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the May 2 game where Dell Curry led in points and Antonio Davis in rebounds, both of which are correctly shown in row 5.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"in the april 29 game against detroit with score w 89 - 83 the location and attendance be air canada centre 20112\"\n\nFirst, I should check which row in the table corresponds to April 29. Looking at the 'date' column, the fourth row (index starting from 0) has the date \"april 29\". So that's our target row.\n\nNext, let me verify each part of the claim against this row.\n\n1. **Date and Opponent**: The claim mentions April 29 and Detroit as the opponent. From the table, under 'date' it's April 29, and 'team' is Detroit. That matches.\n\n2. **Score**: The score in the table for that row is \"w 89 - 83\", which indicates a win with the scores 89-83. The claim states \"score w 89 - 83\", so that's correct.\n\n3. **Location and Attendance**: The 'location attendance' column shows \"air canada centre 20112\". The claim mentions \"air canada centre 20112\" as the location and attendance, which matches exactly.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table.

The claim states: \"the team be detroit for every game play and the location be the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe first condition is that the team is Detroit for every game. So, I'll check each row's \"team\" column to see if it's consistently Detroit.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 1: Detroit\n- Game 2: Detroit\n- Game 3: Detroit\n- Game 4: Detroit\n- Game 5: Detroit\n\nAll teams are listed as Detroit, so this condition holds true.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim is about the location. It should be either \"the palace of auburns hill\" or \"air canada centre.\" I'll check each row's \"location attendance\" column for this.\n\nExamining each game:\n\n- Game 1: The Palace of Auburn Hills 22076\n- Game 2: The Palace of Auburn Hills 22076\n- Game 3: Air Canada Centre 20138\n- Game 4: Air Canada Centre 20112\n- Game 5: The Palace of Auburn Hills 22076\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"the palace of auburns hill\" but in the table it's spelled as \"The Palace of Auburn Hills.\" There's an extra 's' in the claim. I should note that. However, since the location names are slightly different, but the main part is \"Auburn Hills,\" perhaps it's considered the same place. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo.\n\nBut according to strict reading, the claim specifies \"the palace of auburns hill\" (with an 's' after 'auburn'), while the table shows \"The Palace of Auburn Hills.\" The spelling is slightly different. However, it's likely referring to the same place, so maybe we can consider it as matching.\n\nBut another thought: perhaps I should treat them as exactly the same? Maybe not. If the claim has a typo, but all locations are either \"Auburn Hills\" or \"Air Canada,\" then it still holds. So, for each game:\n\n- Game 1 and 2: Auburn Hills\n- Game 3 and 4: Air Canada Centre\n- Game 5: Auburn Hills\n\nAll games fall into one of the two specified locations, even if there's a slight variation in spelling.\n\nWait, but looking back at the claim, it says \"the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\" So, any location must be either of those. Since all rows have either The Palace of Auburn Hills or Air Canada Centre, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo both conditions are met: team is Detroit every time, and locations are only the two specified places.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: Chris Child had double-digit assists (meaning 10 or more) in three out of the five games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different game with various statistics. The relevant column here is \"high assists,\" which lists players and their assist counts for that game.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **Game 1**: High assists are Alvin Williams (6). Chris Child isn't mentioned, so he didn't have double-digit assists here.\n2. **Game 2**: High assists are Chris Child with 14. That's definitely a double-digit assist. So that's one game.\n3. **Game 3**: High assists again are Chris Child with 10. Exactly 10, which counts as double-digit. Second game.\n4. **Game 4**: High assists are Alvin Williams (9). Chris isn't listed here, so no double digits for him in this game.\n5. **Game 5**: High assists are both Chris Child and Alvin Williams with 6 each. So Chris didn't reach double digits here either.\n\nSo, counting up: Chris had double-digit assists in Game 2 (14) and Game 3 (10). That's two games, not three.

Now, onto the location.\n\nThe \"location attendance\" column indicates where each game was played:\n- Game 1: Palace of Auburn Hills 22076\n- Game 2: Palace of Auburn Hills 22076\n- Game 3: Air Canada Centre 20138 (This is different; it's in Toronto, not Detroit)\n- Game 4: Air Canada Centre 20112 (Again, a different location)\n- Game 5: Palace of Auburn Hills 22076\n\nSo, out of five games:\n- Games 1, 2, and 5 were at the Palace of Auburn Hills.\n- Games 3 and 4 were at Air Canada Centre.\n\nTherefore, only three games (rows 0, 1, 4) meet both conditions. The claim states that four games are against Detroit at that specific location, which isn't accurate because two games were elsewhere.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for each row:\n- For Game 3 (row index 2), checking \"team\" and \"location attendance\" shows it's not at Palace of Auburn Hills.\n- Similarly, Game 4 (row index 3) is also at Air Canada Centre.\n\nThus, the claim is false. The correct count should be three games, not four.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the april 29 game be the highest attend at the air canada centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all games that took place at the Air Canada Centre because the claim specifically mentions that location. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: April 21 vs Detroit, Location: The Palace of Auburn Hills\n- Row 1: April 24 vs Detroit, Location: The Palace of Auburn Hills\n- Row 2: April 27 vs Detroit, Location: Air Canada Centre\n- Row 3: April 29 vs Detroit, Location: Air Canada Centre\n- Row 4: May 2 vs Detroit, Location: The Palace of Auburn Hills\n\nSo, the games at Air Canada Centre are rows 2 and 3. Now, I need to check their attendance numbers.\n\nRow 2 (April 27): Attendance is 20138\nRow 3 (April 29): Attendance is 20112\n\nWait a minute, April 27 has higher attendance than April 29 at the same location. So the claim says that April 29 was the highest attend at Air Canada Centre, but according to these numbers, it's actually lower.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there was a game on April 27 with higher attendance at the same venue.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the attendance figures for both games at Air Canada Centre. Comparing them shows that the April 29 game did not have the highest attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
