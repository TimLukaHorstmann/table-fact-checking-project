The claim mentions two locations: Target Center and FedExForum. We're supposed to check when games took place at these venues and see if the one at Target Center was after the one at FedExForum.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all rows where the location is either \"target center\" or \"fedexforum\". Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Team Houston at US Airways Center on April 1. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Sacramento at US Airways Center on April 3. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Dallas at American Airlines Center on April 5. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: New Orleans at New Orleans Arena on April 8. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Memphis at FedExForum on April 10.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table shows. The table has columns: game number, date, team, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game with details about that game.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the game against New Orleans and whether it didn't have the highest attendance. So, my first step is to locate the game(s) where the opponent was New Orleans. Looking through the 'team' column, I see only one entry for \"new orleans\" in row 3 (game number 78). \n\nNext, I need to find out the attendance for that particular game. In the same row, under the 'location attendance' column, it says \"new orleans arena 17781\". So, the attendance was 17,781.\n\nNow, I have to check if this was the highest attendance across all games in the table. To do that, I'll look at each row's attendance number:\n\n- Game 75: us airways center 18422 \u2192 18,422\n- Game 76: same location as game 75 \u2192 18,422\n- Game 77: american airlines center 20301 \u2192 20,301\n- Game 78: new orleans arena 17781 \u2192 17,781 (this is our game)\n- Game 79: fedexforum 15908 \u2192 15,908\n- Game 80: target center 18478 \u2192 18,478\n- Game 81: us airways center 18422 \u2192 18,422\n- Game 82: us airways center (no attendance number provided)\n\nLooking at all these numbers, the highest attendance is in game 77 with 20,301 attendees. The New Orleans game had only 17,781, which is less than that. Therefore, the claim that \"the game against new orleans didn't have the highest attendance\" is TRUE because another game (game 77) had a higher attendance.\n\nTo verify this accurately, I should note the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For the New Orleans game: row index 3, column 'location attendance' to get the attendance number.\n- For the highest attendance: row index 2, same column to see that it's higher than the New Orleans game.\n\nThis confirms that the claim is TRUE because there was a game with higher attendance than the one against New Orleans.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"golden state, memphis, and new orleans all have the same attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The table has five columns: game, date, team, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a specific game with details about the opponent team and the attendance at that game.\n\nThe claim mentions three teams: golden state, memphis, and new orleans. My task is to find the attendances for each of these teams when they played as opponents in games listed in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. For \"golden state,\" I check if any row lists them under the \"team\" column. Scanning down, I see that game 82 was against golden state. The attendance for that game is listed as \"us airways center.\" However, the numerical value isn't provided here; it's just the location. So, the exact attendance number is missing.\n\n2. Next, for \"memphis,\" there are two entries: games 79 and 81. Game 79 has an attendance of 15908, and game 81 lists the same venue as game 82 but without a numerical value\u2014only \"us airways center.\"\n\n3. For \"new orleans,\" I find their entry in game 78, which shows an attendance of 17781.\n\nNow, analyzing these findings:\n\n- The claim states that all three teams have the same attendance. However, looking at the data:\n  - Memphis has two attendances: 15908 and (unknown as only location is given).\n  - New Orleans has 17781.\n  - Golden State's attendance isn't numerically provided; it's just the location.\n\nSince not all three have numerical attendances, and even among the ones that do, they don't match (e.g., 15908 vs. 17781), the claim isn't supported. Additionally, for golden state and one of memphis' games, we don't have actual numbers to compare.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because not all three teams have the same attendance as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that golden state, memphis, and new orleans each had the same attendance when they played. By examining the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Golden state's game (row 82) doesn't provide a numerical attendance.\n- Memphis has attendances of 15908 and an unknown value.\n- New Orleans has 17781.\n\nThe attendances aren't the same, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 78, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 79, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 82, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the claim \"the highest attendance be at the target center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents. Looking at the table headers: game number, date, team, location attendance, and record. So the key columns here are \"location attendance\" because it directly relates to attendance numbers, and perhaps \"team\" if needed for context, but maybe not necessary for this claim.\n\nThe claim is about the highest attendance being at the Target Center. So I need to check which games were played at Target Center and what their attendances were, then compare them with other locations to see if Target Center indeed had the highest.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Game 75: Houston, US Airways Center, 18422\n- Game 76: Sacramento, US Airways Center, 18422\n- Game 77: Dallas, American Airlines Center, 20301\n- Game 78: New Orleans, New Orleans Arena, 17781\n- Game 79: Memphis, FedExForum, 15908\n- Game 80: Minnesota, Target Center, 18478\n- Game 81: Memphis, US Airways Center, 18422\n- Game 82: Golden State, US Airways Center, but the attendance isn't listed here.\n\nWait, for game 82, it's at US Airways Center but no attendance number is provided. So I can ignore that since we don't have data.\n\nNow, compiling the attendances:\n\n- Target Center (Game 80): 18478\n- American Airlines Center (Game 77): 20301\n- Others: US Airways has two games at 18422 and one at 18422 again, and others are lower.\n\nComparing these numbers:\n\nThe highest is 20301 at American Airlines Center. Target Center's attendance was 18478, which is less than 20301. So the claim that the highest attendance was at Target Center isn't true because American Airlines Center had a higher number.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Game 80: Target Center with 18478\n- Game 77: American Airlines Center with 20301\n\nThese two rows in the \"location attendance\" column show that Target Center didn't have the highest.

The claim mentions two locations: FedExForum and Target Center. My task is to find out when each of these games took place and compare their dates.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows, each representing a different game. Each row has columns for game number, date, team, location attendance, and record. I'm particularly interested in the \"date\" column because it tells me when each game occurred.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the \"location attendance\" column to find where FedExForum is mentioned. Scanning down, I see that on row 5 (index starting from 0), the location is listed as \"fedexforum 15908\". The date for this game is April 10.\n\nNext, I'll look for Target Center in the same column. Looking through the rows, I find it at row 6 (since indexing starts at 0). Wait, no\u2014row 6 has \"us airways center\" again. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, row 5 is FedExForum, then row 6 is April 13 against Memphis at US Airways Center. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the Target Center appears in another location. Let's see: looking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Houston at US Airways\n- Row 1: Sacramento at US Airways\n- Row 2: Dallas at American Airlines Center\n- Row 3: New Orleans at New Orleans Arena\n- Row 4: Memphis at FedExForum on April 10\n- Row 5: Minnesota at Target Center on April 11\n- Row 6: Memphis again at US Airways on April 13\n- Row 7: Golden State at US Airways on April 15\n\nAh, I see. So the game at FedExForum is row 4 (index 4), which took place on April 10. The game at Target Center is in row 5 (index 5) on April 11.\n\nNow, comparing the dates: April 10 comes before April 11. Therefore, the game at FedExForum happened before the game at Target Center. This means that the claim which states that the FedexForum game took place after the Target Center game is incorrect.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because April 10 is earlier than April 11.\n</think>\n\nThe game at FedExForum was on April 10, and the game at Target Center was on April 11.

Scanning through each row:\n\n- Game 75: Team Houston\n- Game 76: Team Sacramento\n- Game 77: Team Dallas\n- Game 78: Team New Orleans \u2013 this is one of the teams mentioned in the claim.\n- Game 79: Team Memphis\n- Game 80: Team Minnesota \u2013 this is the other team in the claim.\n- Game 81: Team Memphis again\n- Game 82: Team Golden State\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row 78 (New Orleans) and row 80 (Minnesota).\n\nNext, I need to check the 'location attendance' column for both these rows. For New Orleans, in row 78, it says \"new orleans arena 17781\". That means the attendance was 17,781.\n\nFor Minnesota, row 80 shows \"target center 18478\", so the attendance was 18,478.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 17,781 (New Orleans) and 18,478 (Minnesota). Since 18,478 is higher than 17,781, the attendance for Minnesota's game was actually higher. Therefore, the claim that Minnesota's game had lower attendance is false.\n\nI should make sure I didn't mix up any numbers or teams.

Let me compare this with all other games. \n\nLooking at all the attendances:\n\n- Houston (Game 75): 18422\n- Sacramento (76): 18422\n- Dallas (77): 20301 \u2192 This is higher than New Orleans.\n- New Orleans (78): 17781\n- Memphis (79): 15908\n- Minnesota (80): 18478\n- Memphis (81): 18422\n- Golden State (82): No data\n\nSo, Dallas's game had the highest attendance at 20301. Therefore, the claim that New Orleans' game had the highest is false because another game (against Dallas) had higher attendance.\n\nI should list all the relevant cells to make this determination. That includes each row where there's an opponent and their respective attendances, as well as the New Orleans row. So, I'll note the rows for Houston (75), Sacramento (76), Dallas (77), New Orleans (78), Memphis (79), Minnesota (80), and Memphis again (81). Each of these has an attendance number that was considered in comparing whether New Orleans had the highest.\n\nI should also include game 82, but since it doesn't have an attendance number, it's unclear. However, for this analysis, we can only consider the available data. Since Dallas already has a higher number than New Orleans, even if game 82 had higher attendance (though we don't know), without that data, the highest known is still Dallas.\n\nSo, the claim is false because another game had higher attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The game against New Orleans did not have the highest attendance; the game against Dallas had a higher attendance of 20301 compared to New Orleans' 17781.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
