    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"most of the standard name for asymmetric digital subscriber line start with itu\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to extract all the relevant data points. The table has multiple rows, each representing different versions and specifications related to ADSL technologies. The columns are version, standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate.\n\nThe claim is about the \"standard name\" starting with \"itu\". So, I need to look at each row's \"standard name\" column to see if it begins with \"itu\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: standard name is \"ansi t1.413 - 1998 issue 2\" \u2192 starts with \"ansi\", not \"itu\".\n2. **Row 1**: standard name is \"itu g992.1\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n3. **Row 2**: standard name is \"itu g992.1 annex a\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n4. **Row 3**: standard name is \"itu g992.1 annex b\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n5. **Row 4**: standard name is \"itu g992.2\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n6. **Row 5**: standard name is \"itu g992.3\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n7. **Row 6**: standard name is \"itu g992.3 annex j\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n8. **Row 7**: standard name is \"itu g992.3 annex l\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n9. **Row 8**: standard name is \"itu g992.4\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n10. **Row 9**: standard name is \"itu g992.5\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n11. **Row 10**: standard name is \"itu g992.5 annex m\" \u2192 starts with \"itu\".\n12. **Row 11**: standard name is \"(up to 3.75 mhz)\" \u2192 does not start with \"itu\".\n\nNow, let's count how many of these start with \"itu\":\n\n- Rows 1-10 (excluding row 0 and 11) all have standard names starting with \"itu\". That's 10 rows.\n- Row 0: starts with \"ansi\" \u2192 does not match.\n- Row 11: doesn't start with \"itu\" \u2192 doesn't match.\n\nTotal number of rows in the table is 12. Out of these, 10 have standard names starting with \"itu\". So, more than half (which is 6 out of 12) do so; in fact, a significant majority (83%) start with \"itu\".\n\nTherefore, the claim that most standard names for ADSL start with \"ITU\" is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all the rows' \"standard name\" column. So I'll list each row index from 0 to 11 under the \"standard name\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. The claim seems a bit unclear because of the wording, but I think it's stating that one of the common names in the table includes \"adsl,\" which stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several rows under different versions like adsl, adsl2, adsl2+, and adsl2++. Each row has a \"common name\" column. My task is to check if any of these common names include \"adsl.\" \n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: The common name is \"adsl.\"\nRow 1: Common name is \"adsl ( gdmt )\"\nRow 2: Common name is \"adsl over pots\"\nRow 3: Common name is \"adsl over isdn\"\nRow 4: Common name is \"adsl lite ( glite )\"\nRow 5: Common name is \"adsl2\"\nRows 6,7,8: These are variations of adsl2 with different annexes but the common names don't include \"adsl,\" they have \"adsl2\" or \"re-adsl2.\"\nRows 9,10: These are for adsl2+ and adsl2+ m.\nRow 11: Common name is \"adsl4.\"\n\nSo in rows 0 through 4, the common names all include \"adsl.\" For example, row 0 has just \"adsl,\" which directly matches the claim. The other rows have additional descriptors but still include \"adsl\" as part of their common name.\n\nTherefore, since there are multiple entries where the common name includes \"adsl,\" the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells would be any row where the \"common name\" column contains \"adsl.\" Looking back, that's rows 0,1,2,3,4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the common name includes \"adsl,\" and checking each row confirms this across multiple entries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"common name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the highest upstream rate be 5.0 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that the maximum upstream rate for ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) technology is 5.0 Mbps. I'll need to look through the table to see if any entry matches this.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different version or variant of ADSL. The columns include 'version', 'standard name', 'common name', 'downstream rate', and 'upstream rate'. So, for this claim, I'm particularly interested in the 'upstream rate' column across all rows.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: version is adsl, upstream rate is 1.0 Mbps.\n2. **Row 1**: adsl again, upstream is 1.3 Mbps.\n3. **Row 2**: adsl over pots, upstream remains at 1.3 Mbps.\n4. **Row 3**: adsl over isdn, upstream increases to 1.8 Mbps.\n5. **Row 4**: adsl lite, which has a lower upstream of 0.5 Mbps.\n6. **Row 5**: adsl2, upstream is 1.3 Mbps.\n7. **Row 6**: adsl2 annex j, upstream jumps to 3.5 Mbps.\n8. **Row 7**: re-adsl2, which drops back to 0.8 Mbps for upstream.\n9. **Row 8**: splitterless adsl2, upstream is 0.5 Mbps again.\n10. **Row 9**: adsl2 +, upstream is 1.1 Mbps.\n11. **Row 10**: adsl2 + m, upstream increases to 3.3 Mbps.\n12. **Row 11**: adsl2 ++, which has an upstream rate of 5.0 Mbps.\n\nSo the highest upstream rate I see in the table is 5.0 Mbps for 'adsl2 ++' version with a common name 'adsl4'. Therefore, this matches the claim that the highest upstream rate is 5.0 Mbps for ADSL.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows beyond row 11 to ensure I haven't missed anything, but it looks like that's all. So yes, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the highest upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s occurs in the last row under 'adsl2 ++', which is a type of asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL). Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the lowest downstream rate achieve be 1.5 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions the lowest downstream rate being 1.5 mbit/s for ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line). So I'm looking for the minimum value in the 'downstream rate' column where the version is related to ADSL.\n\nLooking at the table, the versions listed are adsl, adsl2, and adsl2 +, adsl2 ++. Each of these has different downstream rates.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. The first row under adsl has a downstream rate of 8.0 mbit/s.\n2. Second row: 8.0 again.\n3. Third: 12.0\n4. Fourth: 12.0\n5. Fifth: 1.5 mbit/s here. This is the first instance I see of a lower downstream rate for adsl.\n\nThen, moving to adsl2:\n6. Downstream rates are 12.0, then same in the next two rows.\n7. Last row under adsl2 has 5.0 mbit/s but that's for re-adsl2.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, actually, the fifth row is adsl with 1.5 downstream. Then, looking further down, there's another entry:\n\nIn the last row, version is adsl2 ++ and the standard name mentions up to 3.75 mhz, common name is adsl4, but the downstream rate is 52.0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking at each 'downstream rate' value:\n\n- adsl: 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0, 1.5\n- adsl2: 12.0, 12.0, 5.0, 1.5\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking at the rows:\n\nRow 4 (index starts at 0): version is adsl, common name is adsl over isdn, downstream rate is 12.0.\n\nRow 5: version adsl, standard itu g992.2, common name adsl lite, downstream rate is 1.5 mbit/s.\n\nSo that's one instance of 1.5 for adsl.\n\nThen, looking at adsl2:\n\nRow 6: version adsl2, standard itu g992.3, downstream 12.0\n\nRow 7: same standard, annex j, downstream still 12.0\n\nRow 8: annex l, downstream 5.0\n\nRow 9: standard g992.4, common name splitterless adsl2, downstream rate is 1.5 mbit/s.\n\nWait, no\u2014row 9's downstream is listed as '01.5' but in the table it says \"01.5 mbit / s\"\u2014so that's 1.5. But looking at row index: let me recount.\n\nThe rows are:\n\n0: adsl, 8.0\n\n1: adsl, 8.0\n\n2: adsl, 12.0\n\n3: adsl, 12.0\n\n4: adsl, 1.5\n\n5: adsl2, 12.0\n\n6: adsl2, 12.0\n\n7: adsl2, 5.0\n\n8: adsl2, 1.5?\n\nWait no\u2014row index 9 is version adsl2, standard g992.4, downstream rate is 1.5.\n\nSo both rows 4 (adsl) and 9 (adsl2) have 1.5 mbit/s as downstream rates.\n\nBut the claim is about ADSL, which refers to adsl specifically, not adsl2 or other versions. So I need to check if the lowest downstream rate for adsl is 1.5.\n\nLooking at all adsl rows:\n\nRows 0-4: their downstream rates are 8,8,12,12,1.5. The minimum here is indeed 1.5. But wait\u2014row 4's downstream is 1.5 mbit/s for adsl (standard g992.2), so that's the lowest.\n\nHowever, looking at row 9: version is adsl2, standard g992.4, which has a downstream rate of 1.5 as well. But since the claim refers to ADSL, not adsl2 or others, I think it's considering only the adsl rows.\n\nBut wait, let me check all versions again:\n\nLooking for any adsl row with lower than 1.5 mbit/s. The lowest in adsl is 1.5 (row 4). Are there any adsl rows with lower? No. So the claim says that the lowest downstream rate achieved is 1.5 for ADSL, which would be correct based on the table.\n\nWait, but row 9 has a lower downstream rate of 1.5 as well, but it's under adsl2. So if someone considers all versions together, the minimum could be lower elsewhere, but in this case, since the claim specifies ADSL, only the adsl rows are relevant.\n\nSo in that context, the lowest downstream for adsl is 1.5 mbit/s, which matches the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait\u2014the claim says \"for asymmetric digital subscriber line\"\u2014which is ADSL. So looking only at adsl entries.\n\nYes, so the lowest downstream rate among adsl entries is indeed 1.5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest downstream rate for ADSL is 1.5 mbit/s. Reviewing the table, the row with index 4 under the 'adsl' version shows a downstream rate of 1.5 mbit/s. This confirms the claim as TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"none of the standard name for asymmetric digital subscriber line start with itu\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked here. The table lists various versions and standards related to ADSL. The claim is about whether any of these standards have a 'standard name' that starts with \"itu\".\n\nI'll go through each row in the table one by one and look at the 'standard name' column.\n\nLooking at the first row: the standard name is \"ansi t1.413 - 1998 issue 2\". This doesn't start with \"ITU\", so it's fine for the claim.\n\nSecond row: \"itu g992.1\" \u2013 wait, this starts with \"itu\". Oh, but the claim says none of them start with itu, which would make this statement false because there is at least one that does.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows to be thorough.\n\nThird row: \"itu g992.1 annex a\" \u2013 also starts with itu.\nFourth row: \"itu g992.1 annex b\" \u2013 same here.\nFifth row: \"itu g992.2\" \u2013 again, starts with itu.\nSixth row: \"itu g992.3\" \u2013 yes.\nSeventh row: \"itu g992.3 annex j\" \u2013 yes.\nEighth row: \"itu g992.3 annex l\" \u2013 yes.\nNinth row: \"itu g992.4\" \u2013 yes.\nTenth row: \"itu g992.5\" \u2013 yes.\nEleventh row: \"itu g992.5 annex m\" \u2013 yes.\nTwelfth row: \"(up to 3.75 mhz)\" \u2013 this doesn't start with itu, but it's not relevant because most of the standard names do.\n\nSo since there are multiple entries where the 'standard name' starts with \"ITU\", the claim is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list all rows where the 'standard name' starts with itu and include their row indices along with the column name 'standard name'.\n\nLet me count the rows starting from 0:\n\nRow 1: index 1 (starts at 0?) Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, in programming, indexes usually start at 0. So the first row is index 0, second index 1, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: standard name \"ansi t1...\" \u2013 doesn't start with itu.\nRow 1: \"itu g992.1\" \u2013 starts with it.\nRow 2: \"itu g992.1 annex a\"\nRow 3: \"itu g992.1 annex b\"\nRow 4: \"itu g992.2\"\nRow 5: \"itu g992.3\"\nRow 6: \"itu g992.3 annex j\"\nRow 7: \"itu g992.3 annex l\"\nRow 8: \"itu g992.4\"\nRow 9: \"itu g992.5\"\nRow 10: \"itu g992.5 annex m\"\n\nWait, row indices go from 0 to 12? Because there are 12 rows in the table.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the HTML, the tbody has 12 tr elements (rows). So rows are indexed from 0 to 11.\n\nSo for each of these rows where standard name starts with itu, their row indices are:\n\nRow 1: index 1\nRow 2: index 2\nRow 3: index 3\nRow 4: index 4\nRow 5: index 5\nRow 6: index 6\nRow 7: index 7\nRow 8: index 8\nRow 9: index 9\nRow 10: index 10\n\nWait, row 0 is the first data row, which has standard name \"ansi...\", so no. Then rows 1 to 10 are the ones with standard names starting with itu.\n\nSo in total, there are 10 such rows (indices 1 through 10) where 'standard name' starts with itu.\n\nThus, these are all relevant cells that contradict the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"standard name\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: a rare name and that it includes \"adsl\" which stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. So, I'm guessing this refers to whether there's an entry in the table where the standard name or common name is rare, but the term adsl is included as part of the name.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: version, standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate. The claim is about a \"rare name\", so I think that refers to either the standard name or the common name being something uncommon or rare. But in the context of this problem, it might be more straightforward\u2014maybe just looking for any instance where 'adsl' appears in either the standard name or the common name.\n\nWait, but actually, since the claim says \"include adsl\", maybe it's about whether there's a version that includes 'adsl' in its common or standard names. Let me scan through each row.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n- Rows 0 to 4: version is adsl, with various standard and common names including terms like ansi t1.413, itu g992.*, etc. The common names include 'adsl', 'adsl (gdmt)', 'adsl over pots', etc.\n- Rows 5 to 7: version is adsl2, with similar standard names but different rates.\n- Rows 8 and 9: version is adsl2 +, again with their own standard names.\n- The last row has version adsl2++ with common name adsl4.\n\nIn all these rows, the common name includes 'adsl' in some form. So, every entry under common name for version adsl includes 'adsl'. The claim says \"rare name include adsl\", which I'm interpreting as whether any of the names (standard or common) use 'adsl', and it seems they all do.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the claim is just stating that 'adsl' is part of the rare name, meaning it's included in the standard or common names. Since all rows under version adsl have 'adsl' in their common names, this would support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those where the common name includes 'adsl'. Each row with version 'adsl' has a common name that starts with 'adsl', so all rows 0 to 4 (indices 0-4) have 'common name' as adsl. So the relevant cells would be from these rows, column 'common name'.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"rare name include adsl\", which might mean a specific rare instance where 'adsl' is part of the name. Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether 'asymmetric digital subscriber line' is the standard term for adsl, and if any row uses that exact phrase in its common or standard name.\n\nLooking again at the table, none of the rows have \"Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line\" as either standard or common names. The closest is 'adsl', but not the full expansion. So maybe the claim is false because while 'adsl' is included, the full term isn't present in any cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that 'adsl' is a rare name for asymmetric digital subscriber line. But in reality, 'adsl' is commonly used as an abbreviation, so it's not rare. Therefore, if the table shows that 'adsl' is included in common names, and the claim says it's a rare name, then the claim would be false because 'adsl' isn't rare here\u2014it's actually quite prevalent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could mean that among all possible terms for asymmetric digital subscriber line, 'adsl' is considered a rare or uncommon name. But looking at the table, 'adsl' appears frequently in common names, so this would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to whether there's any row where the standard name includes adsl. Let me check that. The standard names are things like ansi t1.413 and itu g992.*, which don't include 'adsl', but the common names do. So if the claim is about the common name including adsl, then it's correct because all the rows have 'adsl' in their common names.\n\nWait, but the exact wording is \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\". Maybe this means that there exists a rare name (perhaps a less commonly used term) which includes 'adsl'. Since 'asymmetric digital subscriber line' is the full form, and if any row uses it in standard or common names, then it's included. But none of the rows do. So perhaps the claim is false because the table doesn't show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break down the claim: \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\". This could be interpreted as whether 'adsl' is included in a rare (uncommon) name related to asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n\nIn the table, all common names under version adsl include 'adsl', so that's not rare. Therefore, if the claim suggests that there's a rare instance where 'adsl' is part of the name, but in reality, it's commonly used, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct because 'adsl' is included as a common term in all rows, so it's not rare. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more methodically. The claim has two parts: \"rare name include adsl\" and \"for asymmetric digital subscriber line\". So perhaps the question is whether there exists a row where either the standard or common name includes 'adsl' (as part of a rare term), and that relates to asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n\nLooking at the table, all common names under version 'adsl' include 'adsl', which is the abbreviation for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. So in this context, the claim would be true because each row's common name includes 'adsl', indicating that it is part of the naming for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"rare name\", implying that the inclusion of 'adsl' is rare or uncommon. But since all rows have 'adsl' in their common names, perhaps it's not rare at all\u2014it's quite common. Therefore, the claim might be false because 'adsl' isn't a rare term here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is whether 'adsl' is part of any standard or common name, regardless of rarity. Since it is, then the claim would be true.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck on interpreting \"rare name include adsl\". If the claim means that there exists a rare instance where 'adsl' is included in a name, but all instances are common, then the claim is false. However, if the claim simply states that 'adsl' is included in some names (regardless of rarity), then it's true.\n\nBut considering the exact wording: \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\". It might be implying that among the terms used for asymmetric digital subscriber line, there exists a rare name that includes 'adsl'. However, since all common names in the table under version 'adsl' include 'adsl', it's not rare.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct because each row lists a standard or common name that includes 'adsl', making it accurate. But I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the best approach is to look for any cell where 'adsl' appears in either standard name or common name. Since all rows under version 'adsl' have common names with 'adsl', those cells would support the claim that 'adsl' is included as a part of their naming.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is true because each row includes 'adsl' in its common name, which relates to asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining whether the claim \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\" holds based on the provided table. \n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim that a rare name includes \"adsl\" for asymmetric digital subscriber line is **false**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nUpon examining the table, all common names under version 'adsl' consistently include 'adsl', indicating it's not a rare term but rather a commonly used abbreviation. Therefore, since 'adsl' appears frequently in the common names, the claim about it being a rare inclusion is incorrect.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the lowest downstream rate for asymmetric digital subscriber line be 52.0 mbit / s\". \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It's talking about the lowest downstream rate for ADSL being 52.0 mbit/s. I need to check if that's correct according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: version, standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate. The relevant column here is \"downstream rate\". \n\nI should go through each row and look at the \"downstream rate\" values for ADSL versions.\n\nLet me list out all the rows:\n\n1. ADSL (row 0): 8.0 Mbit/s\n2. ADSL (row 1): 8.0 Mbit/s\n3. ADSL Annex A: 12.0 Mbit/s\n4. ADSL Annex B: 12.0 Mbit/s\n5. ADSL Lite: 1.5 Mbit/s\n6. ADSL2: 12.0 Mbit/s\n7. ADSL2 with Annex J: 12.0 Mbit/s\n8. ADSL2 with Annex L: 5.0 Mbit/s\n9. Splitterless ADSL2: 1.5 Mbit/s\n10. ADSL2+: 20.0 Mbit/s\n11. ADSL2+ with Annex M: 24.0 Mbit/s\n12. ADSL2++ or ADSL4: 52.0 Mbit/s\n\nWait, the last row is for ADSL2++, not ADSL. So all entries under \"adsl\" and \"adsl2\" have downstream rates ranging from 1.5 to 12.0 Mbit/s. The highest in those categories is 12.0, but looking for the lowest, I see that both ADSL Lite (row 4) and Splitterless ADSL2 (row 9) have a downstream rate of 1.5 Mbit/s.\n\nThe claim mentions \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" which refers to ADSL, not ADSL2 or later versions. So the relevant rows are from version 'adsl' only.\n\nSo in those rows, the lowest downstream rate is 1.5 Mbit/s, not 52.0. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it states that the lowest is 52.0, which doesn't match the data. The highest downstream for ADSL versions is 12.0, but in the last row, it's 52.0 under 'adsl2++', not ADSL.\n\nThus, I need to list all rows where version is 'adsl' and their respective downstream rates. Those are rows 0-4 (indices 0,1,2,3,4), each contributing relevant cells in the \"downstream rate\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the lowest downstream rate for ADSL is 1.5 Mbit/s, not 52.0. The 52.0 Mbit/s is under ADSL2++, which isn't ADSL.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the median downstream rate achieve be 1.5 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The key points here are:\n- We're looking at \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" (ADSL), so all rows where version is 'adsl', 'adsl2', 'adsl2 +', etc.\n- The specific metric in question is the downstream rate.\n- The claim states that the median of these downstream rates is 1.5 mbit/s.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to extract all downstream rates for ADSL versions.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 0: version 'adsl', downstream rate '08.0 8.0 mbit / s' \u2192 8.0\nRow 1: version 'adsl', downstream rate '8.0 mbit / s' \u2192 8.0\nRow 2: version 'adsl', downstream rate '12.0 mbit / s' \u2192 12.0\nRow 3: version 'adsl', downstream rate '12.0 mbit / s' \u2192 12.0\nRow 4: version 'adsl', downstream rate '01.5 1.5 mbit / s' \u2192 1.5\n\nRows for adsl2 and beyond:\n\nRow 5: version 'adsl2', downstream rate '12.0 mbit / s' \u2192 12.0\nRow 6: same version, rate '12.0' \u2192 12.0\nRow 7: same version, rate '05.0 5.0 mbit / s' \u2192 5.0\nRow 8: same version, rate '01.5 1.5 mbit / s' \u2192 1.5\n\nRows for adsl2+:\n\nRow 9: downstream '20.0 mbit/s'\nRow 10: downstream '24.0 mbit/s'\n\nAnd the last row is adsl2++ (adsl4) with downstream 52.0.\n\nNow, compiling all these downstream rates from ADSL versions:\n8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0, 1.5,\n12.0, 12.0, 5.0, 1.5,\n20.0, 24.0, 52.0\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), which typically refers to the first version. However, sometimes 'adsl' can include adsl2 and adsl2+ as they are part of the same family. I need to clarify whether the claim includes all ADSL versions or just the initial ones.\n\nAssuming the claim is about all ADSL variants (including 2 and 2+), let's list all downstream rates:\n\nList of downstream rates:\n1.5, 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0, 1.5, 12.0, 12.0, 5.0, 20.0, 24.0, 52.0\n\nNow, let's sort them to find the median:\n\nSorted list:\n1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 20.0, 24.0, 52.0\n\nThere are 12 data points. The median will be the average of the 6th and 7th values.\n\nCounting to the middle:\nPositions 1-12:\n1:1.5\n2:1.5\n3:5.0\n4:8.0\n5:8.0\n6:12.0\n7:12.0\n8:12.0\n9:12.0\n10:20.0\n11:24.0\n12:52.0\n\nThe 6th and 7th values are both 12.0, so the median is (12 + 12)/2 = 12.0.\n\nBut the claim states the median is 1.5, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in including all versions. Let me check if perhaps the claim refers only to 'adsl' and not adsl2 or beyond.\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\nRows with version 'adsl' are rows 0-4:\nDownstream rates: 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0, 1.5\n\nSo that's five data points. Let me list them and find the median.\n\nSorted list: 1.5, 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0\n\nMedian is the middle value when sorted, which is the 3rd value. Here, the third value is 8.0.\n\nSo if the claim refers only to 'adsl' (rows 0-4), the median downstream rate would be 8.0, not 1.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering all ADSL variants including adsl2 and beyond. But as calculated earlier, the overall median was 12.0, which still doesn't match 1.5.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of data points or included incorrect rows.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRows with version starting with 'adsl':\n\nRow indices 0-4: adsl\nRow 5-8: adsl2\nRow9-10: adsl2 +\nRow11: adsl2 ++ (adsl4)\n\nSo, if considering all these as ADSL variants, the downstream rates are:\n\nRows 0-4: 8.0, 8.0, 12.0, 12.0, 1.5\nRows5-8: 12.0, 12.0, 5.0, 1.5\nRows9-10:20.0,24.0\nRow11:52.0\n\nTotal downstream rates:\n\nFrom rows 0-4: 5 entries\nRows5-8: 4 entries (rows 5,6,7,8)\nRows9-10:2 entries\nRow11:1 entry\nTotal = 5+4+2+1=12 entries as before.\n\nSorted list is correct with median 12.0.\n\nTherefore, the claim's stated median of 1.5 is incorrect whether considering all ADSL variants or only the initial 'adsl' versions.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the median upstream rate be 5.0 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) refers to a type of technology used for internet access, which allows data transmission over telephone lines. The term \"asymmetric\" here means that the downstream rate (data coming to the user) is higher than the upstream rate (data sent by the user). \n\nThe claim mentions the median upstream rate being 5.0 mbit/s. Median means the middle value when all values are arranged in order. So, I need to look at all the upstream rates for ADSL and find their median.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has entries under 'version', 'standard name', 'common name', 'downstream rate', and 'upstream rate'. Since the claim is about ADSL, I should focus on rows where the 'version' column is either 'adsl', 'adsl2', or 'adsl2+', etc., but specifically, since the common names include various types of ADSL (like ADSL, ADSL2, ADSL2+), I'll collect all upstream rates from these entries.\n\nLet's list out all the upstream rates:\n\n1. 1.0 mbit/s\n2. 1.3 mbit/s\n3. 1.3 mbit/s\n4. 1.8 mbit/s\n5. 0.5 mbit/s\n6. 1.3 mbit/s\n7. 3.5 mbit/s\n8. 0.8 mbit/s\n9. 0.5 mbit/s\n10. 1.1 mbit/s\n11. 3.3 mbit/s\n12. 5.0 mbit/s\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm capturing all the rows correctly. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 0: adsl -> upstream 1.0\nRow 1: adsl (gdmt) -> upstream 1.3\nRow 2: adsl over pots -> upstream 1.3\nRow 3: adsl over isdn -> upstream 1.8\nRow 4: adsl lite -> upstream 0.5\nRow 5: adsl2 -> upstream 1.3\nRow 6: adsl2 annex j -> upstream 3.5\nRow 7: re-adsl2 -> upstream 0.8\nRow 8: splitterless adsl2 -> upstream 0.5\nRow 9: adsl2+ -> upstream 1.1\nRow 10: adsl2+ m -> upstream 3.3\nRow 11: adsl2++/adsl4 -> upstream 5.0\n\nWait, the last row's version is 'adsl2++' with common name 'adsl4', and upstream rate of 5.0.\n\nSo that gives us all 12 rows to consider for ADSL versions.\n\nNow, I need to collect all the upstream rates:\n\nFrom each row:\n- Row 0: 1.0\n- Row 1: 1.3\n- Row 2: 1.3\n- Row 3: 1.8\n- Row 4: 0.5\n- Row 5: 1.3\n- Row 6: 3.5\n- Row 7: 0.8\n- Row 8: 0.5\n- Row 9: 1.1\n- Row 10: 3.3\n- Row 11: 5.0\n\nSo the list is:\n\n[1.0, 1.3, 1.3, 1.8, 0.5, 1.3, 3.5, 0.8, 0.5, 1.1, 3.3, 5.0]\n\nNow, to find the median, we need to sort this list in ascending order.\n\nLet's arrange them:\n\n0.5, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 1.3, 1.3, 1.8, 3.3, 3.5, 5.0\n\nNow, since there are 12 values (even number), the median will be the average of the 6th and 7th values.\n\nThe 6th value is 1.3 (since we start counting from 1: 1st=0.5, 2nd=0.5, 3rd=0.8, 4th=1.0, 5th=1.1, 6th=1.3)\n\nThe 7th value is also 1.3.\n\nSo the median is (1.3 + 1.3)/2 = 1.3 mbit/s.\n\nBut the claim states that the median upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s, which doesn't match our calculation of 1.3 mbit/s.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in counting or selecting rows. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking back at each row's upstream rate:\n\nRow 0: 1.0\nRow 1: 1.3\nRow 2: 1.3\nRow 3: 1.8\nRow 4: 0.5\nRow 5: 1.3\nRow 6: 3.5\nRow 7: 0.8\nRow 8: 0.5\nRow 9: 1.1\nRow 10: 3.3\nRow 11: 5.0\n\nSo the list is correct, with 12 entries.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider only the rows where 'version' is 'adsl', not including adsl2 or adsl2+ versions. Because the claim says \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" without specifying any version beyond that.\n\nLet me check what defines ADSL in the table:\n\nLooking at the 'common name' column, entries include 'ADSL', 'ADSL2', 'ADSL2+', etc. So perhaps 'ADSL4' is a different version, but I think it's still under ADSL family.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the rows with 'version' as 'adsl' are considered, not 'adsl2+' or others. Let me clarify: the claim mentions \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" which generally refers to the standard ADSL, so perhaps we should consider all variants of ADSL (including 2 and 2+), unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut in this case, since the claim doesn't specify a particular version, it's safer to include all rows under 'version' as 'adsl', 'adsl2', 'adsl2+', etc., as they are all part of the ADSL family.\n\nSo going back, with 12 entries, the median is 1.3 mbit/s, not 5.0. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells: each upstream rate cell in each row that contributes to the calculation. So for all rows, the 'upstream rate' column is relevant.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be every row with column name 'upstream rate'. The row indices are from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 rows), so each row index from 0 to 11, and column name 'upstream rate'.\n\nTherefore, the JSON answer should have \"answer\": \"FALSE\" and a list of all these cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
