Third row: College is Rutgers. Not UCLA.\n4. Fourth row: College is UCLA. This is the relevant player. His hometown is Las Vegas, NV.\n5. Fifth row: College is Indiana. Not UCLA.\n\nSo only the fourth row matches 'college' as UCLA. The hometown there is indeed Las Vegas, NV, which supports the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Shabazz Muhammad is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"Shabazz Muhammad attend UCLA and his hometown be Las Vegas, NV.\" So there are two parts here:\n\n1. Did Shabazz Muhammad attend UCLA?\n2. Is his hometown Las Vegas, NV?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by finding the row for Shabazz Muhammad. The rows are indexed from 0 to 4. Let me go through each player's name.\n\n- Row 0: Khem Birch\n- Row 1: Perry Ellis\n- Row 2: Myles Mack\n- Row 3: Shabazz Muhammad\n- Row 4: Cody Zeller\n\nSo, Shabazz Muhammad is in row index 3. Now, I need to check the relevant columns for each part of the claim.\n\nFor the first part about attending UCLA, the column 'college' should have this information. In row 3, under 'college', it says \"ucla\". That matches exactly with what's claimed, so that part is correct.\n\nNext, checking the hometown. The column 'hometown' in row 3 lists \"las vegas, nv\". The claim states \"Las Vegas, NV\", which is a slight variation in capitalization but refers to the same place. Since Las Vegas and las vegas are the same city with different casing, and NV is correct for Nevada, this part of the claim is also accurate.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are the 'college' column in row 3 and the 'hometown' column in the same row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that Shabazz Muhammad attended UCLA and is from Las Vegas, NV based on the table's information.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in HTML format and a claim about one of the players listed. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the claim: \"perry ellis go to wichita height high school, and attend kansa college.\" Okay, so this has two parts:\n\n1. Perry Ellis went to Wichita Heights High School.\n2. He attended a college named Kansa College.\n\nNow, I need to check each part against the table data provided. Let's look at the table structure. The columns are player, height, school, hometown, and college. There are five rows of data for different players.\n\nLooking through the rows, Perry Ellis is listed in the second row (row index 1). So his details are as follows:\n\n- Player: perry ellis\n- Height: 6 - 8\n- School: wichita heights high school\n- Hometown: wichita , ks\n- College: kansas\n\nSo for the first part of the claim, Perry Ellis did go to Wichita Heights High School. That's correct.\n\nThe second part says he attended Kansa college. But according to the table, his college is listed as \"kansas\". Wait a minute, that's not \"Kansa\" but \"Kansas\". So there might be a typo in the claim.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"kansa college\", while the table shows \"kansas\". Now, \"kansas\" could refer to the University of Kansas, which is commonly known as Kansas or KU. But the way it's written here is just \"kansas\".\n\nSo in the table, under the 'college' column for Perry Ellis, it says \"kansas\". So he attended the college named Kansas, not Kansa.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: one correct and one incorrect due to a possible typo. But since the colleges are listed as \"kansas\" without any indication of being an acronym or abbreviation, I think we have to take it literally.\n\nSo, in the claim, it's written as \"kansa college\". Since \"kansas\" is spelled differently, this might refer to a different institution, or perhaps it's just a typo. However, based on the data given, Perry Ellis attended \"kansas\" college, not \"kansa\".\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim isn't fully accurate as per the table. Hence, the entire claim isn't entirely true.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim says he went to Wichita Heights High School and attended Kansa College. From the table, both these points are addressed. The school is correct, but the college is slightly off in spelling.\n\nBut hold on, \"kansas\" is actually a common abbreviation for the University of Kansas. So maybe it's just an acceptable way to write it, considering that many people refer to the university as Kansas or KU.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the claim is using a shortened form and is still accurate. However, in the table, it's written exactly as \"kansas\", not \"kansa\". So \"Kansa\" isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim has a typo, intending to write \"Kansas College\" or \"University of Kansas\".\n\nGiven that, since the exact wording doesn't match, I think we have to consider it as incorrect because \"kansas\" and \"kansa\" are different spellings. Therefore, the second part is false.\n\nHence, the entire claim is FALSE because while Perry Ellis did attend Wichita Heights High School, he attended \"kansas\" college, not \"kansa\".\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The school column has \"wichita heights high school\", which matches the claim. The college column says \"kansas\". So in the claim, it's written as \"kansa college\", which doesn't match exactly.\n\nTherefore, even though the intention might be to refer to the University of Kansas, the table lists it as \"kansas\" without any indication that it's an abbreviation for something else. Therefore, since \"kansas\" and \"kansa\" are different, the claim is incorrect on that part.\n\nThus, the overall answer should be FALSE because one part of the claim doesn't align with the data.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that Cody Zeller's hometown is Washington, IN.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five players listed with details including their hometowns. Each row represents a player and includes columns like player name, height, school, hometown, and college.\n\nFirst, I need to locate Cody Zeller in the table. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see that the fifth row has \"cody zeller\" as the player's name. Now, the claim is about his hometown. So, I should look at the 'hometown' column for that specific row.\n\nIn the fifth row under the 'hometown' column, it says \"washington  , in\". This seems to indicate Washington, IN as his hometown. The claim exactly matches this information: \"cody zeller's hometown be washington, in\".\n\nWait, but I notice there are extra spaces after Washington and before IN. Does that matter? Probably not because when comparing the claim, it's about the content rather than whitespace issues.\n\nTherefore, since the hometown listed for Cody Zeller is indeed Washington, IN, the claim is accurate.\n\nTo identify the relevant cells for this verification, I need to note which cells were checked. The first step was finding Cody Zeller in the 'player' column of the fifth row (row index 4 if counting from 0). Then, checking his hometown in the same row under the 'hometown' column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n1. Row 4, Column 'player' to confirm it's Cody Zeller.\n2. Row 4, Column 'hometown' where the claim is verified.\n\nThis leads me to conclude that the answer should be TRUE with those two relevant cells specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cody Zeller's hometown is Washington, IN.

He is from Jersey City, NJ.\n\nI'll start by looking at the table to find the row corresponding to Shabazz Muhammad. Scanning through the player names, I see that he's in the fourth row (row index 3 if starting from 0). Let me check his height and hometown.\n\nLooking at the \"height\" column for Shabazz Muhammad, it says 6-6, not 6-11 as claimed.

The claim says, \"kansa college be get a player that attend st anthony high school.\" Hmm, okay, I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably correct any possible typos in the claim to understand it better. It seems like \"kansa\" might mean \"Kansas,\" which is a state and also has universities there. So maybe the intended meaning is that Kansas College (or perhaps University of Kansas) got a player from St. Anthony High School.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two things: \n1. Are any players listed as attending St. Anthony High School?\n2. Is one of those players going to a college in Kansas?\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Khem Birch attended Notre Dame Prep, not St. Anthony.\n- Row 1: Perry Ellis went to Wichita Heights High School. His college is listed as \"kansas.\" So, Perry is from Kansas but didn't attend St. Anthony.\n- Row 2: Myles Mack went to St. Anthony High School and his college is Rutgers, which isn't in Kansas.\n- Row 3: Shabazz Muhammad attended Bishop Gorman and goes to UCLA; not relevant here.\n- Row 4: Cody Zeller from Washington High School attends Indiana.\n\nSo, looking for someone who attended St. Anthony (which is only Myles Mack) but he's going to Rutgers, which isn't in Kansas. There's no player who both went to St. Anthony and a Kansas college.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the colleges. Let me check again:\n\n- Perry Ellis: \"kansas\" \u2014 that's correct.\n- Myles Mack: \"rutgers\"\n\nSo, since there's no overlap between St. Anthony attendees going to a Kansas school, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are where I found Myles Mack's high school (St. Anthony) and his college (Rutgers). Also, Perry Ellis is from Wichita Heights but went to KU, so those are relevant too.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kansas College obtained a player who attended St. Anthony High School.
