    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"asc diaraf lose to stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that asc diaraf lost to stade malien in a specific competition, which I assume is the African Cup of Champions Clubs (ACCC) in 1971.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between two teams with their aggregate scores and results from both legs of the match. The columns are \"team 1\", \"agg\" (aggregate score), \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\".\n\nI need to find if there's an entry where asc diaraf is team 1 or team 2, and stade malien is the opposing team. Then check the aggregate result to see who won.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien \u2013 This is the relevant match.\n- Rows 3 to 8 are other matches, but I can skip those since I found asc diaraf in row 2.\n\nIn row 2, team1 is asc diaraf and team2 is stade malien. The aggregate score is 3 - 4. So asc diaraf scored 3 goals, and stade malien scored 4 in total across both legs.\n\nThe claim states that asc diaraf lost to stade malien. Since 3 < 4, this means asc diaraf did lose the match.\n\nNow, I should check if the tournament mentioned is indeed the African Cup of Champions Clubs. The table doesn't specify the year or the competition's name directly. However, since the claim mentions 1971, and assuming this table pertains to that specific edition, it aligns with the context.\n\nSo, based on the data in row 2, asc diaraf lost to stade malien, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the young african score 2 points in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand what each column represents. The columns are team1, agg (aggregate), team2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row seems to represent a match between two teams, showing their scores in both legs and the aggregate result.\n\nNow, focusing on \"young africans\" as one of the teams. Looking through the table rows, I find that \"young africans\" are listed in the last row (row index 8). The 'agg' column shows they scored 2-0 against \"lavori publici.\" Both legs show 2-0 and 0-0 respectively.\n\nThe claim mentions scoring 2 points. In football (soccer), a goal is worth one point, so 2 goals would translate to 2 points. The 'agg' score of 2-0 indicates that young africans scored two goals in total across both legs. \n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table where \"young africans\" scored 2 points (goals) in their match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against the enugu ranger\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: team 1, agg (which stands for aggregate score), team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their scores in both legs and the overall aggregate.\n\nThe claim is about \"secteur 6\" losing by 1 against \"enugu ranger\". I'll need to find the relevant row where one of these teams is listed as team 1 or team 2.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n- Row 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n- Row 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9\n- Row 6: esp\u00e9rance vs al-ahly (benghazi)\n- Row 7: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers\n- Row 8: young africans vs lavori publici\n\nSo, row 7 has \"secteur 6\" as team 1 and \"enugu rangers\" as team 2. Wait, the claim says \"enugu ranger\", but in the table it's \"enugu rangers\". Hmm, that could be a typo or variation in naming. I'll proceed assuming they are the same team.\n\nNow, looking at row 7:\n\n- team 1: secteur 6\n- agg: 1 - 2\n- team 2: enugu rangers\n- 1st leg: 1 - 1\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 1\n\nThe aggregate score is 1-2, which means the total goals for secteur 6 are 1 and enugu rangers have 2. So, secteur 6 lost by a goal difference of 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the legs:\n\nFirst leg was 1-1 (so each scored once), second leg was 0-1. That means in aggregate, secteur 6 has 1+0=1 and enugu rangers have 1+1=2, so yes, they lost by one goal.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because secteur 6 did lose by a margin of 1 against enugu rangers (or ranger).\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index for this match is 7.\n- We need the 'agg' column to see the overall result and the team names in 'team 1' and 'team 2'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index: 7, column_name: \"team 1\" (to confirm it's secteur 6)\n- row_index: 7, column_name: \"team 2\" (to confirm it's enugu rangers)\n- row_index: 7, column_name: \"agg\" (to see the result)\n\nAlternatively, since 'agg' shows the overall score, that's sufficient to determine the loss. The team names are also necessary to ensure we're looking at the correct match.\n\nSo, compiling this information into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because secteur 6 lost by a margin of 1 goal against enugu rangers as shown in row 7 where the aggregate score is 1-2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for the row that involves both \"as porto novo\" and \"victoria club mokanda.\" Scanning through the table rows:\n\n- The first row is al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara.\n- Second: abaluhya united vs great olympics.\n- Third: asc diaraf vs stade malien.\n- Fourth: maseru united vs mmm tamatave.\n- Fifth: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda. This is the one I'm looking for.\n  \nSo, the relevant row is index 4 (since indexing starts at 0). Now, in that row, let's check the columns to see how they performed.\n\nLooking at \"agg\" which probably stands for aggregate score: it says \"0 - 3.\" That means as porto novo scored 0 goals, and victoria club mokanda scored 3. So, as porto novo didn't score any points in this match.\n\nAdditionally, the legs are shown in the \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\" columns. The first leg was \"0 - 1,\" and the second leg was \"0 - 2.\" Adding up both legs for as porto novo: 0 + 0 = 0 goals total. For their opponent, it's 1 + 2 = 3 goals.\n\nSo, the claim says they scored no points, which in football (soccer) terms, a goal is a point towards the score. Since they didn't score any goals in either leg or the aggregate, this would mean they got zero points from their scoring in this match against victoria club mokanda.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because as porto novo scored 0 points (goals) against them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"as porto novo\" didn't score any goals against \"victoria club mokanda.\" The relevant cells are in row index 4 for both \"team 1\" and \"agg.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the row that mentions canon yaound\u00e9. Scanning the 'team 1' and 'team 2' columns, I see that canon yaound\u00e9 is listed under team 1 in one of the rows. Let me note the details from that row.\n\nLooking at the relevant row, it's the sixth one (index starting from 0, so row_index 5). The data here shows:\n- team 1: canon yaound\u00e9\n- agg: 9 - 4\n- team 2: as solidarit\u00e9\n- 1st leg: 7 - 3\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 1\n\nNow, the claim is about the total points scored by canon yaound\u00e9 compared to their opponent. The 'agg' column likely stands for aggregate, which would be the combined score from both legs of the match.\n\nIn the 'agg' cell, it's written as \"9 - 4\". This means canon yaound\u00e9 scored 9 goals in total (from both legs) and their opponent, as solidarit\u00e9, scored 4. To find out how many more points canon yaound\u00e9 scored than their opponent, I subtract the opponent's score from canon's: 9 - 4 = 5.\n\nSo, canon yaound\u00e9 did indeed score 5 more goals (points) than their opponent. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo support this conclusion, the relevant cells are:\n- The 'agg' column in row 5, which shows the total scores.\n- Additionally, looking at each leg's scores can help verify that the aggregate is correct. The first leg was 7 - 3 and the second leg was 2 - 1, so adding those up gives canon yaound\u00e9 a total of 9 (7+2) and as solidarit\u00e9 with 4 (3+1). This cross-verification confirms the aggregate score.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by these cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the table represents.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: team 1, agg (which I think stands for aggregate), team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row seems to represent a match between two teams with their respective scores in the first and second legs, plus an aggregated result which might include penalties if needed.\n\nThe claim is about \"canon yaound\u00e9\" scoring zero points against their opponent. First, I need to locate canon yaound\u00e9 in the table. Scanning through the team 1 column, I see that canon yaound\u00e9 is listed as team 1 in one of the rows.\n\nLooking at that row:\n\n- Team 1: canon yaound\u00e9\n-_agg_: 9 - 4\n- Team 2: as solidarit\u00e9\n- 1st leg: 7 - 3\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 1\n\nWait, the aggregate score is 9-4. So in total, canon yaound\u00e9 scored 9 goals against as solidarit\u00e9. The claim says they scored zero points, which doesn't make sense because if they scored 9 goals, that would mean they definitely scored more than zero.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the table. Perhaps \"agg\" refers to aggregate points or something else? But in football (soccer), points are usually based on wins, draws, losses, but the scores here look like goal counts, not points. However, the claim is about points, so perhaps it's referring to the match outcome in terms of points rather than goals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the claim: \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent.\" If we interpret this as whether they scored any points in the match, which in football usually means 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, etc., but that doesn't fit here because the scores are goals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about scoring zero goals. But the aggregate shows canon yaound\u00e9 with 9 goals and their opponent with 4. So they definitely scored more than zero goals.\n\nWait another thought: maybe \"points\" refers to points in a different context, like penalty shootout points? Looking at the first row, the agg is shown as 2-2 (5-4 pen), indicating that after extra time or something, it went into penalties where each team got some points. But for canon yaound\u00e9's row, there's no mention of pens in their aggregate score. Their agg is just 9-4.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is about them scoring zero goals? If so, then since they scored 9 goals total, that would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"points\" as something else. Maybe it's about match points in a league context, but the table doesn't provide that information\u2014it only shows the scores of each leg and the aggregate.\n\nWait, let me go back to the table structure. The columns are team 1, agg (aggregate), team 2, 1st leg, 2nd leg. So for canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9:\n\n- In the first leg, canon yaound\u00e9 scored 7 goals and conceded 3.\n- In the second leg, they scored 2 and conceded 1.\n- The aggregate is 9 (7+2) -4 (3+1).\n\nSo overall, they won both legs and the aggregate. Therefore, in terms of match outcomes, they probably got 3 points for each win, but that's not explicitly stated here.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions \"score zero point against their opponent.\" If \"points\" here refers to goals, then scoring zero would mean they didn't score any goals. But clearly, canon yaound\u00e9 scored 9 goals in total, so this can't be true.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about points as in match result points (3 for a win), but since the claim is about \"against their opponent,\" perhaps it's about whether they lost both legs and thus got zero points. But no, canon yaound\u00e9 won both legs: 7-3 and 2-1.\n\nWait another angle: maybe the user made a typo and meant to say \"scored zero goals.\" But even then, the claim says \"points,\" which is confusing because goals are not points in soccer. Points are awarded based on match outcomes.\n\nSo, given all this, I think the claim is false because canon yaound\u00e9 scored multiple goals (9 in total) against their opponent, so they definitely didn't score zero points if that refers to goals or didn't lose both legs to get zero points.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero points against their opponent\" is false. Based on the table, canon yaound\u00e9 scored a total of 9 goals across both legs, indicating they did not score zero points if referring to goals or did not lose both matches to get zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"is_claim_true\": false,\n    \"explanation\": \"Canon Yaound\u00e9 scored a total of 9 goals against their opponent in the aggregate, so they did not score zero points.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
