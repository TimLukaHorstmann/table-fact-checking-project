    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify this claim about a fighter's matches. The claim says the fighter won against Paul Weremecki with a TKO using head kick and punches, and also won against Gary Padilla via a split decision.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has multiple rows, each representing a match result. Let me go through them one by one to find the relevant matches.\n\nStarting from the top, there's a win against Ricardo Arona with a KO, then another win against Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira also with a KO. Then a loss against Glover Teixeira via KO. Next, I see a win against Paul Weremecki in row 15 (since counting starts at 0). The result is 'win', method is 'tko (head kick and punches)'. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nContinuing down, there's another win against Gary Padilla in row 16. It says 'win' with a decision split, which is exactly what the second part of the claim states.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table. The relevant rows are 15 and 16, specifically looking at the 'Result', 'Opponent', and 'Method' columns for each to confirm the wins and methods.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by two entries in the table where the fighter won against Paul Weremecki with a TKO and Gary Padilla via split decision.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where I need to verify a claim about some fights based on the provided table data. The user has given me a table with multiple rows and columns, each containing information about different fights. My task is to check if the claim made by the user is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"the fight against opponent glover teixeira be a loss by method ko (punches), but the fight against jan nortje be a win with method tko (punches)\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly this claim is saying. It's stating two things:\n1. The fight against Glover Teixeira resulted in a loss via KO (punches).\n2. The fight against Jan Nortje was a win via TKO (punches).\n\nI'll need to check each of these points against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents a different fight with details like opponent, result (win/loss), method, event, round, time, and location. The relevant columns here are \"Opponent,\" \"Result,\" and \"Method.\"\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: checking if the fight against Glover Teixeira was a loss by KO (punches). I'll scan through each row to find where the Opponent is Glover Teixeira.\n\nLooking at row index 12, I see the opponent is Glover Teixeira. The result for that fight is \"loss,\" and the method is listed as \"ko (punches)\". This matches exactly what the claim states about this fight.\n\nNow moving to the second part: checking if the fight against Jan Nortje was a win via TKO (punches). I'll look through the rows again for the opponent named Jan Nortje. \n\nUpon reviewing, I find that row index 10 lists the opponent as Jan Nortje. The result here is \"win,\" and the method is specified as \"tko (punches)\". This also aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table data, there's no discrepancy between what's stated and what's shown.

It's claiming that there are two fights in the table where the opponents were Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander, and in both cases, the result was a loss by TKO via punches.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll go through each row to find any mentions of these opponents and check if the results match the claim. \n\nStarting from the top:\n1.

Let's go row by row.\n\nStarting from the top, looking for \"Gary Padilla\" as an opponent. Hmm, scanning down, I don't see Gary Padilla in any of the opponent names. Wait, let me check again. No, it seems he isn't listed here. The opponents mentioned are people like Ricardo Arona, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, Glover Teixeira, etc., but not Gary Padilla.\n\nNow, checking for Paul Weremecki. Scanning through the opponents, I see a fight against Paul Weremecki in row 15 (if we start counting from 0, it's actually row 14 because rows go from 0 to 23). The venue listed there is Portland, Oregon, United States. So that's not Mississauga, Ontario, Canada as the claim suggests.\n\nWait a second, did I miss Gary Padilla somewhere else? Let me look again. No, he's not in the table at all. That means the first part of the claim about fighting Gary Padilla in Saitama, Japan is incorrect because there's no such fight recorded here.\n\nSimilarly, Paul Weremecki's fight was indeed in Portland, Oregon, not Mississauga, Ontario. Therefore, both parts of the claim are false based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two fights took place in specific locations: one against Gary Padilla in Saitama, Japan, and another against Paul Weremecki in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Checking the table:\n\n1. There is no entry for a fight with Gary Padilla.\n2. The fight with Paul Weremecki was in Portland, Oregon, USA, not Mississauga.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are unsupported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the fighter's matches is true based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the fighter have match in country inside of the united state include saitama  , japan   , birmingham  , england  , and brisbane  , australia\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems to be claiming that the fighter has had matches in several countries within the United States, including specific locations like Saitama, Japan; Birmingham, England; and Brisbane, Australia.\n\nWait, that doesn't quite make sense because Saitama is a city in Japan, Birmingham is in England, and Brisbane is in Australia. So the claim might actually be listing multiple countries outside of the US where the fighter has had matches. But the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"inside of the united state include...\", which would imply that those places are within the United States, but they're not.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like opponent, result, event name, round, time, and location. The locations listed in the 'Location' column for various matches include Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), Brisbane (Australia), Las Vegas (Nevada, US), Lemoore (California, US), San Diego (California, US), Portland (Oregon, US), etc.\n\nThe claim mentions that the fighter has matches inside the United States including those specific countries. But Saitama, Japan; Birmingham, England; and Brisbane, Australia are not within the United States. So if the claim is saying these locations are within the US, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is listing multiple locations where the fighter has fought, including those inside the US and other countries. But the way it's phrased says \"inside of the united state include...\", which suggests that those places (Saitama, etc.) are within the US, which isn't true.\n\nSo looking at the table:\n\n- Saitama is in Japan: row 23\n- Birmingham is in England: row 19\n- Brisbane is in Australia: row 25\n\nThese locations are outside the US. Therefore, if the claim says that these are inside the US, it's false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It could be saying that the fighter has matches within the United States and also in those other countries. In that case, looking at the table:\n\nThe fighter has matches in multiple locations both within the US (like Las Vegas, Lemoore, San Diego) and outside (Saitama, Birmingham, Brisbane). So if the claim is saying the fighter has matches inside the US including these international locations, which are actually not in the US, then it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is listing all the countries where he fought, both within and outside the US. But the wording says \"inside of the united state include...\", so that would mean those places are inside the US, which they're not.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Saitama, Birmingham, and Brisbane are not within the United States.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
