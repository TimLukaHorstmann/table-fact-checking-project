    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what I need to check. There are two main parts here:\n\n1. Is there a women's doubles team consisting of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey?\n2. Did Jamie Van Hooijdonk compete in men's singles during the same season?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2000 to 2010. I need to find a row where both these conditions are met.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with 2009: \n\n- Men's singles is Jamie Van Hooijdonk.\n- Women's doubles in that year (2009) has Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvery. Wait, the name is spelled \"Caroline Harvery\" here, not \"Carolina Harvey.\" That might be a typo or just different spelling.\n\nSo, the women's doubles team in 2009 is Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvery. Since the claim mentions \"Carolina Harvey,\" I think that's close enough considering possible typos in names. \n\nTherefore, in 2009, both conditions are satisfied: Jamie Van Hooijdonk is in men's singles, and the women's doubles team includes Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvery (which I assume refers to the same person as Carolina Harvey). \n\nI don't see any other rows where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is listed for men's singles. So this must be the only season that fits both conditions.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the women's doubles team, Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey compete in the same year as when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this carefully. So there are two main parts here:\n\n1. Identify the year(s) that Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey were part of the women's doubles team.\n2. Find out if Jamie Van Hooijdonk was competing in men's singles in any of those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season from 2000 to 2010. I'll need to go through each year and check both columns: \"womens doubles\" and \"mens singles\".\n\nStarting with the women's doubles column:\n- Let's scan each year's entry in the \"womens doubles\" column.\n- For example, in 2003, it says \"jo muggeridge felicity gallup\". Not our team.\n- In 2009: \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\". That's the pair we're looking for. So they competed in 2009.\n\nNow, checking the men's singles column for 2009:\n- The entry is \"jamie van hooijdonk\". Perfect, that's exactly who the claim mentions.\n\nSo both events happened in the same year, which is 2009. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm capturing the relevant cells correctly. For Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey, it's row index 9 (since counting starts at 0) under \"womens doubles\". Jamie Van Hooijdonk is in the same row, but under \"mens singles\".\n\nThat should cover all necessary checks without missing anything.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both events occurred in the same year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"there be zero woman's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The claim states that there are no women's doubles teams competing when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in any category (likely men's singles). So, my task is to check if during the years Jamie Van Hooijdonk was a competitor, the women's doubles category had entries.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for \"season,\" \"mens singles,\" \"womens singles,\" \"mens doubles,\" \"womens doubles,\" and \"mixed doubles.\" The relevant information is in the \"womens doubles\" column when Jamie Van Hooijdonk was a competitor in any category.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Jamie Van Hooijdonk appears. Scanning down the \"mens singles\" column, I notice that in 2009, Jamie Van Hooijdonk is listed as the men's singles champion. Now, I need to check what's in the \"womens doubles\" column for that same row (2009 season).\n\nIn the 2009 row under \"womens doubles,\" it says \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" This indicates that there were indeed women's doubles teams competing that year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there was at least one women's doubles team when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed.\n\nSo, the relevant cell to consider is row index 9 (assuming rows are zero-indexed) and column \"womens doubles.\" This shows that women's doubles teams were present during that season, contradicting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there should be no women's doubles teams when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes. Checking the table, in the 2009 row where he is listed, the \"womens doubles\" column shows participants.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
