The claim states: \"the title of the episode that aired on March 31, 2008 be, new york : secret societies\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the row where the original airdate is March 31, 2008. Scanning the 'original airdate' column:\n\n- Row 8 (index starting from 0): march 31  , 2008\nThat's the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, I check the corresponding episode title for that row. In row 8, under 'episode title', it says \"new york  : secret societies\". \n\nComparing this to the claim: The claim says \"new york : secret societies\" and the table has exactly that. There's a space after the colon in both cases, so no discrepancy there.\n\nTherefore, since the episode title matches on the specified airdate, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 8 for 'original airdate'\n- Row index 8 for 'episode title'\n\nSo, I should structure my answer with these details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4, 2008\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. The rows are numbered from 15 to 27 in production numbers and 201 to 213 in episode numbers.\n\nThe claim mentions episode number 202. I'll scan the \"episode no\" column to find where it's 202. Looking at each row, when production number is 16, the episode number is 202. That's in row index 1 (since counting starts from 0; rows are 0-12). \n\nNext, I need to check the original airdate for that episode. In the same row where episode no is 202, the original airdate is \"february 4  , 2008\". The claim says it aired on February 4, 2008. So comparing the dates: they match exactly. \n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. The episode number and airdate align with what's given in row index 1.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are from that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the title of the episode that aired in january 28, 2008 be vietnam host by don wildman.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the episode that aired on January 28, 2008. Scanning through the table, row 0 has the original airdate as \"january 28 , 2008\". So that's the relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check the title of this episode. In row 0, under 'episode title', it says \"underground apocalypse\", not \"vietnam\". That seems incorrect based on the claim.\n\nThe host is mentioned as \"don wildman\" in row 0, which matches the claim. However, since the episode title doesn't match, the main point of the claim is wrong. The correct title for that date isn't Vietnam; that's actually another episode, specifically row 1 with production number 16.\n\nSo, while some parts (like the host) are correct, the key part about the title being \"vietnam\" on that specific airdate isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the episode title as \"Vietnam\" for January 28, 2008. The actual title is \"Underground Apocalypse\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find where episode number 213 is mentioned. Scanning the rows under the \"episode no\" column, I see that each row has a different number: starting from 201 up to 213 in the last row. So, episode 213 is in the last row of the table.\n\nNext, I need to check the airdate for that episode. The relevant columns here are \"episode no\" and \"original airdate.\" For episode number 213, which is in row index 12 (since counting starts at 0), the original airdate is listed as May 5, 2008. \n\nWait a minute, the claim says it aired on January 28, 2008. That doesn't match. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any rows. Looking back, the first row (index 0) has episode number 201 with an airdate of January 28, 2008. So that's a different episode entirely.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because episode 213 aired much later on May 5, not in January.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
