    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the away team for 3 may 1980 be south melbourne, st kilda, footscray, essendon, carlton, and geelong.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's listing several teams as away teams on May 3, 1980. My task is to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has a column labeled \"away team.\" Each row represents a game played on that date, and in each row, there's an entry for both home and away teams. The date mentioned in all rows is indeed 3 may 1980, so they're all relevant to the claim.\n\nNow, let's go through each of the teams listed in the claim:\n\n1. **South Melbourne**: Checking the table, I see a row where the away team is \"south melbourne.\" That's the first row, so that checks out.\n\n2. **St Kilda**: Next, looking for st kilda as an away team. The second row has \"st kilda\" listed as the away team. So, that's correct too.\n\n3. **Footscray**: Moving on to footscray. I check each row and find that in the third row, the away team is footscray. That matches.\n\n4. **Essendon**: The claim mentions essendon as an away team. Looking through the rows, the fourth row has \"essendon\" as the away team. So, yes, that's accurate.\n\n5. **Carlton**: Next up is carlton. I scan the table and find that in the fifth row, the away team is listed as carlton. That fits the claim.\n\n6. **Geelong**: Finally, checking for geelong. The sixth row shows \"geelong\" as the away team, so that's correct as well.\n\nSince all six teams listed in the claim are indeed the away teams on 3 may 1980 according to the table, each corresponding to a different row, the claim is fully supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The date is 3 May 1980. So that's correct.\n\nSecond row: Collingwood is the home team, date same as claim. Correct again.\n\nThird row: Hawthorn is the home team. Date matches.

Then, I'll compare their respective crowd numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, and crowd count. The rows are indexed from 0 to 5.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the venues are mentioned. \n\nRow 1: Venue is Victoria Park, and the crowd is 29094.\nRow 2: Venue is Princes Park (I assume this is Prince Park as a typo), with a crowd of 11958.\n\nSo, comparing these two rows:\n- Victoria Park has a crowd of 29094\n- Princes Park has a crowd of 11958\n\nClearly, 29094 is larger than 11958. Therefore, the claim that the crowd at Victoria Park was larger than at Prince Park is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for this comparison:\n- For Victoria Park: row index 1, column \"crowd\"\n- For Princes Park: row index 2, column \"crowd\"\n\nSo, I'll list these two cells as the relevant ones.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at Victoria Park is larger than at Prince Park.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states that \"the venue on 3 may 1980 be mcg, victoria park, prince park, junction oval, arden street oval, and vfl park.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure to understand which columns are relevant. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nThe claim is about the venues on a specific date, 3 May 1980. So I should focus on the \"venue\" column and the \"date\" column to verify this. Each row represents a game played on that day, so all rows have the same date: 3 may 1980.\n\nNow, let me go through each row one by one and check the venue for that game.\n\nRow 0: The home team is Melbourne at the mcg. So venue is mcg.\nRow 1: Collingwood vs St Kilda at victoria park. Venue is victoria park.\nRow 2: Hawthorn vs Footscray at princes park. Hmm, the claim says prince park, but in the table it's written as princes park. That might be a typo or maybe they are the same place? I'll note that discrepancy.\nRow 3: Fitzroy vs Essendon at junction oval. So venue is junction oval.\nRow 4: North Melbourne vs Carlton at arden street oval. Venue is arden street oval.\nRow 5: Richmond vs Geelong at vfl park. Venue is vfl park.\n\nLooking back at the claim, the venues listed are mcg, victoria park, prince park, junction oval, arden street oval, and vfl park. Comparing to what I found in each row:\n\n- mcg matches.\n- victoria park matches.\n- princes park vs prince park: Close but not exactly the same. Is this a problem? Maybe it's a typo. The claim might have meant princes park as written in the table.\n- junction oval matches.\n- arden street oval matches.\n- vfl park matches.\n\nWait, so in row 2, the venue is princes park, but the claim says prince park. That's one less 's' and missing an 'e'. So are these two considered the same? If they refer to the same place, then it's acceptable. Otherwise, if they're different venues, that would make the claim incorrect.\n\nBut given that the rest of the venues match exactly except for this minor difference, I might have to consider whether prince park and princes park are the same. Alternatively, maybe the claim has a typo, but since it's about the exact wording, perhaps it should be considered as different.\n\nSo in row 2, the venue is princes park, which doesn't exactly match prince park. Therefore, the claim lists venues that include prince park, but in reality, the correct name is princes park.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, does that make the entire claim false? Because one of the venues in the claim isn't actually present in the table. The table has princes park, but the claim says prince park. So it's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, since not all listed venues in the claim are correctly represented in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists \"prince park\" as one of the venues, but the table shows \"princes park.\" Since these don't match exactly, and all other venues do, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the crowd at vfl park on 3 may 1980 be more than 2 time the size of the crowd at prince park that same day.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant rows in the table where the venues are VFL Park and Prince Park. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first row is at the MCG, so not relevant.\n- The second row is Victoria Park; also not relevant.\n- The third row is Princes Park (note the 's'), which I believe is the same as Prince Park mentioned in the claim.\n- The fifth row is Arden Street Oval.\n- The sixth row is VFL Park.\n\nSo, the rows we need are row 2 and row 5. Wait, no\u2014the table's rows are from index 0 to 5. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, each <tr> in the tbody corresponds to a row starting at index 0. \n\n- Row 0: MCG\n- Row 1: Victoria Park\n- Row 2: Princes Park (venue)\n- Row 3: Junction Oval\n- Row 4: Arden Street Oval\n- Row 5: VFL Park\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row 2 (Princes Park) and row 5 (VFL Park). The claim mentions Prince Park, so I assume that's a typo for Princes Park.\n\nNow, checking the crowd numbers:\n\nAt row 2 (Princes Park), the crowd is 11958.\nAt row 5 (VFL Park), the crowd is 47265.\n\nThe claim says VFL Park's crowd was more than twice that of Prince Park. So let's calculate twice the Princes Park crowd: 11958 * 2 = 23916. Is 47265 more than 23916? Yes, it is. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait a second\u2014did I mix up the rows? Let me double-check the row indices. The first data row (row 0) is Melbourne vs South Melbourne at MCG. Then row 1: Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park. Row 2: Hawthorn vs Footscray at Princes Park, crowd 11958. Row 3: Fitzroy vs Essendon at Junction Oval. Row 4: North Melbourne vs Carlton at Arden Street Oval. Row 5: Richmond vs Geelong at VFL Park, crowd 47265.\n\nSo yes, the relevant cells are row 2 (Princes Park) and row 5 (VFL Park). The claim is about whether VFL's crowd was more than twice that of Prince Park.

So, according to the claim, these six teams were home teams on that date.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns are \"home team\" and \"date\". Each row represents a match with details including home team, away team, and the date of the game.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check the home teams and their corresponding dates:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is melbourne, date is 3 may 1980.\n2. **Row 1**: Home team is collingwood, date is 3 may 1980.\n3. **Row 2**: Home team is hawthorn, date is 3 may 1980.\n4. **Row 3**: Home team is fitzroy, date is 3 may 1980.\n5. **Row 4**: Home team is north melbourne, date is 3 may 1980.\n6. **Row 5**: Home team is richmond, date is 3 may 1980.\n\nNow, comparing these home teams with the claim:\n\n- The claim lists south melbourne, st kilda, footscray, essendon, carlton, and geelong as home teams on that date.\n- From the table, none of these teams are listed under the \"home team\" column for any row.

Each row represents a game on 3 May 1980 with different teams.\n\nThe claim states that the away teams for 3 May 1980 are melbourne, collingwood, hawthorn, fitzroy, north melbourne, and richmond. I need to check each of these teams against the 'away team' column in the table rows.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Home team is melbourne, away team is south melbourne.\nSo, for this row, the away team is south melbourne, not melbourne. So melbourne isn't an away team here.\n\nRow 1: Home team is collingwood, away team is st kilda. Again, collingwood is home, so they aren't an away team in their own game.\n\nRow 2: Home team is hawthorn, away team is footscray. So hawthorn isn't the away team here either; instead, it's footscray.\n\nRow 3: Home team is fitzroy, away team is essendon. Fitzroy isn't the away team in their own game.\n\nRow 4: Home team is north melbourne, away team is carlton.

Instead, these are all home teams in their respective rows.\n\nSo according to this table, on 3 May 1980, melbourne was the home team against south melbourne, collingwood was home vs st kilda, and so on.

Let's scan through each row:\n\n1. The first row has venue 'mcg' \u2013 not relevant.\n2. The second row has venue 'victoria park'. So this is one of our targets. The crowd here is 29094.\n3. The third row has venue 'princes park' (note the different spelling). Wait, the claim mentions 'prince park', but in the table it's 'princes park'. I should check if this is a typo or intentional. Since the names are slightly different, maybe they refer to the same place? But for now, I'll assume that 'victoria park' and 'princes park' are two separate venues as per their names.\n\nLooking further:\n- Are there other rows with these venues? No, each venue appears only once in this table.\n\nNow, compare the crowds. Victoria Park has 29094, Princes Park has 11958. Wait a minute, that's actually lower than Victoria Park. So if the claim is that the crowd at Victoria Park was smaller than Prince Park, but according to the numbers, it's the opposite.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The row for Victoria Park (second row) has a crowd of 29094, and Princes Park (third row) has 11958. So 29094 is larger than 11958. Therefore, the claim that the crowd at Victoria Park was smaller is FALSE.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\". The relevant cells are the 'crowd' column for both venues.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at Victoria Park is smaller than at Prince Park. From the table, Victoria Park's crowd is 29094 and Princes Park's is 11958. Since 29094 > 11958, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the only venue on 3 may 1980 be victoria park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim is about the venues on a specific date, 3 May 1980. So I need to check all the rows where the date is 3 May 1980 and see what venues are listed.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row has the venue as mcg.\n2. The second row's venue is victoria park.\n3. The third row's venue is princes park.\n4. The fourth row is junction oval.\n5. The fifth row is arden street oval.\n6. The sixth row is vfl park.\n\nWait, all of these rows have the date 3 May 1980 because each row in the table has that date as per the last column. So I need to check if any venues other than victoria park are present on this date.\n\nFrom the list above, I see multiple venues: mcg, victoria park, princes park, junction oval, arden street oval, vfl park. Clearly, there's more than just victoria park. For example, mcg is also a venue on that date.\n\nSo the claim says that the only venue was victoria park, but from the table, that's not true because other venues were used as well. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key columns here are 'venue' and 'date'. For each row where the date is 3 May 1980, we check the venue. All rows have that date, so I'll list each row's venue column as relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0: venue\n- Row 1: venue\n- Row 2: venue\n- Row 3: venue\n- Row 4: venue\n- Row 5: venue\n\nThis helps confirm that multiple venues were used on that date, contradicting the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various matches from May 3, 1980. The claim is about the crowd sizes at two venues: VFL Park and Prince Park on that day. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to find the rows where the venue is VFL Park and Prince Park. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 5 has \"vfl park\" as the venue. The crowd there was 47265.\n- I'm looking for a row with \"princes park\". Scanning through each row, I see that row 2 has \"princes park\" as the venue, and the crowd number is 11958.\n\nNow, the claim says the crowd at VFL Park was less than half the size of the crowd at Prince Park. Wait, hold on\u2014that doesn't seem right because 47k is way more than 11k. Let me double-check which venue had which crowd. \n\nRow 2 (Prince Park) has a smaller crowd (11958), and row 5 (VFL Park) has a larger crowd (47265). So, the claim is that VFL's crowd was less than half of Prince Park's. That would mean 47k < 0.5 * 11958? Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because 0.5*11958 is about 5979, and 47k is much bigger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again: \"the crowd at VFL park on 3 may 1980 be less than half the size of the crowd at Prince Park that same day.\" So, VFL Park's crowd should be < 50% of Prince Park's.\n\nBut according to the numbers, VFL Park had a much larger crowd. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from rows where the venues are VFL Park and Princes Park. Checking these shows that VFL Park had a significantly larger crowd than Princes Park on May 3, 1980.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
