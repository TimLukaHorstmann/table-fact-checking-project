    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the vfl play at victoria park on 11 may 1957\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n- The event in question is a VFL game.\n- It's supposed to be played at Victoria Park.\n- The date of the game is May 11, 1957.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that it lists various games with details like home team, away team, venue, and date. So, I should check each row for these elements.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0:\n- Home Team: Hawthorn\n- Away Team: Melbourne\n- Venue: Glenferrie Oval\n- Date: 11 May 1957\n\nThis game is at Glenferrie Oval, not Victoria Park. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home Team: Essendon\n- Away Team: Footscray\n- Venue: Windy Hill\n- Date: 11 May 1957\n\nVenue here is Windy Hill. Not the one we're looking for.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home Team: Collingwood\n- Away Team: South Melbourne\n- Venue: Victoria Park\n- Date: 11 May 1957\n\nThis row matches both the venue (Victoria Park) and the date (11 May 1957). So this is a hit.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home Team: Carlton\n- Away Team: Geelong\n- Venue: Princes Park\n- Date: 11 May 1957\n\nPrinces Park is different from Victoria Park, so not relevant here.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home Team: St Kilda\n- Away Team: North Melbourne\n- Venue: Junction Oval\n- Date: 11 May 1957\n\nJunction Oval doesn't match our target venue.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home Team: Richmond\n- Away Team: Fitzroy\n- Venue: Punt Road Oval\n- Date: 11 May 1957\n\nPunt Road Oval is different from Victoria Park as well.\n\nSo, the only relevant row is Row 2, which shows that Collingwood played South Melbourne at Victoria Park on May 11, 1957. This confirms the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Venue in Row 2\n- Date in Row 2\n\nThis way, both conditions (venue and date) are satisfied.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"south melbourne play as the away team on 11th day of may 1957.\" So, I'm looking for a row in the table where South Melbourne is listed under the 'away team' column and the date is May 11, 1957.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows of data for different matches on the same day, May 11, 1957.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if South Melbourne is listed as the away team:\n\n1. First row: Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Melbourne. Date is correct but away team isn't South Melbourne.\n2. Second row: Home team Essendon vs Away team Footscray. Again, not South Melbourne.\n3. Third row: Home team Collingwood vs Away team South Melbourne. Here it is! The date matches as May 11, 1957. So this row has the information we need.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs Geelong. Doesn't match.\n5. Fifth row: St Kilda vs North Melbourne. Not relevant here.\n6. Sixth row: Richmond vs Fitzroy. Again, not South Melbourne.\n\nSo, I found that in row index 2 (since counting starts at 0), under the 'away team' column, South Melbourne is listed as playing on May 11, 1957. This means the claim is accurate because it's directly supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row 2, column 'away team'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the home team be essendon and their opponent score be 4.14 (38)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately. The claim has two main parts: \n\n1. The home team is Essendon.\n2. Their opponent's score is 4.14 (38).\n\nI need to check both conditions in the table and see if they hold true for any row.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that there are six rows, each representing a match on May 11, 1957. Each row has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet's check each row one by one to see if Essendon is the home team and their opponent (away team) has a score of 4.14 (38).\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n- Home team: Hawthorn\nNot Essendon, so I can skip this row.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home team: Essendon\nYes, that's the first condition. Now, who is their opponent? The away team is Footscray. What's the away team score? It says 4.14 (38). That exactly matches the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are met in this row. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll check the other rows as well.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: Collingwood\nNot Essendon, so no need to look further here.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home team: Carlton\nAgain, not Essendon.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home team: St Kilda\nStill not Essendon.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home team: Richmond\nNope, not Essendon either.\n\nSo the only row where Essendon is the home team is Row 1. In that same row, their opponent's score is indeed 4.14 (38). \n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are satisfied in this row. The relevant cells would be the \"home team\" and \"away team score\" columns for row index 1.\n\nI think that's all I need to check.

I need to determine whether the claim \"collingwood play as the away team on 11 may 1957\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows in the table body.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: Collingwood as an away team and the date being 11 May 1957. I need to check both conditions in each row.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Melbourne. The date is 11 May 1957. So, Collingwood isn't involved here.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team is Essendon, away team is Footscray. Again, Collingwood isn't mentioned. Date is the same as before.\n\nThird row:\n- Here, the home team is Collingwood, and the away team is South Melbourne. The date is 11 May 1957. This means Collingwood is playing at home, not away. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home team is Carlton, away team is Geelong. Date matches, but no mention of Collingwood.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home team is St Kilda, away team is North Melbourne. Again, date matches but no Collingwood involved.\n\nSixth row:\n- Home team is Richmond, away team is Fitzroy. The date is still 11 May 1957, and Collingwood isn't present here either.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, I notice that Collingwood appears only once as the home team on 11 May 1957 against South Melbourne. There's no instance where Collingwood is listed as the away team on that date in this table. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"collingwood play as the away team on 11 may 1957\" isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood was the away team on a specific date. However, examining each row shows Collingwood only appeared once as the home team. Thus, there's no support for the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. I'll need to carefully check each part of the claim against the information in the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: \"essendon's opponent score be 13.11 (89) on 11 may 1967 at prince park\". Hmm, okay, so let me break this down into its components to verify each part against the table.\n\nThe claim has three main pieces of information:\n1. The team in question is Essendon.\n2. Their opponent's score was 13.11 (89).\n3. The date of the match was May 11, 1967, and it took place at Prince Park.\n\nNow, I'll look into the table to see if these details align.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that there are several rows, each representing a different match on the same day: May 11, 1957. Wait, that's interesting because the claim mentions 1967, which is ten years later. That immediately stands out as a potential discrepancy. Let me check if any of the matches in the table took place at Prince Park and involve Essendon.\n\nIn the fourth row (index starting from 0), I see:\n- Home team: Carlton\n- Away team: Geelong\n- Venue: Princes park\n- Date: 11 may 1957\n\nWait, that's a different date\u2014May 1957, not 1967. Also, the home team here is Carlton, not Essendon. So this row doesn't directly pertain to Essendon as the home or away team.\n\nLooking at the second row (index 1):\n- Home team: Essendon\n- Away team: Footscray\n- Venue: Windy Hill\n- Date: 11 may 1957\n\nHere, Essendon is the home team. Their opponent's score was 4.14 (38). The claim states that Essendon's opponent scored 13.11 (89), which doesn't match.\n\nSo in this table, there's no entry for Essendon on May 11, 1967. All entries are from 1957, and the only mention of Prince Park is with Carlton vs Geelong on that date, not involving Essendon.\n\nTherefore, each part of the claim doesn't align with the data in the table:\n- The opponent score (13.11) isn't found for Essendon's match.\n- The venue (Prince Park) isn't associated with Essendon in any row.\n- The date is 1967, but all matches are from 1957.\n\nThus, the claim doesn't have support from the table. I should also note that the relevant cells checked were those related to Essendon's opponent score, venue, and date where applicable.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on May 11, 1967, at Prince Park, Essendon's opponent scored 13.11 (89). Checking the table:\n- The only match involving Essendon is in row 1: they played Footscray at Windy Hill on May 11, 1957. Footscray's score was 4.14 (38), not matching.\n- No match at Prince Park involves Essendon; the venue is listed for Carlton vs Geelong in row 3 on May 11, 1957.\n\nThe claim's date and details don't match any entries in the table. Hence, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
