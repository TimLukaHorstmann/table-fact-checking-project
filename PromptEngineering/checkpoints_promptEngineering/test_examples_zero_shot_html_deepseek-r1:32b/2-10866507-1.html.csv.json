    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the away team for both 14 july 2007 and on 20 july 2007 be perth glory\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has several columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. Each row represents a match with details about that game.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: 14 July 2007 and 20 July 2007. For each of these dates, I need to check if the away team is Perth Glory.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 14 July 2007 (row index 0), the home team is Newcastle Jets, and the away team is Perth Glory. The score is 0-1 in favor of Perth Glory. So, yes, on this date, Perth Glory was indeed the away team.\n\n- Next, for 20 July 2007 (row index 1), the home team is Adelaide United, and again, the away team is Perth Glory. The score here was a draw at 1-1. This also confirms that Perth Glory was the away team on this date.\n\nBoth checks align with the claim. Therefore, the claim holds true because in both specified dates, Perth Glory was the away team. \n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else in the claim. It doesn't mention any other teams or details, so focusing solely on the away team for these two dates suffices.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Perth Glory be the away team on 4 August 2007 and on 12 August 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The key points here are:\n\n1. On 4 August 2007, Perth Glory was an away team.\n2. On 12 August 2007, Perth Glory was also an away team.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has columns for round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. Each row represents a match with details about that particular game.\n\nI'll go through each relevant date one by one.\n\nStarting with 4 August 2007:\n- I scan the 'date' column to find \"4 august 2007\". That's in the fourth row (index 3, since indexing starts at 0). In this row, under the 'away team' column, it says \"Perth Glory.\" So, on that date, Perth Glory was indeed the away team.\n\nNext, for 12 August 2007:\n- Again, I look for the date in the 'date' column. It's found in the fifth row (index 4). In this case, the 'away team' is also \"Perth Glory.\" So, on this later date as well, they were the away team.\n\nBoth instances check out. There are no discrepancies in the data provided. Therefore, the claim that Perth Glory was the away team on both specified dates is supported by the table.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for each part of the claim:\n- For 4 August 2007: Row index 3, columns 'date' and 'away team'.\n- For 12 August 2007: Row index 4, columns 'date' and 'away team'.\n\nEach of these cells directly relates to verifying the parts of the claim. Thus, they are all relevant in confirming the truthfulness of the statement.\n\nSince both dates align with Perth Glory being the away team as per the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the crowd on 4 august 2007 at bluetongue central coast stadium be larger than the crowd on 20 july 2007 at hindmarsh stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. It's comparing the crowd sizes on two different dates and stadiums.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. \n\nI need to find the rows that correspond to August 4th, 2007, and July 20th, 2007. Let me scan through the dates.\n\n- The first row is July 14, 2007.\n- The second row is July 20, 2007. That's one of the dates in the claim. The stadium here is Hindmarsh Stadium. So I need to note the crowd number for this match. Looking at the 'crowd' column, it's 3513.\n\nNext, looking for August 4th, 2007. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The fourth row has the date as August 4, 2007. The stadium here is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. Checking the crowd number in that row, it's 5967.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 3513 (July 20) and 5967 (August 4). Is 5967 larger than 3513? Yes, it is. So the claim states that the crowd on August 4th was larger than on July 20th, which is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\nFor July 20th:\n- Row index: 1\n- Columns needed: 'date', 'stadium', and 'crowd'. But since the claim directly refers to these values, I need to include all three to support the comparison. So each of these columns in row 1.\n\nWait, but perhaps just the crowd number is enough? Because the claim's condition hinges on whether one crowd is larger than the other. However, for thoroughness, maybe including the date and stadium to confirm we're looking at the right matches is necessary.\n\nSimilarly, for August 4th:\n- Row index: 3\n- Same columns: 'date', 'stadium', and 'crowd' as they are relevant to verifying that it's indeed the correct match being referred to in the claim.\n\nSo I'll list all these cells to show which parts of the table support the conclusion. Each row has three entries, so six objects in total for relevant_ cells.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects only the crowd numbers? Let me check the instructions again: \"check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant.\" So, I think it's appropriate to include all cells that confirm both dates, stadiums, and crowd sizes. Because without confirming the dates and stadiums, we can't be sure we're comparing the right rows.\n\nSo for row 1 (July 20), we have 'date', 'stadium', and 'crowd' columns. Similarly for row 3 (August 4). That makes six relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"the home team be adelaide unite on both 20 july 2007 and on 12 august 2007.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Adelaide United was the home team in two specific matches: one on July 20, 2007, and another on August 12, 2007.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to find the relevant information.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a different match. The columns are 'round', 'date', 'home team', 'score', 'away team', 'crowd', and 'stadium'. \n\nLet me check each date mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **July 20, 2007**: I'll look for this date in the 'date' column. Scanning through the rows:\n   - Row 0: July 14, 2007\n   - Row 1: July 20, 2007\n   So, row index 1 has the date of July 20, 2007.\n\n   In this row, the 'home team' is Adelaide United. The claim says that Adelaide United was the home team on this date. That's correct according to the table.\n\n2. **August 12, 2007**: I'll search for this date as well.\n   - Row 4: August 12, 2007\n   So, row index 4 has the date of August 12, 2007.\n\n   In this row, the 'home team' is also Adelaide United. The claim states that they were the home team on both dates, which matches here as well.\n\nWait a minute, I think there's another thing to check. Let me make sure that these are the only two instances of Adelaide United being the home team or if there are more rows. But from the table, row 1 and row 4 are the ones where the date matches the claim, and both have Adelaide United as the home team.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the 'home team' column on the specified dates (July 20, 2007 and August 12, 2007) in the table.

The claim says: \"the stadium use for the game on 20 july 2007 be the same as the stadium use for the game on 12 august 2007\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to find the rows corresponding to those dates. Let me scan through each row's 'date' column.\n\nLooking at the first row (index 0), the date is 14 July 2007. Not the one we need. The second row (index 1) has the date 20 July 2007, which matches the first part of the claim. Then I check the next rows: third row is 28 July, fourth is 4 August, and fifth is 12 August. So the relevant rows are index 1 for 20 July and index 4 for 12 August.\n\nNow, I need to find the 'stadium' column in these two rows.

There are five rows in total, each representing a different match.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: 14 July 2007 and 20 July 2007. I'll need to check the 'away team' for these dates.\n\nStarting with 14 July 2007:\n- Looking at row index 0 (the first data row), the date is \"14 july 2007\". The 'away team' in this row is listed as \"perth glory\".\n\nNext, checking 20 July 2007:\n- Moving to row index 1, the date here is \"20 july 2007\".

The claim is: \"adelaide unite be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems like there are two parts to this claim. Adelaide United is mentioned twice as being the away team on two specific dates: 4 August 2007 and 12 August 2007.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns for round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. The rows are indexed from 0 to 4. I need to check each row where the date is either \"4 august 2007\" or \"12 august 2007\" and see if Adelaide United is listed as the away team in those instances.\n\nStarting with the first part: 4 August 2007. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is 14 July, not relevant.\n- Row 1: Date is 20 July, not relevant.\n- Row 2: Date is 28 July, not relevant.\n- Row 3: Date is 4 August 2007. The home team here is Central Coast Mariners and the away team is Perth Glory. So Adelaide United isn't involved in this match as the away team; in fact, they're not even mentioned in this row.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. So on 4 August, according to the table, it's Central Coast Mariners vs. Perth Glory. That means the claim might be incorrect here because Adelaide United is not the away team on that date. But let me double-check in case I misread the rows.\n\nRow 3: Round SF, Date 4 Aug, Home team is Central Coast Mariners, Away team is Perth Glory. So no, Adelaide isn't involved as an away team there.\n\nNow checking the second part of the claim: 12 August 2007. Let's look at Row 4:\n\nRow 4 has date 12 August 2007. The home team is Adelaide United and the away team is Perth Glory. So in this case, Adelaide United is actually the home team, not the away team.\n\nWait, that contradicts the claim. The claim says Adelaide United was the away team on both dates, but according to the table, on 12 August, they were the home team.\n\nSo putting it together: On 4 August, Adelaide wasn't even an away team; someone else was. And on 12 August, they were home, not away. Therefore, the claim is false because in both instances, Adelaide United isn't the away team as claimed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, did I miss any other rows? The table only has five entries. So no, there's no other row with those dates where Adelaide could have been the away team.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Adelaide United was the away team on both 4 August and 12 August 2007. Checking the table:\n\n- On 4 August 2007 (Row 3), the away team is Perth Glory, not Adelaide United.\n- On 12 August 2007 (Row 4), Adelaide United is the home team.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has several rows, each representing a match with details like date, home team, score, away team, crowd size, and stadium.\n\nI need to check two things: the crowd size on 4 August 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium and compare it with all other crowd sizes in the table to see if it's the largest.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Round 1):** Date is 14 July 2007, stadium is Port Macquarie Regional Stadium, crowd size 2700.\n2. **Row 1 (Round 2):** Date is 20 July 2007, stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium, crowd size 3513.\n3. **Row 2 (Round 3):** Date is 28 July 2007, stadium is Darwin Football Stadium, crowd size 2700.\n4. **Row 3 (SF):** Date is 4 August 2007, stadium is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, crowd size 5967.\n5. **Row 4 (GF):** Date is 12 August 2007, stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium, crowd size 9606.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions \"Hindmarsh Stadium\" on 4 August 2007. But looking at row 3, which has the date 4 August 2007, the stadium listed is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, not Hindmarsh. The crowd there was 5967.\n\nNow, checking other rows for Hindmarsh Stadium:\n\n- Row 1: 20 July 2007 at Hindmarsh with 3513.\n- Row 4: 12 August 2007 at Hindmarsh with 9606.\n\nSo on 4 August 2007, the match was actually at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. Therefore, there is no entry for a match at Hindmarsh Stadium on that date in the table. \n\nThe highest crowd size in the table is 9606 at Hindmarsh Stadium on 12 August 2007. Since the claim refers to a non-existent event at Hindmarsh Stadium on 4 August, it's impossible for that crowd to be larger than any other. Alternatively, if we consider that perhaps there was a mistake in the stadium name and the match on 4 August was actually at Hindmarsh, but according to the table, it wasn't.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the crowd on 4 August 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium doesn't exist in the data provided.

The 'home team' for that row is Adelaide United as well. \n\nWait, but Newcastle Jets are mentioned in the first row on July 14, 2007, but that's not one of the dates in the claim.\n\nSo according to the table, on both specified dates (July 20 and August 12), the home teams were Adelaide United, not Newcastle Jets. Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states that Newcastle Jets were the home team on those dates when they weren't.\n\nI should also make sure I didn't miss any rows. The table has five rows, and the relevant ones are row indices 1 (July 20) and 4 (August 12). Both have Adelaide United as the home team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because on both July 20 and August 12, the home teams were Adelaide United.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says that the stadium used for the game on 12 August 2007 is the same as the one used on 28 July 2007.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table and find the rows with those dates. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 0: Date is 14 July 2007 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 1: 20 July 2007 \u2013 also not our target date.\nRow 2: 28 July 2007 \u2013 that's one of the dates mentioned in the claim. The stadium here is Darwin Football Stadium.\nRow 3: 4 August 2007 \u2013 no, we're looking for 12 August.\nRow 4: 12 August 2007 \u2013 yes, this is the other date. The stadium listed here is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nWait a minute, so on 28 July it was Darwin Football Stadium and on 12 August it's Hindmarsh Stadium. Those are different stadiums. So the claim that they're the same isn't correct. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. I need to note where each stadium is mentioned. For 28 July, that's row index 2 under 'stadium'. And for 12 August, it's row index 4 again under 'stadium'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both games were at the same stadium, but looking at the table, they're different.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
