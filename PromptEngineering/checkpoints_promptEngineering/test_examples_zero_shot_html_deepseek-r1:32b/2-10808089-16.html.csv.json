    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"on august 13th, 1966, the away team be north melbourne, while the home team be collingwood.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two teams involved in a game on August 13, 1966: North Melbourne as the away team and Collingwood as the home team.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for 'home team', 'away team', and 'date'. Each row represents a match with details like scores, venue, crowd, etc. The key is to find the row where the date is August 13, 1966, then check if Collingwood is the home team and North Melbourne is the away team.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is St Kilda vs South Melbourne on August 13, 1966. Not relevant since Collingwood isn't involved here.\n2. **Row 1**: Essendon (home) vs Fitzroy (away). Again, not our teams of interest.\n3. **Row 2**: Collingwood is the home team, and North Melbourne is listed as the away team. The date matches August 13, 1966. This looks promising.\n4. **Row 3** to **Row 5**: These involve other teams but not Collingwood or North Melbourne on that specific date.\n\nSo, row index 2 has the correct home and away teams with the right date. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are 'home team' and 'away team' in row 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches the data exactly: Collingwood as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team on August 13, 1966.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
