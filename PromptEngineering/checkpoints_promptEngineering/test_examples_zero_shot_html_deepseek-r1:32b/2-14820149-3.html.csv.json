The claim states: \"team ducados - yamaha have the same number of points in 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class with 121.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Team name: ducados - yamaha\n2. Years: 1990 and 1991\n3. Class: 500cc\n4. Points in both years: 121 each\n\nNow, I'll check the table for these details.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- For 1990:\n  - Year: 1990\n  - Class: 500cc\n  - Team: ducados - yamaha\n  - Points: 121\n\n- For 1991:\n  - Year: 1991\n  - Class: 500cc\n  - Team: ducados - yamaha\n  - Points: 121\n\nBoth entries in 1990 and 1991 have the same team, class, and points.

The claim says: \"there be 8 point for the 1985 250cc class, but only 4 point for the 1986cc class.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify the relevant rows. The years mentioned are 1985 and 1986, so I need to find those in the 'year' column.\n\nLooking at row index 1: year is 1985, class is 250cc, team is jj cobas, points are 8, wins are 0. So for 1985, the points are indeed 8. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking 1986: I see row index 2 has year 1986, class 500cc, team cagiva, points 4, wins 0. The claim mentions \"1986cc\", which seems like a typo because in the table, it's 500cc for that year. So maybe they meant 1986 and 500cc class.\n\nIn row index 2, the points are 4, which matches the second part of the claim saying only 4 points. However, there's a slight issue with how the claim is phrased. It says \"1986cc\" instead of specifying the class as 500cc or perhaps mistyping the year.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, all the years from 1984 to 1993 are present. The classes vary between 250cc and 500cc. So for 1986, it's 500cc with 4 points. Therefore, the claim is correct in stating that there were 8 points in 1985 (250cc) and 4 points in 1986 (500cc).\n\nSo both parts of the claim are accurate as per the table. The relevant cells would be the 'points' column for 1985 and 1986. Specifically, row index 1's 'points' and row index 2's 'points'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states the points for 1985 (8) and 1986 (4), matching the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The relevant columns here are 'year', 'class', and 'points'. \n\nThe claim specifies that it's about the \"250cc\" class. So, I should filter the rows where the 'class' column is \"250cc\". Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1984: class is 250cc, points are 0.\n- 1985: class is 250cc, points are 8.\n- 1986: class is 500cc, so I can ignore this.\n- 1987: class is 250cc, points are 46.\n- 1988: class is 250cc, points are 221. This looks like a high number.\n- 1989: class is 250cc, points are 98.\n\nSo the relevant years for 250cc are 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1989. The points for these are 0, 8, 46, 221, and 98 respectively.\n\nNow, checking the claim: It states that in 1988, there were 221 points for the 250cc class. Looking at row index 3 (since rows start from 0), which is the 1988 entry, the points are indeed 221.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if this is the highest in that class. Comparing all the 250cc points: 0 < 8 < 46 < 98 < 221. So yes, 221 is the maximum for the 250cc class, and it occurred in 1988.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are those that show the points for each year in the 250cc class to confirm the highest value.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the year with the most win in the 250cc class with team ducados - yamaha be 1988 with 2 win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim states that in the 250cc class and specifically for the team \"ducados - yamaha\", the year 1988 had the most wins, which were two wins.\n\nNext, I need to examine the table provided.

However, according to the table, the number of wins in 1988 was actually three.\n\nMoreover, the claim suggests that 1988 had the most wins for this team and class combination. Checking other relevant rows (since only these three years have both 250cc and ducados - yamaha), we see that 3 wins in 1988 is indeed higher than any other year for this specific team and class.\n\nBut wait, the claim states two wins, but according to the data, it's three.

The team is \"ducados - yamaha.\"\n2. The years involved are 1990 and 1991.\n3. The class is 500cc.\n4. Both years should have the same number of points.\n5. That point value is specified as 61.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to find the relevant rows for these criteria. \n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Columns are: year, class, team, points, wins.\n- Rows are indexed starting from 0.\n\nI need to locate the rows where the team is \"ducados - yamaha\" and the class is 500cc for the years 1990 and 1991.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 4: Year 1990, class 500cc, team ducados - yamaha, points 121.\n- Row 5: Year 1991, class 500cc, team ducados - yamaha, points 121.\n\nWait a minute.

That's a lot higher than the previous years in this class.\n- Then index 5: 1989, still 250cc, points drop to 98.\n\nSo, compiling the points for each year in the 250cc class:\n- 1984: 0\n- 1985: 8\n- 1987: 46\n- 1988: 221\n- 1989: 98\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the highest points in the 250cc class were achieved in 1988 with 221 points. The claim incorrectly states that it was in 1985.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"total of 221 point,\" which is correct numerically but assigned to the wrong year. So both parts of the claim are incorrect: the year and the associated points don't align as stated.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the maximum points for the 250cc class were in 1988, not 1985.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"there be 8 point for the 1991 250cc class, but only 4 point for the 1986cc class.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately to check against the table data. \n\nThe first part is about the 1991 250cc class having 8 points. Looking at the table, I need to find the row where year is 1991 and class is 250cc. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The years go from 1984 up to 1993. Let me check each one for 250cc in 1991.\n\nRow indexes are from 0 to 8 (since there are 10 rows, but starting at 0). \n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\n- Row index 6: 1990, 500cc\n- Row index 7: 1991, 500cc\n\nSo in row 7, year is 1991 and class is 500cc. The points column there shows 121. But the claim mentions 250cc for 1991. Hmm, that's a problem because I don't see any entry for 1991 in 250cc. So maybe the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, the second part: only 4 points for the 1986cc class. Wait, 1986cc seems like it might be a typo. The years are four-digit numbers. Perhaps it's supposed to be 1986 in the 500cc class? Let me check row index 2.\n\nRow 2: year 1986, class 500cc, points 4. That matches the second part of the claim (4 points for 1986). So that's correct.\n\nBut back to the first part: since there's no entry for 1991 in 250cc, and the only 1991 is in 500cc with 121 points, the claim about 8 points for 1991 250cc isn't supported. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nWait a minute\u2014did I misread something? Let me double-check all rows:\n\n- Rows 4 to 6: 1989 (250cc), 1990 and 1991 are both 500cc. So no 250cc entries for 1991. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on that part.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the first part: There's no such row in 1991 with 250cc.\n- For the second part: Row index 2 (1986, 500cc, points 4).\n\nTherefore, since the claim has an incorrect part and a correct part, but the first part isn't supported, the overall answer is FALSE. The relevant cells include row 7 (checking 1991) and row 2 (for 1986).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
