    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The claim is: \"Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo play on the same team as the 4th and 5th player respectively.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being claimed here. It seems like it's saying that in a particular game or activity within the house, two people named Susana (paired with Z\u00e9 Maria) and Susana (paired with Telmo) are on the same team, occupying the 4th and 5th positions.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several rows, each labeled with terms like \"all housemates\" or names of participants. My goal is to find any cells that mention either \"Susana Z\u00e9 Maria\" or \"Susana Telmo\" and check their team positions.\n\nStarting from the top, the first few rows don't seem relevant as they mention evictions or other actions. I'm looking for rows that list teams or players in order. The row labeled \"all housemates\" seems like a good starting point because it might list all participants together.\n\nIn the \"all housemates\" row (row index 12), I check each column to see if Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo are listed. Column names go from 0 to 10, so I'll look at each one:\n\n- Column 0: marco ricardo v telmo\n- Column 1: c\u00e9lia ricardo a z\u00e9 maria\n- Column 2: maria jo\u00e3o z\u00e9 maria\n- Column 3: c\u00e9lia s\u00f3nia susana\n- Column 4: carla paulo\n- Column 5: marta paulo\n- Column 6: marta susana\n- Column 7: m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria\n- Column 8: c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\n- Column 9: c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria\n\nWait, in column 3, there's \"c\u00e9lia s\u00f3nia susana\". That includes Susana. But is it \"Susana Z\u00e9 Maria\" or just \"Susana\"? The claim mentions both names paired with Susana.\n\nLooking further down, rows 14 to 16 each list participants as well. For example, row 14 has \"c\u00e9lia\" in column 10, but that doesn't include the specific pairings we need.\n\nI don't see any cells where Susana is explicitly paired with Z\u00e9 Maria or Telmo. The closest is in column 8: \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\", which includes both names but not necessarily as a team. However, this doesn't specify their positions (4th and 5th) on the same team.\n\nSince I can't find any cells that explicitly state Susana Z\u00e9 Maria is the 4th player and Susana Telmo is the 5th on the same team, the claim isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is \"telmo and paulo play on the same team as no 6 and no 9.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the structure of the table. It has several rows with different labels like \"all housemates,\" \"riquita,\" etc., each followed by a list of names in subsequent columns labeled from 1 to 11.\n\nThe claim mentions four individuals: telmo, paulo, no 6, and no 9. I need to find if these four are on the same team as per the table.\n\nLet me break down what needs to be checked:\n\n1. Identify which row contains both \"telmo\" and \"paulo.\"\n2. Ensure that in this same row, there's a mention of \"no 6\" and \"no 9.\"\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- The first relevant row is \"all housemates.\" Let's check the entries here:\n   - Column 1: marco ricardo v telmo\n   - Column 2: c\u00e9lia ricardo a z\u00e9 maria\n   - Column 3: maria jo\u00e3o z\u00e9 maria\n   - Column 4: c\u00e9lia s\u00f3nia susana\n   - Column 5: carla paulo\n   - Column 6: marta paulo\n   - Column 7: marta susana\n   - Column 8: m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria\n   - Column 9: c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\n   - Column 10: c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria\n\nI notice that \"paulo\" is in columns 5 and 6 under the \"all housemates\" row. \"telmo\" appears in column 8 and 9.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"no 6\" and \"no 9.\" I'm assuming this refers to columns 6 and 9. So let's check if \"telmo\" and \"paulo\" are both listed in these columns under the same row.\n\nLooking at column 6: It lists \"marta paulo.\" There's no mention of telmo here.\nIn column 9: It mentions \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria.\" No paulo here either.\n\nHmm, so in column 6 and 9 under the \"all housemates\" row, telmo is present but paulo isn't. Conversely, paulo is in columns 5 and 6, but not alongside telmo in the same columns.\n\nAdditionally, I'll check if there's another row where both telmo and paulo are mentioned along with columns 6 and 9. Scanning through other rows:\n\n- \"riquita\" appears in several rows, each listing different names across columns. None of these include both telmo and paulo together in the same row.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there's no row where telmo and paulo are listed together with mentions in both column 6 and column 9.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the data because telmo and paulo do not appear together in columns 6 and 9 under the same team.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"6\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"9\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim: \"richardo v be the no9 team that have no6 play paulo.\" Hmm, first thing I notice is a typo in \"richardo\" which should probably be \"ricardo\". So maybe it's Ricardo V.\n\nI need to check this against the provided table. Let me look at the structure of the table. It has several rows and columns labeled from 1 to 11, but looking closely, each row seems to have entries that are either lists of names or phrases like \"all housemates\" or specific terms like \"riquita\".\n\nThe claim mentions two main points: \n1. Ricardo V is part of the no9 team.\n2. The no6 play involves Paulo.\n\nI need to figure out what corresponds to \"no9 team\" and \"no6 play\". Looking at the table, I see rows with labels like \"all housemates\", \"riquita\", and others that list several names. Maybe each row represents a different phase or round in a game or competition where participants are eliminated.\n\nLet me check each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 9 (row_index 8)**: It has entries like \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\". I don't see Ricardo V here, so maybe this isn't the no9 team as per the claim.\n2. **Row 6 (row_index 5)**: The entry is \"carla paulo\". So Paulo is mentioned here. But according to the claim, no6 play should involve Paulo. That part seems correct.\n\nWait, but Ricardo V isn't in row 8. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Let me recount the rows:\n\n- Rows start from index 0. The last few rows before \"riquita\" are:\n  - Row 9 (index 9): riquita with different team members.\n  \nHmm, maybe \"no9 team\" refers to row 9 where Ricardo V is listed? Let me check row 9:\n\n- In row_index 9: The entries include \"ricardo v\", so yes, he's there. So the no9 team (row 9) includes Ricardo V.\n\nNow for the second part: no6 play has Paulo. Looking at row 6 (index 5), it's \"carla paulo\". So Paulo is indeed in that row. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as both conditions are met with Ricardo V in row 9 and Paulo in row 6.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"6\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"9\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"marco richardo vtelmo be the no8 team that have no9 player telmo.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is referring to. It mentions Marco, Ricardo Vtelmo (probably a typo and should be Ricardo V and Telmo separately), being part of a team called no8, and this team has a player named no9 who is Telmo.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different teams or groups. The columns are labeled from 0 to 10, with each column potentially representing a position or role in the team.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"marco\" in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 6: marco ricardo v telmo\nThis seems relevant because it mentions Marco and Ricardo V along with Telmo. This row is under the \"no8\" team, so that matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's a no9 player named Telmo in this team. In the same row (row 6), the entries include Telmo as one of the members. So, it seems like Telmo is indeed part of the no8 team and could be considered as the no9 player.\n\nHowever, I should also check other rows to ensure there's no conflicting information or another entry that might contradict this claim.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- Row 17: marco ricardo vtelmo\nWait, this seems similar but in a different context. The team here is \"no8\" again, so it's consistent with the previous finding.\n\nAdditionally, row 20 mentions Telmo as part of another team, but since the claim specifies the no8 team, I focus on rows related to that.\n\nOverall, the relevant cells are in row 6 and row 17 under the \"no8\" column. These rows list Marco, Ricardo V, and Telmo as members of the no8 team. The mention of Telmo fits the description of having a no9 player named Telmo.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"marco richardo vtelmo\" being part of the no8 team with Telmo as their no9 player. Checking row 6 and row 17 under the \"no8\" column confirms that Marco, Ricardo V, and Telmo are members.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no8\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"no8\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
