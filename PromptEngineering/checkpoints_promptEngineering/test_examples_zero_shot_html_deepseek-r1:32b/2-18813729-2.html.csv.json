The claim says: \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It seems like it's saying that among all the songs with a remix called 'dead guy remix', only one of them is not released in the year 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on two columns: \"year\" and \"remix\". The relevant rows are those where the remix is \"dead guys remix\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Year 2003, Remix dead guys remix \u2192 Relevant.\n2. Row 1: Year 2003, Remix dead guys remix \u2192 Relevant.\n3. Row 2: Year 2003, Remix dead guys remix \u2192 Relevant.\n4. Row 3: Year 2005, Remix dead guys remix \u2192 This is the one not in 2003.\n5. Rows 4 and 5 have a different remix (\"dee - lux remix\"), so they're not relevant.\n\nSo, for the remix \"dead guys remix\", there are four songs (rows 0-3). Out of these, three are from 2003, and one is from 2005. Therefore, only one song with that remix isn't from 2003.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim carefully. It mentions two main points:\n1. Only one artist.\n2. The artist's name should be that of a state.\n3. These artists are from remixes named \"dead guy remix.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns here would be \"artist\" and \"remix.\" I need to focus on rows where the \"remix\" column has entries related to \"dead guys remix.\" The claim refers specifically to this remix type.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the remix is \"dead guys remix.\" Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Remix is \"dead guys remix\"\n- Row 1: Remix is \"dead guys remix\"\n- Row 2: Remix is \"dead guys remix\"\n- Row 3: Remix is \"dead guys remix\"\n- Rows 4 and 5 have different remixes, so I can ignore them for this claim.\n\nSo, rows 0 to 3 are the ones we need to examine. Now, let's list out the artists in these rows:\n\n1. Blondie (Row 0)\n2. Chicane (Row 1)\n3. Lamb (Row 2)\n4. Texas (Row 3)\n\nThe claim states that only one of these artists has a name that is also the name of a state. I'll need to check each artist's name against U.S. states.\n\n- Blondie: This isn't a state.\n- Chicane: Also not a state.\n- Lamb: Not a state either.\n- Texas: Yes, Texas is a U.S. state.\n\nSo, out of the four artists, only Texas matches a state name. That means exactly one artist in the dead guys remix list has a state's name as their artist name.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because only \"Texas\" fits the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that among the artists with remixes named \"dead guys remix,\" only \"texas\" corresponds to an actual U.S. state.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remix\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" Hmm, it looks like there might be a typo; maybe they meant \"year\" instead of \"ear.\" So I'll interpret this as claiming that the year 2005 is the only year with just one song, meaning no other years in the table have only one song.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows. Each row represents a different song entry with details like year, artist, song name, album, and remix. My task is to check how many songs are present for each year.\n\nFirst, let me list out the years:\n\n1. 2003\n2. 2003\n3. 2003\n4. 2005\n5. 2010\n6. 2010\n\nNow, I'll count how many entries each year has.\n\nStarting with 2003: There are three rows (rows 0, 1, and 2) all from 2003. So that's three songs for 2003.\n\nNext is 2005: Only one row (row 3). So just one song in this year.\n\nThen 2010: Two rows (rows 4 and 5), meaning two songs.\n\nSo, according to the claim, 2005 should be the only year with a single song. Let me verify:\n\n- 2003 has multiple songs.\n- 2005 has one song.\n- 2010 has multiple songs.\n\nThe claim says that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs, meaning all other years have more than one. That's correct because 2003 and 2010 both have multiple entries.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this determination. The key column here is \"year,\" so I'll look at each row's year. Additionally, the number of rows per year is important, but since it's about counting occurrences, the specific song details aren't necessary beyond noting that each entry under a year represents a different song.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the 'year' entries in each row. That includes every row's 'year' column to check how many times each year appears.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- The claim is TRUE because 2005 is indeed the only year with one song.\n- All rows have their 'year' checked, so relevant_cells include all six rows pointing to the 'year' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a few conditions:\n\n1. \"produce after 2003\": So we're looking for songs released in years after 2003. That would be 2004 and beyond.\n2. \"there be 1 single song\": It's talking about exactly one song that meets the other conditions.\n3. \"do not have an album title list\": This probably means the album column has a value of 'n/a' or is empty, indicating no album was listed for that song.\n\nNow, let's look at the table provided. The table has rows with data from 2003 to 2010. Each row includes details like year, artist, song, album, and remix.\n\nFirst, I'll filter out the songs produced after 2003. That means any row where the 'year' is greater than 2003. Looking at the table:\n\n- The first three rows are from 2003, so they don't count.\n- The fourth row is 2005: artist Texas, song \"can't resist\", album \"red book\".\n- Rows five and six are from 2010:\n   - Fifth row: Pixie Lott's \"turn it up\" with album titled \"turn it up\".\n   - Sixth row: Perry Mystique's \"party like ur 18 feat sway\" with album listed as 'n/a'.\n\nNext, I need to find songs after 2003 without an album title. From the filtered rows (year > 2003), let's check each album:\n\n- 2005: Album is \"red book\" \u2014 not n/a.\n- 2010: Fifth row has album as \"turn it up\".\n- Sixth row in 2010 has 'n/a' for the album.\n\nSo, there is exactly one song after 2003 that doesn't have an album listed. That's the sixth row: Perry Mystique's song with album 'n/a'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's exactly one song meeting all conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there is one song produced after 2003 without an album title.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like there might be some typos or grammatical issues, so I'll interpret it as: \"Songs from Dee-Lux remix are performed by different artists, but all these songs are from the same year.\"\n\nSo, two conditions here:\n1. The songs with 'dee - lux remix' should have different artists.\n2.

Row 1: Year is 2003, Remix is \"dead guys remix\". Again, not Dee-Lux.\n3. Row 2: Year is 2003, Remix is \"dead guys remix\". Still not Dee-Lux.\n4. Row 3: Year is 2005, Remix is \"dead guys remix\". Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Year is 2010, Remix is \"dee - lux remix\". This matches the criteria. So this song is from Dee-Lux and released in 2010, which is not 2005.\n6. Row 5: Year is 2010, Remix is \"dee - lux remix\". Another match. Song is also released in 2010.\n\nWait a minute, so both row 4 and row 5 have the Dee-Lux remix and are from 2010. That means there are two songs remixed by Dee-Lux that are not from 2005.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 1 of the song...\".

The year is exactly 2005, but the claim says \"after\" which I think means strictly after, so 2006 and beyond. So this might not count unless we consider 2005 as included.

The task is to determine whether a specific claim about the given HTML table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim: \"the song from the dee  - lux remix be perform by the same art and the song be from different year.\" It seems like there might be some typos here, so I need to interpret it correctly. The intended meaning likely is that the songs remixed by Dee Lux were performed by the same artist and are from different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song with details about the year, artist, song title, album, and remix information. \n\nI notice there are two entries where the remix is \"dee  - lux remix\":\n- Row 4: Year 2010, Artist Pixie Lott, Song Turn It Up\n- Row 5: Year 2010, Artist Perry Mystique, Song Party Like Ur 18 feat. Sway\n\nWait, both these entries have the same remix but different artists and the same year (2010). So according to this data, the songs remixed by Dee Lux are performed by different artists and are from the same year.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any other entry with a different year for Dee Lux remixes. Scanning through all rows, the only two entries with \"dee  - lux remix\" are both in 2010. There's no other row where the remix is by Dee Lux from a different year.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Rows 4 and 5 have the same remix type but same year. So according to this, both conditions in the claim aren't met: the artists are different, and the years are the same. \n\nWait no, the claim says that the songs from Dee Lux remixes are by the same artist and from different years. But in reality, they're by different artists and same year. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells, I'll mark rows 4 and 5 under columns 'year' and 'artist' since these are crucial to verifying the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
