    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"ann strother (g) be from connecticut\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Ann Strother in the table. Scanning the 'player' column, I find her listed as player number 5: \"ann strother (g)\". That's a match.\n\nNext, the claim says she is from Connecticut. Looking at the columns, there are two that might be relevant here: 'nationality' and 'college / country / team'. The nationality for Ann Strother is listed as \"united states\", which doesn't directly say Connecticut. \n\nHowever, the 'college / country / team' column has \"connecticut\" under her row. This likely refers to her college, meaning she attended a university in Connecticut, such as the University of Connecticut.\n\nSo, while her nationality isn't Connecticut, she is associated with Connecticut through her college. Therefore, the claim is true based on her educational background there.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ann Strother (g) is from Connecticut. Looking at row 5 of the table, under 'college / country / team', it lists \"connecticut\", which supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college  / country  / team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"ann strother (g) player be from connecticut and be never play on indiana fever\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Ann Strother in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find her at row index 4. Her details are listed as follows:\n\n- Player: ann strother (g)\n- Nationality: united states\n- New WNBA team: atlanta dream\n- Former WNBA team: indiana fever\n- College/Country/Team: connecticut\n\nNow, breaking down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Ann Strother is from Connecticut.\n2. She never played for the Indiana Fever.\n\nFor the first part, the \"college / country / team\" column shows \"connecticut\" for Ann Strother, so she is indeed from Connecticut. That checks out.\n\nFor the second part, the claim states that she never played for the Indiana Fever. However, looking at her former WNBA team, it's listed as \"indiana fever.\" This means she did play for the Indiana Fever before moving to Atlanta Dream.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are being evaluated, and while the first is correct, the second is incorrect because she did play for the Indiana Fever. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
