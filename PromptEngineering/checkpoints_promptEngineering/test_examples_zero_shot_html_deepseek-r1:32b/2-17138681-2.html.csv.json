    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse this to understand what's being asked. The claim is about whether an entry in the table has a viewer count exceeding 12.42 million, and that entry specifically has a \"rating / share\" of 3.2 / 8.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five columns: rating, share, rating/share (which seems to combine both), viewers in millions, and rank overall.\n\nSo I need to find the row where the \"rating  / share  (18  - 49)\" column is exactly \"3.2  / 8\". Then, check if the corresponding \"viewers  (millions)\" value is more than 12.42 million.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\nRow 0: rating/share is 2.6/7 \u2192 doesn't match.\nRow 1: 2.6/6 \u2192 nope.\nRow 2: 3.0/8 \u2192 close, but not 3.2.\nRow 3: 3.1/8 \u2192 still not matching.\nRow 4: 3.1/8 \u2192 same as above.\nRow 5: 3.2/8 \u2192 this matches the condition!\nSo in row 5, viewers are 12.42 million.\n\nThe claim is asking if there's more than 12.42 million viewers for that entry. Since it's exactly 12.42, not more, the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rating  / share  (18  - 49)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers  (millions)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
