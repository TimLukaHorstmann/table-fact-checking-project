    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the result of the game on december 14  , 1986 on week 15 be a loss of 34 - 3\". \n\nFirst, let me parse what the claim is stating. It's talking about a specific game that took place on December 14, 1986, in week 15. The result was a loss with a score of 34-3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should check each row to find the one that matches both the date and the week number mentioned. Let me go through the rows one by one.\n\nStarting from week 1 up to week 16:\n\n- Week 15: The date is December 14, 1986. Checking the opponent for this week is Cleveland Browns, and the result is \"l 34 - 3\". So, it's a loss with those exact scores.\n\nWait, does that match exactly what the claim says? The claim mentions a loss of 34-3 on December 14, which is exactly what week 15 shows. \n\nSo, all parts of the claim are correct based on the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies the game's date, week number, and result as shown in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"week 15th's game on december 14 , 1986 be a win of 34 - 3\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the components of the claim:\n- Week number: 15\n- Date: December 14, 1986\n- Result: Win with a score of 34-3\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column for \"week\", \"date\", and \"result\". Each row corresponds to a game played in that week. \n\nI'll search the table for the row where the week is 15. Scanning through the rows:\n- Row 14 (since indexing starts at 0) has week 15.\n\nNow, checking the date in this row: It's December 14, 1986, which matches the claim. So far, so good.\n\nNext, I'll look at the \"result\" column for that row. The result is listed as \"l 34 - 3\". In the table, a 'w' denotes a win and an 'l' denotes a loss. So this game was a loss with the score 34-3.\n\nThe claim says it's a win of 34-3, but according to the table, it's a loss. Therefore, the result doesn't match the claim.\n\nAdditionally, the attendance isn't part of the claim, so I don't need to check that. \n\nSince the claim states it was a win, but the table shows a loss, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies week 15 and December 14, 1986. The relevant row confirms the date and week but shows a loss instead of a win.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
