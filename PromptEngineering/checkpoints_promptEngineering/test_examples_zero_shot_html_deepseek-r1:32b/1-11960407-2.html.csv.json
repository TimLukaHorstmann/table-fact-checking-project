    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"toronto lose to cleveland on november 24, 108 - 111 (ot)\". I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the date mentioned in the claim, which is November 24. Scanning through the 'Date' column, I find that row 13 has \"november 24\" as the date. So, that's our target row.\n\nNext, I need to check who Toronto played against on that date. In the 'Opponent' column of row 13, it says \"cleveland\". That matches the claim, so far so good.\n\nNow, let's look at the result of the game. The 'Result' column for row 13 shows \"l\", which typically stands for a loss. This aligns with the claim stating that Toronto lost.\n\nFinally, I'll verify the score mentioned in the claim. The scores are listed under the 'Score' column as \"108 - 111 (ot)\". The numbers here indicate that Toronto scored 108 points and Cleveland scored 111, which is exactly what the claim states.\n\nPutting it all together: The date matches, the opponent is correct, Toronto lost, and the score details are accurate. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the information in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with several columns and rows, each representing different games played on various dates. They also made a claim about the result of a game on November 20 in Dallas being \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\". My task is to verify this claim against the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what columns are relevant for checking this claim. The important aspects here are the date of the game, the location (opponent), and the result of the game. Looking at the table, the columns that seem relevant are \"Date,\" \"Opponent,\" and \"Result.\"\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to find the one where the Date is November 20 and the Opponent is Dallas. Scanning down, I see that row index 10 has the date \"November 20\" and the opponent is \"dallas\". That matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the result for this specific game: according to the table, the result is listed as \"l 99 - 105 (ot)\". The claim states it was a win with a score of \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\". This doesn't match because in the table, Toronto lost that game (\"l\") and the scores are different.\n\nSince the result doesn't align with what's claimed, the claim is false. Therefore, I need to identify which cells were relevant in verifying this. The relevant columns for each row checked would be \"Date,\" \"Opponent,\" and \"Result.\"\n\nSo, for the rows that match the date and opponent (row 10), these three columns are directly involved in assessing the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
