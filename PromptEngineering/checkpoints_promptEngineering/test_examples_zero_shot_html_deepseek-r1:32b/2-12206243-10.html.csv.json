    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the user has given a table with data about some games in September, and there's a specific claim they want to verify. The claim is: \"the september 1 game against the mets result in a win 3 - 0. there be 19196 crowd attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if this claim is true or false based on the table provided. To do that, I'll go through each part of the claim and see what relevant information exists in the table.\n\nThe first part of the claim mentions September 1 game against the Mets with a result of a win 3-0. So I need to look for a row where the date is September 1 and the opponent is the Mets. Let me scan through the rows... Looking at the table, the earliest dates start from September 5th. Wait, that can't be right. The first few entries are September 5, then September 7, 8, etc., but there's no entry for September 1. Hmm, so if there's no row with September 1, that means the table doesn't have data for that date.\n\nNext, the claim talks about attendance being 19196. Since there's no row for September 1, I can't find any attendance number related to that game in the table. Therefore, both parts of the claim\u2014game result and attendance\u2014are not supported by the given data.\n\nSo putting it all together, since there's no relevant cell for September 1 or its corresponding opponent, result, or attendance, the claim can't be verified with the information provided. Thus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are none because the necessary data isn't present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"on september 22 23, 3380 crowd witness a win against the yankee of 8-1.\" Wait, that doesn't look quite right. The date seems off\u2014\"september 22 23\"\u2014maybe that's a typo and they meant September 22nd or perhaps both 22 and 23rd? But looking at the table, each row is a specific date.\n\nFirst, I'll check the dates in the table. Scanning through, I see entries for September 22 and September 23 separately. The claim mentions two dates together, but maybe it's just referring to one of them or perhaps both?\n\nNext, let's look at the crowd size mentioned: \"3380.\" Hmm, checking the column named \"Attendance,\" which is likely the crowd count. For each date, I'll note the attendance:\n\n- September 22: The attendance is 23,380.\n- September 23: The attendance is 29,276.\n\nThe claim says 3380, but in both cases, it's much higher. Wait, maybe there was a typo and they meant 23,380? Or perhaps the commas were misplaced? Because in some countries, commas are used as thousand separators, so 23,380 would be read as 23 thousand 380.\n\nLooking at September 22: The attendance is indeed 23,380. The claim might have a typo where they wrote \"3380\" instead of \"23380.\" That seems plausible.\n\nNow, checking the opponent and the score. For September 22nd, the opponent was the Yankees, and the score was an 8-1 win. So that matches the claim about defeating the Yankees with a score of 8-1.\n\nSo putting it together: The date might have been mistyped (September 22 instead of perhaps both 22 and 23), but since only September 22 has the correct opponent, score, and an attendance close to what's claimed (if considering a typo in the number), I think the claim is supported.\n\nThe relevant cells would be for September 22nd. Let me find that row index. Counting from the top, the first data row is September 14th as row 0, then each subsequent date increments by one. So September 22nd is... let's see:\n\nLooking at the table structure, it starts with August dates and goes into September. Wait, actually, all the rows provided are in September, starting from the 14th. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 30-something? Wait no, looking back, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's look at the table structure again. The first row after the header is August 28: that's row index 0. Then September 14 is next. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: August 28\nRow 1: September 14\nRow 2: September 15\n...\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count from the first data row in September.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list all dates with their row indices:\n\n- Row 0: August 28 (maybe not relevant)\nAssuming that the table starts at August 28 as row 0, then each subsequent date increments by one. So let's find September 22 and 23.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nLooking for \"september 22\" in the Date column, which is column 1 (if columns are index starting from 0: Date, Opponent, Score, Pitcher, Attendance). Wait, no\u2014the table has headers: Date, Opponent, Score, Pitcher, Attendance. So each row's first cell is the date.\n\nSo I'll look for rows where the date is September 22 or 23. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided rows (assuming they are ordered):\n\nRow with September 22: I see a row with \"september 22\" in the Date column, which has an attendance of 23,380.\n\nSimilarly, September 23 has 29,276 attendance.\n\nSo to confirm:\n\n- For September 22:\n   - Opponent: Yankees\n   - Score: 8-1 (win)\n   - Attendance: 23,380\n\nThe claim says \"on september 22 23\"\u2014I think they meant September 22 and possibly 23? But only September 22 matches the attendance close to what's claimed if considering a typo.\n\nSo the relevant row is for September 22. Now, what's its row index?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices (assuming the first data row after headers is 0):\n\n- August 28: Row 0\n- September 14: Row 1\n- September 15: Row 2\n- September 16: Row 3\n- September 17: Row 4\n- September 18: Row 5\n- September 19: Row 6\n- September 20: Row 7\n- September 21: Row 8\n- September 22: Row 9\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them in order:\n\nAssuming the table starts with August 28 as row 0.\n\nThen each subsequent date is +1 row index.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: August 28\nRow 1: September 14\nRow 2: September 15\nRow 3: September 16\nRow 4: September 17\nRow 5: September 18\nRow 6: September 19\nRow 7: September 20\nRow 8: September 21\nRow 9: September 22\nRow 10: September 23\n\nSo for September 22, it's row 9. The attendance is 23,380.\n\nTherefore, the claim mentions \"3380,\" which might be a typo for 23,380. So the attendance matches if considering that typo.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are in row 9 (September 22) for Date, Opponent, Score, and Attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data from September 22nd. The attendance figure likely had a typo, as 23,380 closely matches the claimed 3,380 when considering potential punctuation errors.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is true based on the information in row 9 of the table (September 22), where the team played against the Yankees with an attendance of 23,380 and won 8-1. The score and opponent match the claim, and the attendance figure is likely a typo for 23,380.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Date: September 22 (Row 9)\n- Opponent: Yankees\n- Score: 8-1\n- Attendance: 23,380\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the dates mentioned:** The claim refers to \"september 22 23,\" which might be a typo for September 22 and/or 23.\n\n2. **Check attendance figures:**\n   - September 22: 23,380\n   - September 23: 29,276\n\n3. **Compare with the claim's attendance (\"3380\"):** Likely a typo; 23,380 is close when considering punctuation.\n\n4. **Verify opponent and score for September 22:** Yankees, 8-1 win\u2014matches the claim.\n\n5. **Determine row index for September 22:** It's row 9 in the table.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the information in row 9 of the table (September 22).\n\n\\boxed{TRUE}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, the task is to verify a claim based on the given table data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the record after the september 28 win against the red sox be 76 - 86\". I think that means after winning on September 28 against the Red Sox, their overall record was 76 wins and 86 losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, pitcher's stats, attendance, and the team's record after that game. The last column is labeled \"Record\" which shows the wins and losses up to that point.\n\nI need to find the row corresponding to September 28. Scanning through the table, I see that on September 28, they played against the Red Sox with a score of 3-2. In this game, Gordon pitched with a record of 6-10, and the team's overall record after this game is listed as 76-86.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I should check two things: that the date is September 28 and that the opponent was the Red Sox. Also, confirm that their record after this win is indeed 76-86.\n\nLooking at the table, the row for September 28 has \"red sox\" as the opponent and the record shows 76 - 86. This matches exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The relevant columns are \"Date\", \"Opponent\", and \"Record\". For September 28, these would be row index 30 (assuming rows start at 0), column names \"Date\" (which is September 28), \"Opponent\" (Red Sox), and \"Record\" (76-86).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user didn't specify which columns to include. I think the main thing is the Record after that specific game. So perhaps only the Record cell is needed for verification.\n\nAlternatively, to be thorough, including the Date and Opponent cells would help confirm it's the right game. But according to the instructions, I need to list all relevant cells used to verify each condition in the claim.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the row where the date is September 28.\n2. Confirm that the opponent was the Red Sox.\n3. Check if the record after this game is 76-86.\n\nEach of these checks corresponds to a cell in the table. Therefore, I should include all three cells as relevant: \"Date\", \"Opponent\", and \"Record\" for that specific row.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's example response, it only included the Revenue and Employees columns without specifying each part. Maybe the main focus is on the record cell.\n\nIn any case, to be precise, I should include the Date, Opponent, and Record cells from the September 28 row because they all contribute to verifying the claim.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON structure, each relevant cell is an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". The row index for September 28 seems to be the last row in the table provided. Counting the rows: starting from 0, the first data row is August 19, then August 20, etc., up to September 28 being row 30.\n\nSo, relevant cells would include row 30 for Date, Opponent, and Record columns.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}, {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}]}",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all games in September from the table. The table has rows for each date in September, so I should go through each row and check the \"Date\" column to see if it's September 1st.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 0: Date is September 1\n- Rows 1 onwards are other dates like September 2, etc.\n\nNow, I need to find the combined runs for the game on September 1. The combined run would be the sum of both teams' scores in that game. Let me check the \"Runs\" column.\n\nIn row 0 (September 1), the Runs are listed as 3-5. Wait, that's two numbers separated by a hyphen. I think this means one team scored 3 and the other 5, so combined runs would be 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nNext, I have to check if 8 is indeed the lowest combined run for any game in September. To do this, I'll go through each row and calculate the combined runs for each date.\n\nLet me list out the Runs column:\n- Row 0: 3-5 \u2192 8\n- Row 1: 2-4 \u2192 6 (Wait, that's lower than 8)\n- Row 2: 2-7 \u2192 9\n- Row 3: 3-4 \u2192 7\n- Row 4: 1-5 \u2192 6\n- Row 5: 3-2 \u2192 5 (Lower still)\n- Rows continue, but let me check a few more:\n- Row 6: 5-4 \u2192 9\n- Row 7: 8-1 \u2192 9\n- And so on...\n\nWait, I'm noticing that in row 1, the combined runs are 2+4=6. That's lower than 8 from September 1. Similarly, in row 4, it's 1+5=6 again. In row 5, it's 3+2=5, which is even lower.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim that September 1 has the lowest combined runs isn't correct because there are other games with lower combined runs. For example, row 5 (September 26) had a combined run of 5, which is less than 8.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check include:\n- The Runs column for each game in September to compare the totals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Runs\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Runs\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Runs\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Runs\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It has columns like Date, Team, Score, Pitcher, and others. The rows represent each game, with details about who they played, the score, and the pitcher for that game.\n\nThe claim mentions September 25, so I should find the row where the date is September 25.

Let's note down the details of that row: it was a 4-3 win, and the pitcher was Mike Mussina with a record of (15-8). \n\nNow, checking if Mike Mussina got the win. The score shows our team won 4-3, so yes, they won the game on September 25. The pitcher for that game was Mike Mussina, which suggests he pitched and likely got the win since his name is listed under Pitcher.\n\nTo confirm, in baseball, the pitcher who starts a game and allows few enough runs to give his team a chance to win typically gets credit for the win if his team wins. Given that the team won 4-3 and Mussina's record improved or remained at (15-8), it supports that he was the winning pitcher.\n\nSo, all the relevant cells are in the row where the date is September 25, specifically the Team column to confirm it was against the Orioles, the Score column showing a win, and the Pitcher column indicating Mike Mussina pitched.

The opponent for that day was the Red Sox, so that part matches.\n\nNext, checking the outcome of that game: under the \"Score\" column for September 28, it says \"3 - 2\". Since this is the Blue Jays' score followed by their opponents', a loss would mean the Blue Jays scored fewer runs. Here, they scored 3 versus the Red Sox's 2? Wait, no\u2014wait, if the Blue Jays are the home team or away? Actually, in baseball, typically the first number is the visiting team's score, and the second is the home team's. So if the Blue Jays were at home on September 28, their score would be 3, but they lost to the Red Sox who scored 2? That doesn't make sense because 3 > 2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again: the \"Score\" column in the table shows the Blue Jays' runs first, then the opponent's. So on September 28, it was 3-2 in favor of the Blue Jays? But that would mean they won, not lost. The claim says they lost to the Red Sox, so this seems contradictory.\n\nWait a minute\u2014that might be incorrect. Let me double-check: If the Blue Jays scored 3 and the Red Sox scored 2, then the Blue Jays won. So why does the claim say they fell to 76-86 after losing? There's something wrong here because if they lost, their win-loss record should go down.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the score. Let me check other rows for clarity. For example, on September 25 against the Orioles, the score was 4-3 in favor of the Blue Jays, and their record went from 72-86 to 73-86. That makes sense because a win would increase wins by one.\n\nSimilarly, on September 26 against the Red Sox, the score was 3-0, which I think is a shutout victory for the Blue Jays, as they increased their record from 74-86 to 75-86. Wait, but in that case, a win would make it 75-86.\n\nWait, so on September 28, if the score was 3-2 and the Blue Jays lost, then perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the score is presented. Maybe the first number is the opponent's score, not the Blue Jays'. That would mean that on September 28, the Red Sox scored 3, and the Blue Jays scored 2, resulting in a loss for the Blue Jays.\n\nLooking at another row to confirm: On September 19 against the Orioles, the score was 4-3. If it's Blue Jays first, then they won. But their record went from 75-86 to 76-86, which suggests a win. So yes, I think the format is Blue Jays' runs first.\n\nWait, but on September 28, if the Blue Jays scored 3 and lost, that can't be right because they have more runs. So perhaps the score is presented as Opponent - Blue Jays? Let's check other rows where they lost. For example, let's look for a row where their record decreased.\n\nLooking at September 17 against the Orioles: the score was 3-2 and their record went from 75-86 to 75-87. So that must be a loss because the loss count increased by one. Therefore, in this case, the opponent scored 3, Blue Jays scored 2. Hence, the format is Opponent's score - Blue Jays' score.\n\nWait, so on September 17: Opponent (Orioles) 3, Blue Jays 2. That makes sense because it was a loss for the Blue Jays, so their record went from 75-86 to 75-87.\n\nSimilarly, on September 20 against the Yankees, score was 3-2, and their record went from 76-86 to 76-87. So again, opponent scored 3, Blue Jays 2; another loss.\n\nTherefore, the format is Opponent's runs - Blue Jays' runs. Hence, on September 28 against the Red Sox, the score was 3-2. That means the Red Sox scored 3, and the Blue Jays scored 2, resulting in a loss for the Blue Jays.\n\nNow, checking their record before and after this game: Before September 28, they were at 75-86 (from September 26). On September 28, after losing, it should go to 75-87. But looking at the table, on September 29, the score is \"10 - 3\" and their record becomes 76-87. Wait, that suggests they won on September 29 because the win count increased from 75 to 76.\n\nWait a second\u2014on September 28, if they lost, their record should be 75-87 after that game. But in the table, I don't see an entry for September 28 with a loss leading to 75-87; instead, it jumps from 75-86 on September 26 to 76-87 on September 29.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a missing row or I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table entries starting from September 17:\n\n- Sep 17: 3-2 loss \u2192 record 75-87\n- Sep 18: 4-3 win \u2192 76-87\n- Sep 19: 4-3 win \u2192 77-87\n- Sep 20: 3-2 loss \u2192 77-88\n- Sep 21: 3-2 loss \u2192 77-89\n- Sep 22: 5-2 win \u2192 78-89\n- Sep 23: 4-3 win \u2192 79-89\n- Sep 24: 3-2 win \u2192 80-89\n- Sep 25: 4-3 win \u2192 81-89\n- Sep 26: 3-0 win \u2192 82-89\n- Sep 27: No game listed? Or perhaps it's a day off.\n- Sep 28: If they played and lost, the record would be 82-90. But in the table, I see Sep 29: 10-3 win \u2192 83-90.\n\nWait, this doesn't align with the claim of falling to 76-86. There's a discrepancy here because according to the table, their record continued to improve after September 25, not decrease.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the \"Record\" column for each date:\n\n- Sep 17: 75-87\n- Sep 18: 76-87\n- Sep 19: 77-87\n- Sep 20: 77-88\n- Sep 21: 77-89\n- Sep 22: 78-89\n- Sep 23: 79-89\n- Sep 24: 80-89\n- Sep 25: 81-89\n- Sep 26: 82-89\n- Sep 27: Not listed, maybe a day off.\n- Sep 28: If they lost, it would be 82-90\n- Sep 29: Win \u2192 83-90\n\nBut the claim mentions falling to 76-86. That suggests that after September 28, their record was 76-86, which is not reflected in this table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the \"Record\" column. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- Sep 1: Record starts at 72-86\n- Then it goes up and down based on wins and losses.\n\nWait, maybe the table isn't complete or there's a mistake in my interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to an earlier date where their record was 76-86 after a loss to the Red Sox on September 28.\n\nLooking back at the \"Record\" column for each game:\n\n- Sep 1: 72-86\n- Sep 2: After a win, it's 73-86\n- Sep 3: Win \u2192 74-86\n- Sep 4: Loss \u2192 74-87\n- Sep 5: Loss \u2192 74-88\n- Sep 6: Win \u2192 75-88\n- Sep 7: Win \u2192 76-88\n- Sep 8: Win \u2192 77-88\n- Sep 9: Loss \u2192 77-89\n- Sep 10: Loss \u2192 77-90\n- Sep 11: Win \u2192 78-90\n- Sep 12: Loss \u2192 78-91\n- Sep 13: Win \u2192 79-91\n- Sep 14: Win \u2192 80-91\n- Sep 15: Loss \u2192 80-92\n- Sep 16: Win \u2192 81-92\n- Sep 17: Loss \u2192 81-93\n- Sep 18: Win \u2192 82-93\n- Sep 19: Win \u2192 83-93\n- Sep 20: Loss \u2192 83-94\n- Sep 21: Loss \u2192 83-95\n- Sep 22: Win \u2192 84-95\n- Sep 23: Win \u2192 85-95\n- Sep 24: Win \u2192 86-95\n- Sep 25: Win \u2192 87-95\n- Sep 26: Win \u2192 88-95\n- Sep 27: Not listed\n- Sep 28: If they lost, it would be 88-96\n- Sep 29: Win \u2192 89-96\n\nBut the claim says after the game on September 28, their record was 76-86. That doesn't match with the table entries.\n\nWait a minute\u2014perhaps I'm misinterpreting the \"Record\" column. Maybe it's not cumulative but something else? Or perhaps the table is presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made an error in the claim or the table data isn't accurate.\n\nBut assuming that the table is correct and we're to answer based on the given information, I need to determine if after a loss on September 28 against the Red Sox, their record was indeed 76-86.\n\nLooking back at the \"Record\" column, when does it show 76-86? Let's see:\n\n- Sep 1: 72-86\n- Then gradually increasing wins.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking too far ahead. Maybe after a loss on September 28, their record was 76-86. So let's check when that would happen.\n\nIf we're at a point where they have 75 wins and 86 losses, a loss would take them to 75-87, not 76-86. Therefore, the claim seems inconsistent unless there was a day where their record was exactly 76-86 after a loss.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table isn't complete or I'm missing some games.\n\nBut based on the data provided, it's unclear how their record would drop to 76-86 after September 28. It seems more like their record continued to increase in wins as they won several games.\n\nTherefore, I might conclude that there is a mistake either in the claim or the table provided.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the data, the team's record was not 76-86 after their game on September 28 against the Red Sox. The information suggests that their record continued to rise with more wins than losses as of the games listed.\n\n**Answer:** No, the team did not have a 76-86 record after their September 28 game against the Red Sox; their record was higher in wins based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the highest scoring game of the season be against the angel on september 8 final score be 12 - 10\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. The highest-scoring game was against the Angels.\n2. This game took place on September 8.\n3. The final score of that game was 12-10.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table to see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with games against different teams and dates. I need to find a row where the opponent is \"Angels\" on September 8. Let's scan through the rows:\n\nI don't immediately see an entry for September 8. Wait, looking closely: The first few rows are from September 7, then September 8? Hmm, no. Let me count the rows starting from index 0.\n\nRow 0: Sep 7 vs Twins, score 12-5\nRow 1: Sep 7 vs Twins, score 4-3\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe September 8 isn't in the table at all? Or perhaps it's a typo and meant another date.\n\nLet me check each row for the opponent \"Angels\". Looking through the table:\n\nRow 2: Opponent is Twins on Sep 7\nRow 3: Opponent is Angels on Sep 8, score 12-10. Wait, I think I found it in row index 5 (since counting starts at 0). Let me recount.\n\nWait no, perhaps the numbering is different. Let's list out the rows with their indices:\n\nAssuming each <tr> corresponds to a row, starting from 0.\n\nRow 0: Sep 7 vs Twins\nRow 1: Sep 7 vs Twins\nRow 2: Sep 8 vs Angels? Or maybe it's September 8 in another part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong columns. The relevant columns are \"Opponent\" and \"Date\", as well as \"Final Score\".\n\nLooking for a row where Opponent is Angels and Date is September 8. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow index 0: Sep 7 vs Twins\nRow 1: Sep 7 vs Twins, score 4-3\nWait, perhaps the dates are in another format? Maybe September 8 isn't listed because it's actually September 9 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing it. Let me go through each row:\n\nLooking at the \"Date\" column for Sep 8. The first few rows after the header have dates like Sep 7, then perhaps Sep 8 is in a later row.\n\nWait, looking back: The table shows games from September 7 onwards. Let's see if any row has a date of Sep 8 and opponent as Angels.\n\nAfter checking all rows, I don't find a game on Sep 8 against the Angels. Wait, but actually, in row index 5 (assuming starting count correctly), there is an entry for Sep 8 vs Angels with score 12-10.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again:\n\nLet me recount from the top. The first data row after the header is Row 0: Sep 7, Twins, 12-5\n\nRow 1: Sep 7, Twins, 4-3 (but that might be a different game or perhaps duplicate entry)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting because some rows have the same date but different scores. Let me check each row for Sep 8 and Angels.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nI don't find any row where the opponent is Angels on Sep 8. The closest is a game against the Angels on Sep 9? Or maybe it's Sep 8 in another part of the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it earlier. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nRow 0: Sep 7 vs Twins\nRow 1: Sep 7 vs Twins\nRow 2: Sep 8 vs Angels (yes! Here we go)\n\nSo, row index 2 has:\n\nDate: Sep 8\n\nOpponent: Angels\n\nScore: 12-10\n\nYes, that's the claim. So this row supports all parts of the claim.\n\nAdditionally, to confirm if it's the highest-scoring game, I need to check other games for higher scores. The highest score in the table is 12-10 (row index 2), and another game on Sep 7 has a score of 12-5, which is lower than 12-10.\n\nSo yes, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row index 2, specifically the \"Date\", \"Opponent\", and \"Final Score\" columns. The claim is supported by this data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"highest_scoring_game\": true,\n  \"opponent\": \"Angels\",\n  \"date\": \"Sep 8\",\n  \"final_score\": \"12-10\"\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is **true**.
