    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two engines: Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 and Ford Cosworth DFV, and it says they have F tyres.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row for these engines and their corresponding tyre types.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 1970: Engine is Ford Cosworth DFV, Tyre is F. So this matches part of the claim.\n- Row 1971: Engines are Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 and Ford Cosworth DFV. The tyres here are also F.\n\nSo both engines mentioned in the claim have F tyres in these rows. That supports the claim.\n\nI should note that in 1972 onwards, the tyres change to G or others, but since the claim is about whether they have F tyres at least once, it's sufficient.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For 1970: Engine and Tyres columns.\n- For 1971: Same columns again for both engines.\n\nSo, collecting these as relevant_ cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the march 741 chassis have f tyre and 6 point.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of the claim and check it against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions three things about the March 741 chassis:\n1. Tyre type 'f'\n2. Points equal to 6\n\nSo, my task is to look for the row where the chassis is \"march 741\" and then verify if the tyres are 'f' and points are 6.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where the chassis is listed as \"march 741.\" Scanning down:\n\n- Year 1970: Chassis is march 701. Not relevant.\n- Year 1971: Chassis includes march 711 and march 701. Still not 741.\n- Year 1972: Chassis has multiple entries, none are 741.\n- Year 1973: Again, no 741.\n- Year 1974: Here's the row for 1974. The chassis is \"march 741.\" Perfect.\n\nNow, I'll check the tyres and points in this row. The tyre column shows 'g' for this row. So, the claim says 'f', but the table shows 'g'. That's a discrepancy.\n\nNext, checking the points: The table lists 6 points, which matches the claim.\n\nWait, so the claim has two parts. The tyres are said to be 'f', but in the table, it's 'g' for that row. So one part is correct (points), and one is incorrect (tyres). Since both conditions must hold true for the claim to be accurate, any mismatch would make the claim false.\n\nTherefore, since the tyre type doesn't match, even though points do, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table data. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo sum up:\n- Relevant cells are in row 4 (assuming rows are zero-indexed; let me check the count). Let's confirm: The first row is 1970 as index 0, then each subsequent year increments the index. So 1974 would be at row index 4.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For chassis: column \"chassis\" in row 4.\n- For tyres: column \"tyres\" in row 4.\n- For points: column \"points\" in row 4.\n\nThese are the cells that need to be checked. Since the tyre type doesn't match, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two conditions about the March 741 chassis. Checking against the table, while the points are correct, the tyre type isn't. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
