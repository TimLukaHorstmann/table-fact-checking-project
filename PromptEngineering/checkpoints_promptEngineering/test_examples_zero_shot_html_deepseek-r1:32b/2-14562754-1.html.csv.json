    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"laurent boutonnat do 8 remixes of the song throughout the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: version, length, album, remixed by, and year. My focus should be on the \"remixed by\" column to find entries involving Laurent Boutonnat in 1995.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Album version. Remixed by is empty. So no.\n2. **Row 1**: Single version. Remixed by Laurent Boutonnat. Year is 1995. That's one remix.\n3. **Row 2**: No voice remix edit. Also remixed by Laurent Boutonnat and another person. This is the second remix.\n4. **Row 3**: Extra large remix. Same as above, so third remix.\n5. **Row 4**: Distorded dance mix. Again, same remixers. Fourth remix.\n6. **Row 5**: New remix edit. Fifth remix.\n7. **Row 6**: Single dance mix. Sixth remix.\n8. **Row 7**: New remix edit (Germany). Seventh remix.\n9. **Row 8**: German radio edit. Eighth remix.\n\nRows 9-14: The other rows are from years other than 1995, so they don't count.\n\nSo, Laurent Boutonnat is involved in 8 remixes of the song throughout 1995.

Then check if their lengths are both 4 minutes and 25 seconds.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. For \"new remix edit\":\n   - Scanning each row's version column.\n   - Found at row index 5: version is 'new remix edit', length is 4:25. That matches.\n\n2.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"2 remixes of the song be release in 1996 and 2003 , by richard dekkard and junkie xl respectively.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific remixes released in 1996 and 2003, created by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL respectively.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find any entries related to these years and remixer names.\n\nStarting with 1995 releases:\n- The rows from index 0 to 8 all have the year 1995. These include different versions like single version, remix edits, dance mixes, etc., but they don't mention Richard Dekkard or Junkie XL as remixed by. So none of these are relevant for our claim.\n\nMoving on to other years:\n- Row index 10: This is the UK remix with a year 1996. The remixer here is Richard Dekkard. That matches the first part of the claim\u2014a remix in 1996 by Richard Dekkard.\n- Row index 12: JXL Remix, released in 2003, remixed by Junkie XL. This fits the second part of the claim\u2014another remix in 2003 by Junkie XL.\n\nNow, checking if there are exactly two remixes as per the claim. From the table:\n- The UK remix (1996) is one.\n- The JXL Remix (2003) is another.\nSo that's two remixes by the specified remixer names in the given years.\n\nAre there any other remixes in 1996 or 2003? Let me double-check. Looking through all rows, only these two entries have the years 1996 and 2003 respectively. All others are either 1995 or later (like 2006 and 2009).\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because there are exactly two remixes released in 1996 and 2003 by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL respectively.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n- For UK remix: row index 10, columns 'version', 'year', 'remixed by'.\n- For JXL Remix: row index 12, same columns.\n\nSo the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with 7 of the remixes in the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The individuals involved are Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat.\n2. They worked together on 7 remixes.\n3. All these remixes were released in the year 1995.\n\nNext, I'll examine each row of the table to see where both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat are listed under the \"remixed by\" column for the year 1995.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rows 2 through 8 (index 2 to 8) have entries from 1995.\n- Checking each of these rows:\n  - Row 2: Single version, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat only. Doesn't meet both names.\n  - Rows 3-7: Each has both Bertrand and Laurent listed under \"remixed by\". That's five rows (indices 2 to 6).\n  \nWait, actually, let me recount:\n\n- Row 2: Only Laurent Boutonnat.\n- Rows 3: Both. Index 2.\n- Row 4: Both. Index 3.\n- Row 5: Both. Index 4.\n- Row 6: Both. Index 5.\n- Row 7: Both. Index 6.\n- Row 8: Both. Index 7.\n\nWait, that's rows 3 to 9 (indices 2 to 8) but considering the \"year\" is 1995 for all these except row 8 which has year 1995? Wait no, looking back:\n\nActually, in the table provided, rows 0-10 are from 1995 except rows 11 and 12 (UK remix, live version recorded in 1996), but let me correct that.\n\nWait, the table starts with row indices as per HTML. Let's list all rows:\n\nRow 0: album version - year 1995\nRow 1: single version - 1995\nRow 2: no voice remix edit - 1995\nRow 3: extra large remix -1995\nRow4: distorded dance mix -1995\nRow5:new remix edit -1995\nRow6:single dance mix -1995\nRow7:new remix edit (germany) -1995\nRow8:german radio edit -1995\nRow9:music video -1995\nRow10:live version 1996\nRow11:junkie xl -2003\nRow12:live version 2006\nRow13:live version 2009\n\nWait, no. The table has rows from index 0 to 14? Wait the user provided a table with rows numbered 0-14 (since there are 15 rows in total). Let me recount:\n\nRows 0 to 8 have year 1995.\n\nRow 0: album version - remixed by no one, as it's an album version.\nRow1: single version - remixed by Laurent Boutonnat\nRow2: no voice remix edit - both\nRow3: extra large remix - both\nRow4: distorded dance mix - both\nRow5:new remix edit - both\nRow6:single dance mix - both\nRow7:new remix edit (germany) - both\nRow8:german radio edit - both\n\nSo rows 2-8 (indices 2 to 8): that's 7 rows where both are listed.\n\nEach of these rows has \"remixed by\" as both names. So in the year 1995, there are 7 remixes where both worked together.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll collect the relevant cells:\n\nFor each row from index 2 to 8 (inclusive), check the \"remixed by\" column and \"year\".\n\nSo, for each of these rows, we need to include both the \"remixed by\" and \"year\" columns. But according to the instructions, I just need to list the relevant cells that support the claim.\n\nBut wait, perhaps only the \"remixed by\" and \"year\" are necessary. Let me see:\n\nFor each row where remixed by includes both names and year is 1995, we can include those rows' \"remixed by\" and \"year\".\n\nSo for rows 2-8 (indices 2 to 8), the columns \"remixed by\" and \"year\". That's 7 rows.\n\nBut in the output, I have to list each cell as {\"row_index\": x, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"} and same for year. Wait no, perhaps only the cells that are directly relevant: i.e., where both names are present in \"remixed by\" and year is 1995.\n\nAlternatively, since we're verifying two conditions per row (both remixed by and year), perhaps each of those cells is a separate entry.\n\nSo for rows 2-8, columns \"remixed by\" and \"year\".\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be:\n\nFor each row in 2-8, include {\"row_index\": x, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"} and {\"row_index\":x, \"column_name\": \"year\"}.\n\nBut that's a lot of entries. Alternatively, perhaps just include the rows where both remixed by are present and year is 1995.\n\nWait, let me think again: The claim states that Bertrand and Laurent did 7 remixes in 1995. So I need to find all rows where \"remixed by\" includes both names AND \"year\" is 1995.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows 2-8 (indices 2 to 8):\n\nRow2: remixed by both, year 1995\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: same\nRow7: same\nRow8: same\n\nThat's seven rows. So for each of these rows, the relevant cells are \"remixed by\" and \"year\".\n\nThus, for each row from 2 to 8:\n\n- remixed by column (to confirm both names)\n- year column (to confirm it's 1995)\n\nSo that's 7 rows x 2 columns = 14 entries in relevant_cells.\n\nBut perhaps the question only requires the cells where the condition is met, so for each row that meets both conditions, include their \"remixed by\" and \"year\".\n\nAlternatively, if a row has remixed by as both but year not 1995, it's irrelevant. But in our case, all these rows are from 1995.\n\nSo yes, the relevant cells would be for each of these seven rows, their \"remixed by\" and \"year\".\n\nThus, the JSON should include:\n\n\"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n  {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n  {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n  {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n  {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n  ... and so on for rows 4-8\n]\n\nBut writing all of them would be tedious. However, in the answer, I can represent this as seven entries each with their respective row indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just include the \"remixed by\" column for these rows, but then how do we confirm the year? Maybe it's better to include both columns for each row.\n\nSo in total, 14 entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is correct. There are exactly seven remixes in the year 1995 where both Bertrand and Laurent were involved as remixed by. These can be found in rows 2 through 8 of the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** \n   - The task is to verify if Bertrand and Laurent collaborated on seven remixes in 1995.\n   - Examine each row for the year \"1995\" and check if both names are listed under \"remixed by.\"\n\n2. **Analyze Each Row:**\n   - Rows 2 through 8 (indices 2 to 8) have the year \"1995.\"\n   - In each of these rows, \"remixed by\" includes both Bertrand and Laurent.\n\n3. **Count the Matches:**\n   - There are seven such rows where both conditions (\"remixed by\" includes both names and year is 1995) are satisfied.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is verified as true with exactly seven matches.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is correct. Bertrand and Laurent collaborated on seven remixes in the year 1995.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thirteenth: \"jxl remix\", 2003.\n14. Fourteenth: \"live version (recorded in 2006)\", year 2006. This matches part of the claim.\n15. Fifteenth: \"live version (recorded in 2009)\", year 2009. This also matches the other part of the claim.\n\nSo, I found two rows that have live versions recorded in 2006 and 2009, specifically row indices 13 and 14. \n\nI should check if there are any other live versions beyond these to ensure completeness, but from what I see, those are the only ones with years matching the claim.\n\nNow, confirming each point:\n\n- Is there a live version recorded in 2006? Yes (row index 13).\n- Is there a live version recorded in 2009? Yes (row index 14).\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nTo structure this as per instructions:\n\n- The answer is \"TRUE\".\n- Relevant cells are rows 13 and 14 under the 'version' column, but looking back, each relevant row has both version and year columns contributing to the claim. So, I'll include both 'row_2006' (index 13) and 'row_2009' (index 14), with their respective columns.\n\nWait, actually, in my count above, row indices start from 0. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: album version\n- ...\n- Row 11: live version 1996\n- Row 12: jxl remix 2003\n- Row 13: live version 2006 (recorded in 2006)\n- Row 14: live version 2009\n\nYes, so row indices are 13 and 14. Therefore, the relevant cells should include both rows under 'version' and their corresponding years.\n\nBut according to the instructions, for each cell that supports the claim, I need to note its row index and column name. Since the versions indicate it's a live version, and the year columns show the respective years, both are necessary. However, in the response example, they only include one column per relevant cell, so perhaps focusing on 'version' or 'year'? Let me think.\n\nThe claim is about \"live version... record in 2006 and 2009.\" So each of these requires checking two things: that it's a live version and the year. Therefore, for each of those rows (13 and 14), both the 'version' and 'year' columns are relevant.\n\nBut to keep it concise as per the example, perhaps just including the 'row_2006' and 'row_2009' under their respective years would suffice. Alternatively, perhaps each row index is mentioned once with both column names? Wait, no, the example shows separate objects for each cell.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\n{\n   \"answer\":  \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\":  [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nSo each relevant cell is a separate object. Therefore, for the two live versions in 2006 and 2009, each row has both 'version' and 'year' columns that are relevant.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to list only the 'row_2006' as version and year, same with 'row_2009'. However, in the problem statement, the claim is about \"live versions\" being recorded in those years. So for each row, both the fact that it's a live version (version column) and the year are necessary.\n\nTherefore, I should include two objects per relevant row: one for 'version' and another for 'year'.\n\nWait, but let me check the claim again: \"live version of the song be record in the year 2006 and 2009.\" So each live version must have both a version type (live) and the correct year. Therefore, for each relevant row, I need to include both columns.\n\nSo:\n\nFor row index 13 (recorded in 2006):\n- column_name: 'version' because it's a live version.\n- column_name: 'year' because the year is 2006.\n\nSimilarly, for row index 14:\n- column_name: 'version'\n- column_name: 'year'\n\nBut wait, looking at the table structure:\n\nEach row has 'version', 'year', and other columns. So to confirm a live version in 2006, I need both that the version is 'live' and the year is 2006.\n\nSo, for each of those rows (13 and 14), both their 'version' and 'year' are relevant cells.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should list all relevant cells. So in this case, four entries:\n\n- row 13, version\n- row 13, year\n- row 14, version\n- row 14, year\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, they only included one column per cell, so perhaps I should include all four.\n\nBut maybe in the response, for each relevant row that contributes to the claim, we can list both columns. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to note the rows where 'version' is live and 'year' matches 2006 or 2009.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just including the rows with their respective years is enough since the version is already in those rows. But I think it's better to include both columns per row because each contributes to verifying the claim.\n\nBut let me check if that's necessary. For example, in the response, if a cell has 'live' in version and 2006 in year, then both are relevant for supporting that part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, I think it's correct to include all four cells: row13 version, row13 year, row14 version, row14 year.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to list just the rows where live versions exist and their respective years. So in this case:\n\n- For 2006: row 13 with 'live' version and year 2006\n- For 2009: row 14 with 'live' version and year 2009\n\nTherefore, each of these rows contains both pieces of information necessary to confirm the claim for that specific year.\n\nSo in the relevant_cells array, I would include two objects per supporting fact:\n\nFor 2006:\n- {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"version\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n\nSimilarly, for 2009:\n- {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"version\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n\nSo total of four objects.\n\nBut I think that's overkill. Maybe each row index is sufficient if both columns are checked within that row. Alternatively, perhaps the example expects just the rows where the versions and years match.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, you can have multiple columns per cell contributing to a claim. So in our case, for each supporting year (2006 and 2009), we need both the 'version' column indicating it's a live version and the 'year' column indicating that specific year.\n\nTherefore, I think including all four cells is appropriate.\n\nBut perhaps the example only included one column per row because that was sufficient to demonstrate the point. In our case, since each supporting cell requires two pieces of information from different columns in the same row, we should include both for each relevant row.\n\nAlternatively, if you consider that the combination of a live version and specific year is found in those rows, perhaps just listing those two rows as contributing cells is sufficient, but I'm not sure if it's necessary to list all four individual cell references.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nThe user asked about an increase in revenue and number of employees. The response included two separate cells: one for revenue (row 0) and another for employees (row 1). Each contributing cell was listed as a separate object.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, each year's claim is supported by a row that has both the version type and the year. So perhaps for each year, we need to include two cells: one indicating it's a live version and another showing the correct year.\n\nTherefore, since 2006 is supported by row 13 with 'version' and 'year', and 2009 by row 14 with both columns, then the relevant_cells should have four objects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of those rows as a whole supports one part of the claim (e.g., row 13 supports the 2006 part, row14 supports the 2009). But I think to adhere strictly to the example, where each cell contributing to the answer is listed, then four entries are needed.\n\nBut perhaps that's not necessary because each row in this case contributes two pieces of information (version and year) but for a single claim point. However, since the user might just need to know which rows contain live versions with those specific years, maybe it's sufficient to list each row once, without specifying both columns, as they implicitly include both.\n\nBut looking at the example again: in their case, two different columns (Revenue and Employees) were used from different rows. So for our case, perhaps each relevant row is just one entry per contributing fact, but since both version and year are needed per row, maybe it's better to list all four cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should format the response as:\n\n- For 2006: include row13 with 'version' and 'year'\n- For 2009: include row14 with 'version' and 'year'\n\nBut in terms of individual cell references, that would mean four separate objects.\n\nHowever, perhaps the user expects just the rows to be listed once each. So let me try:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"version\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"version\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n\nSo four entries in the relevant_cells array.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is necessary. Maybe just two entries:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n\nBecause those are the specific cells that match the years asked for (assuming that each row also has 'live' in version). Alternatively, if the user wants to confirm both aspects, then all four.\n\nIn any case, perhaps it's best to provide all four as they directly contribute to verifying the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me consider another angle. The question is about whether there are live versions for 2006 and 2009. So each of those years would be supported by a row where 'version' is 'live' and 'year' matches. Therefore, each such supporting fact requires two cells: the version cell in that row and the year cell in that same row.\n\nTherefore, for 2006, we have to check both cells in row13, so include both entries. Similarly for 2009, both cells in row14 need to be checked. Therefore, including all four is correct.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nAnswer: Yes, there are live versions available for both years.\nRelevant cells:\n- Row13's version and year\n- Row14's version and year\n\nThus, the relevant_cells array should include four entries as above.\n</think>\n\nTo confirm that there are live versions for the years 2006 and 2009, we need to check both the 'version' and 'year' columns in the respective rows.\n\n- For **2006**: The row with index 13 has a version marked as 'live' and the year specified as 2006.\n- For **2009**: The row with index 14 has a version marked as 'live' and the year specified as 2009.\n\nThus, both years have live versions available.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- `Row 13: Version`\n- `Row 13: Year`\n- `Row 14: Version`\n- `Row 14: Year`",

    "claim": "bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with less than 7 of the remixes in the year 1995",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with less than 7 of the remixes in the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two people: Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat. The claim states that they have done less than 7 remixes in the year 1995.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to focus on rows where both 'remixed by' includes either Bertrand or Laurent and the year is 1995. So, my first step is to filter all entries from 1995.\n\nNow, let's go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Album version, remixed by '-', so no.\n2. **Row 1**: Single version, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat. Year 1995. Count this as one remix.\n3. **Row 2**: No voice remix edit, remixed by both Laurent and Bertrand. Year 1995. This is another remix, so count increases to two.\n4. **Row 3**: Extra large remix, same remixers. Year 1995. Count goes up to three.\n5. **Row 4**: Distorded dance mix, again both remixers. Year 1995. Now at four.\n6. **Row 5**: New remix edit, same as above. Year 1995. Five now.\n7. **Row 6**: Single dance mix, same remixers. Year 1995. Six remixes.\n8. **Row 7**: New remix edit (Germany), same team. Year 1995. Seven remixes here.\n9. **Row 8**: German radio edit, same. Year 1995. That's eight.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says less than seven, but we've already reached eight in the year 1995 alone. Let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nRows 9 and onwards are from years after 1995 (1996, 2003, etc.), so they don't affect this count. So focusing only on rows where the year is 1995:\n\n- Rows 1 through 8: All have 'remixed by' as either Laurent alone or both Laurent and Bertrand.\n- Each of these rows represents a remix in 1995.\n\nCounting them, that's eight remixes. Since the claim says \"less than seven,\" but there are actually eight, which is more than seven, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nSo, to summarize, I looked at each row with the year 1995 and counted how many times Bertrand or Laurent were involved in the remixing. The total was eight, exceeding the claimed less than seven.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the 'remixed by' column includes either Bertrand Chtenet or Laurent Boutonnat and the year is 1995.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows from 1995:** Filter all rows with the year 1995.\n2. **Check 'remixed by' Column:** For each of these rows, check if it mentions either Bertrand Chtenet or Laurent Boutonnat.\n3. **Count the Remixes:** Count how many such entries there are.\n\nAfter reviewing the table:\n\n- There are eight remixes from 1995 involving both Bertrand and Laurent. Thus, the claim of less than seven is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user is asking whether there's a live version recorded before 2006. So I'm looking for any rows in the table that have 'live version' under the 'version' column and their corresponding year is before 2006.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: version, length, album, remixed by, year.\n\nI'll scan through the rows to find entries with \"live version\" in the 'version' field. \n\nRow 10: live version (recorded in 1996) - Year is 1996.\nRow 12: live version (recorded in 2006) - Year is 2006.\nRow 13: live version (recorded in 2009) - Year is 2009.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row indices 10, 12, and 13. Their years are 1996, 2006, and 2009 respectively.\n\nThe claim states that a live version was recorded before 2006. Row 10 has the year 1996 which is indeed before 2006.

The claim says: \"2 remixes of the song were released after 2003 by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL respectively.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various versions of a song with details like version name, length, album, remixer, and year.\n\nI need to check for any remixes released after 2003. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Rows 0 to 8 are all from 1995. So no help there.\n- Row 9: UK Remix, year is 1996. Still not after 2003.\n- Row 10: Live version in 1996. Not relevant.\n- Row 11: JXL Remix, remixed by Junkie XL, year 2003. Wait, the claim says \"after 2003.\" So 2003 is not after. Hmm, but maybe it's a typo and they meant 2003 or later? Or perhaps considering 2003 as included.\n- Rows 12: Live version in 2006, but remixed by nobody, so not a remix.\n- Row 13: Live version in 2009, again no remixer mentioned.\n\nSo the only remix after 1995 is row 11 (JXL Remix) in 2003. But Richard Dekkard's UK remix was in 1996. The claim mentions two remixes by these two artists after 2003, but I don't see any other remixes from either of them post-2003. Junkie XL only did the 2003 remix.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. Are there any other remixers besides Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet? Yes, Richard Dekkard in row 9 (1996) and Junkie XL in row 11 (2003). \n\nThe claim says two remixes were released after 2003 by those two. But Junkie XL's is exactly in 2003, not after. Richard Dekkard has nothing after 2003 either.
