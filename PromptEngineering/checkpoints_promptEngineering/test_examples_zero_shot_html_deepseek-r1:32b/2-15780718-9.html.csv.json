    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy\n2. They had 14 rebounds each.\n3. These were the highest rebounds in a game against Miami.\n\nI need to check if there's any game where both these players had 14 rebounds, or if one of them did, and whether it was against Miami.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find games against Miami and see who had high rebounds in those games.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Game 73 vs Detroit. Not Miami.\n- Row 1: Game 74 vs New York. Not Miami.\n- Row 2: Game 75 vs New Jersey. No, still not Miami.\n- Row 3: Game 76 vs Miami. Here it is.\n\nIn row 3 (index 3), the opponent is Miami. Let's check the \"high rebounds\" column for this game. The entry says \"jelani mccoy (14)\". So Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds in that game. But where is Michael Bradley? I don't see his name here. He might have other stats, but in terms of high rebounds, only Jelani is mentioned with 14.\n\nWait, maybe in another game against Miami? Let me check further down.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Row 8: Game 81 vs Miami again. The \"high rebounds\" column here shows \"jerome williams (17)\". So Jerome Williams had 17 rebounds, which is higher than 14.\n\nSo in Game 76 (row index 3), only Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds against Miami, and Michael Bradley isn't listed there. In the next game against Miami, row index 8, neither of them have the highest rebounds; it's someone else with 17.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had the highest rebounds (14) against Miami isn't fully supported because in the only relevant games, only one of them had 14, and in another game, a different player had more rebounds. So the claim is not accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds each as the highest against Miami. However, checking the table shows that only Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds in one game against Miami, while Michael Bradley wasn't listed with such a high rebound count in that game. Another game against Miami showed a higher rebound by someone else.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
