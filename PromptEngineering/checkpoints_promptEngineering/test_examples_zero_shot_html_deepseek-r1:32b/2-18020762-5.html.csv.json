    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the 200 m individual medley took place on 19 December 2009.\" I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row of the table looking for entries related to the 200 m individual medley. Scanning down, I see that at row index 36 (assuming counting starts from 0), there's an entry for \"200 m individual medley.\" Let me check what's in this row.\n\nThe relevant cells for this claim would be:\n- **Event Name**: To confirm it's the 200 m individual medley.\n- **Date**: To verify if the event took place on 19 December 2009.\n\nLooking at row index 36, under \"column_name\" for the event name, it is indeed \"200 m individual medley.\" The date listed in this row is \"19 december 2009,\" which matches the claim exactly. \n\nI should also ensure there are no other entries for 200 m individual medley on different dates that might contradict this claim. Scanning through, I don't see any other occurrences of this event name with a different date. Therefore, the information provided in row index 36 supports the claim without any discrepancies.\n\nHence, based on the table data, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the 200 m individual medley be the only event on 19 december 2009\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is saying that on December 19, 2009, the only event was the 200 m individual medley. To verify this, I need to check two things: first, if there's an entry for the 200 m individual medley on that date, and second, whether that date has any other events listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different event with details like the event name, result, date, competition, and location. The columns are: Event, Result, Date, Competition, Location.\n\nI'll go through each row to find all entries where the Date is December 19, 2009.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\nRow 17: 400 m individual medley on December 18, 2009.\nRow 16: 200 m individual medley on December 19, 2009. So that's one event.\nContinuing further down the table...\n\nWait, after row 17, there are more events:\n\nRow 18: 450 m freestyle relay on March 18, 2004.\nRow 19: 4x100 m freestyle relay on December 17, 2011.\nRow 20: 4x200 m freestyle relay on December 15, 2010.\nRow 21: 4x50 m medley relay on March 17, 2000.\nRow 22: 4x100 m medley relay on December 16, 2011.\n\nWait a minute, did I miss any other rows with December 19, 2009?\n\nLooking back up:\n\nLet me check each row again. Row 5 is the 200 m individual medley on December 19, 2009. Then I need to see if there are any other events on that same date.\n\nGoing through all rows:\n\nRow 0: Event not relevant.\nRow 1: Date October 17, 2004.\nRow 2: August 6, 2009.\n...\nWait, maybe I miscounted the row indices. Let me recount starting from 0.\n\nThe table has multiple rows; let's list all events with their dates:\n\nLooking through each event:\n\n- 450 m freestyle relay on March 18, 2004\n- 4x100 m freestyle relay on December 17, 2011\n- 4x200 m freestyle relay on December 15, 2010\n- 4x50 m medley relay on March 17, 2000\n- 4x100 m medley relay on December 16, 2011\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me go back to the relevant section.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the rows with dates around 2009:\n\nLooking for any other events on December 19, 2009 besides row 5 (which is 200 m individual medley).\n\nRow indices might be off because the table starts at 0. Let me list all the events and their dates:\n\n1. 450 m freestyle relay - March 18, 2004\n2. 4x100 m freestyle relay - December 17, 2011\n3. 4x200 m freestyle relay - December 15, 2010\n4. 4x50 m medley relay - March 17, 2000\n5. 4x100 m medley relay - December 16, 2011\n\nWait, that's not correct. I think I'm miscounting because the table has more rows. Let me go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices start from 0.\n\nRows with Date '19 december 2009':\n\nRow 5: Event is 200 m individual medley, Date is 19 December 2009.\n\nIs there another row with Date 19 December 2009?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 4: 4x50 m freestyle relay on March 8, 2006.\n- Row 5: 200 m individual medley on December 19, 2009.\n- Row 6: 4x50 m freestyle relay on December 13, 2008.\n- Row 7: 4x100 m freestyle relay on December 11, 2011.\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the row numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go through each event in order:\n\nLooking at each row from top to bottom:\n\nRow 0: Event not listed, probably irrelevant.\n\nRow 1: Event is \"450 m freestyle relay\" on March 18, 2004.\n\nRow 2: \"4x100 m freestyle relay\" on December 17, 2011.\n\nRow 3: \"4x200 m freestyle relay\" on December 15, 2010.\n\nRow 4: \"4x50 m medley relay\" on March 17, 2000.\n\nRow 5: \"4x100 m medley relay\" on December 16, 2011.\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense. I think I'm miscounting because the table is longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant rows are earlier in the table. Let me check all events:\n\nLooking for any event with Date '19 December 2009':\n\nI find one such event: \"200 m individual medley\" on that date (row 5).\n\nNow, I need to ensure there are no other events on that same date.\n\nGoing through each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Not relevant.\n- Row 1: March 18, 2004.\n- Row 2: December 17, 2011.\n- Row 3: December 15, 2010.\n- Row 4: March 17, 2000.\n- Row 5: December 19, 2009. (200 m individual medley)\n- Row 6: December 13, 2008.\n- Row 7: December 11, 2011.\nWait, this doesn't seem right because the table goes beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing other rows where Date is December 19, 2009. Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking through each row's date column:\n\n- Any row with '19 December 2009'? Only row 5 seems to have that date.\n\nSo, there's only one event on that date: the 200 m individual medley. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 200 m individual medley was the only event on December 19, 2009. Upon reviewing the table, I found that there is exactly one entry for this date and event. No other events are listed for December 19, 2009.\n\n**Answer: True**\n\nThe 200 m individual medley was indeed the only event on December 19, 2009, as per the provided data.",
