The score is 1-2. This doesn't involve Birmingham City.\n  \n- Row 1: Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton on 11 March 1984. Different date and teams, so not relevant.\n\n- Row 2: Southampton vs Sheffield Wednesday on 20 March 1984 (a replay). Again, different date and teams.\n\n- Row 3: Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County on 10 March 1984. Neither team is Birmingham City.\n\n- Row 4: Derby County vs Plymouth Argyle on 14 March 1984 (replay). Doesn't match the date or teams.\n\n- Row 5: Birmingham City vs Watford on 10 March 1984.

I need to determine whether the claim \"on march 19 , 1984 , plymouth argyle play derby county\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. Each row represents a match between two teams with their respective scores and the date it took place.\n\nThe claim mentions \"march 19, 1984\" as the date when Plymouth Argyle plays against Derby County. I'll scan through each row to see if there's any entry that matches this date and team pairing.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Date is March 10, 1984. Doesn't match.\n- Row 1: Date is March 11, 1984. Not matching.\n- Row 2 (replay): March 20, 1984. Close but not the 19th.\n- Row 3: March 10 again. No luck.\n- Row 4 (replay): March 14, 1984. Still not the 19th.\n- Row 5: March 10, same as others.\n\nI notice that there's no match on March 19, 1984 in any of the rows. The closest is March 20 for a replay between Southampton and Sheffield Wednesday. Therefore, since Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County played on March 10 (row 3) and had a replay on March 14 (row 4), there's no entry for March 19. \n\nSo the claim isn't supported by the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the score of the sheffield wednesday versus southampton game be 0 - 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". Each row represents a match with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton. So I should look for rows where either the home or away team is one of these, and check if their opponents are the other team in question.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row (index 0) has Notts County vs Everton. Not relevant.\n2. Second row (index 1): Sheffield Wednesday as home team and Southampton as away team. This fits our teams. The score here is 0-0.\n3. Third row (index 2) is a replay, with Southampton at home against Sheffield Wednesday again. Score was 5-1.\n\nSo the initial game between these two teams was on March 11, 1984, with a 0-0 scoreline. The claim refers to this specific game because it's about their first meeting before any replays.\n\nI should note that the replay exists but isn't part of the original claim. The claim is specifically about the \"Sheffield Wednesday versus Southampton\" game, which in the table is at row index 1 with a score of 0-0.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell for verification is row 1's \"score\" column. \n\nSince the score matches exactly as stated in the claim, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"with a tie no 2 , sheffield wednesday be home team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the claim. It mentions two main pieces of information: \"tie no 2\" and \"sheffield wednesday being the home team.\" My task is to check if these two conditions are correctly represented in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for \"tie no,\" \"home team,\" \"score,\" \"away team,\" and \"date.\" Each row represents a match with these details. The claim specifies \"tie no 2,\" so I need to find the row where the tie number is 2.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Tie No 1, Home Team Notts County.\n2. Row 1: Tie No 2, Home Team Sheffield Wednesday.\n3. Row 2: Tie No replay, Home Team Southampton.\n4. Row 3: Tie No 3, Home Team Plymouth Argyle.\n5. Row 4: Tie No replay, Home Team Derby County.\n6. Row 5: Tie No 4, Home Team Birmingham City.\n\nSo the row with Tie No 2 is row index 1. In this row, the home team is indeed Sheffield Wednesday, and the away team is Southampton. The score was 0-0 on March 11, 1984.\n\nWait a minute, but I should also check if there are any other rows that might have Tie No 2 or involve Sheffield Wednesday as the home team elsewhere. In this case, row index 2 mentions Sheffield Wednesday again, but it's listed as the away team in a replay. However, the claim specifically refers to Tie No 2, which is only present in row index 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim accurately states that for tie number 2, Sheffield Wednesday was the home team. The relevant cell here is the \"home team\" column in row 1 (index 1). There's no need to consider other rows since the claim doesn't mention any others, and we've confirmed it against the table.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being row index 1 and the column name \"home team.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}]}\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a specific table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the score for the game where Birmingham City be the away team on 10 March 1984 be 1 - 3.\" So, we're looking for a game involving Birmingham City as the away team on that specific date and checking if their score was 1-3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has six rows with details about different matches. Each row includes information like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. \n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones fit the criteria in the claim. \n\nStarting with Row 0: It's a game between Notts County (home) and Everton (away). The date is March 10, 1984, but Birmingham City isn't involved here. So this isn't relevant.\n\nRow 1: Sheffield Wednesday vs. Southampton on March 11, 1984. Not the right date or teams.\n\nRow 2: Another match between Southampton and Sheffield Wednesday, but it's a replay on March 20, 1984. Still not matching our criteria.\n\nMoving to Row 3: Plymouth Argyle vs. Derby County on March 10, 1984. Birmingham City isn't here either.\n\nRow 4 is another replay between Derby and Plymouth on March 14, still doesn't fit.\n\nFinally, Row 5: Birmingham City as the home team against Watford on March 10, 1984. The score is 1-3, but wait\u2014Birmingham City is listed as the home team here, not the away team as per the claim. That's a discrepancy.\n\nSo, according to the table, Birmingham City was the home team in that game, and their score was indeed 1-3. However, since the claim specifies them as the away team, it doesn't match the information provided. Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the data given.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Birmingham City were the away team with a score of 1-3 on March 10, 1984.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"plymouth argyle play the away team derby county after 14 march 1984.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim means.\n\n- \"plymouth argyle\" is mentioned as a team.\n- They are playing against \"derby county.\"\n- In the context of the table, I need to determine if Plymouth Argyle was the away team when they played Derby County after March 14, 1984.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, date.\n\nEach row represents a match between two teams on a specific date. The \"tie no\" column seems to indicate the sequence or type of matches, including replays as separate entries.\n\nNow, I'll go through each relevant row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0 (index 0):**\n   - Home team: Notts County\n   - Away team: Everton\n   - Date: March 10, 1984\n\nThis doesn't involve Plymouth Argyle or Derby County, so it's irrelevant.\n\n2. **Row 1 (index 1):**\n   - Home team: Sheffield Wednesday\n   - Away team: Southampton\n   - Date: March 11, 1984\n\nAgain, not relevant to the teams in question.\n\n3. **Row 2 (index 2):**\n   - Tie no: replay\n   - Home team: Southampton\n   - Away team: Sheffield Wednesday\n   - Date: March 20, 1984\n\nThis is a replay of the previous match between Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton. Not relevant to our claim.\n\n4. **Row 3 (index 3):**\n   - Tie no: 3\n   - Home team: Plymouth Argyle\n   - Away team: Derby County\n   - Date: March 10, 1984\n\nHere, Plymouth Argyle is the home team against Derby County on March 10, which is before March 14. So, this doesn't fit the \"after\" condition.\n\n5. **Row 4 (index 4):**\n   - Tie no: replay\n   - Home team: Derby County\n   - Away team: Plymouth Argyle\n   - Date: March 14, 1984\n\nThis is a replay of the previous match between Plymouth Argyle and Derby County. In this row, Plymouth Argyle is now the away team, and the date is exactly on March 14. The claim says \"after\" March 14, so technically, March 14 isn't after; it's the same day.\n\n6. **Row 5 (index 5):**\n   - Tie no: 4\n   - Home team: Birmingham City\n   - Away team: Watford\n   - Date: March 10, 1984\n\nNot relevant to our teams.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe claim states that Plymouth Argyle plays as the away team against Derby County after March 14. From the table, the only match between these two teams is on March 10 and then a replay on March 14. The replay is exactly on March 14, but not after. Also, in that replay, Plymouth was the away team.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where Plymouth Argyle plays Derby County as an away team after March 14, 1984.
