    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism say still not part of BB Pilipinas from 1973 thru 1986.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems that there was a category called \"Tourism\" in Binibining Pilipinas (BBP) and the claim is stating that this particular title or category wasn't awarded every year between 1973 and 1986. So I need to check each year from 1973 up until 1986 to see if \"Tourism\" was part of BBP or not.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it has columns: Year, Binibining Pilipinas, First Runner-up, Second Runner-up, Third Runner-up, Fourth Runner-up, Fifth Runner-up. The claim mentions that from 1973 to 1986, \"Tourism\" wasn't part of BBP. So I should check each year in this range and see if any of the cells under the relevant columns mention \"Tourism.\"\n\nWait, but how is \"Tourism\" represented in the table? It might be that the \"Binibining Pilipinas\" column includes the title or category. For example, in some rows, the name under \"Binibining Pilipinas\" could include a subtitle indicating the category, like \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism.\" But looking at the data provided, I don't see any such entries.\n\nLet me go through each year from 1973 to 1986 and check if \"Tourism\" appears in any of the relevant columns. \n\nStarting with 1973: The Binibining Pilipinas is named as Maria Lourdes Corazon Dimayuga. No mention of Tourism here.\n\nThen 1974: Binibining is Rosario Nadia Veloso. Again, no \"Tourism\" title.\n\nContinuing this way through each year up to 1986:\n\n- 1975: Ligaya Lourdes Cayetano\n- 1976: Maria Theresa Feliciano\n- 1977: Consuelo Felicitas Rosales\n- 1978: Anna Rita Padilla\n- 1979: Maria Fe Garchitorena\n- 1980: Marilou Diaz-Abaya\n- 1981: Margarita Fidelia Pe\u00f1a\n- 1982: Maria Cristina Rosales Pineda\n- 1983: Mary Ann Vea\n- 1984: Tita Angala\n- 1985: Noella Maricris V. Labrador\n- 1986: Maria Lourdes Jimenez\n\nIn none of these years does the Binibining Pilipinas title include \"Tourism.\" Additionally, looking at the other columns (First Runner-up, etc.), there's no mention of Tourism in any of them either.\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I missing something? Could it be that the Tourism category was introduced later or perhaps not listed here? The claim is specifically about 1973 through 1986. If from 1973 to 1986, there's no entry with \"Tourism\" in any of these columns, then the claim stands.\n\nSo, based on the table provided, it seems that from 1973 up until 1986, the Tourism category was not awarded as part of Binibining Pilipinas. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows no mention of \"Tourism\" in any relevant columns for the years 1973 to 1986.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

It mentions two things:\n1. Maria Luisa Jimenez won the title in 1987.\n2. Maria Muriel Moral won it in 1988.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll check each year to see who was selected.\n\nStarting with 1987: The row index for 1987 is 16 (since counting starts from 0). In that row, the \"Titleholder\" column should list Maria Luisa Jimenez. Scanning the cells, yes, she's listed there.\n\nNext, checking 1988: The row index is 17. The claim says Maria Muriel Moral was the winner the following year. Looking at the 1988 row under \"Titleholder,\" I see her name as well.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss MajA Pilipinas in 1987 and Maria Muriel Moral in 1988.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"maria lourdes enriquez win as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It says that Maria Lourdes Enriquez won Binibining Pilipinas-International (BPI) in the year following the year when Jessie Alice Salones Dixson won BPI.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a year from 1964 to 1991, with columns for various titles like \"Binibining Pilipinas\", \"First Runner-up\", etc. The claim is about two consecutive years where one winner comes after another specific winner.\n\nLet me identify the relevant cells. I need to find entries for both Maria Lourdes Enriquez and Jessie Alice Salones Dixson under the \"Binibining Pilipinas\" column (column name: Binning Pilipinas) and check if they are in consecutive years with the latter coming after the former.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- For the year 1987, the \"Binning Pilipinas\" column has Geraldine Edith Asis. Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is listed under the same year but under a different title, perhaps \"First Runner-up\"? Wait, no\u2014looking at the columns: in 1986, Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is listed under \"Binning Pilipinas.\" So she won in 1986.\n\nNext, I check the following year, which would be 1987. In 1987, the \"Binning Pilipinas\" column has Geraldine Edith Asis, not Maria Lourdes Enriquez. \n\nWait, let me double-check: looking at row indexes. The table starts with 1964 as row 0. Let's count:\n\nRow 25 is 1987 (since 1964 is row 0, adding up each year until 1987). In that row, \"Binning Pilipinas\" is Geraldine Edith Asis. So Maria Lourdes Enriquez isn't listed as the winner in 1987.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says Maria won the year after Jessie. If Jessie won in 1986 (as per row 24), then the next year would be 1987, which is row 25. In that row, Geraldine Edith Asis is listed as Binning Pilipinas, not Maria.\n\nWait, but looking back at row 24 (1986), Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is in the \"Binning Pilipinas\" column. Then in row 25 (1987), Geraldine Edith Asis is in that same column. So Maria Lourdes Enriquez isn't listed as Binning Pilipinas in 1987.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something\u2014let me check all years after 1986 to see if Maria ever won BPI.\n\nLooking further:\n\nIn row 24: 1986 - Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is the winner.\n\nRow 25: 1987 - Geraldine Edith Asis\n\nRow 26: 1988 - Perfida Limpin?\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\n- 1984 (row 22): Maria Cristina Recto? No, that's under a different column.\n\nLooking for \"Maria Lourdes Enriquez\" in the table\u2014when I scan through the years, I find her name in the 1987 row. Let me check: In row 25 (1987), she is listed under which column? Looking at the columns:\n\n- Binning Pilipinas: Geraldine Edith Asis\n- First Runner-up: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- Second Runner-up: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nSo in 1987, Maria Lourdes was the first runner-up, not the winner. Therefore, she didn't win BPI that year.\n\nWait, but is there any other year where she might have won? Let me check further down:\n\nIn row 26 (1988), \"Binning Pilipinas\" is Perfida Limpin.\n\nRow 27: 1989\u2014Sarah Jane Paez as BPI.\n\nRow 28: 1990\u2014Germelina Leah Padilla.\n\nRow 29 and 30 are both for 1991, with different winners listed in each row. Wait, that's odd\u2014they might have had a re-election or something.\n\nIn any case, Maria Lourdes Enriquez is only listed as First Runner-up in 1987. She never won BPI. Therefore, the claim that she won the year after Jessie (who won in 1986) isn't accurate because she didn't win at all.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Jessie Alice Salones Dixson: row 24 (1986), column \"Binning Pilipinas.\"\n\n- For Maria Lourdes Enriquez: row 25 (1987), column \"First Runner-up.\"\n\nSince she didn't win in 1987, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all rows again to ensure I haven't missed any instance where Maria won BPI.\n\nLooking back from row 0 to 30, I don't see Maria Lourdes Enriquez listed as \"Binning Pilipinas\" in any year except maybe if she's in another column. Wait, is there a possibility that in some years, the title might be split or something? Let me check each row.\n\nNo, in all rows, the columns are consistent: Binning Pilipinas is always the first column after the year. I don't see her as the winner anywhere else except in 1987 as First Runner-up.\n\nSo conclusion: The claim is incorrect because Maria Lourdes Enriquez did not win BPI the year after Jessie; she didn't win at all that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maria Lourdes Enriquez won Binibining Pilipinas-International (BPI) the year following Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's victory. \n\n1. **Identifying Jessie's Win**: In 1986 (Row 24), Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is listed under \"Binibining Pilipinas.\"\n\n2. **Checking Maria's Status in 1987**: The next year, 1987 (Row 25), Geraldine Edith Asis won BPI, while Maria Lourdes Enriquez was the First Runner-up.\n\n3. **Maria's Further Entries**: Scanning all rows, Maria Lourdes Enriquez is only listed as a runner-up and not as the winner in any year after 1986.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is false because Maria did not win BPI the year after Jessie; she was only a runner-up. Therefore, there are no valid cells supporting the claim, making it incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": {\n        \"year_jessie_won\": 1986,\n        \"year_maria_was_runner_up\": 1987,\n        \"maria_did_not_win\": true\n    }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"selina manalad and jennette fernando be the first runner-ups when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win the binibining pilipinas - universe.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse what the claim is saying. It mentions that Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez are winners of Binibining Pilipinas-Universe, with Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando as their first runner-ups.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1972 to 1991. Each row has columns for Miss Universe, Miss International, Miss World, etc., but I'm particularly interested in the \"Miss Universe\" column since that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each year and check who won Miss Universe and who were the runners-up.\n\nStarting from 1972:\n- 1972: Liza Rosales as Miss Universe. No mention of Anjanette or Maria Lourdes here.\n- 1973: Gloria Diaz wins. Not relevant.\n- 1974: Margarita Moran. Not our girls.\n- 1975: Elizabeth Gabay. No.\n- 1976: Corazon Aquino. Wait, that's the future president, but she won a beauty pageant? Hmm, maybe not the same Corazon Aquino, but regardless, not Anjanette or Maria Lourdes.\n- 1977: No data for Miss Universe.\n- 1978: Lita Barros. Not relevant.\n- 1979: Luz Marina. No.\n- 1980: Dely Atayde wins, runners-up include Corazon Aquino and Maricar Bantug. Still not our girls.\n- 1981: Marlene Ocampo. No match.\n- 1982: Susan de la Vega. Runners-up are N/A for Miss Universe in this table.\n- 1983: Rosario Guerrero wins, runners-up include Maria Felicidad and Gliceria Cordero.\n- 1984: No data.\n- 1985: Tanya Rosa. Runners-up include Mary Ann Bernardo and Marilou de Leon.\n- 1986: No Miss Universe winner listed.\n- 1987: Gerielyn Aquino, runners-up are Maria Lourdes Enriquez and Maria Luisa Jimenez. Wait, here's a mention of Maria Lourdes, but as a runner-up in Miss International, not sure if that's relevant yet.\n- 1988: No data for Miss Universe winner, only runners-up listed: Maria Anthea Robles and others.\n- 1989: Sarah Jane Paez wins, runners-up are Lilia Andanar, Jeannette Hilario. Not our girls.\n- 1990: Germerolina Padilla wins, runners-up include Jennifer Pingree and Precious Tongko.\n- 1991: There's two rows for 1991. First row lists Anjanette Abayari as Miss Universe, Maria Patricia Betita, Maria Lourdes Gonzalez, not awarded, Selina Manalad, Jennette Fernando. Second row seems to list a different set but also includes Maria Lourdes and Selina.\n\nWait, so in 1991, the first row shows Anjanette Abayari as Miss Universe, with runners-up being Maria Patricia Betita, Maria Lourdes Gonzalez (but it says \"not awarded\"), Selina Manalad, Jennette Fernando. The second row seems to have a different configuration, but I'm not sure if that's conflicting or supplementary data.\n\nThe claim is about Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez winning the title, with Selina and Jennette as first runners-up. From the table, in 1991, Anjanette Abayari is listed as Miss Universe in the first row, but Maria Lourdes Gonzalez is in a separate column (maybe Miss World or another title). The claim says they both won, which might not align since typically only one person wins Miss Universe.\n\nLooking back, maybe I misread. If Anjanette and Maria Lourdes are both winning, perhaps it's referring to different titles? Or perhaps the table is structured differently.\n\nWait, in 1991, there are two rows. The first row has Anjanette Abayari as Miss Universe, with Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando as runners-up (column names might be different). The second row lists Maria Lourdes Gonzalez as Miss Universe, but that doesn't make sense since typically only one person can win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is listing multiple winners or perhaps there was a co-win? I'm not sure. But in reality, Anjanette Abayari won Miss Universe 1991, and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez might have been another contestant but didn't win that title. So the claim that both won might be incorrect.\n\nLooking at runners-up: Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando are listed as first runners-up in the first 1991 row when Anjanette Abayari is the winner. The second row lists a different set, but it's unclear if that's accurate or perhaps an error.\n\nSo putting this together, in 1991, Anjanette Abayari was Miss Universe, and Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were first runners-up. Maria Lourdes Gonzalez was not the winner of Miss Universe; she might have been a runner-up in another category or perhaps in a different pageant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially correct regarding Selina and Jennette being first runners-up when Anjanette won. However, Maria Lourdes Gonzalez did not win Miss Universe that year, so the part about both winning is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won Binibining Pilipinas-Universe with Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando as first runners-up. Based on the table:\n\n- **Anjanette Abayari** did win Miss Universe in 1991.\n- **Selina Manalad** and **Jennette Fernando** were listed as first runners-up alongside her.\n- However, **Maria Lourdes Gonzalez** was not a winner but appeared as a runner-up in another category or possibly in a different pageant.\n\nThus, the claim is partially accurate regarding Selina and Jennette being first runners-up when Anjanette won. Maria Lourdes did not win Miss Universe that year.\n\nAnswer: The claim is partially correct; only Anjanette Abayari was the winner with Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando as first runners-up. Maria Lourdes Gonzalez did not win Miss Universe in 1991.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism do not start until the year 1987.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that the Binibining Pilipinas (Bb. Pilipinas) pageant for Tourism category began in 1987 and didn't exist before that year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various years from 1962 up to 1991 with different categories of winners: Bb. Pilipinas, Bb. Mundo, etc., but I don't see a specific column labeled for Tourism. The columns are Year, Title, Miss Universe, Miss International, Miss World, and then other pageants or titles.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to when the Bb. Pilipinas - Tourism category was introduced. If that's the case, then checking each year in the table might show whether this specific title existed before 1987.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- The earliest years listed are 1962, and I see titles like Bb. Pilipinas, but not specifically for Tourism.\n- Moving to later years, let's check around 1987. In the table, the row for 1987 has Miss Universe as Geraldine Edith Asis, Bb. Mundo as Maria Lourdes Enriquez, and others. There's no column explicitly named \"Tourism\" or indicating that a specific title was awarded for Tourism.\n- Checking previous years like 1986, 1985 (if available), I don't see any mention of Tourism-related titles.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't include all categories, so maybe the Tourism category started in 1987 but isn't listed here. Alternatively, if the table includes all relevant data up to 1991 and there's no mention before 1987, then it would support the claim that the Tourism category started in 1987.\n\nHowever, I notice that in some rows after 1987, like 1988, 1989, etc., the entries don't have a specific \"Tourism\" column either. This makes me question whether the table is comprehensive or if it's missing information about Tourism category winners before 1987.\n\nIf the table is complete and doesn't list any Tourism titles until 1987, then the claim would be TRUE. But I'm not entirely sure because the table might not include all categories, especially since Bb. Pilipinas has various special titles besides the main ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Tourism title was introduced in a year before 1987 but isn't listed here. Without explicit data about Tourism titles prior to 1987, it's hard to confirm or deny the claim definitively from this table alone.\n\nWait, another approach: if the claim is that the Tourism category didn't exist until 1987, then we should check all years before 1987 in the table. If none of those rows have a Tourism title, that would support the claim. Conversely, if any year before 1987 has a Tourism title awarded, it would contradict the claim.\n\nLooking at each row from 1962 to 1986, I don't see any indication of a Tourism category being awarded. The columns are standard pageant titles without specific categories like Tourism.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided table, there's no evidence of a Bb. Pilipinas - Tourism title before 1987. Hence, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not show any entries for \"Tourism\" before 1987.

Binibining Pilipinas is a beauty pageant, and Tourism might refer to a specific title or category within that pageant.\n\nThe table provided lists various years with different column names: Pageant, Year, Winner(s), Runner-up(s), 3rd Place, etc. However, I don't see a column named \"tourism\" in the table.

To verify this, I need to see if in any of these years, the Tourism title was awarded or mentioned. Since there's no specific column for Tourism, maybe it's listed under another category like \"Special Title\" or \"Other Categories.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- For 1973: The columns are Pageant, Year, Winner(s), Runner-up(s), etc., but nothing about Tourism.\n- Similarly, checking each year up to 1988, I don't see any mention of Tourism.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data supporting that Tourism was part of BB Pilipinas in these years, the claim seems accurate based on the information provided.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim that \"selina manalad and jennette fernando be the second runner-ups when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win the binibining pilipinas - universe.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table lists winners for each year from 1972 to 1991. Each row represents a year with several columns: Winner, First Runner-up, Second Runner-up, Third Runner-up, Fourth Runner-up, Fifth Runner-up.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific years where Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won. Let me check the rows for those names.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In 1991, there are two entries:\n  - The first row for 1991 has Winner: anjanette abayari, First Runner-up: maria patricia betita, Second Runner-up: maria lourdes gonzalez. Wait, that's not matching the claim.\n  - The second row for 1991 lists Winner: maria lourdes gonzalez, First Runner-up: maria patricia betita, Second Runner-up: selina manalad.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing because there are two rows for 1991. Let me clarify:\n\nRow index 24 (assuming counting starts at 0) shows:\n- Winner: anjanette abayari\n- First Runner-up: maria patricia betita\n- Second Runner-up: maria lourdes gonzalez\n\nBut the claim says that Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez are winners. That doesn't fit because in this row, Anjanette is the Winner, and Maria Lourdes is the Second Runner-up.\n\nThen, row index 25 (next row for 1991) shows:\n- Winner: maria lourdes gonzalez\n- First Runner-up: maria patricia betita\n- Second Runner-up: selina manalad\n\nSo in this case, Maria Lourdes is the Winner, and Selina Manalad is the Second Runner-up. But Jennette Fernando isn't mentioned here.\n\nWait, but the claim says that both Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernardo are second runner-ups when Anjanette and Maria Lourdes win. That seems conflicting because in one row, Maria Lourdes is a winner with Selina as Second Runner-up, and in another row, Anjanette is the Winner with Maria Lourdes as Second Runner-up.\n\nBut looking at the columns, I see that the claim refers to when both Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win. That would imply they both won in separate years.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a co-win situation? But checking the table, each year has one Winner. So maybe the claim is about two different years where Anjanette and Maria Lourdes were winners, each time with Selina and Jennette as Second Runner-ups.\n\nBut looking at row index 24: Anjanette Abayari (Winner), First Runner-up: maria patricia betita, Second Runner-up: maria lourdes gonzalez. So in this case, Maria Lourdes is the Second Runner-up when Anjanette won.\n\nIn row index 25: Winner is maria lourdes gonzalez, with selina manalad as Second Runner-up and jennette fernando as Fourth Runner-up. \n\nSo the claim states that Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernardo are both second runner-ups when Anjanette and Maria Lourdes won.\n\nBut in row index 24, Anjanette is Winner, Maria Lourdes is Second Runner-up. There's no mention of Selina or Jennette here as Second Runner-ups.\n\nIn row index 25, Maria Lourdes is Winner, Selina Manalad is Second Runner-up, and Jennette Fernardo is Fourth Runner-up. So Jennette isn't the Second Runner-up in this case; she's Fourth.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both Selina and Jennette were second runner-ups when Anjanette and Maria Lourdes won doesn't hold because:\n\n- When Anjanette Abayari won (row 24), Maria Lourdes was Second Runner-up, not Selina or Jennette.\n- When Maria Lourdes won (row 25), Selina was Second Runner-up, but Jennette was Fourth.\n\nThus, the claim isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Second Runner-up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Second Runner-up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is: \"maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do.\" I need to check if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions two main points:\n1. Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost her title in Binibining Pilipinas-International.\n2. This happened the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson did something (probably won or was the titleholder).\n\nI need to find if both these events occurred and if they are consecutive years.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists winners for each year under various columns like Miss Universe Philippines, Binibining Pilipinas International, etc. Let's focus on the relevant column: \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\".\n\nFirst, I'll check when Jessie Alice Salones Dixson was involved. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- 1986 row has Jessie Alice Salones Dixson under Miss Universe Philippines, but not as Binibining Pilipinas International.\n\nWait, in 1987:\n- The Binibining Pilipinas - International is Geraldine Edith Asis.\n\nThen 1988:\n- Maria Anthea Robles and others are listed.\n\nWait, let me check each year carefully:\n\nLooking at the table, from top to bottom. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow for 1986: Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is in Miss Universe Philippines, but Binibining Pilipinas International is Violeta Asela Naluz? Wait no, I think the columns might be different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The table has multiple columns like \"Miss Universe Philippines\", \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\", and others. So for each year, each of these titles is awarded to someone.\n\nSo looking at 1986: Miss Universe Philippines is Violeta Asela Naluz. Binibining Pilipinas International is Jessie Alice Salones Dixson? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the columns.\n\nWait no, the column for 1986 under \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" is Jessie Alice Salones Dixson?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the table, each row represents a year. Each row has several columns like Miss Universe Philippines, Binibining Pilipinas International, etc.\n\nSo in 1986, the column for Binibining Pilipinas International is \"maria cristina recto\". Wait, no: Let me look at the specific data:\n\nFor 1986:\n- The column \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" has maria cristina recto.\n\nWait, but in another part of the table for 1987:\n- Binibining Pilipinas International is Geraldine Edith Asis.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at each row's data:\n\n1986: Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is under Miss Universe Philippines. The Binibining Pilipinas - International for 1986 is maria cristina recto? Or wait, no\u2014looking at the table structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map the columns correctly. Let me list out each row's data:\n\nRow indices start from 0. So first, let me get the column headers: \"Miss Universe Philippines\", \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\", etc.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- For 1986 (row index ?), let me check which row is 1986.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all the years with their Binibining Pilipinas International winners.\n\nLet me go through each year and note who was Binibining Pilipinas - International:\n\nLooking at the table body:\n\n- 1972: maria emma garrucho\n- 1973: maria teresita magno\n- ... (skipping ahead)\n- 1986: violeta asela naluz? Wait no, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the columns are \"Miss Universe Philippines\", \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\", \"First Runner-up\", etc. So each row has data for these categories.\n\nSo in 1986:\n\n- Miss Universe Philippines: violeta asela naluz\n- Binibining Pilipinas - International: jessie alice salones dixson\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the specific data:\n\nIn the table, under \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" for 1986, it's jessie alice salones dixson.\n\nYes, because in row index corresponding to 1986: looking back, the rows are from 1972 upwards. So I need to find which row has 1986.\n\nLooking at the table body:\n\nThe first data row is 1972, then 1973, etc. Let me count up.\n\nActually, perhaps it's easier to note that in 1986, under \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\", the name is jessie alice salones dixson.\n\nSo Jessie Alice Salones Dixson was Binibining Pilipinas International in 1986.\n\nThen, the next year would be 1987. Let's check who was Binibining Pilipinas International in 1987:\n\nLooking at the row for 1987: under \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\", it's geraldine edith asis.\n\nSo in 1986, Jessie Alice Salones Dixson won. In 1987, Geraldine Edith Asis won. There is no mention of Maria Lourdes Enriquez in the Binibining Pilipinas International column for any year adjacent to 1986 or 1987.\n\nWait, looking further down:\n\nIn 1988: maria anthea robles\n1989: maria teresita pineda\n\nHmm. So perhaps Maria Lourdes Enriquez is not listed as a Binibining Pilipinas International winner in the years following 1986.\n\nWait, but let me check all the rows:\n\nLooking at row index for 1987: Geraldine Edith Asis\nRow index for 1988: maria anthea robles\nRow index for 1989: maria teresita pineda\n\nNo Maria Lourdes Enriquez in these.\n\nSo the claim is that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost the title the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson. But according to the table, Jessie won in 1986, Geraldine won in 1987. So if the claim says Maria Lourdes lost the year after Jessie, meaning 1987, but in 1987, Geraldine won, not Maria Lourdes.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because Maria Lourdes Enriquez isn't listed as losing in that context. Alternatively, maybe she was a runner-up or something else.\n\nWait, let me check if Maria Lourdes Enriquez appears elsewhere in the table. Looking through all entries:\n\n- 1987: Under \"First Runner-up\", it's maria lourdes enriquez.\n\nYes! In 1987, under \"First Runner-up\" is Maria Lourdes Enriquez.\n\nSo in 1987, Geraldine Edith Asis won Binibining Pilipinas International, and Maria Lourdes was first runner-up. So she didn't lose the title; she was a runner-up.\n\nBut the claim says she \"lose as binibining pilipinas - international\", which implies she held the title and then lost it. But according to the table, she was first runner-up in 1987, not the winner. The winner was Geraldine.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because Maria Lourdes was a runner-up, not the holder who lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"lose as\". Maybe it means she competed and didn't win? But that's not losing the title; that's just not winning.\n\nMoreover, the year after Jessie (1986) is 1987. In 1987, Maria Lourdes was runner-up, not the winner. So she didn't lose the title because she never held it in 1987.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost her Binibining Pilipinas International title the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is incorrect based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost her Binibining Pilipinas-International title the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson. According to the table:\n\n1. **Jessie Alice Salones Dixson** was the Binibining Pilipinas-International winner in 1986.\n2. The next year, 1987, **Geraldine Edith Asis** won the title, not Maria Lourdes Enriquez. Maria Lourdes was listed as the First Runner-up in 1987.\n\nSince Maria Lourdes Enriquez did not win the title in 1987, she couldn't have lost it. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start until the year 1989.\" Let me look at the table provided and see when the pageant started.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to find any mention of Tourism. The columns are Year, Winner, 1st Runner-up, 2nd Runner-up, 3rd Runner-up, 4th Runner-up, and 5th Runner-up.\n\nStarting from the earliest year in the table, which is 1976, I check each row for \"Tourism\" under any of the runner-up categories. \n\nLooking at 1980: no mention. Similarly, 1983, 1984, etc., none have Tourism listed. Then when I get to 1989, in that row, I see the 4th Runner-up is \"marichele cruz.\" Wait, but where's Tourism mentioned? Let me check again.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim refers to the Binibining Pilipinas-Tourism pageant itself starting in 1989, not necessarily someone representing tourism. If that's the case, does the table indicate when it started?\n\nLooking through the years, the earliest is 1976. However, the table seems to list winners and runners-up of Binibining Pilipinas, which has been ongoing since at least 1976. The claim says Tourism didn't start until 1989, implying that before then, it wasn't part of the pageant.\n\nBut in this table, I don't see any indication of a \"Tourism\" category or participant in earlier years. So perhaps prior to 1989, the tourism aspect wasn't introduced. The claim is stating that Tourism didn't start until 1989, which aligns with the absence of any relevant data in the table before that year.\n\nSo based on this, the relevant cells would be from the 1989 row where \"Tourism\" might have been introduced or recognized. However, since the claim is about starting, and the table doesn't explicitly show a Tourism category until maybe 1989, I'll mark it as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
