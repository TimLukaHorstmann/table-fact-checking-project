    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brandi love be nominate for 2 award at the avn award ceremony in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. There are five rows with data for the year 2013.\n\nThe claim mentions Brandi Love being nominated for two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013. So I need to check how many times she was nominated in that specific ceremony.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: AVN Award, Nominated, MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year\n- Row 1: AVN Award, Nominated, Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n- Row 2: Nightmoves Award, Won, Best Cougar/MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice)\n- Row 3: Nightmoves Award, Nominated, Best Ass\n- Row 4: XBIZ Award, Nominated, Web Star of the Year\n\nSo focusing only on the AVN Award ceremonies in 2013:\n\n- Rows 0 and 1 both have \"avn award\" as the ceremony. Both results are \"nominated\". \n\nTherefore, Brandi Love was nominated twice at the AVN Awards in 2013.\n\nThe relevant cells here would be rows 0 and 1 under the columns 'ceremony', 'result', and 'award'. But according to the instructions, I just need the row index and column name for each relevant cell. Each nomination is a separate row, so two rows are involved.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there are two nominations at the AVN Awards in 2013.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"brandi love be only nominated for best as 1 time in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Brandi Love was nominated only once for \"best ass\" in 2013. So I need to check if there's exactly one nomination under the award category \"best ass\" and nothing else related.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple entries from 2013. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, AVN Award, Nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year.\nRow 1: Year 2013, AVN Award, Nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison.\nRow 2: Year 2013, Nightmoves Award, Won Best Cougar MILF Performer (Editor's Choice).\nRow 3: Year 2013, Nightmoves Award, Nominated for Best Ass.\nRow 4: Year 2013, XBIZ Award, Nominated for Web Star of the Year.\n\nNow, focusing on \"best ass\" awards. In row 3, there's a nomination for \"Best Ass\". Are there any other rows where she was nominated for this award? Let me check all rows again to be thorough.\n\nRows 0 and 1 are about different awards. Row 2 is a win, not a nomination. Rows 4 mentions Web Star of the Year, which isn't related. So only row 3 is relevant here.\n\nSo the claim says she was nominated once for best ass in 2013. From the table, that's accurate because there's exactly one nomination under \"best ass\" category. However, the claim also implies that this was her only nomination in 2013. But looking at other rows, I see multiple nominations: MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year (row 0), Most Outrageous Sex Scene (row 1), and Web Star of the Year (row 4). So she was nominated for more than just \"best ass\" in 2013.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions only being nominated once for best ass. It doesn't say it's her only nomination overall. So perhaps I misinterpreted. Let me read the claim again: \"only nominated for best as 1 time\". Hmm, maybe the user meant that she was nominated once for best ass and not more than once. Alternatively, maybe they're saying that her only nomination was for best ass.\n\nBut looking at the table, there are multiple nominations in different categories. So if the claim is that she was only nominated once (for best ass), then it's false because she had other nominations as well. However, if the claim is that she was nominated once for best ass and possibly others, then it's partially true but the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nBut I think the intended meaning is that her sole nomination in 2013 was for best ass, which isn't correct because there are more nominations listed. Alternatively, maybe the user meant she was only nominated once for best ass among multiple categories, so the count of \"best ass\" nominations is one, which is true.\n\nWait, but let's parse the claim again: \"brandi love be only nominated for best as 1 time in 2013.\" So it could mean two things:\n1. She was only ever nominated once in 2013 (which isn't true because she has multiple nominations).\n2. She was nominated once specifically for best ass, and perhaps other awards as well.\n\nThe wording is a bit ambiguous. However, considering the structure of the table, let's see how many times \"best ass\" appears. Only row 3 mentions \"Best Ass\" nomination. So in terms of being nominated only once for that specific award, it's true. But if the claim implies she had no other nominations, then it's false.\n\nGiven the way the claim is phrased, I think it's focusing on her nomination count for best ass, not overall nominations. Therefore, since there's exactly one nomination for \"best ass\", the relevant cell is row 3, column award.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because she was nominated once for best ass in 2013. The other nominations don't affect this specific claim about that category.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table.\n\nThe claim says: \"big titty sluts be the only name work brandi love receive an award nomination for in 2013.\" Hmm, okay. Wait, I think there's a typo here. It probably should say \"brandi love\" instead of \"sluts.\" So, the correct statement is that \"big titty milfs\" is the only work Brandi Love received an award nomination for in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different nominations and awards. I need to check all the rows from 2013 where the result was a nomination and see if all of them have \"big titty sluts\" as the work. Wait, actually, the claim is that this was the only one.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Nominated for \"milf / cougar performer of the year.\" The work is listed as n/a. So, no specific work mentioned here. This doesn't count towards any work being nominated; it's about her performance category.\n\nRow 1: Nominated for \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison).\" The work is \"big titty sluts.\" So this one counts because the work is specifically mentioned and it's a nomination.\n\nRow 2: Won an award for \"best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice).\" Work is n/a. Again, no specific work here; just her performance category.\n\nRow 3: Nominated for \"best ass.\" Work is n/a. So again, no specific work mentioned.\n\nRow 4: Nominated for \"web star of the year.\" Work is n/a. No specific work here either.\n\nSo, among all these rows, only row 1 has a specific work listed as \"big titty sluts\" where she was nominated. All other nominations didn't have a specific work listed\u2014they were more about her performance or personal categories.\n\nTherefore, according to the table, \"big titty sluts\" is indeed the only work for which Brandi Love received an award nomination in 2013. There are no other works mentioned in any of the rows where she was nominated. Hence, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"big titty sluts\" was the only work for which Brandi Love received a nomination in 2013.

It says that Brandi Love did not win the \"web star of the year\" award in 2013 at any ceremony. So I need to check if there's any entry in the table where she won this specific award in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about an award ceremony. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year is 2013, Ceremony is AVN Award, Result is nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the year. So she was nominated but didn't win this category.\n\nRow 1: Again, AVN Award in 2013, result is nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene. Not relevant to the claim.\n\nRow 2: Nightmoves Award, result is won for Best Cougar MILF Performer (Editor's Choice). Not the award we're looking at.\n\nRow 3: Nightmoves Award, result is nominated for Best Ass. Still not the right award.\n\nRow 4: XBIZ Award in 2013, result is nominated for Web Star of the Year. She was nominated but didn't win here either.\n\nWait a minute, I don't see any row where she won \"web star of the year\". The only relevant entry is Row 4 where she was nominated but didn't win. So according to this table, Brandi Love did not win that award in 2013.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Brandi Love was nominated for \"Web Star of the Year\" at the XBIZ Award in 2013 but did not win it.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"brandi love be nominate for a total of 5 award in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions that Brandi Love was nominated for a total of five awards in the year 2013. My goal is to verify this information against the data presented in the HTML table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. The relevant pieces of information here are the \"year\" to ensure we're looking at entries from 2013, the \"result\" to check if she was nominated or won, and the \"award\" column to count how many nominations there were.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table one by one:\n\n1. The first row is for 2013, AVN Award, result is nominated, award category is MILF / Cougar Performer of the Year.\n2. The second row is also from 2013, AVN Award, result is nominated, and the award category is Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison, associated with the work \"Big Titty Milfs.\"\n3. The third row mentions Nightmoves Award in 2013, where she won for Best Cougar / MILF Performer (Editor's Choice).\n4. The fourth row again from Nightmoves Award in 2013, but this time the result is nominated under Best Ass.\n5. The fifth row is from the XBiz Award in 2013, where she was nominated as Web Star of the Year.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times Brandi Love was nominated. Let's look at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Nominated\n- Row 1: Nominated\n- Row 2: Won (this is a win, so not a nomination)\n- Row 3: Nominated\n- Row 4: Nominated\n\nSo, that's four nominations in total. However, the claim states she was nominated for five awards.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: AVN Award - Nominated (1)\nRow 1: AVN Award - Nominated (2)\nRow 3: Nightmoves Award - Nominated (3)\nRow 4: XBiz Award - Nominated (4)\n\nThat's four nominations, not five. The third row is a win, so it doesn't count toward the nomination tally.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she was nominated for five awards in 2013 is incorrect based on this table. It should be four nominations.\n\nNext, I'll identify the relevant cells to support my conclusion. These are the rows where the result is \"nominated\" and the year is 2013. The relevant column names are \"result,\" as they indicate whether she was nominated or won.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be in rows 0, 1, 3, and 4 under the \"result\" column.\n\nWait a minute\u2014no, actually, each row represents an award nomination or win. Since the claim is about total nominations, each of these four rows where the result is \"nominated\" counts towards that total. Therefore, all four rows are relevant because they contribute to the count of nominations. The fifth row also has a result of \"nominated,\" but looking back, I see there's only five rows in total.\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: AVN, Nominated\n- Row 1: AVN, Nominated\n- Row 2: Nightmoves, Won\n- Row 3: Nightmoves, Nominated\n- Row 4: XBiz, Nominated\n\nSo that's four nominations. Therefore, the claim of five is incorrect.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are all rows where the result is \"nominated\" (rows 0,1,3,4) in the \"result\" column, as well as each row's year to ensure they're from 2013.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Brandi Love was nominated for five awards in 2013. The table shows four nominations and one win. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"brandi love be win 2 award at the avn award in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Brandi Love won two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row and see which entries are from the AVN Awards in 2013.\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, Ceremony is AVN Award. Result is nominated, Award is Milf/Cougar Performer of the Year. So she was nominated here but didn't win.\n\nRow 1: Same year and ceremony. Result is nominated again, for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison. Work is Big Titty MILFs. She was nominated, not won.\n\nRow 2: Nightmoves Award in 2013. Result is 'won' for Best Cougar/MILF Performer (Editor's Choice). So she did win one award here, but this isn't the AVN Awards.\n\nRow 3: Again, Nightmoves Award in 2013. Nominated for Best Ass. Not relevant to the claim about AVN.\n\nRow 4: XBIZ Award in 2013. Result is nominated for Web Star of the Year. So again, not an AVN win.\n\nSo looking specifically at the AVN Awards (rows 0 and 1), both are nominations but no wins. The Nightmoves and XBIZ awards don't count because the claim specifies \"at the avn award.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim says she won two awards at AVN in 2013, but according to the table, she didn't win any there\u2014only nominations.

The claim states: \"brandi love be nominate 2 time for best as as 2 different award ceremony in 2013.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems like there might be a typo; perhaps it should say \"nominated twice for Best Ass at two different award ceremonies in 2013.\" Alternatively, maybe it refers to two nominations for Best Ass from two different ceremonies.\n\nLooking at the table, I see five rows of data, all from the year 2013.

However, looking through all rows, I don't see another nomination for \"Best Ass\" in a different ceremony. The only other ceremonies are AVN and XBIZ, neither of which have a Best Ass category mentioned here.\n\nTherefore, Brandi Love was nominated once for Best Ass at the Nightmoves Awards in 2013, not twice across two different ceremonies. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

This isn't the xbiz award but shows her presence in other ceremonies.\n- The fourth row is another Nightmoves nomination for Best Ass.

These cells show that she was only nominated, not a winner.\n\nSo, compiling all this, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are from row index 4 for those three columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"brandi love be nominate for and win 5 award in 2013\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it has five rows from 2013. Each row lists a year, ceremony, result, award, and work. The claim mentions Brandi Love being nominated for and winning five awards in 2013. I'll need to check each relevant cell to see how many nominations and wins she had that year.\n\nStarting with the first row (row index 0), it shows she was nominated at the AVN Awards for \"milf / cougar performer of the year.\" So that's one nomination, but no win here because the result is 'nominated.'\n\nMoving to row 1, another nomination at the same AVN Awards for \"most outrageous sex scene\" with Kelly Madison. That adds another nomination, so total nominations are now two.\n\nRow 2 is from the Nightmoves Awards where she won \"best cougar / milf performer.\" So that's one win. Now we have two nominations and one win.\n\nRow 3 shows a nomination at Nightmoves for \"best ass,\" bringing the nominations to three.\n\nFinally, row 4 mentions a nomination at the XBiz Award for \"web star of the year.\" That makes it four total nominations and one win.\n\nWait, but the claim says she was nominated for five awards. I've only found four nominations in the table. The relevant cells are all rows where result is 'nominated' or 'won.' So each row from 0 to 4 has either a nomination or a win. That's five entries, but four nominations and one win.\n\nBut the claim says she was nominated for and won five awards. From the table, she had four nominations and one win, making it five total mentions, but not necessarily five awards in terms of separate categories. However, each row is a different award category. So she was indeed part of five award entries: four nominations and one win.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"nominated for and win 5 award.\" That phrasing might mean she was both nominated and won five awards, which isn't the case here because she only won once. Alternatively, it could be that she had five mentions (four nominations, one win), totaling five. But I think the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim means she was nominated for five awards and won some of them. Looking at the table, she has four nominations and one win across different ceremonies and categories. So the total number of award entries or mentions is five: four as 'nominated' and one as 'won.' Therefore, the claim that she was nominated for and won five awards might be a bit misleading because she only won once but had four nominations, making it five in total.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows where result is either 'nominated' or 'won,' which would be all five rows. But the claim says she won five awards, which isn't accurate since she only won one. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because she didn't win five awards; she only won once and was nominated four times.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Brandi Love had four nominations and one win in 2013, not five wins.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
