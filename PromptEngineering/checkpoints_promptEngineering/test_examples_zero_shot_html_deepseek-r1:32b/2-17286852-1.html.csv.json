    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table of bridges with various details and made a claim: \"in Stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style.\" My task is to verify if this claim is true or false based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents. Looking at the table headers:\n- Bridge Name\n- Year Removed (or years)\n- Town/City\n- County\n- Structure Type\n\nThe claim mentions \"Stanley,\" so I should look for rows where the town is Stanley. Once I find that row, I'll check the structure type to see if it's a concrete deck girder bridge.\n\nLooking through the table, each row represents a different bridge. Scanning the 'Town/City' column, I spot \"Stanley\" in one of the rows. Let me note down its details: the Bridge Name is \"Goose River,\" Year Removed mentions 1997-02-27 and removed on 2009-3-25, Town/City is Stanley, County is Traill, and Structure Type is Pratt Through Truss.\n\nWait a minute, the structure type here is Pratt Through Truss, not concrete deck girder. That's conflicting with the claim. The claim states that the bridge in Stanley is of concrete deck girder style, but according to this row, it's a Pratt Through Truss bridge which was removed in 2009.\n\nSo, the structure type doesn't match what's claimed. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are the ones that mention Stanley and its structure type.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other rows with Stanley. Scanning again, I don't see another entry for Stanley. So this is the only row related to Stanley.\n\nPutting it all together: the claim says there's a concrete deck girder bridge in Stanley, but according to the table, the bridge there was a Pratt Through Truss that's been removed. Therefore, the claim isn't true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Town/City\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Structure Type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"in colton's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about a specific bridge in Colton's Crossing that has a particular type of structure\u2014a Pratt Through Truss bridge. So my goal is to check if there's any bridge in the table located in \"colton's cross\" with that specific truss design.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: Bridge Name, Date Removed (if applicable), Location City, Location County, and Structure Type. The rows list various bridges with their details.\n\nI need to search for a bridge named \"Colton's Cross\" or perhaps located in \"Colton's Crossing.\" Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. First row: Colton\u2019s Cross Bridge. Okay, that matches the name in the claim.\n2. Structure Type is Pratt Through Truss Bridge. That also aligns with what the claim states.\n\nSo it looks like this bridge meets both criteria\u2014location and structure type. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells for verification. The row index for Colton\u2019s Cross Bridge is 0 (assuming we start counting from 0). The columns involved are \"Bridge Name\" where it matches the bridge's name and \"Structure Type\" which confirms the truss design.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because both conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by this entry. Also, I need to note down the relevant cells: row 0 for Bridge Name and Structure Type.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Bridge Name\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Structure Type\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the Westgaard Bridge being a Pratt Pony Through Truss bridge is true based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to the Westgaard Bridge in the table. Scanning through each entry, I find that the Westgaard Bridge is listed at row index 23 (since counting starts from 0). The relevant columns are \"Structure Name\" and \"Type\".\n\nIn the \"Structure Name\" column of this row, it's clearly stated as \"Westgaard bridge\". Moving to the \"Type\" column for the same row, the entry is \"pratt pony through truss\". This directly matches the claim made. \n\nThere are no discrepancies here. The type specified in the table aligns perfectly with what the claim states. Therefore, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\nI should ensure that there's no other information conflicting this. Checking other columns for the same row: the \"Location\" and \"County\" don't affect the bridge style. The \"Date Removed\" shows it was removed in 2009, but that doesn't negate its previous classification.\n\nSo, all relevant cells support the claim without any contradictions.\n</think>\n\nThe Westgaard Bridge is listed as a Pratt Pony Through Truss bridge in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 23,\n       \"column_name\": \"Structure Name\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 23,\n       \"column_name\": \"Type\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"cooper town be famous for the blanchard bridge\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two entities: \"Cooper Town\" and \"Blanchard Bridge.\" The claim states that Cooper Town is famous because of the Blanchard Bridge. My task is to check if this is supported by the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a bridge with details like its name, removal date, location (town), county, and type. I need to find any rows where either the town or the bridge's name matches these keywords.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Blanchard Bridge\" in the 'Name' column. Scanning through the names, I see a row with \"blanchard bridge.\" Let me note its details: it was built in 1997 and removed in 2009. The town is listed as Blanchard, and the county is Traill.\n\nNext, I check if there's any mention of Cooper Town in the table. I go through each row looking for towns named Cooper Town or variations like Cooperstown. However, none of the rows list a town named Cooper Town. Instead, I notice a bridge called \"Westgaard Bridge\" located in Voltaire, McHenry county, but that doesn't relate to Cooper Town.\n\nAdditionally, there's a bridge named \"Cooper Town Bridge\"? Wait, no, looking again, the closest is \"Blanchard Bridge,\" which is in Blanchard town. There's also a \"Rainbow Arch Bridge\" and others, but none mention Cooper Town as their location.\n\nSo, based on the table data, there's no row where the town is Cooper Town and it's associated with the Blanchard Bridge. The Blanchard Bridge is indeed in Blanchard, Traill county, not in Cooper Town.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't list any bridge named Blanchard Bridge located in Cooper Town or any indication that Cooper Town is famous for this bridge, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Town\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"mcville have goose river bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.\" So, I need to check each part of this statement against the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any entry related to \"mcville.\" Scanning through the rows, I see a few mentions: \n\n- Row 16: mcville is mentioned as the location for \"west antelope bridge.\"\n- There's also a row mentioning \"blanchard\" and \"hillsboro,\" but nothing directly about mcville having a Goose River Bridge.\n\nNext, the claim talks about a \"Goose River Bridge.\" Looking through all the bridge names, I see there is an entry named \"goose river bridge\" at row 17. However, according to that row, it's in Hillsboro, Traill, not mcville. So that doesn't match up.\n\nThe claim also mentions that this bridge is currently under construction due to structural issues. Checking the status of the Goose River Bridge in the table (row 17), it says \"removed 2009-3-25.\" That means the bridge was removed, not under construction. So that part doesn't hold either.\n\nAdditionally, there's a \"west antelope bridge\" in mcville, but it doesn't mention Goose River or any current construction. It was built on 1997-02-27 and its status isn't indicated as under construction; it just has a type of Pratt Pony Truss Bridge.\n\nSo putting this all together: the claim incorrectly associates the Goose River Bridge with mcville, when it's actually in Hillsboro.
