    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. The table has columns: school, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. Each row represents a different team with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about whether the Maverick is the only team that joined after 1970. So, I need to check all rows for teams whose \"year joined\" is greater than 1970 and see if Maverick is the sole one in that category.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Attica: Joined in 1947\n2. Delphi Community: 1947\n3. Flora: 1947\n4. Rensselaer Central: 1947\n5. Rossville: 1947\n6. Winamac: 1947\n7. Sheridan: Joined in 1948 and again in 2000, but since the claim is about joining after 1970, 2000 is relevant here.\n8. Southwestern: 1958\n9. Western: 1958\n10. Carroll: Joined in 1961\n11. Clinton Prairie: 1961\n12. Central Catholic: Joined in 1970\n13. Harrison (West Lafayette): Joined in 1970\n14. McCutcheon: Joined in 1975\n\nNow, focusing on the \"year joined\" column:\n\n- Sheridan's year joined is listed as \"1948 2000\". This could be interpreted as two separate periods. Since 2000 is after 1970, this team also joined after 1970.\n- McCutcheon joined in 1975, which is after 1970.\n\nSo, there are at least two teams that joined after 1970: Sheridan (via the 2000 entry) and McCutcheon. Additionally, looking at their team names:\n\n- Sheridan's team name is \"blackhawks\".\n- McCutcheon's team name is \"mavericks\".\n\nThe claim states that Maverick is the only team to join after 1970, but since Sheridan (Blackhawks) joined in 2000 and McCutcheon (Mavericks) in 1975, there are two teams. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo identify relevant cells:\n\n- For Sheridan: row index 6, column \"year joined\".\n- For McCutcheon: row index 13, columns \"team name\" and \"year joined\".\n\nThus, these cells show that there's more than one team joining after 1970.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because two teams joined after 1970: the Mavericks in 1975 and the Blackhawks in 2000. The relevant cells include Sheridan's year joined and McCutcheon's team name and year joined.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user provided an HTML table with various details about different schools, including their years joined and left a conference. The claim we need to verify is: \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table data to find the row corresponding to 'rossville' school. Scanning through the rows, I see that 'rossville' is listed under the 'school' column at row index 4.\n\nLooking at this row, the relevant columns are 'year joined' and 'year left'. The 'year joined' is 1947, and the 'year left' is 1977. To determine if the claim is correct, I'll calculate the difference between these two years: 1977 minus 1947 equals exactly 30 years.\n\nSince the time spent in the conference matches the claim of 30 years, the statement is true.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the team from the city of attica leave before the team from the city of west lafayette join.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. The claim is stating that the team in Attica left (year left) before the team in West Lafayette joined (year joined). So I need to find two pieces of information: when Attica's team left and when West Lafayette's team joined.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row for the cities mentioned. Let's start with Attica.\n\nIn the first row, under 'city', it says 'attica'. The relevant columns here are 'year left' which is 1966. So Attica's team left in 1966.\n\nNext, I need to find West Lafayette. Scanning through the table, looking for the city name. In the row where 'harrison (west lafayette)' is listed under 'school', the city is 'west lafayette'. The 'year joined' column for this team is 1970.\n\nNow, comparing these two years: Attica's team left in 1966, and West Lafayette's team joined in 1970. Since 1966 is before 1970, the claim that \"the team from Attica leave before the team from West Lafayette join\" is true.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss any other relevant data, I'll double-check if there are multiple entries for either city. For Attica, only one row mentions it, and for West Lafayette, it's in the 'harrison (west lafayette)' row as the city. No duplicates found that could affect the conclusion.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because 1966 is before 1970.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the team from Attica left before the team from West Lafayette joined. Checking the table, Attica's team left in 1966 and West Lafayette's team (harrison) joined in 1970. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Hornets are not the only team from Clinton County (specifically 12 Clinton). So, I'm looking for other teams in the same county.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with details like city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The relevant columns here are \"team name\" and \"county\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check if there's another team from 12 Clinton besides the Hornets.\n\nRow 0: Attica - county is 23 Fountain. Not 12 Clinton.\nRow 1: Delphi Community - county 08 Carroll. No.\nRow 2: Flora - 08 Carroll again. Nope.\nRow 3: Rensselaer Central - 37 Jasper. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Rossville - team is Hornets, county 12 Clinton. This is the one mentioned in the claim.\nRow 5: Winamac - 66 Pulaski. Doesn't match.\nRow 6: Sheridan - 29 Hamilton. No.\nRow 7: Southwestern - 79 Tippecanoe. Not our target.\nRow 8: Western - 34 Howard. Nope.\nRow 9: Carroll - 08 Carroll. Not relevant.\nRow 10: Clinton Prairie - team is Gophers, county 12 Clinton.

Not applicable.\n\nSo, I found two teams from 12 Clinton County: Rossville's Hornets and Clinton Prairie's Gophers. This means the Hornets aren't the only team from that county, making the claim TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to note where these are in the table.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two schools: Rossville and Clinton Prairie. It says they left three years apart. From the table, I can see that each school has a \"year left\" column which indicates when they stopped being part of something\u2014maybe a league or an association. So, to verify this claim, I need to find the year each of these schools left and then calculate the difference between those two years.\n\nFirst, let me locate Rossville in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that the fifth row (index 4) is for \"rossville.\" The \"year left\" column here shows 1977.\n\nNext, I'll look for Clinton Prairie. The eleventh row (index 10) has \"clinton prairie,\" and its \"year left\" is 1974.\n\nNow, to find the difference between these two years: 1977 minus 1974 equals 3 years.

So, I need to find the year each of these schools joined and see if there's a 10-year difference between them.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by finding the rows for \"winamac\" and \"southwestern\". \n\nFor winamac:\n- The row index for winamac is 5. In that row, under the column \"year joined\", it says 1972. So winamac joined in 1972.\n\nFor southwestern:\n- The row index for southwestern is 8. Under \"year joined\", it's listed as 1958. So southwestern joined in 1958.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference between these two years. 1972 minus 1958 equals 14 years. \n\nThe claim says that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison (west lafayette) join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two teams: one from Carroll and another from Harrison (West Lafayette). It states that the Carroll team joined in 1970 before Harrison did. I'll need to check both their \"year joined\" dates to see if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details like city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The rows are indexed starting from 0.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the relevant information for both teams.\n\nStarting with the Carroll team: I scan the \"school\" column until I find \"carroll.\" That's in row index 9. In that same row, the \"year joined\" is listed as 1961. So according to the table, Carroll joined in 1961, not 1970.\n\nNext, for Harrison (West Lafayette): I look through the \"school\" column again and find \"harrison (west lafayette)\" at row index 12. The \"year joined\" here is 1970.\n\nNow, comparing the two: Carroll joined in 1961, while Harrison joined in 1970. So Carroll actually joined earlier than Harrison. However, the claim states that Carroll joined in 1970 before Harrison. That's incorrect because the table shows Carroll joined in 1961, which is indeed before 1970 but not in 1970 itself.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me check again: \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison...\". So the claim is that Carroll joined in 1970 and that this was before Harrison's joining year. But according to the table, Carroll joined in 1961, which is before 1970. However, the claim incorrectly states that they joined in 1970. Therefore, the claim has two issues: it gives the wrong year for Carroll and implies that this was before Harrison's 1970 join, but in reality, Carroll joined even earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014the year left for Carroll is 1977. So their time span includes up to 1977, but the joining year is 1961. So the claim says they joined in 1970, which isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim's first part is wrong.\n\nMoreover, Harrison joined in 1970, so if Carroll had also joined in 1970, it would be simultaneous or maybe depending on exact months, but since the table shows years, we can consider them as joining in the same year, which doesn't support \"before.\"\n\nSo, putting this together: the claim is incorrect because Carroll joined in 1961, not 1970. Therefore, the statement that they joined in 1970 before Harrison (who joined in 1970) is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n\n- For Carroll: row index 9, \"year joined.\"\n- For Harrison: row index 12, \"year joined.\"\n\nThese are the two key pieces of information needed to evaluate the claim.

Scanning down, I see:\n\n- Row 3: Rossville is in county 12 clinton, joined in 1947 and left in 1977.\n- Then later, row 10: Clinton Prairie is also in county 12 clinton, joined in 1961 and left in 1974.\n\nWait a minute, that's two teams from 12 Clinton County. So the claim says only one team, but I found two. That already makes the first part of the claim false.\n\nNow checking Carroll County. The county entries have \"08 carroll\" as the identifier. Looking through:\n\n- Row 0: Attica is in 23 fountain, so not relevant.\n- Row 1: Delphi Community is in 08 carroll, joined in 1947 and left in 1992.\n- Row 2: Flora is also in 08 carroll, joined 1947, left 1961.\n- Then row 10 again is Clinton Prairie, which we already checked. Wait no, that's 12 clinton. So next, looking further down:\n\nRow 3: Rensselaer Central is in 37 jasper.\n\nRow 4: Rossville, as mentioned earlier.\n\nRow 5: Winamac is in 66 pulaski.\n\nRow 6: Sheridan is in 29 hamilton.\n\nRow 7: Southwestern is in 79 tippecanoe.\n\nRow 8: Western is in 34 howard.\n\nRow 9: Carroll is in 08 carroll, joined in 1961 and left in 1977.\n\nSo there's Delphi Community (row 1), Flora (row 2), and Carroll (row 9) all under 08 carroll. That's three teams from Carroll County.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only one team from each of these counties joined is incorrect because both have more than one team.\n\nSo putting this together: The relevant cells are for county entries where it's either 12 clinton or 08 carroll, and their corresponding 'year joined' to confirm if they indeed joined. \n\nRelevant rows and columns would be:\n\nFor 12 Clinton:\n- Row 3 (Rossville) with 'county' as 12 clinton and 'year joined' 1947.\n- Row 10 (Clinton Prairie) with 'county' 12 clinton and 'year joined' 1961.\n\nFor Carroll County (08 carroll):\n- Rows 1, 2, and 9 all have county as 08 carroll with respective years joined.\n\nSo the claim is false because both counties have more than one team that joined.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
