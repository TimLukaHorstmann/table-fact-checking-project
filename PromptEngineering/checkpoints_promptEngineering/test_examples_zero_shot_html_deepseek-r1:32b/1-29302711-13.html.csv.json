    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the task is to determine if the claim \"roscoe tanner be the ninth rank tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The instructions say to check each part of the claim against the table and then decide.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's in HTML format with several columns: rk, name, country, matches played, matches won, points, and prize money (usd). There are nine rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"roscoe tanner\" and states that he is ranked ninth. So, I need to check if roscoe tanner is indeed the ninth-ranked player in this table.\n\nFirst, let's find roscoe tanner in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column:\n\n1. ken rosewall\n2. arthur ashe\n3. marty riessen\n4. roger taylor\n5. mark cox\n6. brian fairlie\n7. jan kode\u00e5\u00a1\n8. tom okker\n9. roscoe tanner\n\nYes, roscoe tanner is listed in the ninth row (index 8 if counting from 0).

The other details like country and prize money aren't relevant to the rank part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as roscoe tanner is listed in the ninth position according to the 'rk' column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rk\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So the claim is: \"ken rosewell win more prize money than tom okker and roscoe tanner combine.\" First off, I notice that in the table, the player's name is spelled \"ken rosewall,\" not \"rosewell.\" Maybe it's a typo, but I'll assume they're referring to Ken Rosewall since that's what's in the table.\n\nNext, I need to look at the relevant columns. The claim mentions prize money, so I should focus on the \"prize money (usd)\" column. Let me find the rows for each player involved: Ken Rosewall, Tom Okker, and Roscoe Tanner.\n\nKen Rosewall is in row 0 with $66,400. Tom Okker is in row 7 with $34,400, and Roscoe Tanner is in row 8 with $25,250. Now I need to check if Ken's prize money is more than the combined total of Tom and Roscoe.\n\nSo, let me calculate Tom and Roscoe's combined prize money: $34,400 + $25,250 equals $59,650. Comparing that to Ken's $66,400, it seems like yes, Ken did win more than the sum of both players.\n\nI should also make sure I'm looking at the right rows and columns in the table to support this calculation. The relevant cells would be Ken Rosewall's prize money in row 0, Tom Okker's in row 7, and Roscoe Tanner's in row 8, all under the \"prize money (usd)\" column.\n\nSo putting it all together: $66,400 (Ken) > ($34,400 + $25,250) = $59,650.

The 'rk' column likely stands for rank.\n\nLooking at the rows, Roger Taylor is listed in row 3 with a rank of 4. Mark Cox is in row 4, also with a rank of 4. So both have the same rank value of 4. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any other information that might affect their tie. The claim mentions them being tied for fourth place. In sports rankings, sometimes ties can occur when players have the same points or performance metrics.\n\nLooking at their 'points' column: both Roger Taylor and Mark Cox have 34 points each. That supports the idea they are tied in terms of points, which could mean a tied rank.\n\nBut I should also consider if the 'rk' (rank) is based solely on points or some other criteria. The table shows that their ranks are already listed as 4. So according to the given data, they share the same rank of 4.\n\nTherefore, since both have the same rank value and the same points, it's accurate to say they are tied for fourth place. \n\nSo the relevant cells would be where their names are mentioned along with their ranks and points.

The claim states: \"roscoe tanner be first ranked tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It claims that Roscoe Tanner was the first-ranked tennis player in the 1973 World Tennis Circuit.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it has columns like rank (rk), name, country, matches played, etc., but I don't immediately see a column for the year or specific circuit, so I'm assuming this table is about rankings, perhaps for a particular season or event. The claim mentions 1973 specifically, but the table doesn't have that information. So, I need to work with what's given.\n\nThe rank column shows \"rk\" as 1 through 9. The first-ranked player here is Ken Rosewall from Australia with 42 matches played and 53 points. Roscoe Tanner is at row index 8 (since counting starts from 0), which is the last entry, ranked 9th. \n\nSo according to this table, Roscoe Tanner isn't the top-ranked; he's actually in ninth place. The claim says he was first, but according to the data here, Ken Rosewall holds that position.\n\nNow, considering whether the claim could still be true despite this: maybe the table doesn't cover all players or events? But without additional information about 1973 or other tournaments, I can only go by what's in the table. \n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, Roscoe Tanner is not first but ninth. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nI'll note that the relevant cells are the rank and name columns for both Ken Rosewall (row index 0) and Roscoe Tanner (row index 8).

The task is to determine whether the claim \"ken rosewell lose more prize money than tom ekker and roscoe tanner combine\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Ken Rosewall lost more prize money individually compared to the combined total of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner. So, I need to calculate two things: Ken's prize money and the sum of Tom's and Roscoe's prize money.\n\nLooking at the table, let me identify each player's data:\n\n1. **Ken Rosewall**: His row is the first one in the table. The relevant column here is \"prize money (usd)\". According to the table, Ken has $66,400.\n\n2. **Tom Okker**: He is listed under row 8 with a prize money of $34,400.\n\n3. **Roscoe Tanner**: His data is in row 9, showing he earned $25,250.\n\nNext step is to sum Tom's and Roscoe's prize money:\n- Tom: $34,400\n- Roscoe: $25,250\n- Combined total = $34,400 + $25,250 = $59,650\n\nNow, compare Ken's prize money to this combined amount. Ken has $66,400, and the combined total of Tom and Roscoe is $59,650.\n\nSince $66,400 (Ken) is greater than $59,650 (Tom + Roscoe), it seems like the claim would be TRUE. However, I need to double-check for any possible errors or misunderstandings.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the table shows that Ken has 53 points and Tom has 25 points, but the claim is about prize money, not points. So focusing on the correct column is crucial here.\n\nAnother consideration: The player's names in the claim are spelled slightly differently than in the table. \"ken rosewell\" vs. \"Ken Rosewall\", and \"tom ekker\" vs. \"Tom Okker\". It's possible that these are typos, but assuming they refer to the same individuals, as there's no other \"ekker\" or similar name in the table except Tom Okker.\n\nAlso, for Roscoe Tanner, the spelling matches exactly between the claim and the table, so that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, based on the numbers:\n\n- Ken: $66,400\n- Tom + Roscoe: $34,400 + $25,250 = $59,650\n\nSince 66,400 > 59,650, the claim that Ken lost more prize money than the two combined is TRUE.\n\nI should make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me recheck:\n\nKen's row: 1st row, prize money is indeed $66,400.\nTom's row: 8th row, prize money is $34,400.\nRoscoe's row: 9th row, prize money is $25,250.\n\nAdding Tom and Roscoe: 34,400 + 25,250 = 59,650.
