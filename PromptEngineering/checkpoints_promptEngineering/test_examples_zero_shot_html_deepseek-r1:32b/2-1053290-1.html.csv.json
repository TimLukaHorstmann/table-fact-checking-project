    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the brighton hotel bombing happen in brighton , uk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what information I have and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components: the event name, which is \"brighton hotel bombing,\" and the location, which is \"brighton , uk.\" My task is to check if these details match any entry in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different bombing incident with various details like year, description, location, perpetrator, and casualties. The columns are: Year, Description, Location, Perpetrator, Casualties.\n\nI'll scan through the 'Description' column to find \"brighton hotel bombing.\" Scanning down, I see at row index 19 (counting from 0), the Description is \"brighton hotel bombing.\" That matches the event name in the claim.\n\nNext, I check the corresponding 'Location' for this row. The Location listed is \"brighton , uk,\" which exactly matches the location stated in the claim. \n\nSince both the event name and its location as per the table align with the claim, there's a direct match. There are no discrepancies here. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should note that while other columns like 'Year' (1984), 'Perpetrator' (\"ira\"), and 'Casualties' (\"5\") provide additional context about this event, they aren't necessary to verify the specific claim about location. However, including all relevant cells helps in confirming the accuracy comprehensively.\n\nThus, based on the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Description\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happen in enniskillen , uk\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries related to the Brighton Hotel Bombing in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row with \"brighton hotel bombing.\" Let me check its details. The location listed is \"brighton , uk,\" which aligns with what I know\u2014the bombing did occur in Brighton, UK.\n\nNow, looking at the claim again, it says the bombing happened in Enniskillen, UK. Wait a minute, that doesn't match. Enniskillen is a different place, located in Northern Ireland. From my knowledge, there was another bombing in Enniskillen on Remembrance Day in 1987, which is also listed in the table as \"remembrance day bombing.\" That one occurred in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland.\n\nSo, comparing the claim to the table, the Brighton Hotel Bombing is correctly noted under its own row with location Brighton, while the Enniskillen event is a separate entry. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that the Brighton bombing happened in Enniskillen, which isn't supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- The \"brighton hotel bombing\" row's Location.\n- The \"remembrance day bombing\" row's Location to confirm it was in Enniskillen.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
