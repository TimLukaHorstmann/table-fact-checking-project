    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim that we need to verify as TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12.\" So, we're checking if Princess Mary married William II when she was younger than 12 years old.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple entries for princesses named Mary. Let's identify them:\n\n- The first row (row index 0) is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\"\n- Another entry is in row index 5: \"mary  , princess royal 1897  - 1965.\"\n\nWait, the claim says \"princess mary,\" but we have two different Marys. We need to determine which one married William II.\n\nLooking at the first row (row 0), her name is Mary, and her husband is listed as William II, Prince of Orange. The marriage date is given as 1641 in the 'date married' column. Her birth year is 1631. So, if she was born in 1631 and married in 1641, that would make her 10 years old at the time of marriage.\n\nThat seems to fit the claim: she married William II before age 12.\n\nNow, checking row index 5 for another Mary: She is from 1897-1965 and married in 1922. Her husband isn't William II but Henry Lascelles. So this doesn't apply to the claim about William II.\n\nThus, focusing on row 0:\n\n- Birth year: 1631\n- Marriage year: 1641\n- Age at marriage: 1641 - 1631 = 10 years old\n\nSo, she was indeed married before age 12. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n1. The 'name dates' column for row 0 to confirm her name and birth year.\n2. The 'date married' column in the same row to get the marriage year.\n3. The 'husband dates' column to confirm she married William II.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at row index 0 under \"name dates,\" \"date married,\" and \"husband dates.\"\n\nI think that's all we need to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"princess louise do not married until she be around 38 year old\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to Princess Louise. Looking at the 'name dates' column:\n\nRow 5: Louise, princess royal 1867 - 1931\n\nSo that's the relevant row for Princess Louise. Her birth year is 1867 and she died in 1931.\n\nNext, I need to find out when she got married. The 'date married' column shows 1889 for her. So she was married in 1889.\n\nNow, let's calculate how old she was when she married. She was born in 1867, so subtracting that from 1889 gives me:\n\n1889 - 1867 = 22 years old.\n\nWait, but the claim says she didn't marry until around 38. Hmm, that doesn't match. According to this, she married at age 22, not 38. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any other information about her marriage? The 'husband dates' column shows Alexander Duff, who was alive from 1849-1912. But that doesn't affect her age at marriage. Also, looking back, row 5 is the only entry for Louise in the table.\n\nSo based on this data, Princess Louise married at 22, not 38. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 5: 'name dates' to confirm her identity and birth year, 'date married' to find out when she got married.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have get a divorce\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that Princess Anne, daughter of Elizabeth II, was the only one in the list who got a divorce.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a princess with details about their marriage and husbands. I'll check each princess to see if they have more than one husband listed or any indication of a divorce.\n\nStarting from the first princess:\n\n1. Mary (row 0): Married William II in 1641. Only one husband mentioned.\n2. Anne (row 1): Married William IV in 1734. One husband, no indication of divorce.\n3. Charlotte (row 2): Married Frederick I in 1797. One husband.\n4. Victoria (row 3): Married Frederick III in 1858. One husband.\n5. Louise (row 4): Married Alexander Duff in 1889. One husband.\n6. Mary (row 5): Married Henry Lascelles in 1922. One husband.\n7. Anne (row 6): Married Mark Phillips in 1973, and the next row (also Anne) married Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992.\n\nWait, rows 6 and 7 are both Anne. Row 6 shows marriage to Mark from 1973-1992, and row 7 shows her marrying Timothy in 1992. This suggests that Anne was married twice, implying a divorce between the two marriages.\n\nNow, checking if any other princess has multiple husbands:\n\nLooking through all rows, only Anne has two entries indicating two marriages. All others have single marriages or one husband each.\n\nTherefore, Princess Anne is the only one who had a divorce as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because only Princess Anne has two husbands listed, indicating a divorce.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

This tells me Charles I was born in 1600 and died in 1649.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's a princess named Mary who is related to Charles I. Looking at row 1 again, the name dates column shows \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\". So Mary was born in 1631 and died in 1660.\n\nNow, to find out how old Mary was when she died. She was born in 1631 and died in 1660. Subtracting those years gives her age at death as 29 (1660 - 1631 = 29). Since 29 is less than 40, the claim that she died before age 40 holds true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are from row 1 in the 'parent' and 'name dates' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, I'm looking for any instances where a princess has had a divorce, and whether there are exactly two others besides her.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, husband dates. The rows list different princesses with their details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one and check for any indication of divorce or multiple marriages, which could imply a divorce.\n\n1. **Row 1: Mary, Princess Royal 1631-1660** - She married William II in 1641. There's only one husband listed, so no indication of a divorce here.\n\n2. **Row 2: Anne, Princess Royal 1709-1759** - Married to William IV in 1734. Again, only one husband is mentioned, so likely no divorce.\n\n3. **Row 3: Charlotte, Princess Royal 1766-1828** - Married Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1797. Only one husband listed, so probably not divorced.\n\n4. **Row 4: Victoria, Princess Royal 1840-1901** - Married Frederick III in 1858. No mention of another marriage or divorce.\n\n5. **Row 5: Louise, Princess Royal 1867-1931** - Married Alexander Duff in 1889. Only one husband listed; no signs of divorce.\n\n6. **Row 6: Mary, Princess Royal 1897-1965** - Married Henry Lascelles in 1922. One husband only, so probably not divorced.\n\n7. **Row 7 and 8: Anne, Princess Royal 1950- (listed twice)** - First marriage to Mark Phillips from 1973-1992. Second marriage to Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992. So, she was married twice, which suggests that her first marriage ended, likely through divorce.\n\nNow, let's count the number of princesses who have been divorced:\n\n- Princess Anne is one because she has two marriages listed.\n  \nLooking for others: The other rows don't show any princesses with more than one husband or any indication of a divorce. Therefore, only Princess Anne on this list has had a divorce.\n\nThe claim states that Anne is \"1 of 3\" princesses who have been divorced.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table and the data it contains.

To find out her death year, I look at the \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" column in Row 1. It states that her reign was from 1642 to 1660. Therefore, she died in 1660.\n\nHer birth year is given as 1631 in the \"name dates\" column. To determine if she died before turning 25, I calculate her age at death:\n\n1660 (death year) - 1631 (birth year) = 29 years old.\n\nSince 29 is greater than 25, Princess Mary did not die before turning 25. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.
