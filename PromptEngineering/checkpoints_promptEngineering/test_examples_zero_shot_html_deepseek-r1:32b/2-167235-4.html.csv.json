The columns are name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party.\n\nThe claim has two parts: that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived to be the oldest prime minister and that his lifespan was from 1872 to 1963.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0 seems to be a header or placeholder, not relevant.\n- Rows 1 to 4 are individual prime ministers. Let's check each name:\n  - Kostaq Kota (twice)\n  - Pandeli Evangjeli (twice)\n  - Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri once.\n\nIn row 3, the name is Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. The born-died column shows 1872-1963. So his lifespan matches the claim.\n\nNow, to check if he was the oldest. I need to compare his death year with others.\n\nLooking at all born-died entries:\n- Kostaq Kota: died in 1949\n- Pandeli Evangjeli: died in 1939\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: died in 1963\n\nSo, 1963 is later than the others. Therefore, he lived longer.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the oldest prime minister with the lifespan 1872-1963. Checking the table, his born-died dates match, and comparing death years shows he outlived others.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Find the row for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (Row 3).\n2. **Check Lifespan:** Born in 1872, died in 1963 as stated.\n3. **Compare Ages:** Other PMs died earlier; thus, he was the oldest.\n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",  \n   \"relevant_cells\": [  \n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born  - died\"}  \n   ]  \n}",

The claim says: \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota's leadership.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It mentions two main points:\n\n1. The earliest term start date is September 5, 1928.\n2. This term was under Kostaq Kota's leadership.\n\nLooking at the table, let me check each row for relevant information.\n\nThe table has a header with columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party.\n\nRow indexes are from 0 to 4.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: All cells have \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939.\" This is likely a header or placeholder and not relevant for the claim.\n  \n- Row 1: \n  Name: Kostaq Kota (1st time)\n  Born-Died: 1889 - 1949\n  Term Start: September 5, 1928\n  Term End: March 5, 1930\n  Political Party: non-party\n\n- Row 2:\n  Name: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time)\n  Born-Died: 1859 - 1939\n  Term Start: March 6, 1930\n  Term End: October 16, 1935\n  Political Party: non-party\n\n- Row 3:\n  Name: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time)\n  Born-Died: 1872 - 1963\n  Term Start: October 22, 1935\n  Term End: November 9, 1936\n  Political Party: non-party\n\n- Row 4:\n  Name: Kostaq Kota (2nd time)\n  Born-Died: 1889 - 1949\n  Term Start: November 9, 1936\n  Term End: April 8, 1939\n  Political Party: non-party\n\nNow, I need to verify both points of the claim.\n\nPoint 1: The earliest term start is September 5, 1928. Looking at all the term start dates:\n\n- Row 1: Sep 5, 1928 (earliest so far)\n- Row 2: Mar 6, 1930\n- Row 3: Oct 22, 1935\n- Row 4: Nov 9, 1936\n\nSo the earliest term start is indeed Sep 5, 1928 in Row 1.\n\nPoint 2: This was under Kostaq Kota's leadership. In Row 1, the name is \"Kostaq Kota (1st time)\", which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, both points are supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Term start date for Row 1 (September 5, 1928)\n- Name for Row 1 (Kostaq Kota)\n\nSo the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The rows represent different prime ministers along with their details.\n\nThe claim is that all the listed prime ministers have no political party. To verify this, I need to check each row's \"political party\" column.\n\nStarting from the first data row (index 1), which is Kostaq Kota (1st time). His political party is listed as \"non - party.\" That fits with the claim.\n\nNext, Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time) also has \"non - party\" under his political party. So far, so good.\n\nMoving to Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time), again the political party is \"non - party.\" This continues to support the claim.\n\nThen there's Kostaq Kota (2nd time), and once more, his political party is listed as \"non - party.\" So all four prime ministers in the table have no political party.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries or possible exceptions. Looking at row 0, it seems to be a header or perhaps an overarching title for the list, but it's not a specific individual.

The claim states: \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936, after mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term end.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are 'name', 'born - died', 'term start', 'term end', and 'political party'. There are five rows in total.\n\nLooking for entries related to kostaq kota and mehdi bej frash\u00ebri. From the table:\n\n- For kostaq kota, there's a first time and a second time entry. The relevant one here is his second term because the claim refers to his term starting on 9 November 1936.\n\nIn row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0), under 'term start' it says 9 November 1936 for kostaq kota's second time as PM. \n\nNow, checking mehdi bej frash\u00ebri. His entry is in row index 3. Under 'term end', it's listed as 9 November 1936. So his term ended on the same day that kostaq kota's term started.\n\nThe claim says that kostaq kota's term starts after mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term ends. Since both terms start and end on the same date, does that mean one is after the other? Well, in reality, if two terms are consecutive without any gap, the next term can be considered as starting right after the previous ended. However, strictly looking at the data here, mehdi's term ends on 9 November 1936 and kostaq's starts on the same day. So it's not exactly after; they overlap on that date.\n\nBut sometimes in such contexts, if one ends and another begins on the same date, it might be interpreted as the next starting immediately after. However, based solely on the data given without assuming any ordering beyond what's stated, we can see that kostaq's term starts on the exact day mehdi's ended.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because kostaq's term starts on 9 November 1936, which is the same day mehdi's term ends. The wording of the claim doesn't specify whether there's a gap or not, just that it starts after. So in this case, since they are back-to-back on the same date, it holds as TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- For kostaq kota's second term: row index 4, 'term start'.\n- For mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term end: row index 3, 'term end'.\n\nSo these two cells confirm the dates in question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It has five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party. There are several rows, each representing a prime minister's term from 1928 to 1939.\n\nThe claim states that \"kostaq kota and mehdi bej frash\u00ebri were both 1st time prime ministers of Albania.\" To verify this, I need to check if both individuals served as prime ministers for the first time during their respective terms.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row seems to be a header or an overall description but isn't relevant for individual entries.\n2. The second row is about Kostaq Kota (1st time). His term started on September 5, 1928, and ended on March 5, 1930. The note \"(1st time)\" indicates that this was his first term as prime minister.\n3. The third row is Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), so it's not relevant to the claim.\n4. The fourth row is about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time).

It has columns: name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. I need to focus on the names and their birth-death years.\n\nLooking for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: he's in row 3 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). His born-died is 1872 - 1963. So he lived from 1872 to 1963, which is a lifespan of 91 years.\n\nNext, Pandeli Evangjeli is in row 2. He was born in 1859 and died in 1939. That's 80 years old.\n\nKostaq Kota appears twice, first time in row 1 and second time in row 4. He was born in 1889 and died in 1949, so that's 60 years.\n\nMehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is the oldest, followed by Pandeli Evangjeli. The claim says Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli, but according to the data, Mehdi is actually older than Pandeli. So the claim would be incorrect because Mehdi should be the oldest, not the second.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. Mehdi's death year is 1963, which is later than Pandeli's 1939. So Mehdi lived longer and died after Pandeli. That means Mehdi was older when he died. Therefore, Mehdi would be the oldest prime minister in this list, making Pandeli second. The claim states that Mehdi is second to Pandeli, which contradicts the data.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri actually lived longer and was older than Pandeli Evangjeli.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because according to the table, mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (died in 1963) lived longer than pandeli evangjeli (died in 1939).

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems like it's trying to say that Albania has had prime ministers who were part of a political party. The wording isn't perfect, but I think that's the gist of it. So, essentially, we're checking if any of the prime ministers listed in the table belonged to a political party.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. The rows contain data about different prime ministers during 1928-1939.\n\nNow, let's go through each row one by one to see their political party affiliations.\n\nThe first row seems like a header or maybe an overall title because all the cells say \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939.\" So, that's probably not relevant for checking individual prime ministers. \n\nNext is Kostaq Kota (1st time). His term was from September 5, 1928, to March 5, 1930. The political party column says \"non - party.\" That means he wasn't part of a political party.\n\nThen we have Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time) with terms from March 6, 1930, to October 16, 1935. Again, the political party is listed as \"non - party.\"\n\nMoving on to Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time), his term was from October 22, 1935, to November 9, 1936. The political party column still says \"non - party.\"\n\nFinally, Kostaq Kota served again (2nd time) from November 9, 1936, to April 8, 1939, and once more, the political party is \"non - party.\"\n\nSo, looking at all these entries, every prime minister listed has a political party affiliation of \"non - party.\" That means none of them were part of a political party during their terms.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Albania has seen prime ministers from a political party isn't supported by this table. All the relevant cells show that each prime minister was non-affiliated with any party.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because all entries in the \"political party\" column indicate \"non - party.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936, after pandeli evangjeli's term end.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns for name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see that Kostaq Kota appears twice: once as his first time in office from 1928 to 1930, and then again starting on November 9, 1936. Pandeli Evangjeli also has two terms listed, but in this case, the relevant one is his second term which ended on October 16, 1935.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking closer, Pandeli's term end date is October 16, 1935. Then Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri took over from October 22, 1935, to November 9, 1936. After that, Kostaq Kota started his second term on November 9, 1936.\n\nSo the claim is that Kostaq's term starts after Pandeli's term ends. But wait, Pandeli's term ended in 1935, and Mehdi was prime minister until 1936 when Kostaq came back. So yes, Kostaq started his second term after both Pandeli's second term and Mehdi's first term.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Kostaq Kota's term start date (November 9, 1936) comes after Pandeli Evangjeli's term end date (October 16, 1935). \n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells. For Kostaq Kota's second term start, that's in row 4 (assuming rows are zero-indexed, so row index 3) under 'term start'. Pandeli Evangjeli's term end is in row 2 (row index 1) under 'term end'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3, column 'term start' for Kostaq's second term.\n- Row index 1, column 'term end' for Pandeli's term.\n\nThat should be sufficient to verify the claim. I don't think other rows contribute to this specific claim since it only concerns these two individuals and their respective term dates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Kostaq Kota started his second term after Pandeli Evangjeli's term ended.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"the only 1st time minister of Albania be Pandeli Evangjeli\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. There are five rows in total, with the first row being a header for each column.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Pandeli Evangjeli as the only 1st time minister. So I'll need to check if there are any other entries that mention \"1st time\" in the name column besides his entry.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The second row is Kostaq Kota (1st time). This indicates he was a prime minister for the first time, so this is another instance of someone serving as the 1st time minister.\n2. The third row is Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), which doesn't fit since it's his second term.\n3. The fourth row is Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time), another first-time minister.\n4. The fifth row is Kostaq Kota again, this time for the 2nd time.\n\nSo from this, I can see that there are at least two other individuals who served as prime ministers for the first time: Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. Therefore, Pandeli Evangjeli isn't the only one with a \"1st time\" entry in his name; others have it too.\n\nThis means the claim is incorrect because there are multiple individuals who served as 1st time ministers, not just Pandeli Evangjeli.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only first-time minister. However, the table shows other instances of \"1st time\" in the name column for Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
