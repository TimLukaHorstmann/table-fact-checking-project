    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"alabama be the opponent when they play at legion field birmingham , al\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has columns: date, opponent, site, result, attendance. There are multiple rows of data under these headers. The claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the opponent is Alabama and the location is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where both conditions are met\u2014opponent is Alabama and site is Legion Field Birmingham, AL. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. September 5: Opponent is Virginia Tech, site is Lane Stadium Blacksburg, VA.\n2. September 12: Chattanooga, Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Greenville, NC.\n3. September 19: Ohio, Peden Stadium Athens, OH.\n4. October 3: Army, same stadium as above.\n5. October 10: UAB, same stadium again.\n6. October 17: Opponent is Alabama, site is Legion Field Birmingham, AL. Here, both conditions are met.\n7. October 24: Southern Miss in Hattiesburg, MS.\n8. October 31: Houston at Dowdy-Ficklen.\n9. November 5: Cincinnati at Nippert Stadium.\n10. November 14: Louisville same stadium.\n11. November 21: Memphis at Liberty Bowl.\n\nSo the row on October 17 has Alabama as the opponent and the site is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells. The 'opponent' column for this row is \"alabama\" and the 'site' column is \"legion field birmingham , al\". So both these columns are important to confirm the claim.\n\nThus, I'll note the row index where this occurs. Looking back, October 17 is the 6th data row (if starting count from 0), so row_index is 5 because after September rows, it's the fifth index in the tbody.\n\nWait, let me recount: The first row is index 0, then each subsequent row increments by one. So October 17 would be row index 5 (since there are 6 data rows before that? Wait no, let me count properly.\n\nLooking at the tbody:\n\nRows:\n0: September 5\n1: September 12\n2: September 19\n3: October 3\n4: October 10\n5: October 17 (this is the row with Alabama)\nSo yes, row index is 5 for this entry.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in column 'opponent' and 'site' of row 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because the opponent was indeed Alabama at Legion Field Birmingham on October 17. \n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim is: \"on november 14 louisville play at dowdy  - ficklen stadium greenville  , nc\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n- Date: November 14\n- Opponent: Louisville\n- Site: Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium, Greenville, NC\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table that matches these three details.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 data rows before the time note). Let me go through each row.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n- Date: September 5\n- Opponent: Virginia Tech\n- Site: Lane Stadium Blacksburg, VA\n\nNot matching November 14 or Louisville.\n\nRow 1:\n- September 12 vs Chattanooga at Dowdy-Ficklen. Doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- September 19 vs Ohio. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- October 3 vs Army. Still not the right date or opponent.\n\nRow 4:\n- October 10 vs UAB. Nope.\n\nRow 5:\n- October 17 vs Alabama at Legion Field. Different site and date.\n\nRow 6:\n- October 24 vs Southern Miss. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7:\n- October 31 vs Houston. Not the date or opponent we're looking for.\n\nRow 8:\n- November 5 vs Cincinnati at Nippert Stadium. Not Louisville, different site.\n\nRow 9:\n- November 14 vs Louisville. This is promising! Let's check the site.\nSite: Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Greenville, NC. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nSo this row (index 9) has all three components matching the claim: date, opponent, and site. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nAdditionally, looking at Row 10:\n- November 21 vs Memphis at Liberty Bowl. Doesn't affect our current claim.\n\nThe last row mentions times, so it's not relevant here.\n\nSo, only Row 9 matches all parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. The claim mentions Alabama as the opponent and an attendance figure of 80,079. My goal is to find if there's a row where the opponent is Alabama and check what the attendance was on that day.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table body:\n\n1. September 5: Opponent is Virginia Tech. Not Alabama.\n2. September 12: Chattanooga. No match.\n3. September 19: Ohio. No.\n4. October 3: Army. Nope.\n5. October 10: UAB. Still not.\n6. October 17: Here's the opponent, Alabama! Now I'll check the attendance in this row. The attendance is listed as 80079.\n\nSo the relevant cell for the opponent is at row index 5 (since counting starts from 0, it's actually the sixth row), and the column is 'opponent'. For attendance, the same row but under 'attendance' column has the value 80079. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows with Alabama as the opponent to avoid any confusion. Looking through the rest of the table, I don't see Alabama listed again, so this is the only relevant entry.\n\nTherefore, since the attendance when playing against Alabama was indeed 80,079, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 31002 crowd attendance when uab be the opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game with details for each column.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: an attendance number (31002) when the opponent is UAB. So I need to find a row where the opponent is UAB and check if the attendance in that row matches 31002.\n\nLooking through the rows, let's scan for \"uab\" in the opponent column. Scanning each row:\n\n- September 5: Opponent is Virginia Tech.\n- September 12: Chattanooga.\n- September 19: Ohio.\n- October 3: Army.\n- October 10: UAB. This is the one.\n\nSo, the row for October 10 has opponent UAB. Now, checking the attendance column in that row. The attendance number there is 31002. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. I should mark it as TRUE and note which cells are relevant: the opponent cell for UAB (row index 4) and the attendance cell with 31002 (same row).\n\nSo the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row_index 4 for both opponent and attendance columns.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:** The claim specifies two key data points - \"uab\" as the opponent and an attendance of \"31002\".\n2. **Search for Opponent 'UAB':** Scan each row's opponent column to find where it matches 'uab'.\n3. **Locate Matching Row:** Found in row index 4 (October 10), opponent is UAB.\n4. **Check Attendance Value:** In the same row, the attendance is listed as 31002, which matches the claim.\n5. **Conclusion:** Both conditions are satisfied; hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"on september 12, the attendance be 34028 against the opponent chattanooga.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The date mentioned is September 12. So, I should look for a row in the table where the 'date' column has \"september 12\". Next, the opponent is Chattanooga, so I'll check the 'opponent' column in that same row. Finally, the attendance is given as 34028, which means I need to verify the number in the 'attendance' column for that specific date and opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, it's an HTML table with headers: date, opponent, site, result, attendance. The rows start from index 0. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0 (september 5): Opponent is Virginia Tech, so not relevant.\n- Row 1 (september 12): Here's the date we're looking for. Let's check opponent and attendance.\n\nIn row 1:\n- Date: september 12 \u2013 matches.\n- Opponent: chattanooga \u2013 matches.\n- Attendance: 34028 \u2013 which is exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are correctly represented in this row. The relevant cells would be 'date' (to confirm it's September 12), 'opponent' (to ensure it's Chattanooga), and 'attendance' (to check the number). \n\nI don't see any discrepancies here.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table in HTML format and a claim to verify. The task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"alabama be the opponent when the attendance be 81079.\" Hmm, that wording seems a bit off, but I think it's asking if Alabama was the opponent during a game where the attendance was 81,079.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find rows where both conditions are met: the opponent is Alabama and the attendance is exactly 81079. Let me scan through each row of the table.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few rows have opponents like Virginia Tech, Chattanooga, Ohio, Army, UAB, and so on. None of these seem to match Alabama yet.\n- Then, I come across a row with opponent \"alabama.\" That's definitely one of the conditions. Now, looking at the attendance for that row: it says 80079. Wait, is that 81079? No, it's actually 80,079. So that's not matching the claim.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the table:\n- The other opponents include Southern Miss, Houston, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Memphis. None of these are Alabama.\n- There's another row labeled \"all times are in eastern,\" but I think that's just a footer note and doesn't contain relevant data for this claim.\n\nSo, from what I can see, there is only one game against Alabama, and the attendance was 80,079 on that day. The claim states the attendance as 81,079, which is slightly higher than what's recorded in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided because while there was a game against Alabama, the attendance didn't reach 81,079. It was 80,079 instead.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row index 5 where opponent is 'alabama' and attendance is 80079.
