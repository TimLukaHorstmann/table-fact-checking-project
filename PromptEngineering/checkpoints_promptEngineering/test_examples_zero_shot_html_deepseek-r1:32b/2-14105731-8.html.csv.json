The format here is q145.\n\nSo, the only relevant cell for season 6 is in row 5 (0-based index 5) under 'format'.\n\nSince this cell shows the format as q145, the claim matches exactly.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It's saying that in season 6, the format used was q245. So I need to look for rows where the season column has a value of 6 and check what the corresponding format is.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Season 1, format h75\n- Row 1: Season 2, format h76\n- Row 2: Season 3, format q143\n- Row 3: Season 4, format q144\n- Row 4: Season 5, format h77\n- Row 5: Season 6, format q145\n- Row 6: Season 7, format q146\n- Row 7: Season 8, format h78\n- Row 8: Season 9, format q147\n- Row 9: Season 10, format h79\n- Row 10: Season 11, format h80\n- Row 11: Season 12, format q148\n- Row 12: Season 13, format q149\n- Row 13: Season 14, format q150\n- Rows 14 and beyond are beyond the provided data.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table, each row has a season from 1 to 16. Let me correct that:\n\nRow indices go up to 15 (since there are 16 rows in total). So:\n\nRow 0: Season 1\n...\nRow 5: Season 6\n\nIn Row 5, which is the sixth row (index 5), the season is 6 and the format is q145. The claim mentions \"q245\", which doesn't match. Therefore, the correct format for season 6 is q145, not q245.\n\nSo the relevant cell is Row 5's 'format' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "223 be the only episode number with q147 format",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It's asserting that episode number 223 is the sole one in the table that uses the format \"q147\". To verify this, I need to check two things: whether episode 223 indeed has the q147 format and if no other episodes have this same format.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate. The column we're interested in is \"format\". I'll scan through each row to see where the format is listed as q147.\n\nStarting from the top, row 0 has episode 217 with format h75. Not relevant. Row 1: episode 218, format h76. Still not q147. Row 2: episode 219, format q143. Close but not quite. Row 3: episode 220, format q144. Hmm. Moving on to row 4: episode 221 with h77. No match yet.\n\nRow 5 has episode 222 and format q145. Still not there. Then row 6 is episode 223 with format q147. That's our first hit. So, yes, episode 223 does have the q147 format.\n\nNow I need to check if any other episodes also have this format. Let me continue scanning the remaining rows. Row 7: episode 224, h78. No. Row 8: episode 225 with q147. Oh wait! Here's another one. So that's two episodes with q147\u2014223 and 225.\n\nWait a second, does row 8 belong to episode 225? Let me confirm the details. Yes, in row 8 (index starts at 0), the episode number is 229? No, wait. Wait, let me recount the rows properly because I might have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait no, looking back: Row indices start from 0. So:\n\nRow 0: 217\nRow 1: 218\nRow 2: 219\nRow 3: 220\nRow 4: 221\nRow 5: 222\nRow 6: 223 (q147)\nRow 7: 224 (h78)\nRow 8: 225 (q147) \u2013 here's another one. So, that's two episodes with q147.\n\nWait, so row 8 is episode 225? Let me double-check the table structure to make sure I'm looking at the right rows and columns. The \"episode\" column is the first one after the index. Looking again:\n\n- Row 6 (index 6): Episode 223, format q147.\n- Row 8: Episode 225, format q147.\n\nSo yes, episode 225 also has the q147 format. Therefore, there are at least two episodes with that format\u2014episodes 223 and 225. This means the claim that 223 is the only one is false because another episode shares the same format.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't miss any other rows beyond row 8. Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 9: Episode 226 (but looking at the data provided, it's actually up to episode 232). Wait, perhaps I got confused with the index numbering.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, after row 6 (episode 223), the next rows are:\n\n7: 224 (h78)\n8: 225 (q147)\n9: 226 (q148)\n10: 227 (q149)\n11: 228 (q150)\n12: 229 (h81)\n13: 230 (h82)\n\nWait, no. Let me recount properly because the table has 16 rows in total.\n\nLet's list all episodes and their formats:\n\n- Episode 217: h75\n- Episode 218: h76\n- Episode 219: q143\n- Episode 220: q144\n- Episode 221: h77\n- Episode 222: q145\n- Episode 223: q147 (row index 6)\n- Episode 224: h78\n- Episode 225: q147 (row index 8)\n- Episode 226: q148\n- Episode 227: q149\n- Episode 228: q150\n- Episode 229: h81\n- Episode 230: h82\n\nSo, both episode 223 (row index 6) and 225 (row index 8) have the format q147. Therefore, the claim that \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format\" is false because there's another episode with the same format.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are rows 6 and 8 in the 'format' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
