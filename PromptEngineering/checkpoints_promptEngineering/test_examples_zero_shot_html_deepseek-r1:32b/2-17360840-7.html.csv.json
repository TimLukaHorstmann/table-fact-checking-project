    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any games where the opponent is the Buffalo Sabres. Scanning through the 'opponent' column, I see that in row index 46 (which is actually the 47th game if counting from 1), the opponent is listed as \"buffalo sabres.\" That's a match.\n\nNext, I need to check what the attendance was for that specific game. The relevant column here is 'attendance.' For row index 46, under the 'attendance' column, the value is 15611. \n\nThe claim states the attendance was 10750. Comparing this with the actual figure from the table, it's clear they don't match. So, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and I'll note which cells were relevant for checking: the 'opponent' column in row 46 to confirm the opponent was Buffalo Sabres, and the 'attendance' column in the same row to verify the attendance number.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
