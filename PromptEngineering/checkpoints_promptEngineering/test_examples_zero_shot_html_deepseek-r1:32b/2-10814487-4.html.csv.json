    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the score on 15/04/07 in super league xii be 52-22\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim. The date mentioned is 15th April 2007 (assuming the format dd/mm/yy), and it's referring to a game in Super League XII. The score claimed is 52-22. \n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. It has columns: Date, Team 1, Score, Team 2, Attend., Competition. So, each row represents a match with details like date, teams involved, scores, attendance, and competition.\n\nMy goal is to find a row where:\n- The Date is 15/04/07.\n- The Competition is Super League XII.\n- The Score is 52-22.\n\nI'll scan through each row starting from index 0. \n\nLooking at the first few rows, none seem to have the date 15/04/07. I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Date is 31/03/07 - not matching.\nRow 1: 09/04/07 - nope.\nRow 2: 15/04/07 - this matches the date! Now, check the competition. It says Super League XII? Let me see: yes, under Competition column for this row it's \"super league xii\". So that's correct.\n\nNow, checking the score. The Score cell is \"28-16\" according to the table. Wait, but the claim says 52-22. That doesn't match. Hmm, did I get the right row?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Row index starts at 0. So row 2 is index 2: Date 15/04/07, Team1 Huddersfield Giants, Score 28-16, Team2 Bradford Bulls, Attend 12931, Competition Super League XII.\n\nSo the score here is 28-16, not 52-22. Therefore, the claim's score doesn't match what's in the table.\n\nBut wait a second, maybe I missed another row with the same date? Let me check further down the table to see if there's another entry on 15/04/07.\n\nContinuing from row 3 onwards:\n\nRow 3: Date 22/04/07.\nRow 4: 29/04/07.\nRow 5: 06/05/07.\n... and so on. There's no other entry with 15/04/07.\n\nTherefore, the only row that matches the date is row index 2, which shows a score of 28-16 in Super League XII. Since this doesn't match the claimed score of 52-22, the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there's any ambiguity about the teams involved or if perhaps the score was recorded differently (e.g., reversed). But in this case, Team1 is Huddersfield Giants and Team2 is Bradford Bulls. The score is listed as 28-16, meaning Huddersfield scored 28 points and Bradford 16.\n\nSo there's no way the score could be interpreted as 52-22 based on this data. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on April 15, 2007, in Super League XII, the score was 52-22. Upon reviewing the table, the relevant row (index 2) shows a match on that date with a different score of 28-16. Thus, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the claim: \"the super league xii score on 21 / 07 / 07 be 14 - 10.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the row that corresponds to July 21, 2007. Scanning the \"Date\" column, I see several entries but none exactly match \"21/07/07\". Wait, there's a date on August 5th, which is \"05 / 08 / 07\" and another on September 21st as \"21 /9 /07.\" Hmm, that might be confusing. Let me check if any row has the exact date of July 21.\n\nLooking again, I don't see a row with \"21/07/07.\" The closest is August 5th and September 21st. Since there's no exact match for July 21, perhaps the claim refers to one of these dates. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation of the date format.\n\nNext, I should check which games are labeled as \"super league xii.\" Looking at the \"Competition\" column, most entries are \"Super League XII,\" except for some that say \"Championship\". The claim specifies \"super league xii,\" so we're focusing on those rows where Competition is Super League XII.\n\nNow, looking at each relevant row:\n\n1. For the game on August 5th, 2007 (row index 13), the score was 38-24 between Bradford and Wakefield. That doesn't match 14-10.\n2. On September 21st, 2007 (row index 19), the score was 30-31 against Wigan Warriors. Again, not matching.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows? Let me recount from the top:\n\nRow indexes start at 0. The first few rows are before July, then August, and September. So row index 8 is July 5th with a score of 38-24 in Super League XII. No, that's not 14-10 either.\n\nLooking further down, perhaps I missed something. Another approach: check all rows where Competition is \"Super League XII\" and see their scores on the given dates.\n\nAfter reviewing each row, it seems there's no game on July 21st in Super League XII with a score of 14-10. The closest possible confusion might be September 21st, but that was a different score.\n\nTherefore, since there's no matching date and score combination for the claim, it must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim made about a specific match in Super League XII on April 15, 2007. The claim states that the score was 52-22 with an attendance of 9000 people. To do this, I'll go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's a row corresponding to April 15, 2007. Scanning through the rows, starting from index 0, I check the \"Date\" column for that date. The first row (index 0) has \"15/04/07\", which matches the date in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm the score. In the table, each row shows the score as two numbers separated by a hyphen. For this row, the score is listed as 52-22. That directly corresponds to the claim's score of 52 to 22, so that checks out.\n\nNow, checking the attendance. The \"Attendance\" column in this row has the number 9000, which exactly matches the attendance figure given in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that the competition is Super League XII as stated in the claim. The table's header mentions it's for \"Super League XII,\" and this specific row doesn't have a different competition listed, so that aligns correctly.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies in these points. All aspects of the claim are accurately represented in the table data for that particular date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this problem step by step. I need to verify the claim: \"the score on 21 / 07 / 07 be 14 to 10 and the home team be bradford.\" So, first, I should understand what exactly is being claimed here.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. The score on July 21, 2007 (assuming the date format is DD/MM/YY) was 14-10.\n2. The home team for that match was Bradford.\n\nI'll start by looking at the table provided to see if there's a row corresponding to this date. Scanning through the \"Date\" column, I find an entry on row 6 with the date \"19 / 08 / 07.\" Wait, that doesn't match. Let me check again. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the rows carefully.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- The first data row is index 0: \"21/5/07\" \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 1: \"28/5/07\"\n- Row 2: \"3/6/07\"\n- Row 3: \"10/6/07\"\n- Row 4: \"17/6/07\"\n- Row 5: \"24/6/07\"\n- Row 6: \"8/7/07\" \u2013 still not matching.\n- Row 7: \"15/7/07\"\n- Row 8: \"22/7/07\" \u2013 getting closer.\nWait, perhaps I missed it earlier. Let me check the exact date \"21 / 07 / 07.\" Scanning through all rows:\n\nLooking at row 8: Date is \"22/7/07,\" so not quite. Row 9: \"29/7/07\" \u2013 nope. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the index.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out each row with their indexes:\n\nRow 0: 21/5/07\nRow 1: 28/5/07\nRow 2: 3/6/07\nRow 3: 10/6/07\nRow 4: 17/6/07\nRow 5: 24/6/07\nRow 6: 8/7/07\nRow 7: 15/7/07\nRow 8: 22/7/07\nRow 9: 29/7/07\nRow 10: 5/8/07\nRow 11: 12/8/07\nRow 12: 19/8/07\nRow 13: 2/9/07\nRow 14: 9/9/07\nRow 15: 14/9/07\nRow 16: 21/9/07\n\nWait, none of these dates match \"21 / 07 / 07.\" So perhaps the claim is about July 21, 2007, but in the table, I don't see any entry with that exact date. Therefore, the first condition (the score being 14-10) can't be verified because there's no matching row for that date.\n\nHowever, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss it. Maybe the date is written differently, like \"21/7/07\" instead of \"21 / 07 / 07.\" Looking again:\n\nRow 6: 8/7/07\nRow 7: 15/7/07\nRow 8: 22/7/07\n\nNo, there's no row with \"21/7/07.\" So the claim refers to a date that isn't present in the table. Therefore, both conditions of the claim are not supported by the data provided.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the date format. Could it be month/day/year instead? Let me check if any row has 21 as the day and July (07) as the month. For example:\n\nRow 6: 8/7/07 \u2013 8th of July\nRow 7: 15/7/07 \u2013 15th of July\nRow 8: 22/7/07 \u2013 22nd of July\n\nNo, none of these are the 21st. Therefore, the claim's date doesn't exist in the table.\n\nSince there's no row for \"21 / 07 / 07,\" both the score and the home team can't be verified. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be fully supported because there's no entry for July 21, 2007 (\"21/07/07\") in the table. \n\nAnswer: The claim is partially incorrect as the specified date does not exist in the dataset.",
