    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"neil labute be nominate for best play in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Person**: Neil LaBute\n2. **Action**: Being nominated\n3. **Category**: Best Play\n4. **Year**: 2009\n\nNow, looking at the table structure provided in HTML format, I see that it contains several columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result.\n\nI'll start by filtering the rows to those from the year 2009 since that's specified in the claim. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first row is for the Tony Award, Best Play category, with Neil LaBute as the nominee and the result being \"nominated\".\n- The second row also pertains to the Tony Awards but in a different category (Best Performance by a Leading Actor), so it doesn't apply here.\n- The third row again is from the Tony Awards but for Best Featured Actress, which isn't relevant either.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are from the Drama Desk Award, which aren't related to the Tony Award's Best Play category mentioned in the claim.\n- The last two rows are from the Theatre World Award, which doesn't pertain to Best Play.\n\nSo, focusing on the first row (row index 0), it directly matches all elements of the claim. Neil LaBute was indeed nominated for Best Play at the Tony Awards in 2009, and the result was a nomination as stated.\n\nTherefore, since the table confirms that Neil LaBute was nominated for Best Play in 2009, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell here is from row index 0 across all necessary columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"thomas sadoski be nominate for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key elements of the claim:\n1. Name: Thomas Sadoski\n2. Nominated for: Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\n3. Year: 2009\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about nominees and their results. I need to check if there's a row where the nominee is Thomas Sadoski, the category matches the claim, and the year is 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2009, Tony Award, Best Play, Neil Labute. Doesn't match.\n- Row 1: Year 2009, Tony Award, Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play, Thomas Sadoski, result is nominated. This matches all the claim's elements.\n- Rows 2 to 6: None of these mention Thomas Sadoski in that specific category.\n\nSo, row 1 has the relevant information confirming the nomination. Therefore, the claim is true.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"reason to be pretty be nominate for best play more than 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First off, the wording of the claim isn't perfect, but it seems like it's saying that \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was nominated for Best Play more than once.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several entries for different award ceremonies and categories in 2009. The relevant parts are the 'award ceremony', 'category', and 'nominee' columns. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: It's a Tony Award nomination for Best Play by Neil LaBute. So, \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was nominated once here.\n2. **Row 3**: This is the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, and the nominee is listed as \"Outstanding Play.\" That seems like it's referring to the play itself being nominated again under a different award ceremony.\n\nSo, we have two separate nominations: one from the Tony Awards and another from the Drama Desk Awards. Each of these counts as a nomination in their respective ceremonies for Best Play (or Outstanding Play). \n\nTherefore, since there are at least two nominations in different categories within the same year, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was nominated for Best Play twice: once at the Tony Awards and once at the Drama Desk Awards.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an HTML table and a claim about it, asking whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. My task is to determine this by checking each condition in the claim against the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It contains data from 2009 about various award ceremonies like Tony Awards, Drama Desk Awards, and Theatre World Award. Each row has details such as year, ceremony name, category, nominee, and result.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony.\" Hmm, this is a bit unclear in English, but I think it's trying to say that before 2009, there was no other year where someone was nominated at the Drama Desk Award ceremony. Or perhaps it means that 2009 was the only year with a nomination.\n\nWait, maybe the intended meaning is that prior to 2009, there were no nominations at the Drama Desk Awards for \"reason to be pretty.\" So I need to check if any rows in the table show a nominee from before 2009 in the Drama Desk Awards category.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- All entries are from 2009.\n- There are three Drama Desk Award entries: Outstanding Play, Outstanding Actor in a Play (Thomas Sadoski), and Outstanding Director of a Play (Terry Kinney). The nominees for these categories were nominated but did not win.\n\nSince all the data is from 2009, there's no information about years before that. Therefore, we can't confirm if prior years had nominations or not because the table doesn't include such data.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the claim. Perhaps it's stating that 2009 was the only year where someone was nominated at the Drama Desk Awards for \"reason to be pretty.\" But looking at the categories in the table for Drama Desk Awards: they're Outstanding Play, Outstanding Actor in a Play, and Outstanding Director of a Play. There's no specific mention of a play named \"Reason to Be Pretty.\"\n\nSo if the claim is about whether before 2009 there were any nominations, but since all entries are from 2009, we don't have data for prior years. Hence, the table doesn't provide information about years before 2009.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be supported by the given data because the table only includes 2009. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
