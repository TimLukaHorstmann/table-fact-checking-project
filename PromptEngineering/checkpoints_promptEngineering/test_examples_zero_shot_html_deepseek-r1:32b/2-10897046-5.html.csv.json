The claim states that \"of the players shown in the table, 7 of them be from the United States.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each player's nationality as listed under the \"Country\" column. Each row represents a player, and their country is specified there.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Country is Canada\n2. **Row 1**: Country is United States\n3. **Row 2**: Country is Canada\n4. **Row 3**: Country is United States\n5. **Row 4**: Country is Canada\n6. **Row 5**: Country is Canada\n7. **Row 6**: Country is Sweden\n8. **Row 7**: Country is United States\n9. **Row 8**: Country is Canada\n10. **Row 9**: Country is Canada\n11. **Row 10**: Country is United States\n12. **Row 11**: Country is Canada\n13. **Row 12**: Country is Sweden\n14. **Row 13**: Country is United States\n15. **Row 14**: Country is Canada\n16. **Row 15**: Country is Sweden\n17. **Row 16**: Country is United States\n18. **Row 17**: Country is Canada\n19. **Row 18**: Country is United States\n\nNow, counting the number of players from the United States:\n\n- Row 1: US (1)\n- Row 3: US (2)\n- Row 7: US (3)\n- Row 10: US (4)\n- Row 13: US (5)\n- Row 16: US (6)\n- Row 18: US (7)\n\nThat's a total of 7 players from the United States.

The claim made is that \"Joonas Nattinen is the only player from Finland shown in the table.\" My task is to verify this claim by checking each relevant cell in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be checked. The key points are:\n\n1. Identify if there's a player named Joonas Nattinen in the table.\n2. Determine his country of origin.\n3. Check all other players' countries to ensure none are from Finland besides him.\n\nStarting with step one, I'll scan through each row looking for \"Joonas Nattinen.\" Looking at the rows, I don't see that name listed. The names start from 1 to 91, but I don't recall seeing Joonas Nattinen in any of them.\n\nNow, moving on to step two, even if he weren't in the table, the second part is checking whether Finland has more players. Since there's no mention of Finland in the \"Country\" column across all rows, that means there are zero players from Finland. Therefore, the claim can't be true because Joonas Nattinen isn't present, and even if he were, there's no one else from Finland.\n\nWait, but since Joonas Nattinen isn't in the table at all, the initial part of the claim is false. So, regardless of other players, the statement that he is the only one from Finland can't hold because he's not even listed here.\n\nSo, compiling this information: there are no Finnish players in the table, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

But I don't see Anders Nilsson listed in the table provided. Since he's not present, it's impossible for him to have been picked before others who are listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no record of Anders Nilsson being selected, and Simon Bertilsson was the first Swedish player picked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Anders Nilsson was picked before any other Swedish players.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"taylor beck be pick 4 place before ryan howse\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about the draft picks: Taylor Beck was picked in the 4th place before Ryan Howse. I think this refers to their positions in the draft order\u2014whether Taylor Beck was selected earlier (i.e., a lower pick number) than Ryan Howse.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with details like Name, Position, Team, and Pick Number. The \"Pick Number\" column is crucial here because it indicates the order in which players were picked. Lower numbers mean they were picked earlier.\n\nI'll search for Taylor Beck and Ryan Howse in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Taylor Beck is on row 13 (0-based index, so row_index 12). His pick number is listed as 4.\n- Ryan Howse is on row 81 (row_index 80). His pick number is listed as 57.\n\nNow, comparing their pick numbers: Taylor has a pick number of 4, and Ryan has 57. Since 4 comes before 57 in the draft order, this means Taylor was picked earlier than Ryan.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are both players' names and their respective pick numbers. So I'll note down the row indices and column names for each.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Taylor Beck was indeed picked at a lower (earlier) number than Ryan Howse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Name\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Pick Number\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 80, \"column_name\": \"Name\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 80, \"column_name\": \"Pick Number\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of players and some information about them. The claim is that \"Michael Lee be the last player in the table to be chosen from the United States.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The claim says Michael Lee is the last player selected who's from the United States. So, I guess that means among all the players in the table, if you look at those from the US, Michael should be listed after everyone else, right? Or maybe it's about being chosen last in a selection process.\n\nWait, but how does the table structure help me verify this? The table has each player with their country. So I need to check which players are from the United States and then see if Michael Lee is indeed the last one among them.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 3: Daniel Delisle, United States\n- Row 4: Gleason Fournier, Canada\nWait, no, let me look carefully. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow indices start from 0. So each row has player info including \"Country.\" I need to find all players with \"Country\" as the United States.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Row 3: Daniel Delisle, Country: United States\n- Any others? Let's check each one:\n\nRow 28: Simon Bertilsson, Sweden\nRow 29: Mattias Lindstrom, Sweden\nRow 30: Daniel Delisle, United States\nRow 31: Gleason Fournier, Canada\nWait, no, I think I'm miscounting.\n\nWait the table has row indices from 0 to 90? No, looking back, the rows are numbered with \"row_...\" like row_0 up to maybe row 90. Wait, actually in the given HTML, each player is a <tr> with a unique id like tr_0, tr_1, etc., up to tr_90.\n\nSo let me check all the players and their countries:\n\nLooking for \"Country\" as United States:\n\nRow 3: Daniel Delisle, Country: United States (row index 88)\nWait no, actually each row has data in columns. Let's see:\n\nEach player's country is in the \"Country\" column.\n\nSo let me go through each player and note if their country is the US.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Daniel Delisle? Wait no, I need to check all rows for Country = United States.\n\nWait the table data isn't presented as HTML but as a list of players. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nEach player's details are in rows with specific columns:\n\nColumns seem to be:\n\n- Rank\n- Player\n- Team\n- Position\n- Country\n\nSo I need to find all players where \"Country\" is United States and see their order in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Daniel Delisle? No, wait row 0 is actually the first player. Let me list them correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note all the US players and their positions.\n\nLet me go through each row from index 0 onwards.\n\nI see that in the table provided, the players are as follows:\n\nRow indices (assuming they start at 0):\n\nLooking back at the HTML structure, each <tr> has a class like \"row_0\", \"row_1\", up to \"row_90\". So row indices from 0 to 90.\n\nNow, checking each player's country:\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 3: Daniel Delisle, Country: United States (row index 88)\n\nWait no, perhaps I should list all players with their country and see who is from the US.\n\nWait looking through the HTML code for \"Country\" entries.\n\nLooking at each <td> in the table, specifically the ones labeled \"Country\".\n\nSo for example:\n\nIn row_0: Country is Canada (Gleason Fournier)\nrow_1: United States? Let me check...\n\nWait perhaps it's better to go step by step.\n\nEach player has a row with Rank, Player, Team, Position, Country.\n\nLooking through each row's country:\n\nFor example:\n\n- Row 38: Michael Lee, Country: United States (row index 90)\n- Are there any others?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow indices where Country is US:\n\nLet me check each row's country:\n\nStarting from row_0 to row_90.\n\nI see Daniel Delisle in row_88 (Country: United States).\n\nAlso, Michael Lee in row_90 (Country: United States).\n\nAny others? Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking through the data, I see:\n\n- Row 34: Cody Eakin, Country: Canada\n- Row 35: Ryan Button, Canada\n- Row 36: Simon Bertilsson, Sweden\n- Row 37: Mattias Lindstrom, Sweden\n- Row 38: Daniel Delisle, United States (row index 88)\n- Row 39: Gleason Fournier, Canada\n\nSo in the table, the US players are Daniel Delisle (row_88) and Michael Lee (row_90). Are there any others?\n\nWait checking again:\n\nLooking through each row's country:\n\n- Row 26: United States? Let me see.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nEach player in the table has their country listed. So let me go from top to bottom and note all US players.\n\n1. Row_0: Gleason Fournier, Canada\n2. Row_1: [Assuming Daniel Delisle is row 38? Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused with row indices.]\n\nWait the table's rows are labeled as tr_0, tr_1, etc., but in the provided HTML, each <tr> has a class like \"row_0\" and the player details inside.\n\nSo to accurately determine which players are from the US, I need to look at the \"Country\" column for each row.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 38: Daniel Delisle, Country: United States\n- Row 90: Michael Lee, Country: United States\n\nAre there any others? Let me check a few more rows.\n\nRow 26: Cody Eakin, Canada\nRow 27: Ryan Button, Canada\nRow 28: Simon Bertilsson, Sweden\nRow 29: Mattias Lindstrom, Sweden\nRow 30: Daniel Delisle, United States\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me list all players from the US:\n\n- Row_38 (Daniel Delisle)\n- Row_90 (Michael Lee)\n\nSo only two players are from the United States in this table.\n\nNow, the claim is that Michael Lee is the last player chosen from the US. So if we consider the order of selection as per their rank or appearance in the table, Michael is listed after Daniel Delisle.\n\nIn the table, Daniel Delisle is at row_38 (Country: United States), and Michael Lee is at row_90 (Country: United States). Since 90 > 38, Michael comes later in the list. Therefore, Michael would be considered the last player from the US in this table.\n\nBut wait, does \"last\" refer to being chosen last or just appearing last? If it's about selection order, perhaps, but without additional context, I think we can assume that the claim refers to his position in the table as the last US player.\n\nSo yes, Michael Lee is indeed the last player from the United States listed in this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Michael Lee is the last player chosen from the United States in the given table. Upon examining each row's country information:\n\n- **Daniel Delisle** (row index 38) is from the United States.\n- **Michael Lee** (row index 90) is also from the United States.\n\nAs row 90 comes after row 38, Michael Lee appears last among players from the United States in this table. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Michael Lee is the last player from the United States listed in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"Of the player list, 3 of them be from the United States\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: Rank, Player, Position(s), DOB, Age, Height (cm), Weight (kg), NHL team, NCAA/University/junior club, and Country. My focus will be on the \"Country\" column since that's what determines nationality.\n\nThe claim specifies that 3 players should be from the United States. So, my task is to count how many players have their country listed as the United States in this table. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one and check the Country value.\n\n1. Row 0: Player is Connor McDavid, Country is Canada.\n2. Row 1: Player is Mathew Barzal, Country is Canada.\n3. Row 2: Player is Jack Eichel, Country is United States. (Count = 1)\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"mac bennett be the only played list that be from finland\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Mac Bennett is the only player in the list who is from Finland. So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Is there a player named Mac Bennett in the table?\n2. If so, what country is he listed as being from?\n3. Are there any other players from Finland besides him?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their details. The columns are: Rank, Player, Position, Team, League.\n\nStarting with point 1: Is Mac Bennett in the table? Let's scan through the \"Player\" column to find his name. Going row by row:\n\n- Row 0: Kappo\n- Row 1: Kivioja\n- ...\nContinuing down, I notice that most players have first and last names, but none seem to be named Mac Bennett. Wait a minute, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about nationality being Finland, not necessarily the name being Mac Bennett. Maybe there's a mix-up here. The claim says \"mac bennett be the only played list that be from finland.\" So it could mean that Mac Bennett is the only player from Finland in the list.\n\nBut looking through all the rows, I don't see any player whose nationality is listed as Finland. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: Kappo is from Sweden.\nRow 1: Kivioja is from Finland.\nWait, hold on! In Row 1, the player is named \"Kivioja\" and his country is Finland. So that's one player from Finland.\n\nContinuing through all rows, I look for other players from Finland:\n\nRow 2: Sweden\nRow 3: USA\nRow 4: Canada\nRow 5: Canada\n... (continuing down)\n\nI don't find any other players from Finland besides Kivioja in Row 1. So according to the table, Kivioja is the only player from Finland.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"Mac Bennett.\" There's no player named Mac Bennett in the table. The closest I see is Row 89: Daniel Delisle from the USA and Row 90: Gleason Fournier from Canada. So where does Mac Bennett fit in?\n\nWait, perhaps there was a typo or misunderstanding in the claim. Maybe it's referring to someone else, but based on the table as given, I don't see any player named Mac Bennett.\n\nSo, if the claim is that \"Mac Bennett be the only played list that be from finland,\" then since there's no such player named Mac Bennett and Kivioja is already from Finland, the claim would be false because it incorrectly identifies Mac Bennett as being from Finland when he isn't even listed. Alternatively, if the claim meant that Mac Bennett is the only Finnish player, but there is another Finnish player (Kivioja), then it's also false.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe claim says \"mac bennett be the only played list that be from finland.\" So, according to this, Mac Bennett should be the sole player from Finland. However, in the table, we have Kivioja (Row 1) from Finland. Therefore, even if Mac Bennett were present and also Finnish, he wouldn't be the only one because Kivioja is already there.\n\nBut since there's no Mac Bennett in the table at all, the claim is incorrect on multiple levels: first, Mac Bennett isn't listed, and second, Kivioja is the only Finnish player.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim meant that the list contains only players from Finland, but clearly, the countries vary (Canada, USA, Sweden, etc.), so that's not the case either.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me parse it again: \"mac bennett be the only played list that be from finland.\" Maybe it means Mac Bennett is the only player in the list who is from Finland. If that's the case, then since Kivioja is also from Finland and there are no other Finns, but Mac Bennett isn't even in the table, the claim is false because he isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, if \"played list\" refers to players on a team, perhaps it's misinterpreted. But given the context, I think the claim is about nationality.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- No player named Mac Bennett is in the table.\n- There is one player from Finland (Kivioja).\n- Therefore, the claim that Mac Bennett is the only Finnish player is false because he isn't present and there's another Finnish player.\n\nHence, the answer should be False. But wait, looking back at my initial thought process, I think I might have confused myself a bit.\n\nLet me double-check: The table has players from various countries, including Finland (Row 1). There is no Mac Bennett in the list. So if someone claims that Mac Bennett is the only Finnish player, but he isn't even there, and Kivioja is the only one, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask whether Mac Bennett is from Finland, but since he's not listed, it's irrelevant. But regardless, based on the table, the claim doesn't hold because either way, Mac Bennett isn't there, and there is another Finnish player.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Mac Bennett be the only played list that be from finland\" is false based on the provided table. The table does not include a player named Mac Bennett. Additionally, there is one player from Finland (Kivioja), so even if Mac Bennett were present, he wouldn't be the only Finnish player.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. There is no player named Mac Bennett in the list, and Kivioja is the only player from Finland. Therefore, Mac Bennett cannot be the sole Finnish player as stated.",

Let's see:\n\n- Row 7 (index 7): Name is \"simon bertilsson\", Country: Sweden.\n- Row 8 (index 8): Name is \"mattias lindstrom\", Country: Sweden.\n- Other rows don't have Swedish players.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"alexander urbom\". Let me check which row that is. Looking through the table:\n\nRow index 70? Wait no, let's go step by step.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I miscounted. Let me go from top to bottom until I find Alexander Urbom.\n\nAh, found him at row index 71 (assuming rows start counting from 0 or 1? The table provided starts with the first data row as Rank 1, Player 2). Wait, in the HTML, the tbody has rows starting from what's displayed as rank 69 to 91. But perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait no, looking again: the table seems to have rows numbered from 1 upwards based on the Rank column. So for example, the first data row is Rank 69, then 70, up to 91.\n\nWait, that's confusing because typically in such contexts, the ranking starts at 1. But here, perhaps it's a partial list starting at rank 69. However, regardless of that, I'll check each player's country and their rank.\n\nLooking for \"Alexander Urbom\":\n\nIn row index 7 (if we consider the first data row as index 0), no. Let me look through all rows:\n\nAt row with Rank 84: Player is \"simon bertilsson\", Country Sweden, Position D.\nRow with Rank 85: \"mattias lindstrom\", Sweden, LW.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, perhaps I should list all players from Sweden first and then see their ranks.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Rank 69: Player \"stephen johnson\" - Country USA.\n2. Rank 70: \"david warsofsky\" - Canada\n3. Rank 71: \"alexander urbom\" - Sweden (found him here)\n4. Rank 72: \"simon bertilsson\" - Sweden (another Swedish player)\n5. Rank 73: \"mattias lindstrom\" - Sweden (third Swedish player)\n\nWait, so Alexander Urbom is at rank 71, Simon Bertilsson at 72, and Mattias Lindstrom at 73.\n\nSo according to the table, Alexander Urbom was picked before Simon Bertilsson and Mattias Lindstrom. Are there any other Swedish players listed in the table?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Rank 69: USA\n- 70: Canada\n- 71: Sweden (Urbom)\n- 72: Sweden (Bertilsson)\n- 73: Sweden (Lindstrom)\n- The rest of the rows are up to rank 91, and in those, I don't see any other Swedish players.\n\nSo, in this table, Alexander Urbom is the first Swedish player listed at rank 71. The next two Swedish players are ranked after him. Therefore, the claim that \"alexander urbom be pick before any other swedish player list\" seems to hold true based on the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"Country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"Country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"Country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Daniel Delisle be the last United States player choose among those list\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down what this means.\n\nFirst, the claim suggests two things: that Daniel Delisle is a United States player and that he was the last one chosen from the list provided. To verify this, I'll need to look through the table for all players who are from the United States and check their positions in the selection order.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with various attributes like rank, name, country, position, team, and league. The relevant columns here would be \"Country\" to identify US players and \"Rank\" or \"row_index\" since higher row indices might indicate later selections if the list is ordered from top to bottom.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\nRow 0: Name not provided, but country isn't specified as United States.\n...\nContinuing down until I find Daniel Delisle. Scanning the rows, I see that Daniel Delisle is on row 88 (assuming counting starts at 0). His country is listed as the United States.\n\nNow, I need to check if he's the last US player in the list. Let me look through all rows from top to bottom:\n\n- Row 0: Country not specified.\n- Rows 1 to 86: Checking each, some are from Canada or Sweden. For example, row 9 is from the United States (Daniel Delisle is at row 88). Wait, no\u2014row 87 has Simon Bertilsson from Sweden. So let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, Daniel Delisle is in row 88 with Country: United States. Now, I need to check all rows after that. The next rows are:\n\nRow 89: Daniel Delisle (US)\nRow 90: Gleason Fournier from Canada\nRow 91: Michael Lee from the US\n\nOh! So there's another US player at row 91, which is after row 88. That means Michael Lee was chosen after Daniel Delisle. Therefore, Daniel Delisle isn't the last US player in the list.\n\nSo the claim that Daniel Delisle is the last United States player selected is false because Michael Lee comes later and is also from the US.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Daniel Delisle is the last United States player chosen. However, upon examining the table, Michael Lee (row 91) is a United States player listed after Daniel Delisle (row 88). Thus, Daniel Delisle isn't the last US player.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** We need to find all players from the United States and their positions in the list.\n2. **Locate Daniel Delisle:** Found in row 88 with Country: United States.\n3. **Check Subsequent Rows:** Look for other US players after row 88. Row 91 has Michael Lee, also from the US.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Michael Lee is listed after Daniel Delisle and is also a US player, Delisle isn't the last.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 88, \"column_name\": \"Country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 91, \"column_name\": \"Country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "taylor beck be pick 2 place before ryan howse",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Taylor Beck be pick 2 place before Ryan Howse\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Taylor Beck was picked in the second place before Ryan Howse. So, I'm looking for their draft positions and comparing them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with various details like Name, Position, Nationality, Team, League, etc. The columns include things like \"Pick\", which I assume refers to their draft position or selection order in some context.\n\nI'll start by locating Taylor Beck and Ryan Howse in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Taylor Beck is listed at row index 10 (since counting starts at 0, the 11th row). His details show he's a left wing from Canada, plays for Prince Albert Raiders in the WHL, and his \"Pick\" value is 2.\n  \n- Ryan Howse is found at row index 15. He's a center from the United States, plays for Swift Current Broncos in the WHL, and his \"Pick\" value is also 2.\n\nWait, both have the same pick number? That seems odd if they were picked in different positions. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what \"Pick\" represents. It could mean their position within their respective leagues or teams rather than an overall draft order.\n\nBut according to the table, both are listed with a Pick of 2. The claim is that Taylor Beck was picked before Ryan Howse. If they have the same pick number, perhaps they were selected in the same round but different picks? Or maybe \"Pick\" isn't about the draft order but something else like jersey numbers or positions on their team.\n\nAlternatively, if the table's \"Pick\" column represents the overall draft order, having the same number would mean they were picked at the same time, which contradicts the claim that Beck was before Howse. However, the claim specifies \"2 place,\" so maybe each has a separate pick within their teams or leagues.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is to compare their \"Pick\" values. Both have Pick 2, but if they were both picked in the same round and position, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe Taylor Beck was selected earlier in a draft where Ryan Howse came after him.\n\nBut given the information provided, since both are listed with Pick 2, it's ambiguous whether one was picked before the other. The table doesn't provide enough context about how the picks were ordered relative to each other beyond their individual numbers.\n\nTherefore, without additional information on the sequence of their picks beyond the number, I can't definitively say that Taylor Beck was picked before Ryan Howse just based on both having a Pick 2. They might have been picked in the same round but by different teams, or the table's data doesn't capture the order between them.\n\nSo, considering the given data and not being able to determine the sequence beyond their pick numbers, I would conclude that the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
