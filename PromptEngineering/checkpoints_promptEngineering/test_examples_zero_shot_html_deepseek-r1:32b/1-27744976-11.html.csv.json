    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"Kevin Martin scored the highest amount of points singularly for all of the games except the game on April 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that Kevin Martin had the highest scoring in every game listed in the table except the one played on April 9th. So, my task is to check each game and see if Kevin Martin was indeed the top scorer, with the exception of April 9th.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', 'high points', 'high rebounds', 'high assists', 'location attendance', and 'record'. The relevant column here is 'high points' because that's where individual player point contributions are listed. \n\nI'll go through each row (each game) to check who had the highest points.\n\nStarting with Game 76 on April 1: The high points are Kevin Martin with 33 points. So, he led this game.\n\nGame 77 on April 3: Again, Kevin Martin is listed with 35 points. He's leading here as well.\n\nMoving to Game 78 on April 5: High points go to Kevin Martin again, with 30 points.\n\nNext, Game 79 on April 6: Kevin Martin scored 21 points. It looks like he still has the highest in this game since others are listed with lower numbers or tied, but no one exceeds his 21.\n\nGame 80 is on April 9. The high points here are Chase Budinger, Kevin Martin, and Brad Miller each with 16 points. This means Kevin Martin didn't score the highest singularly; instead, he shared the lead with others. So this is the exception the claim mentions.\n\nFinally, Game 81 on April 11: Kevin Martin has 28 points, which appears to be the highest in that game.\n\nSo, compiling all this, in every game except for April 9 (Game 80), Kevin Martin had the highest points. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, I'll double-check each entry:\n\n- Game 76: Yes, 33\n- Game 77: Yes, 35\n- Game 78: Yes, 30\n- Game 79: Yes, 21 (though it's lower than other games, still the highest in that game)\n- Game 80: No, shared with others\n- Game 81: Yes, 28\n\nAll other games except April 9 have Kevin Martin as the top scorer. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the game with the highest attendance be at the toyota center on april 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all games held at Toyota Center because the claim specifies that location. Scanning through each row, I can see which rows have \"toyota center\" in the \"location attendance\" column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Game 76: Toyota Center with 18059 attendees.\n- Game 77: Toyota Center with 15993 attendees.\n- Game 78: Toyota Center with 15523 attendees.\n- Game 80: Toyota Center with 18089 attendees.\n- Games 79 and 81 are not at Toyota Center, so I can ignore them.\n\nNow, among these games at Toyota Center, I need to find which one had the highest attendance.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"goran dragi\u0107 do not have the most high assist in any game before april 9.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Goran Dragic did not lead his team in assists in any of the games listed before April 9th. To verify this, I'll need to look at each row in the table where the date is prior to April 9 and check who had the highest number of assists.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns relevant here: \"date\", \"high assists\". The key is to focus on rows with dates before April 9 and examine the \"high assists\" column for those rows.\n\nLet me list out each game in order:\n\n1. Game 76: April 1\n2. Game 77: April 3\n3. Game 78: April 5\n4. Game 79: April 6\n5. Game 80: April 9\n\nWait, the claim is about games before April 9, so I should consider up to game 79 (April 6). Game 80 is on April 9, which might be included or excluded depending on interpretation. However, since the date in game 80 is exactly April 9, it's likely that the claim refers to games strictly before that date, so up to April 8.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row before April 9 and check who had the highest assists:\n\n- **Game 76 (April 1):** High assists are Luis Scola with 6. Goran Dragic isn't mentioned here.\n- **Game 77 (April 3):** High assists are Kyle Lowry with 8. Again, Dragic isn't listed here.\n- **Game 78 (April 5):** Kyle Lowry leads with 9 assists.\n- **Game 79 (April 6):** Assists are split between Courtney Lee and Kyle Lowry, each with 6. No mention of Dragic.\n\nSo in all these games before April 9, Goran Dragic isn't the one with the most high assists. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because he doesn't have the highest assist count in any game prior to April 9th.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"luis scola score the highest number of high rebound in game 76 on april 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The player involved is Luis Scola.\n2. He supposedly scored the highest number of rebounds (referred to as \"high rebounds\") in a specific game.\n3. This game is identified as Game 76 on April 1.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check for Game 76 and the corresponding date. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The first row has game number 76 with the date April 1. So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, focusing on that specific row (row index 0 in zero-based indexing), let's look at the columns related to rebounds. The column titled \"high rebounds\" is where I should check for Luis Scola.\n\nIn Game 76:\n- Under \"high rebounds,\" it says \"luis scola 14\". This means Luis Scola had 14 rebounds in that game, which was the highest for his team in that particular game.\n\nI don't see any other player listed with a higher rebound count than 14 in Game 76. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is in row index 0 and column \"high rebounds\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Luis Scola had the highest number of rebounds (14) in game 76 on April 1.

The task is to determine if the claim about attendance at two games is true or false based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says: \"there be 3191 more people in attendance at the game versus the la clipper than at the game versus dallas.\" So, I'm looking for two specific rows in the table\u2014 one where the opponent is LA Clippers and another where the opponent is Dallas. \n\nLooking at the table, let's identify these games. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 76: Opponent is San Antonio\n- Row 77: Atlanta\n- Row 78: Sacramento\n- Row 79: New Orleans\n- Row 80: LA Clippers (this is one of the games we need)\n- Row 81: Dallas (the other game)\n\nNow, for each of these two rows, I'll check the attendance numbers. The relevant column here is \"location attendance.\"\n\nFor row 80 (LA Clippers), the attendance is listed as 18089.\nFor row 81 (Dallas), it's 14898.\n\nNext step is to calculate the difference in attendance between these two games. So, subtracting Dallas' attendance from LA Clippers':\n\n18089 (LA Clippers) - 14898 (Dallas) = 3191\n\nThe claim states that there were 3191 more people at the LA Clippers game than at the Dallas game, which matches exactly with our calculation. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, to note down the relevant cells from the table that we used:\n\n- For row 80 (LA Clippers), we checked \"location attendance\" and found 18089.\n- For row 81 (Dallas), we also looked at \"location attendance\" which was 14898.\n\nThese are the only two cells needed to verify the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Brad Miller scored the highest amount of points singularly for all of the game except the game on April 11.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems like Brad Miller had the highest points in each game, except for the one on April 11. So I need to check each row (each game) and see who had the highest points. If Brad is the top scorer in all games except April 11, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, team, score, etc. The column relevant here is \"high points,\" which shows who scored the most and their points. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Game 76 (April 1)**: High points are Kevin Martin with 33. Brad Miller isn't mentioned here. So in this game, someone else had higher points.\n\n2. **Game 77 (April 3)**: Again, Kevin Martin leads with 35. Brad isn't listed, so he didn't score the highest here either.\n\n3. **Game 78 (April 5)**: Kevin Martin scores 30 again. So not Brad.\n\n4. **Game 79 (April 6)**: Kevin Martin is at 21. Still, no mention of Brad as top scorer.\n\n5. **Game 80 (April 9)**: Here, it's a tie between Chase Budinger, Kevin Martin, and Brad Miller, each with 16 points. So in this game, Brad did have the highest along with others.\n\n6. **Game 81 (April 11)**: Kevin Martin scores 28, so not Brad.\n\nWait, but the claim says Brad scored the highest except April 11. But from what I see, Brad only tied for the high in Game 80 and didn't have the highest in any other game. So actually, he was the top scorer (along with others) only once, which is on April 9. In all other games, someone else had higher points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Brad Miller did not score the highest singularly except for April 11; in fact, he wasn't the highest scorer in most games. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brad Miller scored the highest points in all games except April 11.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that the game with the highest attendance occurred at the New Orleans Arena on April 6th. So, my task is to check two things: \n\n1. What was the attendance for each game?\n2. Which of those games had the highest attendance and where was it located?\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see there's a column named \"location attendance\" which probably contains both the venue name and the number of attendees. So, that's my first point of reference.\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the attendance numbers:\n\n- Game 76: Toyota Center with 18,059\n- Game 77: Toyota Center with 15,993\n- Game 78: Toyota Center with 15,523\n- Game 79: New Orleans Arena with 12,728\n- Game 80: Toyota Center with 18,089\n- Game 81: Toyota Center with 14,898\n\nNow, I need to identify the highest attendance. Let's list them out:\n\n- 18,059 (Game 76)\n- 15,993 (Game 77)\n- 15,523 (Game 78)\n- 12,728 (Game 79)\n- 18,089 (Game 80)\n- 14,898 (Game 81)\n\nThe highest number here is 18,089 for Game 80 at Toyota Center on April 9th. The next highest is Game 76 with 18,059, also at Toyota Center. \n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions April 6th and New Orleans Arena. Looking back at the data:\n\n- On April 6th (Game 79), the attendance was 12,728 at New Orleans Arena.\n\nComparing this to Game 80 on April 9th with 18,089 attendees at Toyota Center, it's clear that the highest attendance wasn't at New Orleans Arena. Instead, the two highest attendances were both at Toyota Center on different dates (April 1st and April 9th). \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the game with the highest attendance was not in New Orleans; it was in Houston at Toyota Center. The highest attendance figure comes from Game 80, which had 18,089 attendees.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game with the highest attendance was at New Orleans Arena on April 6.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"kyle lowry have the lowest assist in game on april 3 and april 5.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the games played on April 3 and April 5.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, team, score, high assists, etc. \n\nFor April 3:\n- The row index is 1 (since counting starts at 0). The column \"high assists\" shows \"kyle lowry 8\".\n\nWait, but the claim says he has the lowest assist in those games. Hmm, maybe I need to check all the assists for each game and see if Kyle Lowry's assist count was indeed the lowest.\n\nIn game 77 (April 3), the high assists are Kyle Lowry with 8. But that's the highest, not the lowest. So this might be a problem because the claim is about having the lowest.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The \"high assists\" column lists who had the most assists in each game. So if Kyle Lowry has the high assist on April 3 with 8, but maybe other players have lower numbers. But the table only shows the top performers, not all players' stats. So without full data, it's hard to say who has the lowest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"lowest\" here refers to being among those mentioned as high assists. That might not make sense because if he's listed as a high assist, others could have less but not listed.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in April 3 and April 5 games, Kyle Lowry was among the top assists each time. For April 3 (row 1), he has 8. For April 5 (row 2), he has 9. So if we compare his assist counts between these two dates, on April 3 it's lower (8) than April 5 (9). But does that make him have the lowest overall?\n\nBut wait, perhaps in each game, other players might have fewer assists, but since only high performers are listed, I can't see all players. So based on the given data, if we consider \"lowest\" as having the least among those mentioned, then in April 3, Kyle has 8, which is higher than others like maybe someone else had lower, but not shown. Or perhaps in both games, his assists are the highest.\n\nWait, let me re-examine each game:\n\nFor April 3 (row 1):\n- High assists: Kyle Lowry with 8. So he's the top assist there.\n\nFor April 5 (row 2):\n- High assists: Kyle Lowry with 9.\n\nSo in both games, he has the highest assists listed. Therefore, if the claim is that he had the lowest, but according to the data, he actually had the highest, this would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Maybe \"lowest assist\" refers to the team's total assists being low. But no, the column shows individual high assists. So it's about individual players' performance.\n\nSo since in both games on April 3 and April 5, Kyle Lowry had the highest assists (8 and 9 respectively), the claim that he has the lowest assist would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"luis scola score the highest number of high rebound in game 54 on april 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Luis Scola had the highest number of rebounds in game 54 on April 3rd. I need to check if this is accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, etc. The relevant columns here are \"game,\" \"date,\" and \"high rebounds.\"\n\nLet's start by locating game 54 on April 3rd. I'll scan through the \"game\" column to find game number 54. Wait, looking at the table, the games listed go from 76 up to 81. There's no game numbered 54 in this table. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe there was a typo or misunderstanding? The claim refers to April 3rd, so let me check which game is on that date.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column, the second row has the date April 3. Let's see what game number that is. In the table, game numbers start from 76 and go up to 81. The second row (index 1) has game number 77, not 54. So game 54 isn't present in this table at all.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's confusion between game numbers or perhaps the claim is referring to another part of the data. Let me double-check: the games listed are from 76 to 81, so game 54 isn't included here. Therefore, any claim about game 54 can't be verified with this table because that game isn't represented.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's assume there might have been a mistake in the game number. If someone meant April 3rd as the date, regardless of the game number, which is game 77, then we should check who had the highest rebounds on that day.\n\nLooking at row index 1 (game 77), under \"high rebounds,\" it's Chuck Hayes with 12 rebounds. Luis Scola isn't mentioned there. So even if the game number was incorrect in the claim, on April 3rd, it's Chuck Hayes who led in rebounds, not Luis Scola.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether game 54 exists or not (since it doesn't), the claim about Luis Scola scoring the highest rebounds on April 3rd isn't supported by the data. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 1, column \"game\" to check the game number is 77, which contradicts the claim's game 54.\n- Row index 1, column \"date\" confirms it's April 3, but the rebounds were led by Chuck Hayes, not Scola.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the claim doesn't hold because either the game isn't present or the stats don't align. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"there be 3191 more people in attendance at the game versus dallas than at the game versus the la clipper.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing the number of attendees at two games: one against Dallas and another against LA Clippers. The claim states that there were 3191 more people at the Dallas game compared to the LA Clippers game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details. I need to find the attendance numbers for both these games. \n\nLet me scan through the rows:\n\n- For the game against Dallas: Let's see, looking for \"dallas\" in the 'team' column. Scanning down, the last row (row index 5) has the opponent as \"dallas\". The attendance is listed under the 'location attendance' column as 14898.\n\n- For the game against LA Clippers: I need to find where the team is \"la clippers.\" Looking at the rows, row index 4 shows the opponent as \"la clippers\" with an attendance of 18089.\n\nNow, the claim says there were more people at the Dallas game than at the Clippers game. Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense because 14898 (Dallas) is actually less than 18089 (Clippers). So, if anything, fewer people attended the Dallas game compared to the Clippers.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations just to be sure. Maybe I misread the numbers. \n\nDallas attendance: 14,898\nLA Clippers attendance: 18,089\n\nCalculating the difference: 18,089 - 14,898 = 3,191.\n\nWait a second! So, actually, there were 3,191 more people at the Clippers game than at the Dallas game. But the claim states it's the other way around\u2014more attendees at Dallas. \n\nSo, this means the claim is incorrect because it's the opposite of what happened. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Relevant cells are the attendance numbers for both games.\n- The Dallas game had 14,898 attendees (row index 5).\n- The Clippers game had 18,089 attendees (row index 4).\n- The difference is in favor of the Clippers by 3,191 people, contradicting the claim.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
