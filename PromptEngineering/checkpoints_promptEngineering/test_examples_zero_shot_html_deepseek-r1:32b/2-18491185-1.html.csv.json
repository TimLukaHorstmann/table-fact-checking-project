    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the first episode air on 7 / 02 / 08\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two key pieces of information: that it's about the first episode and the specific date it aired. The table has a column for \"episode,\" which lists them as one, two, three, four, and five in order. So, the first episode is clearly \"one.\"\n\nLooking at the row for episode one, I check the \"date\" column to see what date it aired. The value there is 7 / 02 / 08. That matches exactly with the claim's date of 7 / 02 / 08.\n\nNow, considering other aspects: the claim doesn't mention anything about time or network, so I don't need to check those columns unless the date was incorrect. Since the date is correct for episode one, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row index 0 (since HTML tables start counting from 0) under the \"episode\" and \"date\" columns. This confirms that the first episode indeed aired on that specific date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"espn2 air episode one on 7 / 21 / 08\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by breaking down the claim into its components.\n\nThe claim mentions three key pieces of information: the network (espn2), the episode name (episode one), and the date (7/21/08). I'll need to check each of these against the table.\n\nFirst, I look at the network. The claim states it's aired on espn2. Scanning through the \"network\" column in each row, all entries show espn2. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the episode name is \"one\". Looking at the first row under the \"episode\" column, it indeed says \"one\".\n\nNow, for the date, the claim specifies 7/21/08. I check the \"date\" column of the row where episode one is listed. The date there is 7/02/08, not 7/21/08.\n\nPutting this together: while espn2 did air episode one, it was on July 2nd, 2008, not on July 21st. Therefore, the claim's date doesn't match the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although espn2 aired episode one, it was on 7/02/08, not 7/21/08.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Network Check:** The network for episode one is espn2 (matches).\n2. **Episode Name Check:** Episode name is correctly identified as \"one\".\n3. **Date Check:** The date in the table for episode one is 7/02/08, which does not match the claim's date of 7/21/08.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 0 (episode one), network column.\n- Row 0 (episode one), date column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"network\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
