    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"thibaud , osbcluny be bear in france while laborante de panormo be bear in pontormo.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It seems like it's saying that Thibaud OSBCLUNY was born in France and Laborante De Panormo was born in Pontormo. I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows. Each row has columns: elector, place of birth, cardinalatial title, elevated, elevator.\n\nI need to find the rows corresponding to Thibaud OSBCLUNY and Laborante De Panormo.\n\nStarting with Thibaud OSBCLUNY: Scanning through the elector column, I see a row where the elector is \"thibaud , osbcluny\". Let me note that down. The place of birth for this row is France. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, Laborante De Panormo: Looking at the elector column again, I find \"laborante de panormo\" as an elector. Checking their place of birth, it's listed as Pontormo. That also matches what the claim says.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: For Thibaud OSBCLUNY, the row index is 1 (since rows start at 0), and the column is \"place of birth\". For Laborante De Panormo, the row index is 2, and the same column applies.

Paolo Scolari's cardinalatial title is Bishop of Palestrina.\n2. Thibaud, OSB Cluny's cardinalatial title is Bishop of Ostia e Velletri.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: elector, place of birth, cardinalatial title, elevated, elevator.\n\nFor Paolo Scolari:\n\n- I'll search for the row where 'elector' is \"paolo scolari\".\n- Found in row 0. The 'cardinalatial title' column says \"bishop of palestrina\". So this part matches.\n\nFor Thibaud OSB Cluny:\n\n- Look for 'elector' as \"thibaud , osbcluny\" (note the extra space and comma).\n- Found in row 1.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"alexander iii be the elevator in 3 of the 9 in the papal election\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim correctly. It seems like it's stating that Alexander III was the elevator (which I believe refers to the pope who elevated someone) for three out of nine electors in the papal election. So, my task is to check how many times \"Alexander III\" appears in the 'elevator' column and see if it's exactly three.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 9 rows (electors). I'll go through each row one by one and count the instances where the elevator is Alexander III.\n\nRow 0: Elevator is Alexander III. Count = 1.\nRow 1: Elevator is Lucius III. Not Alexander III.\nRow 2: Elevator is Alexander III. Count = 2.\nRow 3: Elevator is Lucius III. Not Alexander III.\nRow 4: Elevator is Lucius II. Not Alexander III.\nRow 5: Elevator is Alexander III. Count = 3.\nRow 6: Elevator is Lucius III. Not Alexander III.\nRow 7: Elevator is Lucius III. Not Alexander III.\nRow 8: Elevator is Lucius III. Not Alexander III.\n\nSo, the elevator was Alexander III for rows 0, 2, and 5. That makes three instances out of nine. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that support this conclusion. Each instance where the elevator was Alexander III corresponds to a cell in the 'elevator' column of those rows. So, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0, Column: elevator\n- Row 2, Column: elevator\n- Row 5, Column: elevator\n\nThese three cells confirm that Alexander III was the elevator for three electors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"elevator\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"elevator\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"elevator\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"melior le maitre  , osbvall  , pietro diana and radulf nigellus be elevate on march 16  , 1185\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions four individuals and their elevation date as March 16, 1185. So I need to check each of these four electors in the table to see if their 'elevated' column matches that date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 3: melior le maitre, osbvall\n- The 'elevated' column here says March 16, 1185. So this one matches.\n\nRow 7: pietro diana\n- His 'elevated' date is also March 16, 1185. That's a match.\n\nRow 8: radulf nigellus\n- This row shows the same date as well. So that's three matches so far.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions four individuals. Let me check again. Oh, I think I miscounted the rows because the table has rows from 0 to 8 (since there are 9 entries). Wait no, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the HTML, each <tr> is a row in the tbody. The first data row is index 0: paolo scolari. Then thibaud is 1, laborante 2, melior 3, giacinto 4, graziano 5, ottaviano 6, pietro diana 7, radulf nigellus 8.\n\nSo the four individuals mentioned are:\n\n1. melior le maitre, osbvall (row 3)\n2. pietro diana (row 7)\n3. radulf nigellus (row 8)\n\nWait, that's only three. Oh wait, the claim says \"melior le maitre, osbvall, pietro diana and radulf nigellus\". So four people? Let me check each name in the table.\n\nLooking at row 3: melior le maitre, osbvall \u2013 yes, that's one. Then row 7 is pietro diana, and row 8 is radulf nigellus. The fourth person mentioned might be a typo or perhaps I'm misreading the claim. Wait, looking back at the claim: it says \"melior le maitre , osbvall , pietro diana and radulf nigellus\". So four people? Or perhaps 'osbvall' is part of melior's title.\n\nWait, in the table, row 3 has elector as \"melior le maitre , osbvall\" \u2013 so that's one person. Then pietro is another, and radulf is the third. So the claim lists three people: melior, pietro, and radulf. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting 'osbvall' as a separate elector? Let me check.\n\nLooking at row 3: \"melior le maitre , osbvall\" \u2013 that's likely one person with two titles or something. So the claim lists three individuals: melior, pietro, and radulf.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions four people. Wait no, let's count:\n\n\"melior le maitre  , osbvall  , pietro diana and radulf nigellus\". That seems like three names with possible titles: melior (osbvall), pietro, and radulf.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just check each of these in the table:\n\n- Melior le maitre, osbvall is row 3, elevated March 16, 1185 \u2013 correct.\n- Pietro diana is row 7, same date \u2013 correct.\n- Radulf nigellus is row 8, same date \u2013 correct.\n\nSo all three individuals in the claim were elevated on that date. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because each of them was elevated on March 16, 1185 as per the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be elevate\" which might be a typo for 'elevated'. So yes, the dates match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists three electors (melior le maitre, osbvall; pietro diana; radulf nigellus) and their elevation date as March 16, 1185.

Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is Paolo Scolari, born in Rome, elevated on September 21, 1179 by Alexander III.\n2. Second row: Thibaud, from France, elevated in 1184 by Lucius III.\n3. Third row: Laborante de Panormo, from Pontormo, elevated September 1173 by Alexander III.\n4. Fourth row: Melior le Maitre, OSBVall, born in Pisa, his cardinalatial title is priest of SS Giovanni e Paolo, elevated on March 16, 1185 by Lucius III. So the date here is March 16, 1185, not September 21, 1179.\n5. Fifth row: Giacinto Bobone Orsini, born in Rome, elevated December 22, 1144 by Lucius II.\n6.

Eighth row: Pietro Diana, from Piacenza, elevated March 16, 1185 by Lucius III.\n9. Ninth row: Radulf Nigellus, probably France, elevated March 16, 1185 by Lucius III.\n\nSo, looking at each name mentioned in the claim:\n\n- Melior le Maitre was elevated on March 16, 1185, not September 21, 1179.\n- Pietro Diana was elevated on March 16, 1185 as well.\n- Radulf Nigellus also has the same elevation date of March 16, 1185.\n\nThe claim says all three were elevated on September 21, 1179.

So the corrected claim would likely state that these five electors were born in Rome.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for place of birth is \"place of birth.\" I'll need to check each of the mentioned electors' places of birth.\n\nLet's list out the electors mentioned:\n1. paolo scolari\n2. giacinto bobone orsini\n3. ottaviano di paoli\n\nWait, wait\u2014the claim mentions 5 electors but only lists three names: paolo scolari, giacinto bobone orsini, and ottaviano di paoli. That might be a mistake because the table has nine electors in total. Alternatively, maybe \"paolo scolari\" is one, \"giacinto...\" another, and \"ottaviano...\" third. But the claim says five electors are born in Rome. So perhaps it's saying that out of all the electors listed, five were born in Rome.\n\nWait no, let me re-examine. The original table has 9 rows (electors). Each row includes an 'elector' and their 'place of birth.' \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. paolo scolari: place of birth is Rome.\n2. thibaud, osbcluny: France\n3. laborante de panormo: pontormo\n4. melior le maitre, osbvall: Pisa\n5. giacinto bobone orsini: Rome\n6. graziano da pisa: Pisa\n7. ottaviano di paoli: Rome\n8. pietro diana: Piacenza\n9. radulf nigellus: Probably France\n\nSo the electors born in Rome are:\n- row 0: paolo scolari\n- row 4: giacinto bobone orsini\n- row 6: ottaviano di paoli\n\nThat's three electors, not five. The claim says five electors are from Rome, but according to the table, only three are.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because only three of them were born in Rome.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five electors were born in Rome, but the table shows only three electors with Rome as their place of birth. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place of birth\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place of birth\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place of birth\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
