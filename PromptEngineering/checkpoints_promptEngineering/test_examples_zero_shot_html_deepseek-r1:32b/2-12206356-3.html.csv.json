    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"On June 9, the record was 28-29 with a loss of Mulholland (5-6) and an opponent of the Yankees.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check the table for entries on June 9. Looking through the rows, I see that the earliest date listed is June 4, and then it jumps to June 7. There's no entry for June 9 in this table.\n\nSince there\u2019s no data for June 9, I can\u2019t verify any of the details mentioned in the claim. Without relevant cells from the table to support the claim, it must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about a specific date (June 9) which isn't present in the provided table. Therefore, the relevant_ells list is empty as there are no rows or columns that can validate the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
