    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a table in HTML format with several rows and columns. The task is to determine whether a specific claim about the data in this table is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nThe claim given is: \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1999.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim refers to. It mentions Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as runners-up behind Tiger Woods in the year 1999.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, country, team, individual, location, runners-up. Each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999.\n\nI'll focus on the year 1999 since that's what the claim is about. Scanning through the rows, I see that the first row has the year 1999. Let me look at the details in this row.\n\nIn the 'year' column for 1999, the country is the United States. The team consists of Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods, with Tiger Woods listed as the individual. The location is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Now, looking at the 'runners-up' column for that year, it lists Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin.\n\nThis directly matches the claim. The runners-up are indeed Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin, and Tiger Woods was the individual winner. So, the claim states that these two were runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1999, which aligns perfectly with the information in the table.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data provided. The runners-up for 1999 are correctly identified, and the context (being behind Tiger Woods) is accurate based on the 'individual' column.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or missing information that would make this claim false. Everything checks out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"runners-up\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"individual\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"tiger wood have only win 1 year\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying. It suggests that Tiger Woods has won in only one year according to the data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"individual\". The \"individual\" column likely indicates who was the individual winner for that year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- For 1999, the individual is Tiger Woods.\n- In 1998, Scott Verplank is listed as the individual.\n- In 1997, Colin Montgomerie is the individual.\n- 1996's individual winner is Ernie Els.\n- For 1995 and 1994, Davis Love III and Fred Couples are the individuals respectively.\n- In 1993, Bernhard Langer won individually.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Tiger Woods only appears once in the \"individual\" column for the year 1999. Therefore, according to the table, he has won only one year.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other instances where Tiger Woods might be listed as a team member or runner-up could affect the claim's validity. However, the claim specifically mentions his individual wins, so team appearances don't count here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1996",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1996\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It says that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1996. To verify this, I need to check two things: whether there was a tournament in 1996 and if so, where it was held.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with data from different years. The claim is about 1996, so I'll focus on that row. Scanning through the years listed\u20141993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and onwards\u2014I spot a row for 1996.\n\nIn the 1996 row, the location column mentions \"cape town, south africa.\" So that aligns with the claim's location. However, I also need to check if this was indeed the first time the tournament was held in Cape Town. To do that, I should look through all other rows to ensure there isn't an earlier instance of a tournament in Cape Town.\n\nGoing through each row from 1993 upwards:\n- 1993: Orlando, Florida\n- 1994: Dorado, Puerto Rico\n- 1995: Shenzhen, China\n- 1996: Cape Town, South Africa\n- 1997: Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA\n- 1998: Auckland, New Zealand\n- 1999: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nNone of the years before 1996 list Cape Town as the location. The first occurrence is in 1996. Therefore, the claim that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1996 is correct.\n\nI should also ensure there are no typos or misinterpretations. For instance, verifying that \"cape town\" is spelled consistently and correctly in the table. In this case, it's spelled correctly as \"cape town, south africa.\"\n\nAdditionally, I can cross-reference other columns to confirm any related information, but since the claim specifically concerns location and year, focusing on those two columns suffices.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The 1996 tournament was held in Cape Town, and there's no earlier instance of a tournament in that city. Hence, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1996. Checking the table for the year 1996 confirms the location as Cape Town, South Africa. No prior entries have Cape Town listed before 1996.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were the runners-up in a competition where Tiger Woods was first place, specifically in the year 1997.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row to find information related to 1997. Scanning through the years, I see the third row is for 1997. Let me examine that row:\n\n- **Year**: 1997\n- **Country**: Ireland\n- **Team**: P\u00e3\u00a1draig Harrington & Paul McGinley\n- **Individual**: Colin Montgomerie\n- **Location**: Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA\n- **Runners-up**: Colin Montgomerie & Raymond Russell\n\nWait, the team and individual columns don't mention Tiger Woods. Instead, the runners-up are Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell. Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin aren't listed here.\n\nLooking further down to other years: In 1999, the team is Mark O'Meara & Tiger Woods, with runners-up being Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin. So in 1999, they were runners-up behind Tiger Woods. But the claim specifies 1997, not 1999.\n\nSo, in 1997, the runners-up were different people, and the team included Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley, with Colin Montgomerie as the individual winner. Therefore, Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin weren't the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1997; they were in 1999.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the details don't align for 1997.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1997. Checking the table, the 1997 row shows different runners-up. However, in 1999, they were runners-up. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"runners  - up\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"tiger wood have win several year\" is true or false based on the table provided. First, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Tiger Woods has won multiple times across different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"individual\". The individual column lists who won in that specific year. \n\nStarting with 1999: The individual is Tiger Woods. So, he won at least once.\n\nNext, checking other years:\n- 1998: Individual winner is Scott Verplank.\n- 1997: Colin Montgomerie.\n- 1996: Ernie Els.\n- 1995: Davis Love III.\n- 1994: Fred Couples.\n- 1993: Bernhard Langer.\n\nIt seems Tiger Woods only appears as the individual winner in 1999. Therefore, he hasn't won multiple times across several years based on this table. So, the claim is false because there's only one instance of him winning.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tiger Woods has won multiple times over several years, but according to the table, he only appears once as a winner in 1999.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the tournament was first held in cape town in 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Cape Town hosted a tournament for the first time in 1998. So I need to check two things: whether there's an entry for 1998 with Cape Town as the location, and if that was indeed the first occurrence of Cape Town being used as a location.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1993 to 1999. The columns include 'year', 'country', 'team', 'individual', 'location', and 'runners-up'. I'll go through each year's data one by one.\n\nStarting with 1998: the location is Auckland, New Zealand, according to row index 1. Cape Town isn't listed there. So in 1998, the tournament wasn't held in Cape Town. That already makes me think the claim is false because it claims that Cape Town was the first host in 1998.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if Cape Town appears in any other years before or after 1998. Scanning down, I see that in 1996, the location was Cape Town, South Africa (row index 3). That means Cape Town hosted the tournament in 1996, which is earlier than 1998.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on two points: the year and whether it was the first time. The tournament was held in Cape Town for the first time in 1996, not 1998, and in 1998, it was in Auckland, New Zealand. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: For 1998, I need to look at the 'location' column (row index 1). Also, for Cape Town's first occurrence, it's in 1996 under 'location' (row index 3).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998. However, according to the table, the tournament took place in Cape Town in 1996 and in Auckland in 1998. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
