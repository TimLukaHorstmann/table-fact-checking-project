    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an HTML table and a claim about the data in it. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"bruno brand\u00e3o from brazil have a snatch of 157.0\". So, there are two main pieces of information here that need to be verified:\n\n1. The person's name is Bruno Brand\u00e3o and he's from Brazil.\n2. His snatch weight is 157.0.\n\nI'll start by examining the table provided. The table has several columns: name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, and total (kg). Each row represents an individual athlete with their respective details.\n\nLooking through the rows, I need to find Bruno Brand\u00e3o from Brazil. Scanning down the 'name' column:\n\n- The first few entries are Jo\u00ebl Mackenzie from Cuba, Pedro Stetsiuk from Argentina, and Damian Abbiate also from Argentina. None of these match Bruno.\n- Then I see \"bruno brand\u00e3o  ( bra )\". Since 'bra' is a common abbreviation for Brazil, this looks promising.\n\nNow that I've found Bruno's row, I'll check his snatch weight. The claim states it should be 157.0. Looking at the 'snatch' column in that same row, I see the value is indeed 157.0. That matches perfectly.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll confirm his country. The parentheses show '( bra )', which stands for Brazil, so that part checks out too.\n\nSince both pieces of information in the claim are accurately represented in the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"there be only 1 person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It has two main parts:\n\n1. There is only one person with a snatch of exactly 153.0.\n2. That same person has a bodyweight of exactly 104.70.\n\nSo, my task is to check each row in the table for these two conditions and see if they are both met by exactly one person.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, total (kg). Each row represents a different participant with their respective stats.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where the 'snatch' value is 153.0.\n\n- The first row has a snatch of 175.0.\n- The second row: 160.0\n- Third: 150.0\n- Fourth: 157.0\n- Fifth: 153.0 \u2192 This is the first match for the snatch value.\n\nContinuing, I check the remaining rows:\n\n- Sixth: 140.0\n- Seventh: 140.0 (but the clean & jerk is '-', so maybe not relevant)\n- Eighth and ninth rows have '-' in both snatch and clean & jerk.\n- Tenth row has a snatch of - which likely means no lift, so it's not considered.\n\nSo, only the fifth row has a snatch of 153.0.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this person's bodyweight is exactly 104.70.\n\nLooking at the 'bodyweight' column for that row (fifth row), it shows 104.70. That matches perfectly with the claim.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other rows with a snatch of 153.0:\n\nI've already checked all the rows from 0 to 10, and none except the fifth row have a snatch value of 153.0. Therefore, only one person meets this condition.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied by exactly one person (the fifth row), the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's exactly one participant with a snatch of 153.0 and bodyweight of 104.70.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: Focus on 'snatch' and 'bodyweight' columns.\n2. **Search for Snatch = 153.0**: Only the fifth row meets this criterion.\n3. **Check Bodyweight in That Row**: Confirms it's 104.70.\n4. **Confirm Uniqueness**: No other rows have a snatch of 153.0.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be iose espinoza (nca) with total bodyweight greater than 100 kg.\"\n\nWait, I notice a typo in the name\u2014should that be \"Jos\u00e9 Espinoza\" instead of \"iose\"? Looking back at the table, yes, the correct name is Jos\u00e9 Espinoza from NCA. So first, I'll check if his snatch and clean & jerk are 153.0 and 180.0 respectively.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- The first row is Jo\u00ebl Mackenzie with snatch 175.0 and clean & jerk 205.0.\n- Second: Pedro Stetsiuk, snatch 160, clean & jerk 180. His total is 340.\n- Third: Damian Abbiate, snatch 150, clean & jerk 188.\n- Fourth: Bruno Brand\u00e3o, snatch 157, clean & jerk 180.\n- Fifth: Christian L\u00f3pez, snatch 153, clean & jerk 182. His total is 335.\n- Sixth: V\u00edctor Osorio, 140 and 176.\n- Seventh: Ivorn Mcknee, 140 and '-', so his clean & jerk isn't available.\n- Eighth: Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (NCA), both snatch and clean & jerk are '-' which means he didn't perform those lifts. His total is 'dnf' meaning did not finish.\n\nWait a second, the claim says that the person with snatch 153 and clean & jerk 180 is Jos\u00e9 Espinoza. But in the table, Christian L\u00f3pez has snatch 153, but his clean & jerk is 182. So neither of them has both 153 and 180.\n\nSo maybe I need to see if any person has both snatch 153 and clean & jerk 180. Let me check each row:\n\n- Christian L\u00f3pez: snatch 153, clean & jerk 182 \u2192 no.\n- Bruno Brand\u00e3o: snatch 157, clean & jerk 180 \u2192 no.\n- Pedro Stetsiuk: snatch 160, clean & jerk 180. His total is 340.\n\nHmm, Pedro has clean & jerk 180 but snatch 160. So none have both 153 and 180.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be iose espinoza\". Since Espinoza's data is '-', he didn't achieve those lifts. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Espinoza doesn't have those numbers. Moreover, no one else in the table has both 153 and 180.\n\nAdditionally, checkingEspinoza's bodyweight: his weight is 99.40 kg, which is less than 100 kg. So even if he had those lifts (which he doesn't), his bodyweight wouldn't be greater than 100 kg.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false: Espinoza didn't have those lift numbers, and his weight isn't above 100 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Jos\u00e9 Espinoza did not achieve the specified lifts, and his bodyweight is under 100 kg. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row__index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"clean & jerk\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"clean & jerk\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Bodyweight\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
