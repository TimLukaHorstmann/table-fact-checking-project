    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, it has five columns: game, date, opponent, score, and series. Each row represents a different game with specific details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions April 14 as the date and asks about the opponent. So I should look for the row where the date is \"april 14\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: April 8\n- Row 1: April 10\n- Row 2: April 12\n- Row 3: April 14\n- Row 4: April 17\n\nRow index starts at 0, so the fourth game is at row index 3. In this row, under the 'opponent' column, it says \"new jersey devils\".\n\nThe claim uses \"new jersey devil\", which seems like a typo because the table consistently lists the opponent as \"new jersey devils\" with an 's'. Even though the spelling is slightly off, I think it's referring to the same team. So, the opponent on April 14 is indeed the New Jersey Devils.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is in row index 3 under the 'opponent' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
