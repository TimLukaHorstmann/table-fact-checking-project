    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"marc surer score 4 more point in 1985 compare to 1984\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check if the table contains information about Marc Surer. Looking through the entrant column, I see entries like \"team ensign,\" \"team ats,\" and others. There's no mention of Marc Surer as an entrant in any row. The points are listed under each team or constructor, not individual drivers.\n\nNext, I need to verify the points for 1984 and 1985. For 1984, there are two rows with \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" as the entrant, both scoring 1 point each. That totals 2 points in 1984. In 1985, the row shows \"motor racing developments ltd\" with points 5. \n\nThe claim suggests that Marc Surer scored 4 more points in 1985 than in 1984. However, since Marc Surer isn't listed in the table, I can't find his specific point totals. The data only provides points per team or constructor each year.\n\nSince the claim references a driver (Marc Surer) not present in the table and relies on team points that don't directly correlate to an individual's performance, there's no way to confirm if this is accurate based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, without Marc Surer's entries, I can't support the claim. The relevant cells are the points for 1984 and 1985.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"marc surer score a total of 5 point in both 1985 and 1986\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two years: 1985 and 1986. The claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 5 points each year in those two years. So I need to check if both years have an entry where the points are 5 for Marc Surer.\n\nLooking at the table, let's scan through each row:\n\n- For 1985: The relevant row is row index 10 (assuming rows start from 0). Here, the entrant is \"motor racing developments ltd\", chassis is \"brabham bt54\", engine is \"bmw str - 4 t / c\", and points are 5. However, there's no mention of Marc Surer in this row.\n\n- For 1986: The relevant row is row index 11. Here, the entrant is \"barclay arrows bmw\", chassis is \"arrows a8\", engine is \"bmw str - 4 t / c\", and points are 0. Again, Marc Surer isn't mentioned here either.\n\nWait, I should check if the driver's name is present in any of these rows. The table only includes columns for year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points, but there's no column that specifies the driver's name. Therefore, it's impossible to know from this table whether Marc Surer was driving for those teams or not.\n\nGiven that, I can't confirm that Marc Surer scored 5 points in both years because the necessary information about drivers isn't present. So the claim is unsupported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't list drivers, so we can't verify Marc Surer's points. The relevant cells for 1985 show 5 points and 1986 shows 0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"marc surer score the same amount of point in both race in 1981.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and check for entries from 1981. Looking through the table, I see two rows with the year 1981.\n\nIn row 3 (index starting from 0?), let's count: The first row is 1979, second is 1980, third is also 1980. Then row 3 and 4 are both 1981. \n\nRow 3 has 'ensign racing' with 4 points, and row 4 has 'theodore racing team' also with 4 points.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"marc surer.\" I don't see any entries in the table that mention Marc Surer by name. The entrant columns list teams like 'team ensign,' 'team ats,' 'ensign racing,' etc., but not individual drivers. \n\nSince Marc Surer isn't listed as an entrant, and all points for 1981 are under team names, I can't directly tie the points to him. Without his name in the table, it's impossible to verify if he scored the same points in both races.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be supported by the data provided, so it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because Marc Surer is not mentioned in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has presented a claim about a table and wants to determine if it's true or false based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"marc surer score a total of 8 point in the 2 race of 1981.\" Wait, but looking at the table, I don't see any mention of a driver named Marc Surer. The table lists teams like Team Ensign, Team ATS, Ensign Racing, Theodore Racing Team, Arrows Racing Team, etc., along with their chassis, engines, and points for each year. There's no column or row that specifies individual drivers; it only shows the team entries.\n\nSince the claim mentions Marc Surer, a driver who was active in the early 80s, I know he drove for Ensign and then later for Arrows. However, the table doesn't provide information about individual drivers, just the teams. Therefore, without data on specific drivers, we can't verify how many points Marc Surer scored.\n\nNext, looking at the years mentioned in the claim: 1981 with two races. Checking the table, there are entries for Ensign Racing and Theodore Racing Team in 1981. Both have points listed as 4 each. So together, that's 8 points across both teams in 1981. But since the claim is about Marc Surer, not the teams, we can't attribute those points directly to him.\n\nThe relevant cells here are the ones for 1981, specifically the points from Ensign Racing and Theodore Racing Team. These are rows 3 and 4 in the table (assuming the first data row starts at index 0). Each of these has a 'points' value of 4.\n\nHowever, without information on Marc Surer's participation or his specific points, we can't confirm if he scored those 8 points.

The task is to determine if the claim \"marc surer score 2 time as many point in 1986 than 1983\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that Marc Surer scored twice as many points in 1986 compared to 1983. To verify this, I'll look into the table for the years 1983 and 1986 and see if there's any information about Marc Surer.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, points. Each row represents a team's participation in a particular year with their respective points.\n\nI'll start by checking for entries in 1983. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- In 1983 (row index 7), there are two entries: both from \"arrows racing team\" with chassis models A6 and A7, using BMW engines. The points scored are 4 each.\n\nNext, checking for 1986 (row index 10): the entrant is \"barclay arrows bmw,\" chassis A8, engine BMW STR-4 T/C, and points scored are 0.\n\nNow, I notice that in neither 1983 nor 1986 does the table mention Marc Surer. The table lists teams and their points but doesn't provide driver information like Marc Surer's name. Therefore, we don't have any data about his performance in those years from this table.\n\nSince there is no mention of Marc Surer or his points in either 1983 or 1986, the claim cannot be verified using the given data. Without relevant data supporting the claim, it must be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Marc Surer's points in 1983 and 1986, but the table doesn't include any entries for him.

I need to check if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the years mentioned: 1985 and 1986. Scanning through the table rows:\n\nFor 1985:\n- The row shows \"motor racing developments ltd\" with a chassis of \"brabham bt54\" and an engine of \"bmw str - 4 t / c\". The points listed are 5.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is related to Marc Surer. The table doesn't mention any drivers, only teams and constructors. So maybe each team's total points reflect their performance, possibly including all their drivers.\n\nBut the claim specifies \"Marc Surer\", which isn't present in the table at all. The table lists different teams and constructors but no individual driver names. Therefore, I can't find any data related to Marc Surer directly.\n\nSince there's no information about Marc Surer in the table, I can't verify his points for 1985 or 1986. Without this data, the claim can't be supported by the given information.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"marc surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total.\" Hmm, I need to parse this correctly.\n\nFirst, I notice that the table doesn't mention \"marc surer\" anywhere. All the entrants are teams like team ensign, team ats, etc., but there's no individual driver listed. So, the first thing is that the table might not have data about Marc Surer specifically. That could be a problem because if he's not in the table, how can we verify his points?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim refers to someone else, or maybe \"marc surer\" is supposed to represent something else? But looking at the table again, all entries are team names and their corresponding points. There's no mention of individual drivers or their points.\n\nSo if the claim is about Marc Surer, but he's not in the table, then we can't verify it. Alternatively, maybe \"marc surer\" is a typo or misinterpretation. Let me check for any similar names. No, nothing seems close. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to the points scored by the teams. Maybe Marc Surer is associated with one of these teams? But without that information in the table, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the points column: In 1979, team ensign scored 0 points. Team ats had two entries in 1980, both with 0 points each. Ensign racing and Theodore racing team in 1981 both have 4 points each. Arrows A4 and A5 in 1982 also have 3 points each. In 1983, arrows a6 has 4 points. Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW in 1984 has 1 point for each entry. Motor racing developments ltd in 1985 has 5 points, and barclay arrows bmw in 1986 has 0.\n\nWait, the highest points a team got was 5 in 1985. So if the claim is about someone scoring 6 points twice more than another score of 2 points, but in the table, no one scored 6 or 2 points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. The structure is a bit unclear: \"score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total.\" Perhaps it's saying that Marc Surer scored 6 points on two occasions, which is twice as much as when he scored 2 points? But again, without his data, we can't check.\n\nSince the table doesn't include any information about Marc Surer, and all entries are team-based with varying points, I think the claim cannot be supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks any mention of Marc Surer, making it impossible to verify the claim based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Looking at rows with 'year' 1982, there are two entries for Arrows Racing Team: one with chassis A4 and another with A5. Both have points listed as 3. So in 1982, Arrows Racing Team scored 3 points each time.\n\nThe claim says Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in three races in 1982. However, since Marc Surer isn't mentioned in any of the entrant fields for 1982 or any other year, it's impossible to verify that he scored any points at all.
