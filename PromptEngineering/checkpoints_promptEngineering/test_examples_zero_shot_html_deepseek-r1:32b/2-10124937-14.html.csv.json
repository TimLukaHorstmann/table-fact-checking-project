    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"when marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The table has several columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams with their aggregate scores and the results of each leg.\n\nThe claim is about Marseille being the first team in a row and checking if the first leg's score was 3-1. So, I need to look for any row where \"team 1\" is Marseille.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n1. The first row is Andrlecht vs Bayern Munich.\n2. Second row: Rangers vs Werder Bremen.\n3. Third: Bolton Wanderers vs Sporting CP.\n4. Fourth: Bayer Leverkusen vs Hamburg.\n5. Fifth: Benfica vs Getafe.\n6. Sixth: Fiorentina vs Everton.\n7. Seventh: Tottenham Hotspur vs PSV Eindhoven.\n8. Eighth row: Marseille vs Zenit St Petersburg.\n\nIn the eighth row, team 1 is Marseille. Now, I need to check what the first leg's score was for this match. The \"1st leg\" column shows 3-1. So according to the table, when Marseille is the first team, their first leg score is indeed 3-1.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true as per the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key here is that both the first leg and second leg scores should be the same for Bolton Wanderers. So I'm looking for their two legs having identical scores.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: team1, agg (aggregate score), team2, 1st leg, 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams, showing both legs of the tie and the aggregate result.\n\nI need to find the row where Bolton Wanderers is involved. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The third row has \"bolton wanderers\" as team1, with an aggregate score of 1 - 2 against Sporting CP.\n- Their first leg score is 1 - 1, and the second leg is 0 - 1.\n\nWait, let me break that down. First leg: Bolton Wanderers scored 1 goal, Sporting CP scored 1. Second leg: Bolton Wanderers 0, Sporting CP 1.\n\nSo the claim is about whether both legs have the same score. The first leg was 1-1 for Bolton and 1-0 in the second? No, actually, the team2 is Sporting CP, so the scores are:\n\nFirst leg: Bolton (team1) vs Sporting CP (team2). First leg score: 1 - 1.\n\nSecond leg: The same teams, but since it's a two-leg tie, probably reversed. But looking at the table, for Bolton Wanderers, team2 is Sporting CP in both legs because it's part of their aggregate.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the first leg, team1 is Bolton, and team2 is Sporting CP with score 1-1. In the second leg, same teams? Or does it switch? Wait, no, looking at the columns: for each row, it's team1 vs team2, with their respective scores in both legs.\n\nSo for the third row:\n\nteam1: Bolton Wanderers\n\nagg: 1 - 2\n\nteam2: Sporting CP\n\n1st leg: 1 - 1 (Bolton scored 1, Sporting CP scored 1)\n\n2nd leg: 0 - 1 (Bolton scored 0, Sporting CP scored 1)\n\nSo the first leg was a draw 1-1. The second leg was 0-1 in favor of Sporting CP.\n\nThe claim is that both legs have the same score for Bolton Wanderers. So looking at their scores:\n\nIn the first leg, Bolton Wanderers scored 1.\n\nIn the second leg, they scored 0.\n\nSo their scores in each leg are different: 1 vs 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the scores aren't the same in both legs.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The row index for Bolton Wanderers is 2 (since rows start at 0). The columns involved are \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\". \n\nSo relevant_cells should include:\n- row_index: 2, column_name: \"1st leg\"\n- row_index: 2, column_name: \"2nd leg\"\n\nThat's how we verify the claim. Since their scores differ in both legs (1 vs 0), the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for Bolton Wanderers are the first and second leg scores. Comparing these shows different scores, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
