    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the philadelphia flyer record be 40 - 11 - 10 as of february 23rd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: game, february, opponent, score, and record. Each row represents a game played against different opponents with their respective outcomes and records.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the Philadelphia Flyers' record (40-11-10) as of February 23rd. So I need to check if there's an entry where the opponent is the Philadelphia Flyers and the date in February is the 23rd, and whether their record matches.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow indices start at 0 for the first data row (game 49). Let me go through them one by one.\n\n- Row 0: Game 49, Feb 2 vs Boston Bruins. Opponent isn't Philadelphia Flyers.\n- Row 1: Game 50, Feb 3 vs Buffalo Sabres. Not relevant.\n- ...\n- Continue until I find the row where opponent is Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nLooking ahead, at row index 12 (since each data row increments by 1). Let's check:\n\nRow 12 has game number 62? Wait no, let me recount correctly. Wait, looking back, the table shows rows from game 49 to game 62, so there are 14 games listed.\n\nLooking for opponent \"philadelphia flyers\". Checking each row:\n\nRow index 0: Boston Bruins\nRow 1: Buffalo Sabres\nRow 2: St Louis Blues\nRow 3: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 4: Chicago Black Hawks\nRow 5: Pittsburgh Penguins\nRow 6: Los Angeles Kings (twice)\nWait, wait. Let me list each row's opponent:\n\n- Row 0 (game 49): Boston Bruins\n- Row 1 (50): Buffalo Sabres\n- Row 2 (51): St Louis Blues\n- Row 3 (52): Toronto Maple Leafs\n- Row 4 (53): Chicago Black Hawks\n- Row 5 (54): Pittsburgh Penguins\n- Row 6 (55): Los Angeles Kings\n- Row 7 (56): Vancouver Canucks\n- Row 8 (57): Los Angeles Kings again\n- Row 9 (58): California Golden Seals\n- Row 10 (59): Detroit Red Wings\n- Row 11 (60): Montreal Canadiens\n- Row 12 (61): Philadelphia Flyers\n- Row 13 (62): St Louis Blues\n\nAh, so the opponent \"philadelphia flyers\" is in row index 12. Let me check that row:\n\nRow index 12: game 61, February 23rd? Wait, the 'february' column for this row has value 23 (since each row's february value increases by 1 or more). Yes, it says February 23rd.\n\nNow, what is the record in that row? The record is given as 40-11-10. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: opponent is Philadelphia Flyers on February 23rd, and their record is indeed 40-11-10. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- The row where opponent is Philadelphia Flyers (row index 12) for the 'opponent' column.\n- The same row's 'record' column to verify the numbers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
