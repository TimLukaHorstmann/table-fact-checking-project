    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim about it. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1.\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear, but I think they're saying that if there's a game where the number of goals scored is more than 4, the result would be 3-1. Alternatively, it could mean that for any goal (like a specific match), if it's larger than 4 in some way, then the result is 3-1.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure to understand the data. The columns are: goal, date, score, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match with details about that match.\n\nNow, let me parse each column:\n\n- **goal**: This seems to be an identifier or perhaps the number of goals scored by the team? But looking at the values (1,2,3,4,5), it's more likely just an incremental ID for each row.\n- **date**: The date when the match took place.\n- **score**: The scoreline of the match. For example, \"3 - 1\" means the home team scored 3 and the away team scored 1.\n- **result**: This seems to be a repetition of the score; for most rows, it's the same as 'score'. However, in row 4, the result is \"2 - 1\" while the score is \"1 - 1.\" That might indicate an aggregate or a different way of presenting the outcome.\n- **competition**: The type of competition this match was part of.\n\nThe claim mentions a goal larger than 4. Since the 'goal' column is just an ID, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps they're referring to the total number of goals in a match. Let me check each row's score:\n\n1. Row 0: \"3 - 1\" \u2192 Total goals = 4\n2. Row 1: \"1 - 2\" \u2192 Total goals = 3\n3. Row 2: \"1 - 0\" \u2192 Total goals = 1\n4. Row 3: \"1 - 1\" (score) and result is \"2 - 1.\" Hmm, maybe this row's total is 3 in the result.\n5. Row 4: \"2 - 1\" score, result is \"3 - 2.\" So total goals here are 5.\n\nSo the only match with a total of more than 4 goals is row 4 (total 5). The claim says that if there's a goal larger than 4, the result should be 3-1. \n\nLooking at row 4, the score is 2-1, and the result is 3-2. So the actual result isn't 3-1; it's 3-2. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold because when there are more than 4 goals (specifically 5), the result isn't 3-1.\n\nI should also check if any other rows have a total over 4. Rows 0 has exactly 4, row 1 is 3, so only row 4 meets the condition. Since that row doesn't satisfy the claimed result, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: I need to look at the 'score' and 'result' columns for each match where total goals exceed 4. Only row 4 fits this, so I'll include both its score and result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"on september 10 , 2013 , the result be 3 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The key pieces of information are the date \"september 10, 2013\" and the result being \"3 - 2\".\n\nNext, I'll look through each row in the table to find the one that matches this date. Scanning the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 0: 24 March 2007 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- Row 1: 3 March 2010 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: 9 July 2011 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- Row 3: 22 May 2013 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- Row 4: 10 September 2013 \u2192 This matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check what the result was on this date. Looking at row 4, the 'result' column shows \"3 - 2\". \n\nSo both the date and the result match exactly with the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- The date in row 4 (column 'date')\n- The result in row 4 (column 'result')\n\nThis gives us the two necessary pieces of information to confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that in all instances where the competition type is \"friendly,\" the number of goals should be less than 3. So, I'll need to look through each row of the table and check two things: whether the competition is friendly and then see if the goal count meets the condition.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five rows, each representing a different match with details like goal count, date, score, result, and competition type. The columns we're interested in are \"goal\" (which likely indicates the number of goals scored) and \"competition.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Competition: friendly\n- Goal: 1\nSince this is a friendly match with only 1 goal, it satisfies the condition. So, relevant cells here are goal=1 (row 0, column 'goal') and competition='friendly' (row 0, column 'competition'). I'll note these as relevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- Competition: friendly\n- Goal: 2\nAgain, a friendly match with 2 goals. This also meets the condition of being less than 3. So, similar to row 0, this row's goal and competition cells are relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Competition: 2011 copa am\u00e9rica\nThis is not a friendly competition, so we can skip checking the goal count here as it doesn't apply to our claim.\n\nRow 3:\n- Competition: friendly\n- Goal: 1\nAnother friendly match with 1 goal. This meets the condition, so relevant cells are noted again.\n\nRow 4:\n- Competition: 2014 world cup qualifier\nNot a friendly competition, so we don't need to check the goals here.\n\nNow, after reviewing all rows, every time the competition is friendly, the number of goals is either 1 or 2, both of which are less than 3. Therefore, the claim holds true for all relevant instances.\n\nIn compiling the relevant cells, I'll list each row where the competition was friendly and extract their goal counts. These include rows 0, 1, and 3 under the 'goal' column and their respective 'competition' columns to confirm they were indeed friendly matches.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
