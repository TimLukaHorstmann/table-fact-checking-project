    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the home team only score zero 3 times out of all games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The relevant columns for this claim are \"home team\" and \"score\". Each row represents a game, except for the replay rows which are separate matches.\n\nThe claim states that the home team scored zero three times. So, I need to go through each game and check if the home team's score was zero.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Liverpool (home) vs Portsmouth. Score is 1-1. Home team scored 1.\n2. **Row 1**: This is a replay where Portsmouth is the home team against Liverpool. Score is 1-0. Home team scored 1.\n3. **Row 2**: Sunderland (home) vs Birmingham City. Score 1-1. Home team scored 1.\n4. **Row 3**: Replay with Birmingham City as home against Sunderland. Score 0-2. Here, the home team scored 0. So that's one instance.\n5. **Row 4**: Sheffield United (home) vs Colchester United. Score 1-0. Home team scored 1.\n6. **Row 5**: Tranmere Rovers (home) vs Swansea City. Score 2-1. Home team scored 2.\n7. **Row 6**: Fulham (home) vs West Ham. Score 0-0. Here, the home team scored 0. That's the second instance.\n8. **Row 7**: Replay where West Ham is the home team against Fulham. Score 0-3. Home team scored 0. That's the third instance.\n9. **Row 8**: Manchester United (home) vs Manchester City. Score 4-2. Home team scored 4.\n10. **Row 9**: Millwall (home) vs Burnley. Score 1-0. Home team scored 1.\n11. **Row 10**: Arsenal (home) vs Chelsea. Score 2-1. Home team scored 2.\n\nFrom this, I found three instances where the home team scored zero:\n- Row 3: Birmingham City scored 0 against Sunderland in a replay.\n- Row 6: Fulham drew 0-0 at home against West Ham.\n- Row 7: West Ham scored 0 against Fulham in a replay.\n\nSo that's exactly three times, which matches the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are where the score was zero for the home team. \n\nWait, but looking back, Row 6 is a regular game, not a replay, and it's a draw with both teams scoring zero. So in that case, both teams scored zero, which counts as one instance of the home team (Fulham) scoring zero.\n\nTherefore, three instances support the claim: rows 3, 6, and 7. Each of these has \"score\" where the home team's score is zero.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are exactly three games where the home team scored zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the manchester unite vs manchester city game have the highest attendance of all game.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant information in the table. The columns are 'tie no', 'home team', 'score', 'away team', and 'attendance'. \n\nI notice that in row 5 (0-based index would be 5, but checking the table structure, actually it's the 6th row because counting starts at 0: rows 0-9. Wait, let me recount. The first data row is index 0: tie no 1, then index 1 is replay, index 2 tie no 2, etc. So the Manchester United vs City game is at row index 5.\n\nLooking at that row, 'home team' is Manchester United and 'away team' is Manchester City. The attendance for this match is 67228.\n\nNow, I need to check all other games' attendances to see if any have a higher number than 67,228. \n\nRow 0: Liverpool vs Portsmouth, attendance 34669\nRow 1: Portsmouth replay vs Liverpool, attendance 19529\nRow 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham, 24966\nRow 3: Birmingham City replay vs Sunderland, 25645\nRow 4: Sheffield Utd vs Colchester, 17074\nRow 5: Manchester United vs Man City, 67228 (this is the highest so far)\nRow 6: Fulham vs West Ham, attendance 14705\nRow 7: West Ham replay vs Fulham, 27934\nRow 8: Millwall vs Burnley, 10420\nRow 9: Arsenal vs Chelsea, 38136\n\nComparing all these numbers, the highest is indeed 67228 in row 5. So the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- The 'attendance' column for row index 5 (Manchester United game) as it's the highest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"tie no 7 have the lowest attendance out of all feature game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that tie number 7 has the lowest attendance among all the featured games in the table. So, my task is to check each game's attendance and see if tie no 7 indeed has the smallest attendance figure.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. The rows contain data for different matches, some of which are replays indicated by \"replay\" in the tie no column.\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the attendance numbers:\n\n1. Tie 1: Liverpool vs Portsmouth - Attendance is 34,669.\n2. Replay: Portsmouth vs Liverpool (tie 1 replay) - Attendance is 19,529.\n3. Tie 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City - Attendance is 24,966.\n4. Replay: Birmingham City vs Sunderland (tie 2 replay) - Attendance is 25,645.\n5. Tie 3: Sheffield United vs Colchester United - Attendance is 17,074.\n6. Tie 4: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City - Attendance is 12,215.\n7. Tie 5: Fulham vs West Ham United - Attendance is 14,705.\n8. Replay: West Ham United vs Fulham (tie 5 replay) - Attendance is 27,934.\n9. Tie 6: Manchester United vs Manchester City - Attendance is 67,228.\n10. Tie 7: Millwall vs Burnley - Attendance is 10,420.\n11. Tie 8: Arsenal vs Chelsea - Attendance is 38,136.\n\nWait, actually, I need to correct this because the table has only 11 rows (tie numbers from 1 to 8, with some replays). Let me list each row properly:\n\n- Row 0: tie no 1 \u2192 attendance 34,669\n- Row 1: replay \u2192 attendance 19,529\n- Row 2: tie no 2 \u2192 attendance 24,966\n- Row 3: replay \u2192 attendance 25,645\n- Row 4: tie no 3 \u2192 attendance 17,074\n- Row 5: tie no 4 \u2192 attendance 12,215\n- Row 6: tie no 5 \u2192 attendance 14,705\n- Row 7: replay \u2192 attendance 27,934\n- Row 8: tie no 6 \u2192 attendance 67,228\n- Row 9: tie no 7 \u2192 attendance 10,420\n- Row 10: tie no 8 \u2192 attendance 38,136\n\nNow, focusing on the claim about \"tie no 7\". From row 9 (index starting at 0), tie no 7 has an attendance of 10,420.\n\nI need to check all other ties and replays to find out if any have lower attendance than 10,420. Let's list the attendances:\n\n- Tie 1: 34,669\n- Replay (tie 1): 19,529\n- Tie 2: 24,966\n- Replay (tie 2): 25,645\n- Tie 3: 17,074\n- Tie 4: 12,215\n- Tie 5: 14,705\n- Replay (tie 5): 27,934\n- Tie 6: 67,228\n- Tie 7: 10,420\n- Tie 8: 38,136\n\nLooking through these numbers, the lowest attendance is indeed at tie no 7 with 10,420. The next lowest is tie no 4 with 12,215, which is higher than 10,420. Therefore, tie no 7 does have the lowest attendance.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that tie number 7 has the lowest attendance among all games listed in the table. By examining each game's attendance figures, we find that tie no 7 indeed has the smallest attendance of 10,420, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tie_no\": 7,\n  \"attendance\": 10420,\n  \"lowest_attendance\": true\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"tie no 1 be the game tie score game with the highest attendance.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"Tie no 1\" refers to the first row in the table where the 'tie no' column has the value '1'. Looking at the table, that would be the first data row: tie number 1 between Liverpool and Portsmouth with a score of 1-1 and an attendance of 34669.\n\nThe next part is a bit tricky. It says \"be the game tie score game with the highest attendance.\" I think this means that tie no 1 should have the highest attendance among all the games listed in the table. So, my task is to check if the attendance for tie no 1 (34669) is indeed the highest when compared to all other attendances.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column, I'll list out all the values:\n\n- Tie 1: 34669\n- Replay: 19529\n- Tie 2: 24966\n- Replay: 25645\n- Tie 3: 17074\n- Tie 4: 12215\n- Tie 5: 14705\n- Replay: 27934\n- Tie 6: 67228\n- Tie 7: 10420\n- Tie 8: 38136\n\nNow, comparing these numbers. The highest attendance is in tie no 6 with 67228, which is much higher than tie no 1's 34669. So, the claim that tie no 1 has the highest attendance isn't correct.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. Tie no 1 has an attendance of 34669. The other games have attendances ranging from around 10k to over 67k. Clearly, tie no 6 in Manchester United vs Manchester City had the highest attendance. Therefore, tie no 1 is not the game with the highest attendance.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because there's a game (tie no 6) with higher attendance than tie no 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that tie number 1 has the highest attendance. By examining all attendances in the table, we find that tie no 6 has the highest attendance of 67228. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"both the arsenal and chelsea team be only feature on the list a single time.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying both Arsenal and Chelsea appear only once each in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are two columns that mention teams: 'home team' and 'away team'. So, I'll need to check how many times each of these teams appears in either of these columns.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Liverpool, away team is Portsmouth.\n2. Row 1 (replay): Home team is Portsmouth, away team is Liverpool.\n3. Row 2: Home team is Sunderland, away team is Birmingham City.\n4. Row 3 (replay): Home team is Birmingham City, away team is Sunderland.\n5. Row 4: Home team is Sheffield United, away team is Colchester United.\n6. Row 5: Home team is Tranmere Rovers, away team is Swansea City.\n7. Row 6: Home team is Fulham, away team is West Ham United.\n8. Row 7 (replay): Home team is West Ham United, away team is Fulham.\n9. Row 8: Home team is Manchester United, away team is Manchester City.\n10. Row 9: Home team is Millwall, away team is Burnley.\n11. Row 10: Home team is Arsenal, away team is Chelsea.\n\nNow, checking for Arsenal:\n\n- It appears in row 10 as the home team. I don't see any other rows where Arsenal is either home or away. So, that's one occurrence.\n\nChecking for Chelsea:\n\n- It appears in row 10 as the away team. Again, looking through all rows, there are no other instances of Chelsea in either 'home team' or 'away team'. So, that's also one occurrence.\n\nSince both Arsenal and Chelsea each appear only once in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here with various football matches and their details. The claim is \"the home team never score zero points through all the game.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, in football (soccer), a draw is when both teams have the same score, right? So if it's 1-1 or 0-0, that's a draw. Each team gets one point for a draw, so each home team would get at least one point in those cases. The claim says they never scored zero points, meaning there are no games where the home team lost outright without getting any points.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row and see if any home team ended up with zero points, which would mean they lost the game. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Liverpool vs Portsmouth, score is 1-1. That's a draw. Both get a point each. So no issue here.\n2. **Row 1**: This is a replay, and the home team is Portsmouth. They won 1-0 against Liverpool. So Portsmouth gets three points. Still good.\n3. **Row 2**: Sunderland vs Birmingham City, another 1-1 draw. Both teams get one point each.\n4. **Row 3**: Replay between Birmingham City and Sunderland. This time, the score is 0-2, so Birmingham lost as home team. Wait, does that mean they got zero points? Because if they lost, yeah, in football terms, a loss gives you zero points. So this seems like the claim might be false here.\n5. **Row 4**: Sheffield United won 1-0 at home. They get three points.\n6. **Row 5**: Tranmere Rovers beat Swansea City 2-1. Another win, so three points.\n7. **Row 6**: Fulham and West Ham had a 0-0 draw initially. Then in the replay (row 7), Fulham lost as away team when it was 0-3. Wait, no, row 7 is the replay where West Ham won at home with 0-3. So West Ham got three points as the home team.\n8. **Row 6**: The initial match between Fulham and West Ham ended 0-0. Both teams drew, so each got one point.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in row 3. Let me double-check: Row 2 is Sunderland vs Birmingham City with a 1-1 draw. Then the replay (row 3) has Birmingham City as home team, and they lost 0-2 to Sunderland. So in that replay, Birmingham was the home team and lost, meaning they got zero points from that game.\n\nSo this directly contradicts the claim because the home team (Birmingham City in row 3) did score zero points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the home team never scored zero points across all games. However, in the replay between Birmingham City and Sunderland, Birmingham City as the home team lost with a score of 0-2, resulting in zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the manchester unite vs manchester city game have the lowest attendance of all games.\" First, I notice a typo in the team name; it's spelled \"manchester unite\" instead of \"manchester united,\" but I assume that's a mistake and they're referring to Manchester United.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where both teams are Manchester United and Manchester City. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Liverpool vs Portsmouth\n- Row 1: Portsmouth vs Liverpool (replay)\n- Row 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City\n- Row 3: Birmingham City vs Sunderland (replay)\n- Row 4: Sheffield United vs Colchester United\n- Row 5: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City\n- Row 6: Fulham vs West Ham United\n- Row 7: West Ham United vs Fulham (replay)\n- Row 8: Manchester United vs Manchester City\n- Row 9: Millwall vs Burnley\n- Row 10: Arsenal vs Chelsea\n\nSo, the game between Manchester United and Manchester City is in row 8. The attendance there is 67228.\n\nNext, I need to check all other games' attendances to see if any have lower attendance than 67228.

Looking at the table's structure, each row represents a match with home and away teams. Each team can appear either as the home or away team.\n\nStarting with Arsenal: Let's scan through all rows. In row 8, Arsenal is listed as the home team against Chelsea. Are there any other entries where Arsenal appears? Looking back at the table, it seems that Arsenal only appears once in row 8. There are no other rows mentioning Arsenal either as home or away.\n\nNow checking Chelsea: Similarly, I look through each row for mentions of Chelsea. In row 8, Chelsea is the away team against Arsenal. Any other instances? No, it doesn't appear anywhere else. So Chelsea also appears only once in the table.\n\nThe claim states that both teams feature more than once. However, from my examination, neither Arsenal nor Chelsea appears multiple times.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like it's a list of football (soccer) matches with details such as tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific match or a replay if needed.\n\nThe claim is about \"tie no 7\" having the highest attendance. So I need to find which row in the table corresponds to tie number 7 and then check its attendance figure against all other attendances in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row's first column is either a tie number (like 1,2,3,...) or \"replay\". The rows with numbers are the initial matches, while the replays are additional games played when there was a draw. \n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows that have a numerical tie no. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: tie no 1\n2. Row 1: replay (not numbered)\n3. Row 2: tie no 2\n4. Row 3: replay (not numbered)\n5. Row 4: tie no 3\n6. Row 5: tie no 4\n7. Row 6: tie no 5\n8. Row 7: replay (not numbered)\n9. Row 8: tie no 6\n10. Row 9: tie no 7\n\nSo, row index 9 corresponds to tie no 7. The attendance for this match is listed as 38136.\n\nNow, I need to compare this attendance with all other attendances in the table to see if it's the highest.\n\nLet me list out all the attendances:\n\n- Tie 1: 34669\n- Replay (Portsmouth vs Liverpool): 19529\n- Tie 2: 24966\n- Replay (Birmingham City vs Sunderland): 25645\n- Tie 3: 17074\n- Tie 4: 12215\n- Tie 5: 14705\n- Replay (West Ham United vs Fulham): 27934\n- Tie 6: 67228\n- Tie 7: 38136\n\nLooking at these numbers, the attendance for tie no 6 is 67228, which is higher than tie no 7's 38136. Therefore, tie no 7 does not have the highest attendance.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure I'm considering all relevant data, I should check if any other ties or replays have higher attendances. For example, the replay between West Ham United and Fulham has an attendance of 27934, which is lower than both tie no 6 and tie no 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: tie no 7's attendance is 38136, but there's another match (tie no 6) with a higher attendance of 67228. Therefore, the claim that tie no 7 has the highest attendance is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n\n- The attendance for tie no 7 in row index 9.\n- All other attendances to compare, but since the main focus was on tie no 7 and the highest, I think only the attendance of tie no 7 is needed. However, to confirm, we need to look at all attendances, but for brevity in the answer, perhaps just listing the relevant cell that holds tie no 7's attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because tie number 6 has a higher attendance than tie number 7.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"tie no 1 be the game with the second highest attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are 'tie no', 'home team', 'score', 'away team', and 'attendance'. The rows represent different games, some marked as replays.\n\nThe claim refers to \"tie no 1\" having the second highest attendance. So, I need to:\n\n1. Identify all the attendance numbers in the table.\n2. Determine which has the highest and second highest attendances.\n3. Check if tie no 1's attendance matches the second highest.\n\nLooking at each row's 'attendance' column:\n- Row 0: 34669\n- Row 1 (replay): 19529\n- Row 2: 24966\n- Row 3 (replay): 25645\n- Row 4: 17074\n- Row 5: 12215\n- Row 6: 14705\n- Row 7 (replay): 27934\n- Row 8: 67228\n- Row 9: 10420\n- Row 10: 38136\n\nWait, but the 'tie no' column is numbered from 1 to 8 with some replays. So, tie no 1 refers to row 0 (since rows are zero-indexed). Its attendance is 34669.\n\nNow, let's list all attendances in order:\n- Row 8: 67228\n- Row 7 (replay): 27934\n- Row 10: 38136\n- Row 3 (replay): 25645\n- Row 0: 34669\nWait, that's not correct. Let me list all attendances correctly:\n\nList of attendance values:\n34669, 19529, 24966, 25645, 17074, 12215, 14705, 27934, 67228, 10420, 38136.\n\nNow, sorting them in descending order:\n- 67228 (tie no 6)\n- 38136 (tie no 8)\n- 34669 (tie no 1)\n- 27934 (replay of tie no5)\n- 25645 (replay of tie no2)\n- 24966 (tie no2)\n- 19529 (replay of tie no1)\n- 17074 (tie no3)\n- 14705 (tie no5)\n- 12215 (tie no4)\n- 10420 (tie no7)\n\nSo the highest attendance is 67228, and the second highest is 38136. The third is 34669.\n\nTie no 1 has an attendance of 34669, which is the third highest, not the second. Therefore, the claim that tie no1 has the second highest attendance is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, 'attendance' (34669)\n- Rows with higher attendances: row8 (67228) and row10 (38136)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
