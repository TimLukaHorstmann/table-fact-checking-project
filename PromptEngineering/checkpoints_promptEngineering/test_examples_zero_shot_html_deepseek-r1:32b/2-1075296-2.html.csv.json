    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Michael Schumacher is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"michael schumacher be the driver whose constructor be ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retire of 1:32:35.101\"\n\nI'll start by checking each part of the claim against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that Michael Schumacher is listed as a driver with Ferrari as his constructor. That's one condition met.\n\nNext, the average grid number being 1. In the table, under the 'grid' column for Schumacher, it shows '1'. Since there's only one entry, the average is just 1, so that checks out.\n\nThen, the time / retired status should be \"1:32:35.101\". The table has this exact value in the 'time / retired' column for Schumacher. So that part also matches.\n\nI don't see any other entries for Michael Schumacher in the table, so there's no conflicting data. All parts of the claim are supported by the information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all specified details about Michael Schumacher match the table entry.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
