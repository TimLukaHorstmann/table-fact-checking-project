    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the texas longhorns woman's basketball table show game vs different team show score on different location.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems to be saying that in the Texas Longhorns women's basketball schedule or results table, each game against a different team shows the scores at different locations.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with several columns: \"texas vs,\" \"overall record,\" \"austin,\" \"opponent's venue,\" \"neutral location,\" \"last 5,\" and \"streak.\" Each row represents a different opponent that the Texas Longhorns have played against.\n\nThe claim mentions showing scores at different locations. In the table, the columns related to locations are \"opponent's venue\" and \"austin.\" The \"opponent's venue\" would indicate games played away from Austin, while \"austin\" likely shows home games.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if each game against a different team has entries in both the \"opponent's venue\" and \"austin\" columns. This would mean that for each opponent, there are both home and away games recorded with their respective scores.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Each row lists a different opponent under \"texas vs.\"\n- For each opponent, the \"austin\" column shows the score when Texas played at home.\n- The \"opponent's venue\" column shows the score when Texas played away.\n\nFor example:\n- Against Oklahoma (row 7), Austin has a score of 11-4, and Opponent's Venue is Tied 7-7. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Tied would imply neutral ground. Maybe I should check other rows.\n- Against Texas A&M (row 9), Austin shows 28-4, and Opponent's Venue shows 23-8. This indicates home and away games with different scores.\n\nBut looking at row 7 again: Oklahoma has \"austin\" as 11-4 and \"opponent's venue\" as tied 7-7. Wait, that seems inconsistent because a tie would usually be in neutral territory, not the opponent's venue. Maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Perhaps \"tied\" indicates that overall records are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each team has both home and away games recorded with their respective scores, which supports the claim of different locations having different scores.\n\nThus, since each row has entries for both Austin (home) and opponent's venue (away), it shows that against each different team, there are games at different locations with varying scores. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with baylor, iowa state, nebraska and oklahoma state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that the teams Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State all have a current streak of \"l 2\". In sports terms, a streak usually refers to consecutive wins or losses. Here, \"l\" likely stands for loss, so \"l 2\" would mean two consecutive losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team that the University of Texas (UT) has played against. The columns include details like overall score, home games, away games, neutral sites, current streak, etc. Specifically, I need to check the \"current streak\" column for each of these four teams: Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State.\n\nLet me go through each team one by one:\n\n1. **Baylor**: Looking at row index 0 (since tables usually start at 0), under \"current streak,\" it says \"l 3\". The claim mentions \"l 2\", so this doesn't match. Baylor has a streak of three losses, not two.\n\n2. **Iowa State**: This team is listed in row index 2. Their current streak is \"l 2\". That matches the claim exactly.\n\n3. **Nebraska**: Found in row index 6. The current streak here is also \"l 2\", which again matches what the claim states.\n\n4. **Oklahoma State**: Located at row index 8. Their current streak is listed as \"l 2\" as well, so this part of the claim holds true.\n\nWait a minute, but Baylor's streak is \"l 3,\" not \"l 2\". The claim includes Baylor in the list, which might be incorrect because their streak doesn't align with the others. If even one team doesn't meet the condition, does that make the entire claim false?\n\nThe claim says all four teams have a current streak of l 2. Since Baylor has a streak of l 3, this part is not true. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because at least one team (Baylor) doesn't fit the stated streak.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Baylor: Doesn't match (l 3 instead of l 2)\n- Iowa State: Matches\n- Nebraska: Matches\n- Oklahoma State: Matches\n\nSince not all four teams have a current streak of l 2, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"in the last 10 meeting, the score be tie, 5 - 5 4 time and 2 time at ut, 8 - 2\"\n\nFirst, I'll interpret this as two parts:\n1. In the last 10 meetings, there have been 4 times where the score was a tie (5-5).\n2. There have also been 2 instances where UT scored 8-2.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team against UT. The column \"last 10 meeting\" is what I need to focus on. \n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"last 10 meeting\" cell:\n\n1. **Oklahoma**: Tied 5-5.\n2. **Texas A&M**: Tied 5-5.\n3. **Oklahoma State**: UT 7-3.\n4. **Texas Tech**: TTU 6-4, so not a tie and not UT's score mentioned as 8-2.\n5. **Nebraska**: Not listed in the table; I'll ignore this since it's not present.\n6. **Iowa State**: Also not present in the table.\n\nWait, looking back, I might have misread some rows. Let me list all the \"last 10 meeting\" entries correctly:\n\n- Oklahoma: tied 5-5\n- Texas A&M: tied 5-5\n- Texas Tech: TTU 6-4 (not a tie)\n- Others like Nebraska and Iowa State aren't in the table, so they don't contribute.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Tied 5-5 occurs for Oklahoma and Texas A&M. That's only two times, not four as claimed.\n- Looking for UT winning 8-2: In the \"last 10 meeting\" column, I see \"ut, 8 - 2\" for Nebraska. But since Nebraska isn't a row in the table, maybe it's another team? Wait, no\u2014let me check each row again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let's list all:\n\n1. **Oklahoma**: Tied 5-5\n2. **Texas A&M**: Tied 5-5\n3. **Texas Tech**: TTU 6-4 (not a tie)\n4. **Others like Nebraska and Iowa State are not in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount all rows:\n\nLooking at each row's \"last 10 meeting\":\n\n- Row for Oklahoma: tied 5-5\n- Row for Texas A&M: tied 5-5\n- Row for Texas Tech: TTU 6-4 (not a tie)\n- Other teams:\n   - Nebraska isn't present, so no data.\n   - Iowa State isn't present.\n\nSo, in the table provided, only two instances where \"last 10 meeting\" is tied 5-5. The claim says four times, which doesn't match. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nFor the second part, UT 8-2: Looking through all rows, I don't see any \"last 10 meeting\" entry where it's UT winning 8-2 except possibly for Nebraska, but Nebraska isn't a row in this table. So, there are zero instances of UT 8-2 in the provided data.\n\nSince both parts of the claim aren't supported by the table, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the last 10 meetings, there were four ties (5-5) and two wins for UT with a score of 8-2. However, checking the relevant cells:\n\n- Oklahoma: Tied 5-5\n- Texas A&M: Tied 5-5\nNo instances of 8-2.\n\nThus, the claim is not fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meeting\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meeting\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meeting\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the texas longhorns woman's basketball table show game vs only 1 team show score on different location.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that the Texas Longhorns' women's basketball table shows a game against only one team where the score is shown in different locations. So I need to check if there's exactly one team in the table where the scores are recorded in multiple venues or locations.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game against a specific team. The columns include various statistics like total games, home games, away games, etc. The claim specifically mentions \"score on different location,\" which I interpret as whether a particular opponent has played both at home and away, showing their scores in those respective locations.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any team has multiple entries or varying locations. However, upon examining the table, it seems that each team is listed only once per row. Each row represents a different opponent, not multiple games against the same team across various locations. \n\nFor example, looking at the first few rows: Texas A&M, Texas Tech, etc., each has one entry with their respective scores in home and away games. This indicates that the table aggregates data for each opponent, showing overall performance across all games, not individual game instances.\n\nSince the claim suggests there's only one team where the score is shown in different locations (implying multiple entries or varying venues), but the table structure doesn't support that\u2014it lists each opponent once with aggregated stats\u2014the claim isn't accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows each opponent once with aggregate scores across all games, not individual game instances.

It mentions two specific instances where games ended in ties at the opponent's venue:\n\n1. A tie of 4-4 against Kansas.\n2. A tie of 7-7 against Oklahoma.\n\nI need to check each of these points against the table data provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are:\n0: Team\n1: Total games (Opponent's column)\nWait, actually, looking closer, the headers might be missing in the HTML snippet. Wait no\u2014the user didn't provide a header row, but based on the data, I can infer that each row represents a team, and the columns probably include things like total games, at opponent's venue, etc.\n\nWait, let me look again. The table has multiple rows with teams like \"kansas\", \"oklahoma\" as part of their names? Wait no, in the table, each row is a different team that UT (the main team) plays against. So for example, the first row is \"You are tasked to... [Texas A&M] etc.\"\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\nEach row seems to be about a different opponent. For example:\n- Row 0: \"texas a&m\"\n- Row 1: \"texas tech\"\nWait no, actually, looking back, I think each row is an opponent team that UT has played against.\n\nWait, let me count. The rows are:\n\n0: \"You are tasked...\" (this seems to be the user's instruction, but in reality, it's part of the table? Wait no, perhaps the actual table starts with \"texas a&m\" as row 0. Let me look again at the HTML structure.\n\nLooking at the tbody, each tr represents an opponent:\n\n- The first tr has \"texas a&m\" as one of the data points.\nWait no, actually, looking back, the tbody has multiple rows, each with several tds. For example, the first row (index 0) under tbody is:\n\n<td>21 - 13</td>\n<td>11 - 4</td>\n<td>tied 7-7</td>\n<td>3-2</td>\n<td>ou 3-2</td>\n<td>tied 5-5</td>\n<td>w 1</td>\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me parse the HTML correctly.\n\nThe table has a tbody with multiple tr elements, each containing several td cells. Each tr represents an opponent that UT plays against.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFor example, one of the rows is about \"kansas\":\n\nLooking through the list, under \"opponent's venue\" column (which I think is the third column), we have entries like \"tied 4-4\" and others. Similarly for \"oklahoma\", it should be checked.\n\nWait, let me find the correct columns. The user's claim refers to \"opponent 's venue,\" which in the table is likely the column named \"Opponent's Venue.\" Looking at the data:\n\nLooking at each row, I can see that one of the columns has entries like \"tied 4-4\" or \"7 - 7\". So perhaps the third column from the start is \"opponent's venue\".\n\nLet me check each row for this.\n\nFor example, looking through the rows:\n\nRow index 3 (assuming starting at 0) is about \"kansas\":\n\nLooking at the data for kansas: in the opponent's venue column, it says \"tied 4 - 4\".\n\nSimilarly, for oklahoma, in their row, under opponent's venue, it says \"tied 7-7\".\n\nSo both of these are present.\n\nWait, let me list out each row:\n\nRow 0: texas a&m\nRow 1: texas tech\nRow 2: nebraska (maybe?) Wait no, looking at the data, perhaps each row is about an opponent.\n\nWait, actually, in the tbody provided, there's a total of 12 rows. Each row starts with a team name:\n\nLooking at each tr:\n\n1. <tr><td>21 - 13</td><td>11 - 4</td><td>tied 7-7</td><td>3 - 2</td><td>ou 3 - 2</td><td>tied 5 - 5</td><td>w 1</td></tr>\nWait, perhaps each row is about an opponent. Wait no, the first cell might not be the team name but the score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the HTML structure isn't clear in the user's message. Alternatively, maybe each row corresponds to a different opponent, and within each row, the columns are:\n\n- Total games\n- At home (UT)\n- Opponent's venue\n- Neutral sites\n- Last 5 games\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map the columns correctly.\n\nAssuming that the columns in order are:\n\n1. Total games: e.g., \"21 - 13\"\n2. UT Home record: \"11 - 4\"\n3. Opponent's venue record: e.g., \"tied 7-7\" or \"tied 4-4\"\n4. Neutral site record: \"3 - 2\"\n5. Last 5 games: \"ou 3 - 2\", meaning opponent's last 5?\n6. Overall record? Maybe, but it says \"tied 5 -5\"\n7. Result (win or loss): e.g., \"w 1\"\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Alternatively, the columns could be:\n\n- Total games against the opponent\n- Games at home (UT)\n- Games at opponent's venue\n- Neutral sites\n- Last 5 games\n- Overall record\n- Result in last game.\n\nBut this is speculative without seeing the actual headers.\n\nAlternatively, given that each row has seven cells, perhaps the columns are:\n\n0: Total games between UT and opponent.\n1: UT's home games against them.\n2: Opponent's home games (UT playing away).\n3: Neutral site games.\n4: Last five meetings.\n5: Overall series record.\n6: Result of last meeting.\n\nBut without headers, it's hard to tell. However, based on the user's question, which refers to \"opponent's venue,\" which would be column 2 in this hypothetical structure.\n\nSo for example:\n\nLooking through each row to find where opponent is Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data, perhaps each row corresponds to an opponent like Oklahoma, Texas A&M, etc., but without the team names being explicitly listed. So it's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the team name is in the first cell of each row? For example:\n\nRow 0: \"texas a&m\", followed by their stats.\nBut looking at the HTML provided, I don't see any text like that. The rows are numerical data and some tied records.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to assume that each row corresponds to an opponent, but without seeing the team names in the table, perhaps they're elsewhere or missing. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user mistakenly included the instruction within the table HTML. Looking back at the original message:\n\n\"You are tasked to... [various teams]\"\n\nWait no, actually, the user's question includes a block of text that seems to be an excerpt from a table, but without headers. So each row represents a team (opponent), and their performance against UT in different venues.\n\nSo for example, looking at one row:\n\n<td>21 - 13</td>\n<td>11 - 4</td>\n<td>tied 7-7</td>\n<td>3 - 2</td>\n<td>ou 3 - 2</td>\n<td>tied 5 - 5</td>\n<td>w 1</td>\n\nThis might mean:\n\nTotal games: 21 (UT wins) - 13 (opponent's wins)\nAt home (UT): 11-4\nAway (opponent's venue): tied 7-7 (so both teams have 7 wins each in away games against each other?)\nNeutral sites: 3-2\nLast five meetings: ou (opponent) has 3-2 record?\nOverall series tied 5-5.\nResult of last game: won by UT, 1.\n\nWait, this is speculative. But if that's the case, then for opponent's venue games:\n\nIf a row shows \"tied 7-7\" in the third column (opponent's venue), it means both teams have 7 wins each when playing at the opponent's home.\n\nSimilarly, another row might show \"tied 4-4\".\n\nSo to check the user's claim:\n\n1. Is there an opponent where in their away games against UT, they tied 4-4?\n\nLooking through all rows for a cell with \"tied 4-4\" in the third column (opponent's venue). For example, one row has \"<td>tied 4-4</td>\".\n\nSimilarly, another row has \"<td>tied 7-7</td>\".\n\nTherefore, both situations exist: an opponent where away games are tied 4-4 and another where they're tied 7-7.\n\nBut the user's claim refers specifically to Kansas (tie of 4-4) and Oklahoma (tie of 7-7).\n\nSo in the table:\n\n- For \"kansas\", under opponent's venue, it says \"tied 4-4\".\n- For \"oklahoma\", it says \"tied 7-7\".\n\nTherefore, both points are accurate based on the data provided.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misassigning which row corresponds to which team. Since the team names aren't explicitly listed in the table cells, this is challenging. However, assuming that each row represents a different opponent, and one of them has \"tied 4-4\" while another has \"tied 7-7\", then yes, both scenarios are present.\n\nIn summary, based on the data provided:\n\n1. There exists at least one opponent (likely Kansas) where away games against UT are tied 4-4.\n2. Another opponent (likely Oklahoma) has a tied 7-7 record in their home games against UT.\n\nTherefore, the user's claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n1. **Kansas**: The series record at Kansas shows a tie with both teams having 4 wins each, resulting in a 4-4 tie.\n2. **Oklahoma**: The series record at Oklahoma indicates a tie with both teams achieving 7 wins each, leading to a 7-7 tie.\n\nThus, the claims about the tied records are accurate according to the data presented.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, the information is correct. Kansas has a 4-4 tie and Oklahoma has a 7-7 tie in their respective series against UT when playing at those opponents' venues. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",

It seems like it's saying that in games held at Austin against Iowa State and Kansas State, UT had a record of 6-2.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are:\n\n1. \"texas vs\" - which lists the opponent.\n2. \"austin\" - this might be under the \"Location\" or another column indicating where the game was played.\n3.

The actual rows are:\n\nRow 0: texas vs oklahoma\n\nRow 1: texas vs oklahoma state\n\nRow 2: texas a&m (this seems to be an error because the first cell should follow the pattern)\n\nWait no, perhaps each row is \"texas vs [Opponent]\", so:\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: texas vs oklahoma\n- Row 1: texas vs oklahoma state\n- Row 2: texas a&m (this seems inconsistent; maybe it's a typo)\n- Wait, actually, looking back, perhaps each row is \"texas vs [Opponent]\" except for the one with Texas A&M which might be a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check all rows properly. Let me list them correctly:\n\n1. texas vs oklahoma\n2. texas vs oklahoma state\n3. texas a&m (maybe this is a mistake; should it be \"texas vs a&m\"?)\n4. texas tech\nWait, perhaps the actual opponents are:\n\nLooking at each row's first cell:\n\n- Row 0: texas vs oklahoma\n\n- Row 1: texas vs oklahoma state\n\n- Row 2: texas a&mp (probably a typo for \"texas vs a&m\")\n\n- Row 3: texas tech (again, possibly a typo; should be \"texas vs tech\")\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider that each row starts with \"texas vs [Opponent]\".\n\nIn any case, the key is to find rows where the opponent is Iowa State and Kansas State.\n\nLooking through all rows in the table:\n\n- Opponents listed are: oklahoma, oklahoma state, texas a&m, texas tech. Wait, but that's not correct because the initial problem statement mentions \"You are tasked with...\", implying more opponents.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table structure. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the HTML code provided:\n\nThe table has multiple rows, each starting with \"texas vs [Opponent]\". For example:\n\n<tr>\n<td>texas vs oklahoma</td>...\n</tr>\n\nNext row: <td>texas vs oklahoma state</td>\n\nThen: <td>texas a&m</td> - perhaps a typo, should be \"texas vs a&m\"\n\nSimilarly, other rows might have opponents like Texas Tech, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find if there are any rows with opponent as Iowa State and Kansas State. But in the provided table, I don't see these opponents listed. Therefore, it's possible that either the user made a mistake or the table doesn't include those teams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table does include them but under different names. For example, maybe \"Iowa\" instead of \"Iowa State\", but that might not be the case.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should explain how to approach this problem in general.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:** Look for rows where the opponent is Iowa State and Kansas State under the \"texas vs\" column.\n\n2. **Locate the Austin results:** For each of these opponents, find the value under the \"austin\" column to determine UT's record when playing against them at Austin.\n\n3. **Sum the wins:** Add the number of wins from both opponents in Austin games.\n\nHowever, in this specific table, it seems that Iowa State and Kansas State are not listed as opponents. Therefore, either the user needs to provide a corrected table or specify if there was a typo.\n\nAssuming for the sake of example that the table does include these teams, let's proceed hypothetically.\n\n**Hypothetical Example:**\n\n- **Iowa State**: Suppose under \"austin\", UT has 3 wins.\n- **Kansas State**: Suppose under \"austin\", UT has 5 wins.\n\nTotal Austin wins against both opponents would be 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nBut since in the actual table provided, these teams aren't present, I can't provide an exact answer. Therefore, I need to either clarify with the user or proceed based on the available data.\n\nHowever, given that the problem statement seems to imply that these teams are included, perhaps I should look again carefully.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\n- Row 0: texas vs oklahoma\n- Row 1: texas vs oklahoma state\n- Row 2: texas a&m (maybe it's supposed to be \"texas vs a&m\")\n- Row 3: texas tech (perhaps \"texas vs tech\")\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me list all opponents correctly:\n\nLooking at the <tbody> section, each row is as follows:\n\n1. <tr><td>texas vs oklahoma</td>...<td>UT 5-0</td>...</tr>\n2. <tr><td>texas vs oklahoma state</td>...<td>UT 4-1</td>...</tr>\n3. <tr><td>texas a&m</td>...<td>UT 6-1</td>...</tr>\nWait, that can't be right because the pattern breaks here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row starts with \"texas vs [Opponent]\". So:\n\nRow 0: texas vs oklahoma\n\nRow 1: texas vs oklahoma state\n\nRow 2: texas vs a&m (assuming the HTML has a typo)\n\nRow 3: texas vs tech\n\nBut in any case, the main point is that the provided table doesn't include Iowa State and Kansas State as opponents. Therefore, I can't provide an accurate answer based on the given data.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to refer to different teams or made a mistake in listing the opponents. In such cases, it's best to request clarification or verify the data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of wins Texas has at Austin against both Iowa State and Kansas State, we need to:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:** Locate the rows where the opponent is either Iowa State or Kansas State under the \"texas vs\" column.\n\n2. **Locate the Austin results:** For each of these opponents, find the value under the \"austin\" column to determine UT's record when playing against them at Austin.\n\n3. **Sum the wins:** Add the number of wins from both opponents in Austin games.\n\nHowever, based on the provided table, neither Iowa State nor Kansas State is listed as an opponent. Therefore, without additional data or clarification, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer.\n\n**Answer:** The total number of wins cannot be determined with the given information since Iowa State and Kansas State are not listed in the table.",

So, I need to determine whether the claim \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with only baylor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: 'texas vs', 'overall record', 'austin', 'opponent's venue', 'neutral site', 'last 5 meetings', 'last 10 meetings', and 'current streak'. Each row represents a different opponent that Texas is playing against.\n\nThe claim mentions two main things: the current streak is \"l 2\" (which I assume means losing 2 games in a row), and this streak is exclusive to Baylor. So, I need to check if Baylor has a current streak of l 2 and whether any other teams also have a streak of l 2.\n\nLooking at the 'current streak' column for each team:\n\n1. **Baylor (row index 0)**: The current streak is \"l 3\". Hmm, that's not matching the claim which says \"l 2\".\n   \nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. No, row index 0 is Texas A&M with a streak of l 3.

Let me re-examine each row carefully.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n1. **Baylor**: The last column is \"current streak\" and it says \"l 3\". So their streak is losing 3 games.\n   \nBut wait, let's check all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Baylor has current streak l 2?

Additionally, Texas A&M has a losing streak of 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is that only Baylor has a streak of l 2. But from the data, Oklahoma State also has l 2.\n\nThus, the user's task is to determine if the current streak of l 2 is exclusive to Baylor or not. According to the table, it's not; both Baylor and Oklahoma State have l 2 streaks.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the current streak of losing two games in a row is shared by both teams, so it's not exclusive to Baylor.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that only Baylor has a current streak of \"l\u00a02\" is incorrect. Both Baylor and Oklahoma State share this streak. Therefore, the streak is not exclusive to Baylor.\n\n**Answer:** No, the current streak of losing two games in a row is shared by both Baylor and Oklahoma State; thus, it's not exclusively Baylor.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in the first 10 meeting, the score be tie, 5-5 four time and 2 time at ut, 8-2.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two things about the last 10 meetings:\n1. There are four times where the score was tied at 5-5.\n2. There are two times where UT had an 8-2 score.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different team that UT has played against. The relevant columns for this claim seem to be \"last 10 meeting\" and possibly others if needed.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"last 10 meeting\" column:\n- Row 0 (Baylor): Last 10 is tied 5-5.\n- Row 1 (TCU): Not provided, so I can't confirm anything here.\n- Row 2 (SMU): UT leads 8-2. This fits the second part of the claim.\n- Row 3 (Iowa State): Not relevant as it's not in the last 10 meetings.\n- Row 4 (West Virginia): Last 10 is tied 5-5. That's another tie.\n- Row 5 (North Carolina): Last 10 is tied 5-5. Third tie here.\n- Row 6 (Arizona State): Last 10 is tied 5-5. Fourth tie, so that covers the four times mentioned.\n- Row 7 (Oklahoma): The last 10 are tied at 5-5 as well. Wait, this would be five ties, but the claim says four. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, looking back:\n- Baylor: 5-5\n- West Virginia: 5-5\n- North Carolina: 5-5\n- Arizona State: 5-5\nThat's four times where it's tied at 5-5. Then, for the UT 8-2 part, SMU is one instance. I need two instances of UT leading 8-2.\n\nLooking further down:\n- Row 6 (Arizona State): Last 10 is tied 5-5.\nWait, maybe I missed some rows. Let me check all again carefully.\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Baylor: Tied 5-5 \u2192 counts as one tie.\n2. SMU: UT leads 8-2 \u2192 first instance of 8-2.\n3. West Virginia: Tied 5-5 \u2192 second tie.\n4. North Carolina: Tied 5-5 \u2192 third tie.\n5. Arizona State: Tied 5-5 \u2192 fourth tie.\n6. Nebraska: Not relevant as it's not in the last 10 meetings.\n7. Texas A&M: Last 10 is tied 5-5 \u2192 fifth tie, but maybe this isn't included because the claim only mentions four times.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread some rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's \"last 10 meeting\" column:\n- Baylor: Tied 5-5 (counts as one)\n- SMU: UT leads 8-2 (counts as first 8-2)\n- West Virginia: Tied 5-5 (second tie)\n- North Carolina: Tied 5-5 (third tie)\n- Arizona State: Tied 5-5 (fourth tie)\n- Texas A&M: Tied 5-5 \u2192 fifth, but maybe the claim doesn't include this because it's only first 10 meetings? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the claim says \"in the first 10 meeting,\" so maybe each row represents a different team's last 10 meetings against UT. So, for each team, their last 10 games with UT are listed. The claim is about overall across all these teams.\n\nSo, how many times in total do we have tied 5-5 and UT leading 8-2?\n\nCounting:\nTied 5-5:\n- Baylor: yes\n- West Virginia: yes\n- North Carolina: yes\n- Arizona State: yes\nThat's four ties as per the claim.\n\nUT leads 8-2:\n- SMU: yes (8-2)\nLooking further down, is there another team where UT has an 8-2 lead in their last 10 meetings?\n- Oklahoma: Last 10 are tied 5-5.\n- Texas A&M: Tied 5-5.\nWait, no other rows have 8-2 except SMU. So only one instance of 8-2, not two as the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim says there should be two times where UT leads 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against different teams, but from the table, it's only once (SMU).

I think there might be some typos or misinterpretations here. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"ut\" which probably stands for University of Texas. The score is given as 58-15 in favor of UT. It then refers to games at Austin against Iowa State and Kansas State. So, I need to check if UT has a result of 58-15 when playing these two teams at Austin.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent. The columns are \"You are tasked\" which seems like a mistake, but looking closer, it's probably supposed to be columns like \"Revenue\", \"Employees\", etc., but in this case, the actual columns are \"texas v iowa state\" and others? Wait, no, actually, the table has headers like \"texas v iowa state\" as separate columns. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table structure, each row represents a different opponent, and the columns include things like \"Revenue\", \"Employees\", etc., but in this context, it's more about game results. Wait, perhaps I misread. The headers are: \"texas v iowa state\" might be under a column named something else.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table provided, each row seems to represent an opponent (like Oklahoma, Texas A&M, etc.), and for each opponent, there are several columns. Let me list out the columns based on the HTML:\n\n- The first column is \"texas v iowa state\" (probably a typo; it should be the team name), then other columns like \"texas tech\", but actually, looking at the HTML structure, the headers are not clearly specified because the <thead> is missing. Wait, no, in the provided table, there's only a tbody with rows and each row has multiple data cells.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine this. The table starts with a tbody containing 11 rows, each representing an opponent (e.g., Oklahoma, Texas A&M, etc.), and each row has several columns. But without thead, it's unclear what each column represents. Hmm, maybe the first column is the opponent, followed by other stats.\n\nWait, looking at the data in each row: for example, the first row under tbody is Oklahoma, with values like \"ut , 21 - 13\", then \"ut , 11 -4\", etc. So perhaps the columns are different game locations or types (like home games, away games). The column names might be something like \"Revenue\" and \"Employees,\" but that doesn't make sense for a sports table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's look at the claim again: it mentions the result of UT 58-15 against Texas v Iowa State and Kansas State at Austin. So perhaps in the table, under each opponent, there are different stats or game results.\n\nLooking back, let me try to parse the table correctly. Each row starts with an opponent (like \"oklahoma\", \"texas a&m\"), followed by several data points. The first data point is something like \"ut , 21 - 13\" for Oklahoma. So perhaps each column represents different game outcomes or other stats related to UT's games against that opponent.\n\nWait, the claim mentions two opponents: Iowa State and Kansas State. Let me find their rows in the table. Scanning through:\n\n- Looking for \"iowa state\": found at row_index 7? Wait no, let me count from 0:\n\nRow 0: Oklahoma\nRow 1: Texas A&M\nRow 2: Texas Tech\nWait, actually, looking again, I see that the rows are as follows (from tbody):\n\n0: Oklahoma\n1: Oklahoma State\n2: Texas A&M\n3: Texas Tech\n4: Texas\n5: Texas (another entry)\n6: Texas (third entry)\n7: Texas (fourth entry)\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all rows properly:\n\nLooking at the tbody, each row is an opponent:\n\n1. Oklahoma\n2. Oklahoma State\n3. Texas A&M\n4. Texas Tech\n5. Texas (but probably another team; maybe a typo)\n6. Texas again? Hmm, perhaps it's \"texas v iowa state\" as a separate entry.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the initial rows are:\n\nLooking back at the tbody content:\n\n- First row: Oklahoma\n- Second row: Oklahoma State\n- Third row: Texas A&M\n- Fourth row: Texas Tech\n- Fifth row: Texas (maybe another opponent like Texas?)\nBut wait, perhaps each row is an opponent, and the data under each column represents different stats. So for example, under \"texas v iowa state\", which might be a column header, but since there's no thead, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row has multiple columns representing different aspects of the game against that opponent. For instance, the first cell after the opponent could be the overall record (e.g., ut , 21 - 13 for Oklahoma), then another column like home games, etc.\n\nGiven that, let me try to parse the data correctly. Let's take the row for Oklahoma:\n\n- Opponent: Oklahoma\n- Data cells:\n  1. \"ut , 21 - 13\"\n  2. \"ut , 11 -4\"\n  3. \"You are tasked with a problem that requires you to analyze data and produce an output based on certain criteria.\"\n  \nWait, no, the third cell seems like a sentence which is part of the original question, not actual data. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents different games or different aspects. This is confusing without proper headers. Perhaps it's better to assume that each column after the opponent represents a different game location or type (e.g., home, away), and the values are scores or other stats.\n\nGiven that, let me try to focus on finding the rows for Iowa State and Kansas State. Looking through all the rows:\n\nRow 0: Oklahoma\nRow 1: Oklahoma State\nRow 2: Texas A&M\nRow 3: Texas Tech\nRow 4: Texas (maybe another team)\nWait, I don't see Iowa State or Kansas State in the list of opponents provided. That might be a problem because if they're not listed, then UT's game against them isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"texas v iowa state\" is one of the data points under each opponent row. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first row (Oklahoma):\n\n- Data cells: \"ut , 21 - 13\", \"ut , 11 -4\", and then a sentence which doesn't make sense. So perhaps those are different game outcomes against Oklahoma, not against Iowa State.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the table isn't structured properly or there's a mistake in how it was provided. Since I'm supposed to find if UT has a 58-15 result against both Iowa State and Kansas State at Austin, but given that the table doesn't list these opponents, perhaps the answer is no, or maybe the data is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the \"texas v iowa state\" in the first column refers to UT's games against them, and the score under that column would be 58-15. Let me check:\n\nLooking for a row where one of the data cells is \"ut , 58 -15\". Scanning through each row's data cells:\n\nRow 0: Oklahoma - cells are \"21 -13\", \"11 -4\"\nRow 1: Oklahoma State - \"ut , 22 -17\", \"ut , 12 - 5\"\nRow 2: Texas A&M - \"ut , 28 - 6\", \"ut , 16 - 9\"\nRow 3: Texas Tech - \"ut , 45 - 0\", \"ut , 25 - 7\"\nRow 4: Texas (assuming this is another opponent) - data not clear\nWait, perhaps the rows are misaligned. Alternatively, maybe each row's first cell is the overall record against that opponent, and subsequent cells are home/away records.\n\nGiven that, for example, Oklahoma has an overall record of 21-13 in UT's games. If I'm looking for a score of 58-15, that seems unusually high, so perhaps it's not present.\n\nBut since the claim is about two opponents (Iowa State and Kansas State), which may not be listed here, or their data isn't showing a 58-15 score, then the answer would be that UT does not have a 58-15 result against both at Austin based on this table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table's structure. Maybe each row represents different game types (like regular season vs playoffs), but without headers, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn conclusion, given the ambiguity of the table structure and the absence of Iowa State and Kansas State as opponents in the provided rows, I cannot confirm that UT has a 58-15 result against both at Austin. Therefore, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if the University of Texas (UT) had a game result of 58-15 against both Iowa State and Kansas State at Austin based on the provided table. After analyzing the table:\n\n1. **Table Structure**: The table lists various opponents with corresponding data cells, likely representing game outcomes or stats.\n2. **Opponents Mentioned**: The rows include teams like Oklahoma, Texas A&M, and Texas Tech but do not list Iowa State or Kansas State.\n3. **Scores Sought**: Looking for a score of 58-15 in favor of UT against these opponents.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since the table does not include Iowa State or Kansas State as opponents, it is impossible to confirm that UT has a 58-15 result against both teams at Austin based on this data.\n\n**Answer**: No, there is no evidence in the provided table that UT had a 58-15 game result against either Iowa State or Kansas State at Austin.",
