    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim step by step using the provided table. The claim is: \"the season 2010-11 detail have a title of 47th and the runner-up be waseda.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the context of the table.\n\n1. **Season 2010-11**: This likely corresponds to the year or season details listed in the \"season\" column of the table.\n   \n2. **Title of 47th**: This probably means that the row corresponding to season 2010-11 is labeled as the 47th title.\n\n3. **Runner-up be waseda**: The runner-up for that season should be Waseda University, which would mean looking at the \"runner-up\" column in the relevant row.\n\nNow, I'll go through each step:\n\n**Step 1: Locate the row with season 2010-11**\n\nLooking at the table, I scan the rows to find where the \"season\" is listed as 2010-11. Scanning down, I see that in row 46 (assuming the first data row after headers is index 0), the season is 2010-11.\n\n**Step 2: Check the title number**\n\nIn the same row, the \"title\" column should indicate if it's the 47th. From the table, I see that for row 46 (season 2010-11), the title is listed as 47th. This matches the claim.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the runner-up**\n\nNext, check the \"runner-up\" column in this same row to confirm if it's Waseda. The table shows that for season 2010-11 (row 46), the runner-up is indeed Waseda. This part of the claim also holds true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied with the data from row 46. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify a claim using the provided table. The claim states: \"meiji win the 32nd title, while waseda be the runner-up.\" I'll need to check if Meiji University won their 32nd championship and if Waseda was the runner-up in that same event.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to the 32nd title. Looking at the table, each row represents a different edition of the championship, starting from the 1st up to the 49th. The row index starts at 0 for the first row. So, the 32nd title would be in row index 31 (since we start counting from 0). \n\nLooking at row index 31, the \"Champion\" column shows \"meiji,\" which matches the claim that Meiji won the title. The \"Runner-up\" column for the same row is \"waseda,\" aligning with the claim that Waseda was the runner-up.\n\nTo ensure there are no discrepancies, I'll cross-reference other columns. The \"Year\" and \"Opponent\" columns don't directly impact this specific claim about who won or lost, so they aren't necessary for verification here. However, all data points in row 31 support the claim without any contradictions.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"at the national stadium tokyo venue, during season 1995-6 detail, the title be 32nd and the runner up be waseda.\" I need to check if this claim is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: Season, Titleholder, Runner-up, Host Venue, and Attendance. The rows are indexed from 0 onwards, each representing a different season's data.\n\nThe claim mentions the venue as \"national stadium tokyo,\" which matches the \"Host Venue\" column in the table. So, I need to find the row where the Host Venue is \"national stadium tokyo.\" Looking through the table, every row under Host Venue says \"national stadium tokyo,\" so that doesn't narrow it down much.\n\nNext, the season mentioned is 1995-6 detail. In the table, each row's Season column has values like \"1995 -6 details,\" \"1996 -7 details,\" etc. So I'm looking for the row with \"Season\" equal to \"1995 -6 details.\" Scanning through, I find that at row index 30 (assuming rows start from 0), the Season is \"1995 -6 detail.\"\n\nNow, checking the claim: it states the title was 32nd and the runner-up was Waseda. In the table, each season has a Titleholder and Runner-up. For row 30, I need to see what these columns say.\n\nLooking at the Titleholder for that row, it's \"waseda,\" but wait\u2014that doesn't seem right because if the title is supposed to be 32nd, then the runner-up being Waseda might not align. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The claim says the title (champion) is 32nd and the runner-up is Waseda. So in the table, for Season \"1995 -6 detail,\" Titleholder should be whoever won that season, which according to row 30 is \"waseda.\" But the claim says the title is 32nd, implying that the champion was the 32nd team or perhaps the ranking. However, in the table, it's a specific university name, not a numerical rank.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The table lists universities as Titleholder and Runner-up, not numerical rankings. So maybe \"32nd\" refers to the season being the 32nd occurrence? Let me check how the seasons are indexed in the table. Each row has a Season column with incremental years, but the numbering doesn't directly correlate to a \"32nd\" title. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is misphrased, and it's referring to the 32nd match or event.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"32nd\" refers to the ranking of the team that won. But in the table, the Titleholder is always a university name, not a numerical rank. So if the claim says the title was held by the 32nd (implying a specific rank), but the table shows \"waseda,\" which doesn't match, then this part might be false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's re-express the claim: during the 1995-6 season at the National Stadium Tokyo, the champion was number 32 and the runner-up was Waseda. But looking at row 30 (Season \"1995 -6 detail\"), the Titleholder is \"waseda\" and Runner-up is \"tokyo.\" So if the claim says the title holder was 32nd, that doesn't match because it's listed as \"waseda.\" Therefore, this part of the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the row indices. Let me recount: starting from Season \"1985 -6 details\" at row 0 up to the later seasons. If row 30 is indeed Season \"1995-6,\" then Titleholder is \"waseda.\" So according to the claim, the champion should be 32nd, but it's actually Waseda. Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nHowever, the Runner-up in row 30 is \"tokyo,\" not \"waseda\" as the claim states. Wait, that can't be right because if the Titleholder is Waseda and Runner-up is Tokyo, then the claim says Runner-up is Waseda, which contradicts. So both parts of the claim are incorrect based on row 30.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct row. Let me check again: Season \"1995-6 detail\" should be somewhere around row 10 or so because each row increments by one year. Wait, no, looking at the table structure, it starts with \"1985 -6 details,\" then each subsequent row increases the season by one year. So 1985-6 is row 0, 1986-7 is row 1, and so on. Therefore, Season \"1995-6 detail\" would be at row (1995 -1985) = 10 years later, so row 10.\n\nWait, let me count: from 1985-6 as row 0, then 1986-7 is row 1, ..., up to 1995-6 being row 10. So row 10 has Season \"1995 -6 detail.\" Now checking that row: Titleholder is \"tokyo,\" and Runner-up is \"waseda.\" So the claim says during this season, the title was held by 32nd (which doesn't match; it's Tokyo) and runner-up was Waseda. Wait, but in row 10, the Titleholder is Tokyo, and Runner-up is Waseda. So the claim says the runner-up was Waseda, which matches, but the title holder was supposed to be 32nd, not Tokyo.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially correct: the runner-up was indeed Waseda, but the title holder was Tokyo, not 32nd. Hence, the claim isn't fully accurate because it incorrectly states the champion as 32nd when it's actually Tokyo.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is only partially supported by the table. The runner-up being Waseda is correct, but the titleholder was Tokyo, not 32nd. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false because during the 1995-6 season at National Stadium Tokyo, Waseda was the runner-up, but the titleholder was Tokyo, not 32nd.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"during season 2000 - 1 , kanto gakuin university be the winner , the title be 37th and the attendance be not available.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nThe first part mentions the season 2000-1. I think this refers to a specific row in the table where the Season column has that value. Looking through the table, I see rows with Seasons like \"2000 - 1\" and so on. \n\nNext, the claim states that Kanto Gakuin University is the winner during that season. So I need to find the row where the Winner column is \"kanto gakuin university\". Let me scan through the Winner column.\n\nI'm looking for a row where both Season is 2000-1 and Winner is Kanto Gakuin University. Let's see... The first few rows have Winners like Keio, Teikyo, Tenri, etc., but I don't immediately recall seeing Kanto Gakuin in the early seasons. Maybe it's later on.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. Starting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Season \"1998 - 99\", Winner \"keio\" \u2013 no.\nRow 1: \"1999 - 2000\" \u2013 Winner \"teikyo\".\nRow 2: \"2000 - 1\" \u2013 Winner \"kanto gakuin university\". Oh, that's the one. So row index is 3 (since counting starts at 0) or wait, let me count again.\n\nWait no, I think in the table provided, the first row after the header is Season \"1998 - 99\", which would be row 0. Then each subsequent row increments. Let's check:\n\nRow index: Looking for Season \"2000 - 1\". Let me list them:\n\nLooking at the Seasons:\n- 1998 - 99 (row 0)\n- 1999 - 2000 (row 1)\n- 2000 - 1 (row 2)\nWait, wait. I think I'm getting confused because in the table provided earlier, the seasons go up to 2012-13, but perhaps the numbering is off. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: Season \"1998 - 99\"\nRow 1: \"1999 - 2000\"\nRow 2: \"2000 - 1\"\nYes, so row index 2 has the season 2000-1.\n\nIn that row, the Winner is indeed Kanto Gakuin University. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, the title being 37th. The Title column in the table indicates the edition number. For example, the first row (Season \"1998 - 99\") has Title as 1st. So each subsequent season increments the title number. Let's see: if row index 2 is Season \"2000-1\", then the previous two seasons would be rows 0 and 1.\n\nRow 0: Season \"1998-99\" \u2013 Title 1st\nRow 1: \"1999-2000\" \u2013 Title 2nd\nRow 2: \"2000-1\" \u2013 Title 3rd? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the numbering is off.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table provided, each row's Title seems to be sequential, starting from 1st and going up. But in the given data, I think the Titles start much higher. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the later rows, for example, row index 34 (Season \"2007 - 8\") has a Title of 44th. Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the Title column represents the number of the edition in sequence, regardless of the season.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row corresponds to an annual championship, so the Title increments by one each year.\n\nSo if Season \"2000-1\" is the third season (since 1998-99 was first), then its title would be 3rd. But in the claim, it's stated as 37th. That seems way off. So perhaps my initial understanding of the table is wrong.\n\nWait, looking at the data again: The table starts with Season \"1998 - 99\" and Title \"1st\", then next season has Title \"2nd\", etc., up to Season \"2012-13\" which would be Title \"45th\". But in the claim, it's referring to the title as 37th. So perhaps I need to find a row where the Title is 37th.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the titles are numbered. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table data, for example, Season \"2012-13\" has Title \"45th\". But in our case, we're looking for a title of 37th. So perhaps it's an older championship.\n\nWait, but according to the claim, the season is 2000-1 and the title is 37th. Let me think: if each year increments the title by one, starting from 1998 as 1st, then 1999 would be 2nd, 2000 would be 3rd, etc., but that would mean 2000-1 is only the third edition. So a title of 37th doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the data again, it's possible that each row represents an annual championship, starting from a certain year. The first row is Season \"1998 - 99\", Title 1st; next is \"1999-2000\", Title 2nd; then \"2000-1\" (row index 2) as Title 3rd, etc.\n\nSo if that's the case, the claim states that in Season 2000-1, which would be row index 2, the title is 37th. But according to this structure, it should be the third title. So there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Title\" refers not to the edition number but to something else. Let me check the table headers again: Season, Title, Winner, Runner-up, Attendance, Venue, Date. So Title is likely the edition or number of that particular championship.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Perhaps the seasons are listed in order, and each has an incremental title. For example:\n\n- 1998-99: 1st\n- 1999-2000: 2nd\n- 2000-1: 3rd\n...\nSo to reach Title 37th, we need a much later season. But according to the claim, it's in Season 2000-1. That doesn't align because 2000-1 would only be the third edition.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me list out the Titles and their corresponding Seasons:\n\nRow 0: 1998-99 \u2013 1st\nRow 1: 1999-2000 \u2013 2nd\nRow 2: 2000-1 \u2013 3rd\n...\nContinuing this way, each row increments the Title by one. So to get to Title 37th, we would need a season that's much later.\n\nBut according to the claim, it's in Season 2000-1, which is only the third edition. Therefore, the claim must be incorrect because the title cannot be 37th if the season is so early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the Titles are assigned. Maybe each year has multiple titles or something else. Alternatively, maybe the table's data starts from a later point, and Title refers to the overall number in a different context.\n\nWait, looking at the data provided earlier, it seems that the earliest season is 1998-99 with Title 1st, then each subsequent year increments by one. So if Season \"2000-1\" is row index 2, its title would be 3rd, not 37th.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement about the title being 37th is incorrect because in the table, that season corresponds to Title 3rd, not 37th. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, checking the Attendance column for Season \"2000-1\" (row index 2), it shows \"not available\", which aligns with the claim stating attendance was not available.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the title number being incorrect. Therefore, despite the winner and attendance parts matching, the title number does not match the claim.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table, it's possible that each row after the header represents an annual championship starting from 1998-99 as the first edition. So if Season \"2000-1\" is the third edition (Title 3rd), then a title of 37th would be much later.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting what the Title refers to. Maybe it's not the edition number but something else, like the tournament name or category. But according to the context, it seems more likely that Title is the edition number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is a list of champions for each year, and the Title column indicates how many times a particular team has won. For example, if a team wins multiple times, their title count increases.\n\nBut in this case, the claim refers to the championship's title as 37th, which would imply that it's the 37th time someone won that tournament. However, given that the earliest entry is only the first edition (1998-99), getting to 37 titles would require many years beyond what's listed.\n\nBut according to the claim, it's in Season 2000-1, which can't be both the third and 37th title. Therefore, this inconsistency means the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe user provided a table of champions from 1998-99 to 2012-13, with each row having Season, Title, Winner, Runner-up, etc. Each Season has an incremental Title starting at 1st.\n\nTherefore, in the Season \"2000-1\", which is three years after 1998, the Title should be 3rd. So if the claim says that in that season, the title was 37th, it's incorrect.\n\nThus, despite the winner and attendance parts matching (Winner: Team C, Attendance: Not available), the Title number is wrong. Therefore, the claim as a whole is false because not all parts are correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim contains inaccuracies regarding the championship details for Season \"2000-1\". While the winner is correctly identified as Team C and attendance information is indeed marked as \"not available\", the title number stated in the claim (37th) does not align with the data provided. According to the table, Season \"2000-1\" corresponds to the 3rd edition of the championship, not the 37th. Therefore, the claim is incorrect due to the mismatch in the title number.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect because the title number does not match; the season in question was actually the 3rd edition, not the 37th.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The claim is incorrect because the title number does not match.}}",

Scanning the \"Season\" column, I see that the 46th season is listed as \"2009 - 10 details\", and the 47th is \"2010 - 11 details\".

The claim states: \"meiji be the loser in the game that have a title of 32nd with hosei as the runner-up.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Game Title (Row Index):** The game referred to is the \"32nd\" one. Looking at the table structure, each row represents a different edition, indicated by the 'row_ index' starting from 0. So, the 32nd would correspond to row_index 31 because indexing starts at 0.\n\n2. **Loser (Meiji):** We need to check if Meiji is listed as the losing team in that specific game. In sports tables like this, the 'runner-up' typically denotes the second-place finisher, so Meiji would be the loser if they are the runner-up.\n\n3. **Runner-Up (Hosei):** The claim says Hosei was the runner-up. So, we need to see if in row 31, the 'runner-up' column shows Hosei.\n\nNow, let's examine the table. I'll look for the row corresponding to the 32nd edition, which is row_index 31 (since counting starts at 0). \n\nLooking at row_index 31:\n- The 'title' or edition number should be 32nd.\n- The 'runner-up' column should list Hosei.\n\nIf both conditions are met, then the claim holds.

Therefore, the claim that Meiji was the loser (runner-up) doesn't hold true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index 31, 'runner-up' to confirm Hosei's position.\n- Checking other columns for Meiji, but since it's not present, it invalidates the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because Meiji isn't listed as the runner-up in the 32nd game; instead, Hosei is the runner-up there.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, in other words, there should be a row in the table where the winner is Tenri and the runner-up (second place) is Teikyo.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: Rank, Team 1, Score, Team 2, Venue, Attendance. The key columns here are \"Team 1\" (which I assume is the winner), \"Score\", and \"Team 2\" (likely the runner-up or the opposing team).\n\nI'll go through each row to find any instance where Team 1 is Tenri and Team 2 is Teikyo, or vice versa. If there's a row where Tenri is listed as Team 1 and Teikyo as Team 2, that would mean Tenri won against Teikyo, making the claim true.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n- Rows 0 to 4: Teams are mostly Waseda, Keio, Meiji. No Tenri or Teikyo here.\n- Row 5: Tenri is mentioned as Team 2 against Tenri... Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread.\nWait, looking back, the table starts from row index 0, but in the HTML, it's rows 1 onwards because of the header. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the first data row after the header is row index 0: \"You are tasked...\", which isn't part of the game results. The actual game results start at row index 0 with Team 1 as Meiji, Team 2 as Keio.\n\nLet me recount:\n\n- Row 0: Meiji vs Keio\n- Row 1: Waseda vs Meiji\n- Row 2: Keio vs Waseda\n- ...\n- Scanning through all rows, I'm looking for any instance where the winner (Team 1) is Tenri and the runner-up (Team 2) is Teikyo.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- Row 46: Team 1 is Teikyo, Team 2 is Tokai. So Teikyo won here.\n- Row 47: Teikyo vs Waseda, but it's not clear who won based on the table structure; perhaps I need to check the score.\nWait, in row 46, the score is 14 - 13, so Teikyo (Team 1) won against Tokai (Team 2). In row 47, Teikyo vs Waseda, score 17-14, so Teikyo again as Team 1.\n\nLooking for Tenri: Scanning through all rows, I don't see Tenri listed in any of the Team 1 or Team 2 columns except maybe one instance.\n\nWait, looking at row index 48: Team 1 is Teikyo, Team 2 is Tenri. The score is 15-12, so Teikyo won against Tenri. That means in this game, Tenri was the runner-up, and Teikyo was the winner.\n\nBut the claim says \"tenri be the winner in the game that have teikyo as the runner - up.\" So according to the table, it's the opposite: Teikyo won, Tenri lost. Therefore, there's no row where Tenri is the winner with Teikyo as the runner-up.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tenri was the winner when Teikyo was the runner-up. However, examining each game result shows that whenever Teikyo participated, they were the winning team (e.g., row 46: Teikyo won against Tokai; row 47: Teikyo won against Waseda). There's no instance where Tenri is listed as the winner with Teikyo as the runner-up.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to verify the claim: \"2010 - 2011 detail be the season have kanto gakuin university as the winner, with an attendance of n/a, and a title of 37th.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are Season, Winner, Attendance, Title Number. Wait, no, looking back, actually, the columns in the table are \"Season\", \"Winner\", \"Attendance\", and \"Title Number\". Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the table structure isn't explicitly given, but based on the data shown, each row has entries for Season, Winner, Attendance, and Title. For example, the first row after the header is \"1974 - 1975 details...\", which I assume is the season, followed by \"kanto gakuin university\" as the winner, then \"n/a\" for attendance, and \"1st\" as the title number.\n\nSo, to break down the claim:\n\n1. Season: The claim mentions \"2010 - 2011 detail.\" So I'm looking for a season that matches this.\n2. Winner: It should be kanto gakuin university.\n3. Attendance: Should be n/a.\n4. Title Number: The season should be the 37th.\n\nNow, let's go through each row of the table to find where Season is \"2010 - 2011.\" \n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row indices start from 0. Let me list out the seasons and their corresponding details:\n\nRow 0: 1974 - 1975\nRow 1: 1975 - 1976\n...\nI notice that the table starts with season \"1974 - 1975\" as row 0, then each subsequent row increases by one year until 2012 - 2013 at row 49.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I think I miscounted. Let me recount to find the exact rows where the season is \"2010 - 2011.\" \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The last few rows are:\nRow 46: 2009 - 10 details\nRow 47: 2010 - 11 details\nRow 48: 2011 - 12 details\nRow 49: 2012 - 13 details\n\nWait, so row 46 is season 2009-10, row 47 is 2010-11, row 48 is 2011-12, etc. So the claim refers to 2010 - 2011, which would be row 47.\n\nNow, checking the details for row 47:\n\nSeason: 2010 - 11 details (assuming that's a typo and should be \"2010 - 2011\")\nWinner: teikyo\nAttendance: 25458\nTitle Number: 47th\n\nWait, but the claim says kanto gakuin university is the winner. Let me check if there's any other row where kanto gakuin is the winner around that time.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 36: Season 2008 - 9 details? Wait, maybe I need to recount all rows up to 47.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me list out from row 0 upwards until I find 2010-11.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n\nRow 0: 1974 - 75\n...\nRow 36: Season would be 1974 + 36 = 2010? Wait, that can't be because each season spans two years. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the seasons are in order from row 0 to 49, so each subsequent row is the next season. So:\n\nRow 0: 1974-75\nRow 1: 1975-76\n...\nEach row increments by one year. Therefore, row n corresponds to the season starting in 1974 + n.\n\nSo for row 36 (n=36), the season would be 1974 +36 = 2010? So season 2010-11 is row 36?\n\nWait, no. Because each row represents a season that starts in year Y and ends in Y+1. So for example, row 0: 1974-75 (Y=1974), row 1: 1975-76 (Y=1975), ..., so to find the season starting in 2010, which is row n where Y = 2010.\n\nSo n = 2010 - 1974 = 36. Therefore, row 36 would be 2010-11 season.\n\nBut looking at the table data provided, in the user's message, it ends with:\n\n...\nRow 46: 2009 - 10 details\nRow 47: 2010 - 11 details\nRow 48: 2011 - 12 details\nRow 49: 2012 - 13 details\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the table is not starting at 1974 but at a different year. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the data given in the user's message:\n\nThe first row after headers is:\n\n\"1974 - 1975 details kanto gakuin university n/a 1st\"\n\nThen each subsequent row increments by one year until:\n\n...\n2008 - 09 details ... 36th\n2009 - 10 details ... 37th\n2010 - 11 details ... 38th\n2011 - 12 details ... 39th\n2012 - 13 details ... 40th\n\nWait, but the user's table ends at row 49 with season 2012-13 as 40th. That doesn't make sense because 1974 to 2013 is 40 seasons.\n\nBut in any case, let's focus on finding the row where Season is 2010 - 11. Let me look through the table data:\n\nLooking at the user-provided table:\n\n...\nRow 46: \"2009 - 10 details\" ... winner: teikyo, attendance: 25458, title: 47th\nRow 47: \"2010 - 11 details\" ... winner: teikyo, attendance: 25458? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the user's table data is as follows (abbreviated):\n\n0: 1974-75 kanto gakuin n/a 1st\n...\n36: 2008-09 ... teikyo 36th?\nWait I'm getting confused. Let me look at the exact user-provided data:\n\nThe user provided a table with rows, each starting with Season details, followed by Winner, Attendance, Title.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow indices and their content:\n\nRow 0: \"1974 - 1975 details kanto gakuin university n/a 1st\"\nRow 1: \"1975 - 1976 details ... n/a 2nd\"\n...\nRow 36: \"2008 - 2009 details teikyo 36th\"\nRow 37: \"2009 - 2010 details teikyo 47th? Wait, no, the user's table shows:\n\nWait in the user's message, the table is presented as follows (extracted):\n\n\"1974 - 1975 details kanto gakuin university n/a 1st\n\n1975 - 1976 details ... n/a 2nd\n\n...\n\n2008 - 2009 details teikyo 36th\n\n2009 - 2010 details teikyo 37th\n\n2010 - 2011 details teikyo 38th\n\n2011 - 2012 details teikyo 39th\n\n2012 - 2013 details teikyo 40th\"\n\nWait, but in the user's message, it seems that starting from a certain point, all winners are teikyo. So for example:\n\nRow 36: \"2008 - 2009 details teikyo 36th\"\nRow 37: \"2009 - 2010 details teikyo 37th\"\nRow 38: \"2010 - 2011 details teikyo 38th\"\nRow 39: \"2011 - 2012 details teikyo 39th\"\nRow 40: \"2012 - 2013 details teikyo 40th\"\n\nSo the row for 2010-2011 season is Row 38, with winner teikyo, attendance 38th.\n\nWait but in any case, the key point is that according to this table, in 2010-2011 season (Season details \"2010 - 2011\"), the winner is teikyo, not kanto gakuin university. So if the task is to determine who won, it's teikyo.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to check the exact data in the user's message. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe user provided a table with rows starting from 1974-1975 up to 2012-2013, each with season details, winner, attendance, and title.\n\nLooking at the winners:\n\nFrom 1974-75: kanto gakuin university\n\nThen presumably other universities until somewhere in the 2000s when teikyo starts winning multiple times.\n\nBut according to the user's table, starting from \"2008 - 2009 details teikyo 36th\" and onwards, all winners are teikyo.\n\nSo for season \"2010 - 2011\", the winner is teikyo.\n\nThus, if the question is asking who won the 2010-2011 season based on this table, it's teikyo.\n</think>\n\nThe winner of the 2010-2011 season was Teikyo University.\n\n**Answer:** Teikyo University",
