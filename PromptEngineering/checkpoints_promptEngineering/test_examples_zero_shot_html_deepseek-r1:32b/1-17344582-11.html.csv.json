    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"with a final score of 75 - 86 , b shaw have 5 assist\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and identify the key components: the score (75-86) and B Shaw having 5 assists. I need to check if both parts are correctly represented in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'score' and 'high assists'. \n\nStarting with the score, I search the 'score' column for \"75-86\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Score is \"l 75 - 86\"\n- Rows 1 to 4 have different scores.\n\nSo, the game with a score of 75-86 is in row 0.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'high assists' for that same row. In row 0, under 'high assists', it says \"b shaw (5)\". This matches exactly with the claim: B Shaw had 5 assists in that game.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in a game with a final score of 75-86, B Shaw had 5 assists. Checking row 0 of the table confirms this information is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that for the game where the series was 1-1 (which I assume refers to the score or the series status), the location attendance was Boston Garden.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and series. So, the relevant columns here are \"series\" and \"location attendance\".\n\nI need to find the row where the series is 1-1. Scanning through the series column:\n\n- Game 1: Series is 0 - 1\n- Game 2: Series is 1 - 1\n- Game 3: Series is 2 - 1\n- Game 4: Series is 2 - 2\n- Game 5: Series is 2 - 3\n\nSo, the series becomes 1-1 in game number 2. Now, looking at that row (row index starts from 0), so game 2 would be row index 1.\n\nIn this row, under \"location attendance\", it says \"boston garden\". So the claim is that for the 1-1 series, the location was Boston Garden, which matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell is in row index 1 and column \"location attendance\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that for all games played at Boston Garden, the series record was 5 wins and 2 losses. Wait, actually, looking again, it says \"series record of 5-2\". But in sports, a series record typically refers to how many games the team has won versus lost in that particular playoff series. However, I need to check if Boston Garden is the location where these games were played and what the corresponding series records are.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five games listed. The relevant columns here are \"location attendance\" which tells us where each game was played, and \"series\", which shows the record after that game. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Location is Boston Garden, series record 0-1.\n2. Game 2: Location is Boston Garden, series record 1-1.\n3. Game 3: Location is The Palace of Auburn Hills, so not relevant here.\n4. Game 4: Location is The Palace of Auburn Hills again, so no.\n5. Game 5: Back to Boston Garden, series record 2-3.\n\nSo the games at Boston Garden are games 1, 2, and 5. Let me check their series records:\n\n- After game 1 (Boston Garden): Series is 0-1 (meaning one loss).\n- After game 2 (Boston Garden): Series is 1-1 (one win, one loss).\n- After game 5 (Boston Garden): Series is 2-3 (two wins, three losses).\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says \"have a series record of 5-2\". That seems off because in these games, the maximum series record at Boston Garden was 2-3. Also, there are only three games played at Boston Garden, not seven which would be required for a 5-2 record.\n\nSo putting it together: The claim states that all games at Boston Garden have a series record of 5-2, but in reality, the series records from those games don't add up to 5 wins. Instead, after game 5, it's 2-3, which is worse than 5-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the actual series records at Boston Garden do not reach a 5-2 mark; they are lower.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that games played at Boston Garden resulted in a series record of 5 wins and 2 losses. However, examining each game's location and corresponding series record:\n\n- Game 1: Boston Garden (0-1)\n- Game 2: Boston Garden (1-1)\n- Game 5: Boston Garden (2-3)\n\nThe series records at Boston Garden do not reach a 5-2 mark.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
