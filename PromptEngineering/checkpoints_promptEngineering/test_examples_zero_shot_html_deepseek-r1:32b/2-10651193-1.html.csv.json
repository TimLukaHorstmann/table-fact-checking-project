    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there are no players drafted from Tennessee State who have an overall rank (I assume this refers to 'overall' column) lower than 261. So, I need to check if any player from Tennessee State has a rank less than 261.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details including their school or club team and their overall rank. The relevant columns here are \"school / club team\" and \"overall\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find players from Tennessee State.\n\nRow indices start at 0. Let's check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Houston - not Tennessee State\n- Row 1: Wisconsin - nope\n- Row 2: Oklahoma - nope\n- Row 3: Kentucky - nope\n- Row 4: Colorado - nope\n- Row 5: USC - nope\n- Row 6: LSU - nope\n- Row 7: Minnesota - nope\n- Row 8: Texas A&M - nope\n- Row 9: San Diego State - nope\n- Row 10: Duke - nope\n- Row 11: Mississippi - nope\n- Row 12: Tennessee State - yes, John Henry Smith. His overall rank is 261.\n- Rows beyond that are Nebraska (Row 13) and Tulane (Row 14), which aren't relevant.\n\nWait, actually looking back, the row for John Henry Smith is at index 10? Let me recount:\n\nThe table has rows from 0 to 14. Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom the HTML, there are 15 rows in total. The player from Tennessee State is listed in the row where \"school / club team\" is Tennessee state. Looking back, that's John Henry Smith at round 10, overall 261.\n\nSo, the only player from Tennessee State has an overall rank of exactly 261. The claim states there are no players with a rank lower than 261. Since 261 is not less than itself, this means that all (and in this case, the only) players from Tennessee State have a rank equal to or higher than 261.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no player from Tennessee State with an overall rank below 261. The relevant cell is row 10, column \"school / club team\" and row 10, column \"overall\".\n\nSo, the JSON response should include these two cells as they are the ones that confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
