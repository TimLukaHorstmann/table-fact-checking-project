    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying and then verify it against the provided table.\n\nThe claim is: \"designation hd hip 4872 be send 4 year after hd 190360 be\"\n\nI think there might be some typos here. It seems like the intended meaning is that \"hip 4872 was sent 4 years after hd 190360.\" So, I'll interpret it as: \"The message for hip 4872 was sent four years after hd 190360.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the table to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- For hd 190360: The date sent is July 1, 1999.\n- For hip 4872: The date sent is July 6, 2003.\n\nCalculating the time difference between these two dates:\nFrom July 1, 1999, to July 6, 2003, is approximately four years and five days. However, if we consider just the year differences (2003 - 1999 = 4), it's about four years apart.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, hip 4872 was sent around four years after hd 190360. This seems to support the claim.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim. The key information is the \"designation hd\" and the \"date sent.\"\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row index 3: designation hd 190360 with date sent July 1, 1999.\n- Row index 4: designation hip 4872 with date sent July 6, 2003.\n\nThese are the relevant cells to check the dates and confirm the time difference. Since the calculation shows that hip 4872 was sent about four years after hd 190360, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date sent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date sent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"5 designation hds be send on july 6 , 2003 with arrival date range from april 2036 to may 2049.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It mentions that five HD designations were sent on July 6, 2003, and their arrival dates range from April 2036 to May 2049.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different designation hd with details about the constellation, date sent, arrival date, and message. The relevant columns here are \"date sent\" and \"arrival date.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see which ones were sent on July 6, 2003.\n\nRow 4: hip 4872, sent on July 6, 2003. Arrival date is April 2036.\nRow 5: hd 245409, same date sent. Arrival is August 2040.\nRow 6: hd 75732, same date sent. Arrival is May 2044.\nRow 7: hd 10307, same date sent. Arrival is September 2044.\nRow 8: hd 95128, same date sent. Arrival is May 2049.\n\nSo that's five designations (rows 4 to 8) sent on July 6, 2003.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says that \"hd 178428's arrival date is 10 years later than that of hd 190406.\" So, first, I need to find the relevant data for both HD numbers from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows with different designations. I'll start by locating \"hd 178428\" and \"hd 190406\". \n\nFor hd 178428:\n- It's in row index 2 (since counting starts from 0). The arrival date is listed as October 2067.\n\nFor hd 190406:\n- This designation is in row index 1. The arrival date here is February 2057.\n\nNow, I need to compare these two dates. The claim states that hd 178428's arrival is 10 years later than hd 190406's. Let me subtract the years: 2067 minus 2057 equals 10 years. That seems to fit.\n\nWait, but I should check if the months affect this. The claim just mentions years, so as long as the year difference is 10, regardless of the month. Since October 2067 is indeed exactly 10 years after February 2057, the time between them spans more than a decade.\n\nSo, both arrival dates are correctly captured in the table, and the difference is exactly 10 years. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that hd 178428's arrival date is 10 years later than hd 190406's.

The claim says: \"4 of the message in communication with extraterrestrial intelligence say cosmic call 1 and 5 say cosmic call 2.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The table lists different messages sent as part of projects called \"cosmic call 1\" or \"cosmic call 2\". Each row represents a different message sent on specific dates to stars in various constellations.\n\nThe claim is making two statements:\n1. There are 4 entries where the message is \"cosmic call 1\".\n2. There are 5 entries where the message is \"cosmic call 2\".\n\nI'll need to check each row of the table and count how many times each message appears.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices start from 0, as per HTML tables typically being zero-indexed.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: message is \"cosmic call 1\"\n2. Row 1: message is \"cosmic call 1\"\n3. Row 2: message is \"cosmic call 1\"\n4. Row 3: message is \"cosmic call 1\"\n5. Row 4: message is \"cosmic call 2\"\n6. Row 5: message is \"cosmic call 2\"\n7. Row 6: message is \"cosmic call 2\"\n8. Row 7: message is \"cosmic call 2\"\n9.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"hd 178428's arrival date be 10 year earlier than that of hd 190406\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where in the table each of these designations (hd 178428 and hd 190406) appear. Let's look through the rows:\n\n- The first row has hd 186408.\n- The second row is hd 190406, which is one of the designations mentioned in the claim.\n- The third row is hd 178428, the other designation in the claim.\n\nNext, I should extract their respective arrival dates from these rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"3 designation hds be send on july 6 , 2003 , with arrival date range from april 2036 to may 2044.\" I notice there might be a typo in \"be send\" which should probably be \"were sent.\" But regardless, the key points are:\n\n1. Three HD designations were sent on July 6, 2003.\n2. Their arrival dates range from April 2036 to May 2044.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure: each row has columns for designation hd, constellation, date sent, arrival date, and message. So I need to check these relevant cells for rows where \"date sent\" is July 6, 2003.\n\nLet me go through the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 4: hip 4872 - date sent is July 6, 2003. Arrival date is April 2036.\nRow 5: hd 245409 - same date sent, arrival August 2040.\nRow 6: hd 75732 - same date sent, arrival May 2044.\nRow 7: hd 10307 - same date sent, arrival September 2044. Wait, but the claim says up to May 2044. So this one is outside the range.\nRow 8: hd 95128 - same date sent, arrival May 2049. Also outside.\n\nSo from July 6, 2003, there are actually five HD designations: hip 4872, hd 245409, hd 75732, hd 10307, and hd 95128. But the claim says three. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the rows, I see that Rows 4-8 have date sent as July 6, 2003. That's five entries. So if the claim states only three were sent on that date, it's incorrect because there are actually five. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait no, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices starting from 0: Rows 4 to 8 (assuming the first row is index 0). Wait, original table has 9 rows in tbody, from index 0 to 8.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 4: sent on July 6, 2003\nRow 5: same\nRow 6: same\nRow 7: same\nRow 8: same\n\nSo that's five rows. So the claim says three, but it's actually five. Therefore, the count is wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me check the arrival dates for those five:\n\nRow4 (hip 4872): April 2036\nRow5 (hd245409): August 2040\nRow6 (hd75732): May 2044\nRow7 (hd10307): September 2044\nRow8 (hd95128): May 2049\n\nThe claim says arrival dates range from April 2036 to May 2044. So, looking at the actual arrival dates:\n\n- Earliest is April 2036 (Row4)\n- The latest within the claimed range is May 2044 (Row6). But then there's Row7: September 2044 and Row8: May 2049.\n\nSo if we consider only those sent on July 6, 2003, their arrival dates go beyond May 2044. However, the claim says \"range from april 2036 to may 2044,\" which would include up to May 2044 but not beyond.\n\nSo how many of these have arrival dates within that range?\n\nRow4: April 2036 - within\nRow5: August 2040 - within\nRow6: May 2044 - exactly the upper limit\nRows7 and 8: beyond\n\nThus, three HDs (Rows4-6) have arrival dates from April 2036 to May 2044. The other two sent on the same date go beyond that.\n\nSo, the claim says \"three designation hds were sent on July 6, 2003\" which is correct because there are three with arrival dates within that range (Rows4-6). However, there are actually five HDs sent on that date, but only three fall within the specified arrival date range.\n\nWait, no. The claim states both: three were sent on that date AND their arrival dates are in that range. So if five were sent, but only three have arrival dates within April 2036 to May 2044, then the count is correct because those three meet both criteria. The other two sent on the same date go beyond the arrival range.\n\nSo, the claim is about three HDs sent on July 6, 2003, with arrival dates in that specific range. So it's accurate for Rows4-6.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the \"date sent\" and \"arrival date\" columns for those rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date sent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"arrival date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date sent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"arrival date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date sent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"arrival date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"both hd 190406 and hd 178428 be send to the orion constellation on june 30  , 1999\".\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim carefully. It mentions two designations: hd 190406 and hd 178428. The claim states that both were sent to the Orion constellation on June 30, 1999.\n\nI'll start by looking at each part of the claim one by one.\n\n1. Checking if hd 190406 is in the table:\n   - I scan through the 'designation hd' column and find that hd 190406 is present. Let's note down its row index. Looking at the table, hd 190406 is in row 1 (since rows are zero-indexed; wait, no, actually, looking back, the first data row is index 0: hd 186408, then row 1 is hd 190406).\n\n2. Checking the constellation for hd 190406:\n   - In row 1 (hd 190406), the constellation is Sagitta, not Orion.\n\n3. Checking if hd 178428 is in the table:\n   - Yes, it's present in row 2 (since rows are zero-indexed: row 0: hd 186408, row 1: hd 190406, row 2: hd 178428).\n\n4. Checking the constellation for hd 178428:\n   - In row 2, the constellation is also Sagitta.\n\n5. Now, checking the send date for both designations:\n   - Both rows 1 and 2 have 'date sent' as June 30, 1999.\n\nBut wait, the claim says they were sent to Orion, but according to the table, both are in Sagitta. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nMoreover, looking at the 'constellation' column for any entries related to Orion:\n- Scanning through all rows, I see that hd 245409 is in the constellation Orion (row 5), but its send date is July 6, 2003. So that doesn't match June 1999.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that both designations were sent to Orion on June 30, 1999. In reality, they were sent to Sagitta on that date. \n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because hd 190406 and hd 178428 were sent to Sagitta, not Orion.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"constellation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constellation\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"all but 3 of the message in communication with extraterrestrial intelligence say cosmic call 2.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. It's a list of messages sent out, each with details like designation HD, constellation, date sent, arrival date, and the message itself. The relevant column for this claim is the \"message\" column because that's where it specifies whether it's Cosmic Call 1 or 2.\n\nThe claim mentions that all but three of these messages are Cosmic Call 2. So I need to count how many messages are Cosmic Call 2 and see if only three are not, which would mean those three are Cosmic Call 1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (index 0) has \"cosmic call 1\".\n- Second row (index 1): same as above.\n- Third row (index 2): also \"cosmic call 1\".\n- Fourth row (index 3): still \"cosmic call 1\".\n- Starting from index 4, all the way to the last row (index 8), they are \"cosmic call 2\".\n\nSo let's count:\n\nCosmic Call 1: rows 0,1,2,3. That's four messages.\nCosmic Call 2: rows 4 to 8. That's five messages.\n\nThe total number of messages is 9 (from row indices 0-8).\n\nThe claim says all but three are Cosmic Call 2. So if there are four that are not, the claim would be FALSE because it's more than three.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the table, how many rows have \"cosmic call 1\"?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: yes\nRow 1: yes\nRow 2: yes\nRow 3: yes\n\nThat's four. So there are four messages that are not Cosmic Call 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it says all but three (meaning six should be Cosmic Call 2 and three should be something else), but in reality, only five are Cosmic Call 2 and four are Cosmic Call 1. Therefore, the correct answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that there are nine messages total. Four of them are \"cosmic call 1\" and five are \"cosmic call 2.\" Since four do not say \"cosmic call 2,\" the claim that all but three do is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"message\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"message\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"message\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"message\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
