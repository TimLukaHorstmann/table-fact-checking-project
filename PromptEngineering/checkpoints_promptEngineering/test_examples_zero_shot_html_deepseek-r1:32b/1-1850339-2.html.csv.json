The table has columns like Year, Title, Air Force, Army, and Navy. Each row corresponds to a different year from 1947 onwards.\n\nI'm looking for the 2018 season. Scanning down the \"Year\" column, I find the row with 2018 at index 36 (since counting starts from 0). \n\nNow, checking the relevant cells for Air Force and Navy in that year. The claim mentions both Air Force and Navy scores being TBD. So I need to check both columns.\n\nIn row 36:\n- \"Air Force\" column has \"tbd\"\n- \"Navy\" column also has \"tbd\"\n\nThis supports the claim that both scores are yet to be determined (TBD). \n\nAdditionally, the \"Title\" and other columns aren't relevant here since they don't pertain directly to the score status.\n\nSo, all conditions in the claim are met.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"an Army - Navy game will be played on 10 dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD\" is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries related to 2016. Scanning down, I see a row labeled 2016 under the \"Year\" column. Let me examine that row closely.\n\nIn the \"Opponent\" column for 2016, it's marked as \"tbd\", which stands for to be determined. This suggests that at the time of the table's creation, the opponent wasn't confirmed yet. Moving on to the game dates: the \"Army Game,\" \"Navy Game,\" and \"Bowl Game\" columns all have \"tbd\" entries, except for the \"Bowl Game\" which lists a date but not the specific Army-Navy matchup.\n\nNow, looking at other years, I notice that in 2014, the bowl game was held on December 13, 2014, and in 2016, it's set for December 10. However, the 2016 row doesn't specify whether this is an Army-Navy game or just another bowl game.\n\nThe claim mentions both the date (December 10) and the location (Baltimore, MD). From the table, the \"Bowl Game\" for 2016 is indeed scheduled on December 10 at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium. But since the opponent isn't specified in that row, I can't confirm it's specifically an Army-Navy game.\n\nLooking back, in previous years like 2012 and 2014, when the Army-Navy game was listed, it had specific details under \"Army Game\" or \"Navy Game\". Since 2016's row only mentions a bowl game without specifying Army or Navy opponents, I can't definitively say that the Army-Navy game is scheduled on that date and location based solely on this table.\n\nTherefore, while there is a game in Baltimore on December 10, 2016, it's not explicitly confirmed as an Army-Navy matchup.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Bowl Game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the claim \"in 1983, the air force - navy score be 44-17\" is true based on the table provided. Let me see how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: Year, Service, Air Force, Army, Navy. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking again, the columns are Year, Service, Air Force, Army, and another column that seems to be about dates or locations for games. Hmm, maybe I should clarify what each column represents.\n\nThe table rows list years from 1983 onwards. Each row has a \"Service\" column which alternates between Air Force, Navy, Army, etc., followed by some numbers in the other columns. The last few rows have TBDs and specific dates instead of scores. So I think the Air Force, Army, and Navy columns are the scores for each respective service's game that year.\n\nSo for the claim about 1983, I need to find the row where Year is 1983. Let me scan the years in the table. The first few rows start at 1983? Wait no, looking back: the first row after the header has a year of 1983 with Service as \"air force - navy\". Then the next row is 1984 with \"army\", then 1985 \"navy vs army\", and so on.\n\nWait, actually, I think the table might be structured differently. Let me recount: The first data row under the header is Year: 1983, Service: \"air force - navy\". Then in the columns after that, there are numbers like 44-17. So perhaps each of those cells represents the scores for Air Force vs Navy.\n\nWait no, looking at it again: The columns are \"Air Force\", \"Army\", and another one which might be the location or date. For example, the first row has Year 1983, Service as \"air force - navy\", then in the next three columns: 44-17, 24-10, and some dates or locations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me think again. The columns are:\n\n1. Year\n2. Service (which might indicate which services played that year)\n3. Air Force\n4. Army\n5. Another column, perhaps Navy? Or is it another service?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Air Force\", \"Army\" columns represent the scores against each other in their respective games. For example, in 1983, the Service is listed as \"air force - navy\". Then in the Air Force column: 44-17, Army column:24-10, and another column which might be about dates or locations.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a particular game or event. So for 1983, the Service is \"air force - navy\", so that's their game. The next columns then show the scores? Or maybe they are separate games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Air Force column shows the score of Air Force against Navy, and Army column shows the score against another team. But I'm a bit confused about how to interpret this.\n\nWait, looking at the claim: \"in 1983, the air force - navy score be 44-17\". So they're talking about a game between Air Force and Navy in 1983 with that score. \n\nLooking back at the table, for Year 1983, Service is listed as \"air force - navy\", so this row likely represents their game. Then in the next columns: 44-17 (Air Force column), 24-10 (Army column). Hmm, maybe these are scores from different games or perhaps it's the same game.\n\nWait, but if Service is \"air force - navy\", then that suggests it's a single game between them. So in that case, the score for that game would be in one of the columns. But which column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each of the other columns (Air Force, Army) represents their scores against another team, not necessarily each other.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the Service column indicates which two services played that year. So in 1983, it's Air Force vs Navy. Then, in the Air Force column, we have 44-17. Maybe this is the score of Air Force against Navy? Or maybe the first number is Air Force, and the second is Navy.\n\nSo if the claim says \"air force - navy score be 44-17\", that would mean Air Force scored 44 and Navy 17. Looking at the table, in the row for 1983, under the Air Force column, it's 44-17. So maybe that represents the score of the game between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each service has their own scores against other opponents, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, to clarify: The columns are \"Air Force\", \"Army\", and another column which isn't labeled but seems to have numbers or dates. For 1983, Service is \"air force - navy\". Then in the Air Force column: 44-17; Army:24-10; next column:27-6.\n\nHmm, maybe each of those represents the scores for different games. So perhaps Air Force played Navy and another opponent, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in 1983, the game between Air Force and Navy had a score of 44-17. If that's the case, then looking at the table, under the Service column for 1983 being \"air force - navy\", the next columns might represent their scores.\n\nWait, perhaps the first number is the Air Force score, and the second is Navy. So in the row for 1983, under the Air Force column:44-17 would mean Air Force 44, Navy 17. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo yes, that seems to be correct. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1983, the Air Force - Navy score was 44-17. Checking the table, for the year 1983 under the Service column, it shows \"air force - navy\". The corresponding Air Force column lists 44-17, indicating Air Force scored 44 and Navy scored 17.\n\n**Answer:** true",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"for the 1983 season, the air force - navy score be tbd\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has rows representing different years and columns for various details about each season. The relevant columns here are \"Year,\" \"Opponent,\" and any columns that mention scores or matchups between Air Force and Navy.\n\nThe claim is about the 1983 season, so my first step is to check if there's a row in the table corresponding to the year 1983. I'll scan through the rows:\n\n- The earliest year listed is 2014, with entries for 2014, 2016, and 2018. There are no rows before 2014 in the provided data.\n\nSince there's no row for 1983 in the table, there's nothing to verify regarding that specific season. The claim can't be supported because the necessary information isn't present.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the columns:\n\n- \"Opponent\" column shows entries like \"air force,\" \"navy,\" and \"tbd.\"\n- Columns for dates mention locations but don't include historical scores or matchups before 2014.\n\nTherefore, without a row for 1983, there's no way to confirm whether the score was \"tbd\" as claimed. The absence of data means we can't validate the claim, leading us to conclude it's false based on the given table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"the score for air force - navy have all be decide up until 2018.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has rows from 1954 to 2018, each representing a year with details about the Army-Navy game. There are columns for Year, Service Academy, Game Dates (which includes Air Force, Army, and Navy games), and the locations.\n\nThe claim is about whether all scores between Air Force and Navy have been decided up until 2018. So I need to check if every row from 1954 to 2018 has a definite score or if any of them are still TBD (To Be Determined).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- From 1954 onwards, each year's Air Force and Navy game scores are listed numerically except for some years where there's an indication like \"(ot)\" meaning overtime. For example, in 2010, it's \"14 - 6\" which is a definite score.\n\nI notice that starting from 1954 up to 2018, each row under the Air Force and Navy columns has specific scores or indicates the game date if it's future. The latest years like 2014, 2016, and 2018 have \"tbd\" in some cells, which might mean the games are yet to happen or the details aren't filled in.\n\nWait, but looking more carefully, in 2014, under Air Force, it's listed as a date: \"4 oct 2014 at air force,\" and similarly for Navy. So that row doesn't have a score yet; it just shows when the game took place. Similarly, 2016 has \"tbd\" in some columns, meaning no scores are available there either.\n\nTherefore, not all scores up to 2018 are decided because some years don't have numerical scores but instead have dates or TBDs. This means the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all Air Force vs. Navy game scores until 2018 are decided. However, the table shows that for certain years (e.g., 2014, 2016, 2018), the scores are marked as TBD or only have game dates listed without actual numerical results. Therefore, not all games up to 2018 have their scores decided.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Check each row from 1954 to 2018 under the \"Game Dates\" columns for Air Force and Navy.\n2. **Check Scores vs. TBDs:** Determine if each cell contains a numerical score or indicates an undecided game (TBD).\n3. **Analyze Findings:** Notice that years like 2014, 2016, and 2018 have \"tbd\" or only dates, meaning their scores aren't available.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since some years lack definite scores, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": -1, \"column_name\": \"Service Academy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": -1, \"column_name\": \"Game Dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"all but 1 season be about to have or have an army - navy game in baltimore, md (m&t bank stadium)\". \n\nFirst, I'll parse this claim carefully. It suggests that except for one season, every other season has had or is scheduled to have an Army-Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice it's structured with columns: Year, Service, Date/Location, and three more columns which seem to represent different games (perhaps Army vs. Air Force, Navy vs. Air Force, and the Army-Navy game). The last column for each row appears to be about the Army-Navy game.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows where the Army-Navy game is listed in the last column. I'll check each row's last cell to see if it mentions M&T Bank Stadium or Baltimore, MD. \n\nStarting from 2014 onwards:\n- 2014: The last cell says \"13 dec 2014 at baltimore, md (m&t bank stadium)\". That matches the claim.\n- 2016: The last cell is \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore, md (m&t bank stadium)\". Also a match.\n- 2018: The last cell is \"8 dec 2018\" but doesn't specify the location. This could be an issue because it's not clear if it's in Baltimore or another venue.\n\nNow, checking prior years:\nLooking back, for example, 2010: The Army-Navy game was at Philadelphia, PA. So that contradicts the claim. Similarly, other years like 2011 and earlier have different locations listed, so they don't fit the M&T Bank Stadium location.\n\nWait a minute. The user's claim says \"all but 1 season\". But looking back, it seems multiple seasons (e.g., 2010) do not have the game at M&T Bank Stadium. This means that more than one season is an exception, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the user refers to future or upcoming games. Let me check again.\n\nThe table includes years up to 2018, with some TBD entries. For example, 2014, 2016, and 2018 have specific dates but varying locations. Only 2014 and 2016 explicitly mention M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore for the Army-Navy game. 2018 just has a date without a location.\n\nIf I consider only the seasons with an explicit mention of M&T Bank Stadium, there are two: 2014 and 2016. But the claim suggests that all but one season have such games in Baltimore. Given that multiple years do not list this location, the claim is FALSE because more than one exception exists.\n\nWait another point: Perhaps the user is referring to upcoming seasons beyond 2018? The table only goes up to 2018, so without data for later years, I can't confirm if all subsequent seasons are in Baltimore. But based on the given data, multiple seasons (like 2010) don't fit, which invalidates the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those where the Army-Navy game location is specified or not specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking each season's Army-Navy game location. The claim requires that all but one season have their games at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. However, multiple seasons (e.g., 2010) do not meet this criterion. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 48, \"column_name\": \"Date/Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"Date/Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
