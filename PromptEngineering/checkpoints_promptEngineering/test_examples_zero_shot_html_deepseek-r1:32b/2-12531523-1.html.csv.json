    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"In the master tournament, tiger wood have win the most time out of all player.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand what each column represents and look for information related to Tiger Woods' wins compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a different player. The columns include 'player', 'country', 'year(s) won', 'total', 'to par', and 'finish'. \n\nThe key part of the claim is about who has won the most times in the Master tournament. So I should focus on the 'year(s) won' column because that indicates how many times each player has won.\n\nStarting with Tiger Woods, I check his row. The 'year(s) won' entry says \"1997 , 2001 , 2002 , 2005\". That's four separate years listed. So Tiger Woods has four wins.\n\nNext, I'll go through each other player to count their number of wins:\n\n- Phil Mickelson: 'year(s) won' is \"2004 , 2006\" \u2013 that's two wins.\n- Vijay Singh: Only \"2000\" listed \u2013 one win.\n- Mike Weir: Only \"2003\" \u2013 one win.\n- Zach Johnson: Only \"2007\" \u2013 one win.\n- Ian Woosnam: Only \"1991\" \u2013 one win.\n- Sandy Lyle: Only \"1988\" \u2013 one win.\n\nSo, Tiger Woods has four wins, which is more than any other player listed. Phil Mickelson is the next with two wins, and everyone else has just one.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Tiger Woods has won the most times out of all players in the Master tournament is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that Phil Mickelson has two wins and that he has won more times than Zach Johnson.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find how many times each of them has won. The relevant column for this information seems to be \"year(s) won,\" which lists the years each player won their titles.\n\nFor Phil Mickelson: His row shows \"2004 , 2006\" in the \"year(s) won\" column. That means he won twice, in those two years.\n\nZach Johnson's row has \"2007\" under \"year(s) won,\" indicating he only won once.\n\nSo Phil Mickelson indeed has more wins (2) than Zach Johnson (1). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to look at the \"year(s) won\" for both players.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the united state have have 3 player win in the master tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit grammatically off, but it appears to be stating that three players from the United States have won the Master Tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. The relevant information here would be the 'country' column because we need to know which players are from the United States and how many of them have won.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Tiger Woods - United States\n2. Phil Mickelson - United States\n3. Vijay Singh - Fiji\n4. Mike Weir - Canada\n5. Zach Johnson - United States\n6. Ian Woosnam - Wales\n7. Sandy Lyle - Scotland\n\nSo, the players from the United States are Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Zach Johnson. That makes three players.\n\nNow, checking their 'year(s) won' column to see how many times each has won:\n\n- Tiger Woods: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 (4 wins)\n- Phil Mickelson: 2004, 2006 (2 wins)\n- Zach Johnson: 2007 (1 win)\n\nWait a minute. The claim says \"3 player win,\" but each of these players has won multiple times. So the total number of wins by US players is more than three. However, I think the claim refers to three different players from the US who have won at least once, not necessarily the total number of wins.\n\nSo, Tiger Woods (1 win counted), Phil Mickelson (another win), and Zach Johnson (third). That's three players from the US who have each won the tournament at least once. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed three players from the United States listed as winners in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Zach Johnson from the United States have each won the Master Tournament, making a total of three US players.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The 'country' column identifies which players are from the United States.\n2. **List US Players**: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Zach Johnson are listed as from the United States.\n3. **Check Wins**: Each of these players has at least one entry in the 'year(s) won' column, indicating they have won the tournament.\n4. **Count US Winners**: There are three distinct US players who have won.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the problem where I need to determine if the claim \"mike weir have not win with under par for the nasters tournament ,\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The table has headers: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, finish. Each row corresponds to a different player's performance in some tournament, likely the Masters.\n\nThe claim focuses on Mike Weir and whether he won with under par. Under par means his score was less than the standard par; in golf terms, this would be negative if 'to par' is expressed as such.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll find Mike Weir's row. Scanning down, I see Mike Weir is on row index 3 (since rows start from 0: Tiger Woods is 0, Phil Mickelson 1, Vijay Singh 2, Mike Weir 3). \n\nIn that row, under the column 'to par', Mike Weir's value is '+ 2'. That indicates he was two strokes over par. For a win with under par, this would need to be negative or at least not positive.\n\nSo, since his 'to par' is positive, it means he didn't win under par. Therefore, the claim that he hasn't won with under par is correct.\n\nTo verify, I'll check other relevant cells: Mike Weir's year(s) won is 2003, which shows he did win a tournament in that year. But his 'to par' was +2, so it wasn't under.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because he didn't have an under par score when he won.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim says: \"vijay singh have a final total win that be 13 under the score sandy lyle have when she win.\" So, this translates to checking if Vijay Singh's winning total was 13 strokes under Sandy Lyle's winning total.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant rows for Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle. \n\n- For Vijay Singh, I'll check his row. According to the table, Vijay Singh is from Fiji and won in the year 2000. His \"total\" score is listed as 289, with a \"to par\" of +1. The \"finish\" column shows t14, which might indicate his finishing position.\n\n- For Sandy Lyle, she's from Scotland and won in 1988. Her total score is 302, with a to par of +14, and her finish was 45th place.\n\nNow, the claim mentions that Vijay Singh's total win was 13 under Sandy Lyle's score when she won. To verify this, I need to calculate the difference between their totals.\n\nVijay Singh's total is 289, while Sandy Lyle's total is 302. The difference would be 302 minus 289, which equals 13 strokes. This suggests that Vijay Singh scored 13 strokes less than Sandy Lyle in their respective winning years.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"to par\" scores: Vijay Singh was +1 (which is 1 over par), and Sandy Lyle was +14. The difference here is also 13 strokes, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSo, both the total scores and their relation to par support the claim that Vijay Singh's score was 13 under Sandy Lyle's when they won.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

They want me to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It looks like each row represents a player with various details: player name, country, years they won, total score, to par, and finish. The key columns for this claim are \"player\" and \"year(s) won\".\n\nThe claim is: \"In the master tournament, tiger wood win 1 less time than phil mickelson do.\" So, I need to compare how many times Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have won.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Tiger Woods (row index 0) has years won listed as 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005. That's four wins.\n- Phil Mickelson (row index 1) has years 2004 and 2006. So that's two wins.\n\nThe claim says Tiger won one less time than Phil. But wait, four is actually more than two.

It has several columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. The relevant information for this claim will be in the \"year(s) won\" column since that indicates how many times each player has won.\n\nI need to find the rows corresponding to Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- Looking at the players:\n  - Tiger Woods\n  - Phil Mickelson\n  - Vijay Singh\n  - Mike Weir\n  - Zach Johnson\n  - Ian Woosnam\n  - Sandy Lyle\n\nSo, Phil Mickelson is in row index 1 and Zach Johnson is in row index 4 (assuming the first data row after the header is index 0). Wait no, actually, let me recount.\n\nWait, counting from zero:\n- Row 0: Tiger Woods\n- Row 1: Phil Mickelson\n- Row 2: Vijay Singh\n- Row 3: Mike Weir\n- Row 4: Zach Johnson\n- Row 5: Ian Woosnam\n- Row 6: Sandy Lyle\n\nSo, Phil is row 1 and Zach is row 4.\n\nNow, looking at their \"year(s) won\" columns:\n\nFor Phil Mickelson (row 1), the years are listed as \"2004 , 2006\". That means he has two wins because there are two years mentioned. \n\nZach Johnson (row 4) has the year \"2007\", which is just one win.\n\nThe claim says Phil has four more wins than Zach. So, let's check:\n\nPhil's wins: 2\nZach's wins: 1\n\nDifference: 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, Phil actually has only one more win than Zach, not four.

The claim has two main points: \n\n1. Mike Weir won only one Master tournament.\n2. That win was under par.\n\nI'll check each point against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a row for Mike Weir. Let's go through his details:\n\n- **Player:** Mike Weir\n- **Country:** Canada\n- **Year(s) won:** 2003\n- **Total:** 290\n- **To par:** +2\n- **Finish:** t17\n\nSo, Mike Weir has a single year listed where he won, which is 2003. That means he only won one Master tournament, so the first part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNow, checking if that win was under par. The \"To par\" column shows \"+2\". In golf, being under par means having a score lower than the standard par (usually represented by a negative number). However, Mike Weir's to par is +2, which indicates he was two strokes over par. That contradicts the claim because it implies his win wasn't under par.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check: In golf, \"to par\" refers to how many strokes above or below par a player finished. A positive number means over par; negative is under. So Mike Weir being at +2 means he was two strokes over the par score for that tournament.\n\nTherefore, his win in 2003 wasn't under par but rather over by two strokes. This makes the claim incorrect because it states he won under par when actually he didn't.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Mike Weir won one Master under par. Checking the table:\n\n- Mike Weir's \"year(s) won\" shows 2003 (only once), but his \"to par\" is +2, meaning over par.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems to say that Vijay Singh's final score was more than 10 strokes better (lower) than Sandy Lyle's. But I need to check if it's actually less than 10 under, which might mean that his score was within 10 strokes of hers.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the relevant scores for both players. The columns that matter are \"total\" and possibly \"to par.\" Let me see:\n\n- For Vijay Singh (row index 2), the total is 289, and to par is +1.\n- For Sandy Lyle (row index 6), the total is 302, and to par is +14.\n\nWait, but what's the significance of \"to par\"? It shows how each player performed relative to the par score. So Vijay was 1 over par, and Sandy was 14 over.\n\nBut the claim is about their final scores compared to each other. The \"total\" column likely represents their total strokes for the tournament or event. So I should compare their totals: 289 vs. 302.\n\nCalculating the difference: 302 - 289 = 13 strokes. So Vijay's score was 13 strokes less than Sandy's.\n\nThe claim says \"less than 10 under,\" which could mean that his score is within 10 strokes of hers, but in this case, it's actually 13 strokes difference. That means Vijay didn't have a score within 10 strokes; he was more than 10 under.

So if the claim says there are two, that would be true because there are more than two, but perhaps the claim is considering only specific instances or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many times they've won in total? Tiger Woods has four wins, Phil has two, Zach has one. So together, that's 4+2+1=7 wins from US players. But the claim says \"2 players,\" so it's about the number of players, not the number of wins.\n\nSo there are three US players who have won: Tiger, Phil, and Zach. Therefore, if the claim is that the United States have two players who have won, then technically it's true because there are more than two. But wait, maybe the claim refers to only two specific instances or perhaps the data in the table only shows two with multiple wins.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\n- Tiger Woods has years 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005.\n- Phil Mickelson has 2004, 2006.\n- Zach Johnson has 2007.\n\nSo that's three players. So the claim says \"2 players,\" which is less than what's in the table. Therefore, if the claim states there are two US players who have won, but the table shows three, does that make the claim false? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to two separate instances of winning, not two players. But no, it says \"2 player.\" So, in the table, there are three players from the US with wins. Therefore, if someone claims only two, it's incorrect because there are more than that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is considering unique years or something else. Let me check again.\n\nEach row represents a player who has won at least once. So in the table:\n\n- Tiger: 4 wins\n- Phil: 2 wins\n- Zach: 1 win\n\nSo total US players with at least one win are three. Therefore, the claim that there are two is false because there are more than two.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is whether the United States have two players who have won during the master tournament. In the table, Tiger and Phil each have multiple wins, so they are two US players who have won. So perhaps the claim is true because there are at least two.\n\nBut wait, the presence of Zach Johnson adds a third. So does that affect it? No, because the claim only mentions two; having more than two doesn't make it false if the claim is about at least two. But I think in this case, the answer should be TRUE because there are indeed two players from the US who have won.\n\nBut to clarify: The relevant cells would be Tiger Woods (row 0) and Phil Mickelson (row 1), both from the US with years won. Zach Johnson is row 4, also US but perhaps not necessary for this count since the claim only mentions two.\n\nSo I think the answer is TRUE because there are at least two US players who have won. The relevant cells would be Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson's rows under 'country' and 'year(s) won.'\n\nWait, maybe I should include Zach Johnson as well, but since the claim is about two, including him might complicate it. Alternatively, just the first two.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that there are at least two US players who have won, which makes the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe United States has at least two players who have won the tournament: Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The task is to determine if there are two US players who have won the tournament.\n   - Look at the \"country\" column for US players and their respective \"year(s) won.\"\n\n2. **Analyze Data:**\n   - Tiger Woods (Row 0): United States, multiple wins.\n   - Phil Mickelson (Row 1): United States, two wins.\n   - Zach Johnson (Row 4): United States, one win.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - At least two US players (Tiger and Phil) have won, satisfying the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true. There are at least two United States players who have won the tournament. \n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Tiger Woods' country and years won.\n- Phil Mickelson's country and years won.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",
