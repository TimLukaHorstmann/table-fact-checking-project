Let me look at the table step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's a row with the date December 6, 1964. Scanning through each row, I see that in row index 12 (since counting starts from 0), the date is December 6, 1964. That matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if this game was indeed during week 13. Looking at the same row, the 'week' column shows week 13. So both conditions are satisfied: the date and the week number align with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the specific game on December 6, 1964, was in week 13 as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a game on December 6, 1964, occurred during week 13.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the game play on december 6  , 1964 be after week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that the game played on December 6, 1964 happened after week 13. So, I need to check two things: when was the game on December 6, and what week number does it fall under?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one that matches December 6, 1964. Scanning the 'date' column:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- ...\n- Week 13: November 22, 1964 (Wait, no. Let me check each row properly.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow with index 0 to 13 (assuming 0-based indexing? Or maybe 1-based based on week numbers):\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML structure, the first data row is for week 1, so in terms of JSON indices, if we consider the first <tr> as row_index 0, then week 1 is at row_index 0.\n\nWait no, the rows are from index 0 to 13, corresponding to weeks 1 to 14. So each row index corresponds to (week -1).\n\nLooking for the date December 6, 1964:\n\nRow with index 12 has week 13, and the date is November 29, 1964.\n\nNext row: index 13 is week 14, date December 20, 1964.\n\nWait, I don't see a game on December 6. Hmm, did I miss something?\n\nWait let me check all rows:\n\nRow 0: Sept 13\nRow 1: Sept 19\nRow 2: Sept 27\nRow 3: Oct 3\nRow 4: Oct 10\nRow 5: Oct 16\nRow 6: Oct 25\nRow 7: Nov 1\nRow 8: Nov 8\nRow 9: Nov 15\nRow 10: Nov 22\nRow 11: Nov 29 (week 12)\nRow 12: Dec 6, week 13? Wait no:\n\nWait looking at the table data:\n\nWeek 13 is row index 12: date is December 6, 1964.\n\nYes, because in the last rows:\n\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964\n- Week 14: December 20, 1964\n\nSo the claim says that the game on Dec 6 was after week 13. But according to the table, the game on Dec 6 is in week 13 itself.\n\nWait, but the wording of the claim is \"be after week 13\". So if the game is in week 13, it's not after week 13. It's during week 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the game on Dec 6 was in week 13, not after it.\n\nRelevant cells: The row where date is December 6 and its corresponding week number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on December 6, 1964 occurred after week 13. Checking the table, the game on December 6 is listed in week 13. Therefore, it did not occur after week 13.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the game play on december 2, 1963 be week 15\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the table provided to see if there's a game that matches these details. Looking at the table structure, it has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions December 2, 1963, but when I look through the dates in the 'date' column, all the entries are from 1964. The earliest date is September 13, 1964, and the latest is December 20, 1964. There's no game listed for December 2, 1963 because that's a year before the games in this table.\n\nAlso, the claim refers to week 15, but the table only goes up to week 14. Each row has a 'week' number from 1 to 14. So there's no entry for week 15 at all.\n\nTherefore, since both the date and the week mentioned in the claim aren't present in the table, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
