    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the title of deacon of ss cosma e damiano go to the spanish order of the cardinal - deacon\". Hmm, that's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two main things: a specific title and an attribute about the person who holds that title.\n\nThe first part is \"the title of deacon of ss cosma e damiano\". Looking at the table, there's a column called \"title\" which lists various titles held by electors. So I should look through each row's \"title\" to find if any have this exact title.\n\nNext, the second part mentions that this title went to someone with the \"spanish order of the cardinal - deacon\". The table has two relevant columns here: \"order\" and \"nationality\". The \"order\" column specifies whether they're a bishop or priest or deacon. The \"nationality\" should be Spanish if it's referring to someone from Spain.\n\nSo, my approach is:\n1. Find the row where the title is exactly \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\".\n2. Check that row for the nationality and order.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Title is bishop of ostia e velletri. Not matching.\n- Row 1: Bishop of porto e santa rufina. No match.\n- Row 2: Bishop of sabina. Still not it.\n- Row 3: Title of s sabina. Nope.\n- Row 4: Title of s maria in trastevere. Doesn't fit.\n- Row 5: Title of s prassede. Not matching.\n- Row 6: Title of s lorenzo in lucina. No.\n- Row 7: Deacon of s maria in cosmedin. Close but not the same as ss cosma e damiano.\n- Row 8: Deacon of ss cosma e damiano! Yes, this is the one.\n\nNow, checking the details for row 8:\n- Nationality is \"spanish\". That matches the claim's \"spanish\".\n- Order is \"cardinal - deacon\". The claim says \"cardinal - deacon\", which aligns perfectly.\n\nWait a second. The claim mentions both the title and that it went to someone of Spanish nationality who was a cardinal-deacon. Since row 8 has the exact title, Spanish nationality, and order as cardinal-deacon, everything checks out.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row index 8 for the columns \"title\", \"nationality\", and \"order\". But according to the instructions, I need to list all relevant cells that support the claim. So each part of the claim corresponds to a specific cell.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the title \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\" was given to someone who is Spanish and holds the order of cardinal-deacon. The table shows this exact title in row 8 with nationality as Spanish and order as cardinal-deacon. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table with a bunch of cardinals and their details. The claim is that \"cardinal - deacon have the title of deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's saying that any cardinal who is a deacon has the specific title mentioned. So, I should look for all rows where the 'order' column is \"cardinal - deacon\" and check their corresponding 'title' entries.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 6: Rainiero Capocci is a cardinal-deacon with title \"deacon of s maria in cosmedin.\"\n- Row 7: Gil Torres, same order, title is \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano.\"\n- Row 8: Riccardo Annibaldi, again a deacon, titled \"deacon of s angelo in pescheria.\"\n- Row 9: Robert Somercotes, also a deacon, with the title \"deacon of s eustachio.\"\n\nWait a second, none of these titles match \"s lorenzo in lucina.\" In fact, I see that \"s lorenzo in lucina\" is listed under the 'title' column for Tommaso da Capua and Sinibaldo Fieschi. Checking their orders: Tommaso is a cardinal-priest, as is Stefano de Normandis, Giovanni Colonna, Sinibaldo Fieschi. So the title \"s lorenzo in lucina\" isn't under any of the deacons; it's under priests.\n\nTherefore, the claim that deacons have that specific title is false because none of the deacons listed have that title.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that cardinals who are deacons have the title of \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" Checking each row where the 'order' is \"cardinal - deacon,\" their titles do not include \"s lorenzo in lucina.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the 'order' column is \"cardinal - deacon.\"\n   - Rows 6, 7, 8, and 9 are relevant.\n\n2. **Check Titles of These Deacons:**\n   - Row 6: Title is \"deacon of s maria in cosmedin.\"\n   - Row 7: Title is \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano.\"\n   - Row 8: Title is \"deacon of s angelo in pescheria.\"\n   - Row 9: Title is \"deacon of s eustachio.\"\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:** None of the deacons have the title \"s lorenzo in lucina.\" This title appears under cardinal-priests (rows 3 and 5).\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
