Not relevant.\n\nRow 1: Home team Collingwood vs Away team Hawthorn. Still not relevant.\n\nRow 2: South Melbourne is the home team here, and the away team is Fitzroy. That's exactly what the claim states. So this row supports the claim.\n\nRows 3 to 5 don't involve south melbourne or fitzroy as home and away teams respectively.\n\nSo, since Row 2 has 'south melbourne' as home and 'fitzroy' as away, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"footscray be the home team when the away team score be 9.4 (58)\". So I need to check if in any row where the away team's score is 9.4 (58), footscray is listed as the home team.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and examine both the 'away team' and 'home team' columns.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n- Home Team: essendon\n- Away Team: geelong\n- Away Score: 9.4 (58)\nHere, the away score is exactly what's mentioned in the claim. But the home team isn't footscray; it's essendon. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home Team: collingwood\n- Away Team: hawthorn\n- Away Score: 9.8 (62)\nThe away score here is different from 9.4, so no relevance to the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home Team: south melbourne\n- Away Team: fitzroy\n- Away Score: 9.8 (62)\nAgain, the away score doesn't match, so this row isn't relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home Team: melbourne\n- Away Team: st kilda\n- Away Score: 17.7 (109)\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home Team: footscray\n- Away Team: north melbourne\n- Away Score: 13.9 (87)\nHere, the home team is footscray, but the away score isn't 9.4. So this doesn't satisfy both conditions in the claim.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home Team: carlton\n- Away Team: richmond\n- Away Score: 16.10 (106)\nNo match again.\n\nWait a second, did I miss any rows? Let me double-check each row's away score to ensure I didn't overlook the 9.4 (58) anywhere else.\n\nRow 0 had away team geelong with 9.4 (58), but home team was essendon, not footscray. None of the other rows have that exact score. So, the claim is about a scenario where footscray is the home team when the away score is specifically 9.4 (58). Since in the only row with that score, footscray isn't the home team, there's no instance supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Footscray was the home team when the away team scored 9.4 (58). Checking each row, we find that in Row 0, the away score is 9.4 (58), but the home team is Essendon, not Footscray. No other rows have an away score of 9.4 (58) with Footscray as the home team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
