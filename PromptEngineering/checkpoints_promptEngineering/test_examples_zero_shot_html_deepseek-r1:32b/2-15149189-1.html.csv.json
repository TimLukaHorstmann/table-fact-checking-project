    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to verify a claim about Danny Cipriani using the data from a table provided. The claim is: \"Danny Cipriani, born November 2, 1987, be a fly half.\" I need to check if each part of this claim matches the information in the table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. There are three main pieces here:\n1. The name: Danny Cipriani\n2. His birthdate: November 2, 1987\n3. His position: Fly half\n\nI'll start by looking for Danny Cipriani in the table. Scanning through the \"Name\" column, I find his entry. Let me note down the row index where he is listed. Looking at the table structure provided, each row represents a player with details like name, birthdate, position, and team.\n\nSo, I see that Danny Cipriani's row has:\n- Name: Danny Cipriani\n- Date of Birth: November 2, 1987 (I think it's written as Nov 2, 1987 in the table)\n- Position: Fly half\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording. In the table, under \"Position,\" is it exactly \"fly half\"? Or is there a different term used? The claim uses \"fly half\" with a space, but sometimes people write it as one word or another variation.\n\nLooking back at the table, I see that the positions are listed as \"Flyhalf.\" Hmm, so in the table, it's written without the space. The claim says \"fly half.\" That might be a discrepancy. But is this a significant issue? Maybe not, because \"fly half\" and \"Flyhalf\" could refer to the same position.\n\nNext, checking the date of birth. The claim states November 2, 1987. In the table, Danny's DOB is listed as \"Nov 2, 1987.\" That matches exactly in terms of day, month, and year. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, regarding his position: the claim says he's a fly half, while the table lists him as Flyhalf. The capitalization might not matter here since it's just a title. Also, sometimes positions are written differently, but they mean the same role in rugby. Therefore, I can consider this part accurate.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other columns for Danny: team is listed as Wasps, which isn't directly relevant to the claim, so I don't need to check that unless it's part of the verification. But since the claim doesn't mention his team, I can ignore that detail.\n\nSo, all three parts of the claim are correctly reflected in the table. The name matches, the birthdate is accurate, and his position as a fly half is consistent with what's stated, even if there's a slight variation in the term used.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Danny Cipriani is supported by the data in the table. His name, birthdate, and position are all correctly listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Date of Birth\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"the position of the player born on 2 November 1987 be fly-half, the only one for a sale player.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the player born on 2 November 1987. Scanning the 'Date of Birth' column:\n\n- Jonny Wilkinson is listed as born on 25 May 1979.\n- There's another entry for Toby Flood on 8 August 1985, and Jamie Noon on 9 May 1979.\n\nWait, looking again, I see a player named Mike Tindall born on 18 October 1978. Hmm, no. Wait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: Player not mentioned in the table provided.\nLooking at all rows, it seems there's no player with a date of birth on 2 November 1987. The closest is Toby Flood born on 8 August 1985 and Jonny Wilkinson on 25 May 1979.\n\nSince the claim refers to a player born on that specific date, but none exists in the table, the position can't be verified as fly-half for such a player. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Date of Birth\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"prop steve borthwick be leicester 's best know player in that position.\" So, I need to verify if Steve Borthwick is indeed Leicester's most well-known player as a prop.\n\nFirst, I should check the table provided for any mention of Steve Borthwick. Looking through the list, I don't see his name listed. The players in the table include names like Jonny Wilkinson, Toby Flood, Mike Tindall, etc., but Steve Borthwick isn't there.\n\nNext, considering that the claim is about him being the best-known prop for Leicester, even if he's not in the table, I should think about external knowledge. However, based solely on the given data, since Steve Borthwick isn't present, we can't confirm this claim from the table alone.\n\nMoreover, looking at the players listed under Leicester, like Lesley Vainikolo and Paul Sackey, but they're wings, not props. There are no other prop players in the table associated with Leicester. Therefore, without Steve Borthwick's data here, we can't support the claim.\n\nSo, based on the provided information, the answer should be FALSE because there's no relevant cell supporting that Steve Borthwick is Leicester's best-known player as a prop.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
