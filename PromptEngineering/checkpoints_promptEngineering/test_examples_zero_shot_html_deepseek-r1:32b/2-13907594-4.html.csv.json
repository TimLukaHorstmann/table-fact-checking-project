    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me read through the instructions again carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10\"\n\nWait, actually, looking back, it's probably a translation issue. The correct interpretation should be: There is a game with a score of 5-4 OT at Montreal Forum on a date after May 10.\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 7 rows (index 0 to 6). Each row has details like date, opponent, score, location, and series.\n\nThe score mentioned in the claim is \"5 - 4 (ot)\". Let me scan through the 'score' column. \n\nRow 6: Score is 5-4 OT on May 10 at Montreal Forum.\nWait, that's exactly the score but the date is May 10, not after. The next row would be beyond row 6, but the table only has up to May 10.\n\nSo the claim says \"date after may 10\". The latest date in the table is May 10, so there's no game with that score on a date later than that.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the date isn't after May 10; it's exactly May 10. Also, if there were a later date, but looking at all rows, the last one is May 10.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game with score \"5-4 OT\" occurred after May 10 at Montreal Forum. However, in the table, this game happened on May 10, not after. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location  / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
