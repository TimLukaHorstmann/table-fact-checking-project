Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the date mentioned in the claim. The claim says March 13, 1990. Looking at the table, each row has a 'date' column. Scanning through, I see that the fourth row (index starting from 0) has the date \"13 march 1990\". So that's relevant.\n\nNext, the opponent is mentioned as 'dundee'. In the same row where the date matches, I check the 'opponent' column. It says 'dundee', which aligns with the claim. That's another relevant cell.\n\nThe result of the game in the claim is \"3 - 1\". The 'result' column for that row shows \"3  -  1\", which is the same as what's stated. So this also matches and adds another relevant cell.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim\u2014date, opponent, and result\u2014are correctly represented in the fourth row (index 3) of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in the table for March 13, 1990.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that when Dundee was the opponent, the result of the match was 3-4. So I need to check two things: whether there's a row where the opponent is Dundee and if in that same row, the result column shows 3-4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers. The rows are indexed from 0 to 5.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if Dundee is listed as an opponent:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is East Fife. Not Dundee.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is East Fife again. Still not Dundee.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is Airdrieonians. No match here either.\n4. **Row 3**: This one says the opponent is Dundee. Okay, so this is the row we're interested in.\n5. **Rows 4 and 5**: These have opponents St Johnstone and Motherwell respectively. Not relevant.\n\nNow focusing on Row 3 where the opponent is Dundee. Let's check the result column here. The result is listed as 3 - 1. So it was a 3-1 victory, not 3-4 as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim that when Dundee was the opponent, the result was 3-4 is incorrect because the actual result in that match was 3-1.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the opponent and result columns of Row 3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that against Dundee, the result was 3-4. Checking the table, Dundee appears as an opponent in row index 3, where the result is actually 3-1, not 3-4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
