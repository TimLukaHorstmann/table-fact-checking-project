The claim says, \"wigan warrior club have 2 point higher than the london bronco club.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: club, played, lost, drawn, against, diff, and points. So, to check the points for each club, I need to find the row for Wigan Warriors and London Broncos.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see:\n\n- The first row is Wigan Warriors with points listed as 4.\n- The second row is London Broncos with points listed as 2.\n\nNow, let's compute the difference. Wigan has 4 points, and London has 2 points. So, subtracting London's points from Wigan's gives us 4 - 2 = 2. That means Wigan has exactly 2 more points than London.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because Wigan Warriors do have 2 points higher than London Broncos.\n\nThe relevant cells for this comparison are:\n\n1. For Wigan Warriors: row index 0, column \"points\".\n2. For London Broncos: row index 1, column \"points\".\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE with these two cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"st helens rlfc club's record loss be 6 while the wigan warrior club have a loss of 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately.\n\n1. **St Helens RLFC's Losses**: The claim says they have a loss record of 6. I'll check the table for the row corresponding to St Helens RLFC. Looking at the \"lost\" column (column index 2), their value is 6. So this part of the claim is correct.\n\n2. **Wigan Warriors' Losses**: The claim states they have a loss of 4. I'll find Wigan Warriors in the table and check their \"lost\" column.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"london bronco club have a lower number of loss than the warrington wolves club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the table structure and the data it contains.\n\nFirst, looking at the HTML table provided, it has several columns: club, played, lost, drawn, against, diff, points. Each row represents a different rugby league team with their respective statistics for the season or competition they're part of.\n\nThe claim is comparing two specific clubs: London Broncos and Warrington Wolves. The key aspect here is the number of losses each has incurred. So I need to find the 'lost' column for both teams and compare those numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify where each club is located. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. Wigan Warriors\n2. London Broncos\n3. Bradford Bulls\n4. St Helens RLFC\n5. Warrington Wolves\n6. Halifax Blue Sox\n\nSo, London Broncos are in row 1 (since indexing starts at 0) and Warrington Wolves are in row 5.\n\nNow, focusing on the 'lost' column for each:\n\n- For London Broncos, looking at row index 1 under the 'lost' column: the value is 5.\n- For Warrington Wolves, it's in row index 5 under 'lost': the value is 6.\n\nThe claim states that London Broncos have a lower number of losses than Warrington Wolves. Comparing the numbers: 5 (London) vs. 6 (Warrington). Since 5 is less than 6, the statement holds true.\n\nTo ensure I didn't make any mistakes, I'll double-check:\n\n- Correctly identified both clubs' rows.\n- Accurately noted their respective 'lost' values.\n- Confirmed that 5 is indeed lower than 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

The claim mentions two main things:\n\n1. Halifax Blue Sox is one of six clubs.\n2. These six clubs all have no drawn games (i.e., their 'drawn' column shows zero).\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: club, played, lost, drawn, against, diff, points.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the 'drawn' value for Halifax Blue Sox and see if they indeed have no draws. Then I'll verify how many clubs in total have a 'drawn' record of zero.\n\nStarting with the first row: Wigan Warriors. Their drawn column is 0, so that's one club without any draws.\n\nSecond row: London Broncos also has 0 in the drawn column, making two.\n\nThird row: Bradford Bulls have 0 as well, bringing it to three.\n\nFourth row: St Helens RLFC also shows 0, now four clubs.\n\nFifth row: Warrington Wolves with 0, so five.\n\nFinally, the sixth row: Halifax Blue Sox. Their drawn value is 0, which makes six.\n\nSo, all six clubs listed have a 'drawn' record of zero. That includes Halifax Blue Sox as one of them. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells for each club's 'drawn' column. Each row from index 0 to 5 (since there are six rows) has the drawn value at the 'drawn' column.

Since there's only one team with 4 points and no other teams have a higher or equal number except for that, there isn't a second position because all the others have either less or the same (but zero). \n\nWait, maybe I should consider if \"second highest\" can still apply even if multiple teams are tied.

So actually, Wigan Warriors have the highest points, and London has the second highest.\n\nBut wait, the claim says Wigan has the second highest.

The columns are: club, played, lost, drawn, against, diff, points. So, each row represents a different club's performance with various statistics.\n\nThe claim is about the points difference between Wigan Warriors and Bradford Bulls. Specifically, it says that Wigan has 2 more points than Bradford. To check this, I need to find the points for both clubs in the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- The first row is Wigan Warriors. Their points are listed as 4.\n- The third row is Bradford Bulls. Their points are listed as 0.\n\nSo, according to these values, Wigan has 4 points and Bradford has 0 points. Now, I need to calculate if this difference is indeed 2 points. Let's subtract the two: 4 - 0 = 4.
