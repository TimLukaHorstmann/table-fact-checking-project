The table has rows with various statistics across different years from 2005 to 2011.\n\nLooking for \"total match wins,\" I check the rows labeled \"overall win - loss\" which seem to represent total matches won and lost each year. For each year:\n- 2005: 14-7 (wins=14)\n- 2006: 26-8 (wins=26)\n- 2007: 37-16 (wins=37)\n- 2008: 48-18 (wins=48)\n- 2009: 32-26 (wins=32)\n- 2010: 32-27 (wins=32)\n- 2011: 20-26 (wins=20)\n\nThe highest total wins are in 2008 with 48, not 2009. So the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, for \"grand slam match wins,\" I check the rows labeled \"tour level win - loss\" which likely refer to matches within grand slams or similar tournaments. The wins here are:\n- 2005: 0\n- 2006: 0\n- 2007: 1\n- 2008: 6\n- 2009: 27\n- 2010: 30\n- 2011: 14\n\nThe highest is in 2010 with 30, not 2011.

The claim is that \"Poloma's first Premier Mandatory match win came after her first Grand Slam tournament match win.\" I need to check if the table supports this claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look for information about her wins in Premier Mandatory tournaments and Grand Slams. The columns in the table include \"premier mandatory\", \"grand slams\", and \"win - loss\" stats under each category. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Under \"premier mandatory\", there are entries like \"0-0\", which might indicate no wins yet, but I'm not sure if that's her first win.\n- The \"grand slams\" column shows some matches, but again, it's unclear when she had her first win in each category.\n\nI think the key is to find when she got her first win in Premier Mandatory and compare it with her first win in Grand Slams. But the table doesn't provide specific match dates or a clear sequence of events across years. Without knowing the order of these wins, I can't verify if one happened before the other.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I don't have enough evidence to confirm whether her Premier Mandatory win came after her Grand Slam win.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks specific details about the chronological order of Poloma's match wins in Premier Mandatory and Grand Slam tournaments.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"Polona have 26 more tour win in 2010 than in 2008.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the table provided. The rows are labeled with various statistics across different years from 2007 to 2014. I'm focusing on \"tour level win - loss\" and \"overall win - loss\" for the years 2008 and 2010.\n\nLooking at the tour level wins, in 2008, it's listed as 6-8 wins, meaning she won 6 matches. In 2010, under the same category, it's 27-26, so she won 27 matches. The difference here is 27 - 6 = 21 wins.\n\nNow, checking the overall win - loss for each year: in 2008, it's 48-18, which includes all her wins that year, not just tour level. In 2010, it's 32-26. The difference here is 32 - 48 = -16, meaning she had fewer overall wins in 2010 than in 2008.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"tour win,\" which I interpret as tour level wins.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"in 2011 polona be rank 12 spot higher in the year in ranking than in 2010\" is true based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It says that Polona's ranking in 2011 was 12 spots higher (meaning better) compared to her ranking in 2010. So, if she was ranked X in 2010, she should be ranked X-12 in 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a section labeled \"year end ranking\" which has values for different years. Let me find where that is. Scanning through the rows, I spot a row with the label \"year end ranking\". The corresponding data points are: 717, 345, 243, 71, 48, 36, 80. \n\nWait, how do these numbers correspond to the years? Let me check the columns. It seems each column represents a year from 2009 to 2016. The first data point under \"year end ranking\" is for 2009: 717. Then 345 for 2010, 243 for 2011, and so on.\n\nSo, in 2010 (which is the second column), her rank was 345. In 2011 (third column), her rank was 243. \n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between these two ranks to see if it's a 12-spot improvement. The formula would be: 345 (2010) - 243 (2011) = 102. That means her rank improved by 102 spots, not just 12.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the claim. So, if she went from 345 to 243, that's a significant jump of 102 places, which is much more than 12. But the claim says she was only 12 spots higher in 2011 compared to 2010.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how rankings work. Lower numbers mean better ranks because they're closer to 1. So, a lower number indicates a higher ranking position. The difference in rank positions can be calculated as the change from one year to another. \n\nIn 2010, she was ranked 345th, and in 2011, she was 243rd. To find out how many spots higher (better) she is, we subtract 243 from 345: 345 - 243 = 102. So she improved by 102 positions, not 12.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misapplying the calculation. If someone moves up in rank, it's about their position relative to others. The number of spots higher would be how many people are between her 2010 and 2011 ranks. So from 345 to 243, that's an increase of 102 places.\n\nBut the claim is she was only 12 spots higher. That doesn't match because it should be 102, not 12. Therefore, the claim isn't correct based on these numbers.\n\nWait again, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the table's columns and rows. Let me double-check. The \"year end ranking\" row has values for each year from 2009 to 2016. So 2010 is the second column (since it starts with 2009 as the first), which would be index 1, but in JSON terms, the list might start at 0. Wait, looking back, in the table structure provided earlier, each row has data across years from 2009 to 2016, so for \"year end ranking\", the columns are:\n\n- 2009:717\n- 2010:345\n- 2011:243\n- 2012:71\n- etc.\n\nSo 2010 is 345, and 2011 is 243. The difference is indeed 345 - 243 = 102 spots higher in 2011 than in 2010. \n\nTherefore, the claim that she was only 12 spots higher isn't correct; it's actually a much bigger improvement. So, the answer should be false because 102 is not equal to 12.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Polona's ranking improved by 12 spots in 2011 compared to 2010. According to the table, her year-end rankings were 345 in 2010 and 243 in 2011, resulting in a 102-spot improvement, not 12.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- **year end ranking (2010):** 345\n- **year end ranking (2011):** 243\n\nThe difference is 345 - 243 = 102 spots. Therefore, the claim that she improved by 12 spots is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"year_end_ranking_2010\": 345,\n    \"year_end_ranking_2011\": 243,\n    \"difference\": -102\n  }\n}\n```",

The columns are labeled from \"Year\" (which isn't explicitly shown but can be inferred from context) and then a series of statistics across different years. Looking at the rows, I see sections like \"tour level win - loss\" which seems relevant because it might include Grand Slam matches.\n\nI'll check the \"tour level win - loss\" row to find out how many wins Polona had each year. The numbers are as follows: 0-2 in 2005, 1-2 in 2006, 6-8 in 2007, 27-26 in 2008, 30-25 in 2009, and so on. Wait a second, the years don't seem to align with the claim. The highest wins are in 2009 (30 wins) and 2010 (maybe around there). But the user's claim mentions 2010 and 2011 as her peak years.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check another part of the table. There's a row labeled \"overall win - loss\" which might include all matches, but Grand Slams are specific tournaments. However, since there's no explicit mention of Grand Slam wins, I have to infer from the data given.\n\nLooking again at the \"tour level win - loss,\" it seems that 2010 and 2011 don't stand out as the highest. In fact, 2009 has a higher number than those years. This suggests that maybe 2010 and 2011 weren't her peak years for Grand Slam wins.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim isn't supported because the highest wins were in earlier years like 2008 and 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"tour level win - loss\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"tour level win %\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"2011 be the year that poloma have the most total match win and 2009 be the year poloma have the most grand slam match win.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. \n\nStarting with the first part: \"2011 be the year that poloma have the most total match win.\" I'm assuming \"poloma\" is a typo and should be \"Pole,\" but looking at the table, there's no name like Pole or Poloma listed. The rows include statistics for years 2008 to 2015, with various metrics. \n\nNext, the claim mentions \"total match win.\" In the table, under each year, I see columns like \"tour level win - loss\" and \"overall win - loss.\" I think \"overall win - loss\" might refer to total matches won in a season. For example, for 2011 (column 2011), looking at the \"overall win - loss\" row: it's 32-26, which means 32 wins. \n\nNow checking other years for overall wins:\n- 2008: 14-7 \u2192 14 wins\n- 2009: 26-8 \u2192 26 wins\n- 2010: 37-16 \u2192 37 wins\n- 2011: 32-26 \u2192 32 wins\n- 2012: 48-18 \u2192 48 wins\n- 2013: 32-27 \u2192 32 wins\n- 2014: 32-25 \u2192 32 wins\n- 2015: 20-26 \u2192 20 wins\n\nSo the most overall wins are in 2012 with 48. Therefore, 2011 doesn't have the highest total match wins.\n\nMoving to the second part of the claim: \"2009 be the year poloma have the most grand slam match win.\" Grand Slam match wins would likely refer to matches won at major tournaments like Wimbledon or the French Open. In the table, under each year, there's a \"tour level win - loss\" row. For 2009 (column 2009), it shows 1-2 wins. Comparing this with other years:\n- 2008: 0-0 \u2192 0\n- 2009: 1-2 \u2192 1\n- 2010: 6-8 \u2192 6\n- 2011: 27-26 \u2192 27\n- 2012: 30-25 \u2192 30\n- 2013: 27-26 \u2192 27\n- 2014: 32-25 \u2192 32\n- 2015: 14-23 \u2192 14\n\nThe highest tour level wins are in 2014 with 32. So 2009 doesn't have the most Grand Slam match wins either.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"overall win - loss\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"tour level win - loss\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"Poloma's second Premier Mandatory match win came after her first Grand Slam tournament match win.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where in the table I can find information about Poloma's wins in Premier Mandatory tournaments and Grand Slams. Looking at the table structure, there are columns like \"Premier Mandatory,\" \"Grand Slam,\" and others. The rows seem to represent each year from 2014 to 2020.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, the first few rows after the headers don't directly list wins but have placeholders or repeated terms like \"statistics.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again at the table data provided. The rows seem to be divided into sections, perhaps by year? For example, there are multiple entries with \"Premier Mandatory\" in a row, which might indicate each tournament she played in that category.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific achievements: her second Premier Mandatory match win and her first Grand Slam tournament match win. I need to find out if the second Premier win happened after the first Grand Slam win.\n\nLet me check for any entries under \"Premier Mandatory\" where Poloma has a \"win.\" Scanning through, I see rows like:\n\n- For 2018: 2 wins in Premier Mandatory\n- For 2019: 3 wins\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if these represent individual match wins or tournament titles. The claim refers to match wins, so each \"win\" might be a single match.\n\nSimilarly, under the \"Grand Slam\" column, looking for her first win. Let's see:\n\n- In 2017: 4 wins\n- 2018: 5\n- 2019: 6\n\nWait, but how do I know if these are per tournament or total? It might be that each entry is a separate match.\n\nThe claim states that the second Premier Mandatory win came after her first Grand Slam. So I need to see the order of these wins across the years.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- In 2017, under \"Premier Mandatory,\" she has 3 wins.\n- Under \"Grand Slam\" in 2017: 4 wins.\n\nWait, but this might not be per year. Maybe each row represents a different tournament or match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the column represents the number of wins that year. For example, in 2015 under Premier Mandatory, she has \"win\" (maybe one win), and in Grand Slam, another \"win.\" \n\nBut this is unclear. The table's structure isn't entirely clear because some rows are repeated terms like \"statistics,\" which might be section headers.\n\nWait, looking back at the data provided, I see that under \"Premier Mandatory\" there are multiple entries with \"win,\" \"loss,\" etc. Similarly for Grand Slam. So perhaps each row is a separate tournament or match result.\n\nThe claim refers to her second Premier Mandatory win and first Grand Slam win. So I need to find when these occurred relative to each other.\n\nAssuming that the rows are ordered chronologically, let's look through them:\n\nLooking at \"Premier Mandatory\" column:\n- Row 10: win\n- Row 23: win (second Premier Mandatory win)\n  \nFor Grand Slam:\n- Row 16: win (first Grand Slam win)\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the second Premier win is after the first Grand Slam.\n\nLooking at the order of rows:\n\nRow indices for Premier Mandatory wins are 10 and 23. For Grand Slam, the first win is row 16.\n\nSo the first Premier win is in row 10, then the Grand Slam in row 16, then the second Premier in row 23. So the order would be: Premier (row 10) \u2192 Grand Slam (row 16) \u2192 Premier (row 23). Therefore, the second Premier comes after her first Grand Slam.\n\nWait no, that's not correct because the claim says the second Premier came after the first Grand Slam. But in this case, her first Premier was before the Grand Slam, and the second Premier is after. So the second Premier is indeed after the first Grand Slam. Therefore, the claim holds.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact order because the rows might not be strictly chronological if they are grouped by categories. Maybe the table isn't structured in a way that reflects the sequence of events across different tournament types. But given the information provided, it's the best assumption.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data showing that Poloma's second Premier Mandatory win occurred after her first Grand Slam victory.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Premier Mandatory\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Premier Mandatory\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Grand Slam\"}\n   ]\n}",

It states that Polona had 26 additional tour wins in 2011 compared to her performance in 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant data points for 2010 and 2011. The table's columns represent years from 2007 to 2013. So, the 5th column is 2010 (index 4) and the 6th column is 2011 (index 5).\n\nI'll search for rows that mention \"tour win - loss\" because that's related to the number of wins.

Let me think about this: being rank 71 means she is lower (worse) than someone ranked 36. So her ranking actually improved from 2008 to 2011, moving up the rankings.\n\nBut the claim says she was 12 spots higher in 2008 than in 2011. That would mean her 2008 rank should be 12 spots better (lower number) than her 2011 rank. Let's see: if she was ranked 36 in 2011, then 36 minus 12 is 24.

Maybe it's about the difference between 2008 and 2011 being 35 spots better in 2011 than 2008. Because from 71 to 36 is an improvement of 35 positions. But the claim states that in 2008, she was higher by 12 spots compared to 2011. That's not accurate.\n\nSo the relevant cells are for \"year end ranking\" in columns 2008 and 2011. The ranks are 71 and 36 respectively. Since 71 is lower than 36, her ranking wasn't higher by 12 spots in 2008; instead, it was worse. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The table includes a row for \"year end ranking\" across years 2007 to 2014.\n\n2. **Extract Values for 2008 and 2011:**\n   - 2008 rank: 71\n   - 2011 rank: 36\n\n3. **Compare Ranks:** A lower rank number means a higher position (better ranking). So, being ranked 36 in 2011 is better than 71 in 2008.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim:** The claim states that her 2008 rank was 12 spots higher than in 2011. However, from 71 to 36, she improved by 35 positions, not worse. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"2011\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"2011 and 2008 be the year that Polona have the most grand slam match win\" is true based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns in the table relate to grand slam wins or performance. Looking at the table headers: \"Year\", \"Australian Open\", \"French Open\", \"Wimbledon\", \"US Open\", and several other columns that might include match statistics like \"tour level win - loss\" and percentages, as well as overall win-loss and rankings.\n\nThe claim is about having the most grand slam wins in 2011 and 2008. So I need to find which years correspond to the highest number of matches won at these tournaments.\n\nLooking at each year's performance:\n\n- **2008**: The row for 2008 shows a \"tour level win - loss\" of 6-8, with a 43% win rate. Overall win-loss is 48-18, which is a higher ratio.\n- **2011**: For 2011, the tour level win-loss is 27-26 (51%) and overall is 32-26 (55%). This seems better than 2008 in terms of wins.\n- Other years like 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014 show varying results. For example, 2013 has a higher overall win rate (55%) but not sure about grand slams specifically.\n\nWait, the claim is about Grand Slam matches. The table includes \"Australian Open\", \"French Open\", etc., which are Grand Slams. So I should look at those columns for each year to see how many wins Polona had in these tournaments.\n\nLooking at each year's performance:\n\n- **2008**: Let me check the specific grand slam results. For example, 2008's Australian Open win-loss is 3-4 (from row 1: tour level). Wait, actually, looking at the table structure, the columns after \"Year\" include specific tournaments and then some statistics.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The columns are Year, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, then some other stats like \"tour level win - loss\", percentages, overall wins, etc.\n\nSo for each year, under the four Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open), there are win-loss records.\n\nLooking at 2008:\n\n- Australian Open: 1-2\n- French Open: 3-4\n- Wimbledon: 1-2\n- US Open: 0-1\n\nTotal Grand Slam matches in 2008: (1+3+1+0) wins = 5, losses= (2+4+2+1)=9. So total wins are 5.\n\nIn 2011:\n\n- Australian Open: 1-2\n- French Open: 2-3\n- Wimbledon: 3-4\n- US Open: 1-2\n\nTotal wins: 1+2+3+1=7, losses: 2+3+4+2=11.\n\nSo in terms of total Grand Slam match wins, 2011 has 7 and 2008 has 5. That makes 2011 the year with more wins than 2008. Are there other years with higher?\n\nLooking at 2013:\n\n- Australian Open: 2-3\n- French Open: 2-3\n- Wimbledon: 4-4\n- US Open: 2-3\n\nTotal wins: 2+2+4+2=10. That's more than both 2008 and 2011.\n\nWait, but the claim says that 2011 and 2008 are the years with the most Grand Slam match wins. However, 2013 has higher wins (10) compared to both. So if 2013 is included in the table, then the claim might not be accurate because 2013 would have more.\n\nWait, looking back at the table data, I think I need to recheck each year's Grand Slam wins:\n\nLet me list out each year and sum up their Grand Slam wins:\n\n- **2008**:\n  - Australian Open: 1 win\n  - French Open: 3 wins\n  - Wimbledon: 1 win\n  - US Open: 0 wins\n  Total: 5 wins\n\n- **2009**:\n  - AO: 1, FO: 0, W: 1, USO: 1 \u2192 total 3\n\n- **2010**:\n  - AO: 0, FO: 0, W: 0, USO: 0 \u2192 total 0 (seems odd, maybe data missing?)\n\nWait, no, looking at the table:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the \"tour level win - loss\" which might include all tournaments, not just Grand Slams. Alternatively, each of the four columns after Year are the Grand Slam results.\n\nSo for 2013:\n\n- AO: 2 wins\n- FO: 2 wins\n- W:4\n- USO:2 \u2192 total 10\n\nWhich is higher than both 2008 and 2011. Therefore, if 2013 has more Grand Slam wins, then the claim that 2011 and 2008 are the top years would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted which columns represent Grand Slam results. Perhaps only specific ones are considered Grand Slams. Let me clarify:\n\nThe four main Grand Slam tournaments are Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. So each year's performance in these four is represented by their respective columns.\n\nSo for 2013, as above, she has more wins than both 2011 and 2008. Therefore, the claim that 2011 and 2008 are the years with the most Grand Slam match wins isn't accurate because 2013 surpasses them.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate:\n\n- **2008**: AO=1, FO=3, W=1, USO=0 \u2192 total 5\n- **2011**: AO=1, FO=2, W=3, USO=1 \u2192 total 7\n- **2013**: AO=2, FO=2, W=4, USO=2 \u2192 total 10\n\nSo yes, 2013 has the highest at 10 wins. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because 2013 had more Grand Slam match wins than both 2011 and 2008.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding what \"most grand slam match win\" means. Maybe it's about how many tournaments she won, not total matches. So in that case, let's see:\n\nLooking at each year, the number of tournaments she might have won (i.e., reached final and won):\n\n- **2008**: Let's check if any of her Grand Slam appearances resulted in wins.\n\nFor example, in 2008, Australian Open: 1 win (probably first round?), but I think that's just the number of matches she won there. To know if she won the tournament, we'd need to see if she reached the final or won it, which isn't directly shown here. The table only shows match wins and losses in each Grand Slam.\n\nTherefore, without knowing whether she actually won any tournaments, perhaps the claim is about total match victories across all Grand Slams that year.\n\nIn that case, 2013 has the highest with 10 matches won across all four Grand Slams. So 2011 (7) and 2008 (5) are not the top two years; 2013 is higher than both.\n\nThus, the claim is false because 2013 had more Grand Slam match wins.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that 2011 and 2008 were the years with the most Grand Slam match wins for Polona Hercog is not accurate based on the provided data. In 2013, she achieved a higher number of Grand Slam match wins compared to both 2011 and 2008.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because in 2013, Polona Hercog had more Grand Slam match wins than in 2011 and 2008.",
