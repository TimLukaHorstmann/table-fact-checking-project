Let me look at the table provided to check this.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the date mentioned, which is 28 March 2009. Scanning through the 'Date' column, I find a row with that exact date on row index 3 (since counting starts from 0). \n\nIn that same row, under the 'Venue' column, it says \"twickenham stoop\", so that matches the claim. Now, checking the score in the 'Score' column for that row, it shows \"22 -12\". That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by this row: the date, venue, and score. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007 , where the score be 22 - 12\". Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check the date mentioned in the claim. The claim says April 6, 2007. Looking at the table, I see that the first few rows have dates like April 8, 2007, March 17, 2007, etc., but I don't see a row with April 6, 2007. So right away, there's no matching date in the table.\n\nNext, let me check if \"twickenham stoop\" is listed as a venue on any date. Scanning through the 'Venue' column, I notice that \"Twickenham Stoop\" appears once, specifically in row 15 with the date March 24, 2007. The score for that game was 22 - 12, which matches the claim's score.\n\nHowever, there are two issues here: \n1. The date in the table is March 24, not April 6.\n2. Even though the venue and score match on a different date, the claim specifies a specific date that doesn't exist in the table.\n\nTherefore, since the exact date mentioned (April 6, 2007) isn't present in the table, the claim can't be fully supported by the data provided. The relevant cells are from row 15 where \"Twickenham Stoop\" is the venue and the score is 22 - 12, but this doesn't align with the date given in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
