    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table of scores from different years and players, along with some details about the courses they played at. The claim is \"Bruce Zabriski score 282 at PGA National Golf Club, Haig & Champion course.\" I need to verify if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any entry related to Bruce Zabriski. Scanning down the rows, I notice that in row 10 (assuming the first data row after headers is row 0), there's an entry for \"bruce zabriski\" with a score of 282. The course listed here is \"pga national golf club, haig & champion course.\" That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nI need to ensure that all parts of the claim are correctly represented in the table. The player's name is spelled as \"bruce zabriski\" in lowercase letters, but since names aren't case-sensitive for this kind of verification, it still counts as a match. The score is exactly 282, so there\u2019s no discrepancy there.\n\nNext, I check if the course details align. The table lists the location as \"pga national golf club, haig & champion course,\" which matches the claim's description. There's a slight variation in the use of ampersand versus \"and,\" but that doesn't affect the meaning and should be considered the same.\n\nTo make sure there are no other entries for Bruce Zabriski with different scores or courses, I'll quickly scan through the rest of the table. However, from what I can see, this is the only entry for him in the provided data.\n\nTherefore, all elements of the claim\u2014player's name, score, and course\u2014are accurately represented in row 10 of the table. This means the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 9,\n       \"column_name\": \"player\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 9,\n       \"column_name\": \"score\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 9,\n       \"column_name\": \"course\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the highest championship score be 284 by steve brady in 1993",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a table of data with several columns: Year, Player, Score, and others. The claim they want me to verify is \"the highest championship score be 284 by Steve Brady in 1993.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It looks like each row represents a different year, listing the player who had the highest score that year, along with their score and other details.\n\nThe claim specifies two main points: the highest score is 284, achieved by Steve Brady in 1993. So I need to check if both these pieces of information are correct according to the table.\n\nLooking through the rows, each entry under the 'Score' column has numbers followed sometimes by 'po', which might indicate something like par or over. But for now, I'll focus on the numerical part.\n\nI'll go row by row starting from the top:\n\n- 2023: Score is 276.\n- 2022: 274.\n- ... (skipping ahead)\n- When I reach 1993, which should be one of the earlier rows since years are in descending order. Scanning down, I see a row where Year is 1993. The Player there is Steve Brady, and the Score is listed as 284.\n\nSo that matches the claim. Now, to ensure this is indeed the highest score, I need to check all other scores in the table to make sure none are higher than 284. \n\nLooking through each 'Score' value:\n\n- The next rows after 1993 have lower scores: 282, 276, and so on.\n- As I go further down into earlier years like 1990s, the scores are around 275 or less.\n\nWait a minute, I just noticed another row with a higher score. Let me check again. Oh, looking back up at the table, there's a row for 1994 where the Score is 286. That's actually higher than 284. So this would contradict the claim that 284 was the highest.\n\nHold on, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\n- 2023: 276\n- 2022: 274\n- ...\n- 1994: Score is 286\n- 1993: 284\n\nSo 286 is higher than 284, meaning the claim that 284 was the highest is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the years. Let me verify the rows again. The table starts with the latest year at the top and goes backward. So after 1993 comes 1994? That doesn't make sense because 1993 is before 1994. Hmm, perhaps the table is ordered from most recent to past, so earlier years come later in the table.\n\nWait no, looking at the data:\n\n- The first row after the header is Year 2023, then 2022, etc., going down each year until 1977. So yes, 1994 would appear before 1993 in the table because it's more recent.\n\nWait no, that can't be right. If the years are descending from top to bottom, then 1994 comes after 2023, which is correct as per the table structure. So yes, 1994 is above 1993 in the table because it's a later year.\n\nTherefore, since there's a higher score (286) in 1994 than 284 in 1993, the claim that 284 was the highest is false. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Steve Brady scored 284 in 1993 as the highest championship score. Checking the table, there's a higher score of 286 by Loren Roberts in 1994, so the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of data about championships, including the year, winner, course, and score. The claim is that \"the lowest championship score be a tie between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman at 205.\" I need to check if this claim is true or false by looking at the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being claimed. It says there was a tie for the lowest score of 205 between two players: John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman. So I need to find if both these players have a score of 205, which is indeed the lowest in the dataset.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year with details about that championship. The columns are Year, Winner, Course, and Score. So relevant columns for this claim would be 'Winner' and 'Score'.\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'Score' column to find instances of 205 because that's the score mentioned in the claim. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1978: Mike Zack, Score 209\n- 1979: Loren Roberts, 212\n- 1980: John Jackson, 205 \u2192 This is one instance of 205.\n- 1981: Ted O'Rourke, 210\n- 1982: Darrell Kestner, 213 po (I think 'po' might stand for something like playoff or maybe it's a typo)\n- 1983: Victor Tortorici, 214\n- 1984: Fred Funk, 206\n- 1985: John Fiedler, 211\n- 1986: Robert Thompson, 209\n- 1987: Not listed here but going back to the table provided. Wait, in the given data, I need to check all rows.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again, the years go from 1977 up to 2023? No, wait, the initial data seems cut off, but perhaps it's just the first part. From what I can see, in the given rows:\n\nLooking for score 205. Let's check each row:\n\n- The last few rows include:\n   - 1980: John Jackson, Score 205\n   - 1977: Mike Zack, 209\n   - 1978: Larry Griffin, 209\n   - ... and others.\n\nWait, I think in the table provided, there's a row for 1980 with John Jackson and score 205. Also, looking through other rows, is there another instance of 205? Let me check each one:\n\nLooking at row indices (assuming starting from 0), let's see:\n\n- Row 0: 2023, Michael Jordan, Pga Championship, 264\n- ... (I think the table starts in 1977, but perhaps the initial rows are not shown here). Wait, looking back at the user message, the provided HTML table has rows from 1977 up to 2023. Let me count:\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the table, it's a bit unclear because the tbody starts with multiple tr elements. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about two players: John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman both having 205 as their scores, and that being the lowest.\n\nSo first, check if there are two entries with score 205.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For John Jackson: In row where Year is 1980, Winner is John Jackson, Score is 205.\n- For Webb Heintzelman: Let me look for his name. Scanning through, I see a row in 1973? Wait no, looking at the provided data:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go through each row carefully.\n\nLooking at each row's 'Winner' and 'Score':\n\nI'll list them out as per the table:\n\nRow indices (assuming starting from 0):\n\nRow 0: 2023, Michael Jordan,PGA Championship,264\nRow1:2022,Jon Rahm,Masters,277\nRow2:2021,Collin Morikawa,U.S. Open,279\n... and so on until the rows starting from 1977.\n\nWait no, looking at the provided table in the user's message, it seems that the years go from recent to older. Let me correct this:\n\nLooking back, I think the table is structured with Year descending from 2023 down to perhaps earlier years, but the exact start isn't clear. However, within the visible data, let's check each row for 'Score' = 205 and Winners as John Jackson or Webb Heintzelman.\n\nFrom the provided rows:\n\nLooking at the scores, I see that in some rows, the score is mentioned with a 'po', like \"213 po\". Not sure what that stands for, but perhaps it's not relevant here. Let me focus on numeric scores.\n\nIn row 1980: John Jackson, Score 205 \u2192 This is one instance.\n\nLooking for another instance of 205. Checking other rows:\n\n- Row for 1973: Maybe? Wait, no, in the provided data, perhaps it's 1980 and earlier years. Let me check all visible rows:\n\nWait, I think within the given table, the only score of 205 is from John Jackson in 1980. I don't see another entry with score 205. So that would mean there isn't a tie between two players; only one player has the score of 205.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe Webb Heintzelman also has a 205 somewhere else in the table. Let me scan for his name:\n\nLooking through each 'Winner' cell:\n\n- Michael Jordan\n- Jon Rahm\n- Collin Morikawa\n- ...\n- I don't see Webb Heintzelman in any row with a score of 205.\n\nWait, perhaps he's listed elsewhere, but based on the provided table, I can only go by what's visible. If the table doesn't include him with a 205, then the claim is false because there isn't another player with that score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed his name. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking through each Winner:\n\nRow 0: Michael Jordan\nRow1: Jon Rahm\nRow2: Collin Morikawa\nRow3: ...\nContinuing down, until perhaps the older years. Let's say around row indices where Year is 1977 or so.\n\nWait, in the table provided by the user, I see that towards the end, there are rows like:\n\n<tr><td>1980</td><td>John Jackson</td><td>Pebble Beach Golf Links</td><td>205</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1979</td><td>Loren Roberts</td><td>Merion Golf Club</td><td>212</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1981</td><td>Ted O'Rourke</td><td>Augusta National Golf Club</td><td>210</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1982</td><td>Darrell Kestner</td><td>Pebble Beach Golf Links</td><td>213 po</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1983</td><td>Vicente Tortorici</td><td>Huntington Harbour Country Club</td><td>214</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1984</td><td>Fred Funk</td><td>Pebble Beach Golf Links</td><td>206</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1985</td><td>John Fiedler</td><td>Mt.

There's no other player with that exact score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman tied for the lowest championship score of 205. However, upon examining the table:\n\n1. **John Jackson** achieved a score of 205 in the 1980 championship at Pebble Beach Golf Links.\n2. There is no entry for Webb Heintzelman with a score of 205 in the provided data.\n\nSince only John Jackson has a recorded score of 205, there's no tie as claimed. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"all scores from 1996 - 2013 be at courses in port st lucie, florida\" is true based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are Year, Name, Course, and Score. Each row represents a different year from 1977 up to 2013. \n\nThe claim states that all scores between 1996 and 2013 should be from courses in Port St. Lucie, Florida. So I need to check each year within this range (from 1996 to 2013) and see where the courses are located.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- For 1996: The course is \"thorny lea golf club\" in Brockton, Massachusetts. That's not Port St. Lucie.\n- 1997: Same as above, still in Brockton.\n- 1998: Also at Thorny Lea in Brockton.\n- ...\nI notice that all the entries from 1977 to some point are at Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton. Then, looking further up, I see that starting from 2000 onwards, some courses change. Wait, but actually in the table provided, the latest year is 2013? Let me check.\n\nWait no, the table only goes up to 2013 as per the last row:\n\nLooking back at the table, I see that after a certain point, the course changes to \"pga national\" and \"singer island\", both in Port St. Lucie, Florida. For example:\n\n- Year 2005: pga national, port st lucie\n- 2006: same\n...\nUp until 2013.\n\nSo from 2005 to 2013, the courses are indeed in Port St. Lucie. However, what about the years between 1996 and 2004? Let's check:\n\n- Year 1996: Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton\n- 1997: Same\n...\nContinuing this way up to 2004: All these entries are still at Thorny Lea in Brockton.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"from 1996 - 2013\". That means all scores in those years should be from Port St. Lucie courses. However, from 1996 to 2004 (assuming), they are still at Thorny Lea in Brockton, which is in Massachusetts.\n\nSo the claim isn't entirely true because not all scores between 1996-2013 are from Port St. Lucie courses\u2014only those starting from a certain year onward. Therefore, the relevant cells would include any rows where the course isn't Port St. Lucie within that time frame to show the claim is false.\n\nSo I'll identify all rows between 1996-2013 and check their Course locations. If any of them are not in Port St. Lucie, then the answer is FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe years from 1996 onwards until about 2005 have courses in Brockton, Massachusetts. For example, row indices (assuming starting from 0):\n\n- Year 1996: Maybe row index 38? Wait, let me recount the rows to get accurate indices.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the rows correctly. The table starts at 1977 as row 0, then each subsequent year increments the row by one until 2013. So:\n\nYear 1977: row 0\n...\nYear 2013: row 36 (since 2013 - 1977 = 36 years)\n\nSo for 1996, that would be year 1996 - 1977 = 19 years later. So row index 19.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps I can just check the courses in each year from 1996 onward:\n\n- 1996: Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton, MA\n- 1997: Same\n...\nContinuing until, say, 2004: same location.\n\nThen starting at some point, perhaps 2005, it changes to Port St. Lucie.\n\nSo rows from 1996 (row index 19) up to maybe row 30 are still in Brockton.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because not all scores between 1996-2013 are from courses in Port St. Lucie. The relevant cells showing this would be any of those rows where the course is in Brockton during that time frame.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that all scores from 1996 to 2013 were from courses in Port St. Lucie, Florida, is false. Several entries within this period are from Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, Massachusetts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Time Frame:** The claim covers years 1996 through 2013.\n2. **Check Each Year's Course Location:**\n   - Years 1996 to 2004: Courses are at Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, Massachusetts.\n   - Starting around 2005 onwards: Courses shift to Port St. Lucie, Florida (e.g., PGA National).\n3. **Conclusion:** Since not all courses within the specified years are in Port St. Lucie, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. Several scores between 1996 and 2013 were from courses outside of Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nTo provide specific evidence, any row where the course is listed as \"Thorny Lea Golf Club\" in Brockton during 1996-2013 would show this. For example:\n\n- **Year: 1996**\n  - Course: Thorny Lea Golf Club\n  - Location: Brockton, Massachusetts\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nAny row where the year is between 1996 and 2013 and the course is not in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because several scores between 1996 and 2013 were from courses outside of Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 4 championship score at la quinta , california , in 1991 - 1994\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. It's saying that between the years 1991 and 1994 (inclusive), there were four championships held at La Quinta, California. So, I need to check the table for entries where the location is La Quinta, California, and the year falls within 1991-1994.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with details about the championship score. The relevant columns here are \"Year\" and \"Location\".\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows that fall between 1991 and 1994:\n\n- 1991: Row index 20\n- 1992: Row index 19\nWait, actually, I need to check the order of the years in the table. Let me look at the Year column from top to bottom.\n\nThe years go from 1977 (top) up to 2023 (bottom). So, rows are ordered from oldest to newest.\n\nNow, checking each year:\n\n- 1994: Looking through the rows, row index 5 has 1994 as the Year. The location is La Quinta, California.\n- 1993: I don't see a 1993 entry in the table provided; it jumps from 1992 to 1994.\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow indices go from 0 (top) to, let's count how many there are. The last row is 1977, which would be row index... Let me see: From 1977 up, each subsequent year increments until 2023.\n\nWait, no, the table starts at 1977 and goes up to 2023, but I'm looking for 1991-1994. So, in the provided data, let's list out the years:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year not given (header)\nRow 1: 2023\nRow 2: 2022\n...\nWait, actually, no. The table starts with the most recent year at the top? Because in the data provided, the first row under the header is for 2023, then 2022, down to 1977.\n\nSo, the rows are ordered from latest to earliest. So, row index 0 would be 2023, row 1: 2022, ..., and the last row (row index 46) is 1977.\n\nTherefore, I need to find all rows where Year is between 1991 and 1994. Let's calculate their positions.\n\nSince each year decrements by one from 2023 down, the number of years between 2023 and 1991 is 2023-1991 = 32 years. So row index for 1991 would be 32 (since starting at 0: 2023 is 0, 2022 is 1,..., 1991 is 32). Then:\n\n- 1994: 2023 - 1994 = 29 \u2192 row index 29\n- 1993: row index 30\n- 1992: row index 31\n- 1991: row index 32\n\nNow, checking each of these rows:\n\nFor each year from 1991 to 1994 (inclusive), I need to see if the location is La Quinta, California.\n\nLet's go through them one by one.\n\nRow index 29: Year 1994. Location: \"la quinta , california\". So that's a match.\nRow index 30: Year 1993. Looking at row 30 (Year=1993), the location is Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton, MA.\nRow index 31: Year 1992. Location: \"la quinta , california\".\nRow index 32: Year 1991. Location: \"la quinta , california\".\n\nWait, but according to the table:\n\nLooking at row index 5 (Year=1994), it's La Quinta, CA.\n\nBut I think I made a mistake earlier because when counting from the top, each row is descending in years. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong about the row indices for those years.\n\nLet me recount properly.\n\nThe table starts at 2023 (row index 0), then 2022 (1), ..., down to 1977 (46). Therefore:\n\nFor each year Y, its row index is 2023 - Y. So:\n\n- 1994: row index = 2023 - 1994 = 29\n- 1993: 2023 - 1993 = 30\n- 1992: 2023 - 1992 = 31\n- 1991: 2023 - 1991 = 32\n\nNow, checking each of these rows:\n\nRow index 29 (Year=1994): Location is \"la quinta , california\" \u2192 match.\nRow index 30 (1993): Looking at row 30. Let me check the data.\n\nWait, in the provided table, I don't have all the years listed; only some are present. So perhaps not every year is represented. For example, from the data given:\n\n- Row 0: 2023\n- Row 1: 2022\n- ...\nBut the user hasn't provided the entire table up to 1977; it's just a snippet.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided only a portion of the table. So I can't accurately determine the row indices for each year beyond what's shown.\n\nThis complicates things because without knowing all the years and their corresponding locations, I can't be certain about every year between 1991-1994.\n\nHowever, based on the data provided:\n\nLooking at the rows where Year is in 1991-1994:\n\nRow index 5: Year=1994, Location=\"la quinta , california\"\nRow index 6: Year=1993? Wait, no\u2014looking again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The table provided starts from a certain point, but not necessarily covering all years. For example:\n\nLooking at the data, it's possible that only specific years have entries. So, in the given data snippet, let me check which years are present between 1991-1994.\n\nFrom the provided rows:\n\n- Row index 5: Year=1994\n- Row index 6: Year=1993? Or is it another year?\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me list out all the years in the table and their locations to see how many times La Quinta, CA appears between 1991-1994.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index: Year | Location\n0: 2023 | Pebble Beach, CA\n1: 2022 | Augusta, GA\n...\n5: 1994 | La Quinta, California\n6: 1993 | Augusta, GA? Or is it another location?\nWait, perhaps I should go row by row as per the data provided.\n\nActually, since the user hasn't provided all rows, but only a snippet, I can't accurately determine each year's location. Therefore, perhaps focusing on the entries that are present in the provided table between 1991-1994.\n\nIn the given data:\n\nRow index 5: Year=1994, Location=La Quinta\nRow index 6: Year=1993, Location=Augusta, GA (assuming)\nBut without seeing all rows, I can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is continuous from 2023 down to 1977, with each row representing consecutive years. So:\n\nFrom the top (row 0: 2023), each subsequent row decreases by one year.\n\nThus, row index = 2023 - Year\n\nSo for Year=1994 \u2192 row index 29\nYear=1993 \u2192 30\nYear=1992 \u219231\nYear=1991\u219232\n\nNow, in the provided data snippet, do these rows exist? Let me see how many rows are given.\n\nThe user's table starts at row 0: 2023 and goes down. The last row in the provided data is Year=1977 (row index 46).\n\nBut the user hasn't listed all rows; only some are shown. Therefore, without seeing rows 29-32, I can't be certain of their locations.\n\nHowever, from the snippet provided, I can see that:\n\nRow index 5: Year=1994 \u2192 La Quinta\nIf row indices continue, then perhaps between 1991-1994, there are four entries. But in reality, each year is a separate row.\n\nBut without knowing all rows, it's impossible to say exactly how many times La Quinta appears between those years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to count based on visible data. Let me see:\n\nIn the provided table snippet, I can see Year=1994 at La Quinta. Any others?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow index 5: 1994 \u2192 La Quinta\nIs there a row for 1993? Not in the snippet.\nSimilarly, 1992 and 1991 may or may not be present.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is based on the number of times \"la quinta\" appears in the table provided. Let's check:\n\nLooking at all rows in the user's table:\n\nRow 0: Pebble Beach\nRow 1: Augusta\n...\nRow5: La Quinta (1994)\nRow6: ?\nAssuming that in the provided data, only row5 has \"La Quinta\" between 1991-1994.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is once.\n\nBut to be precise, without seeing all rows, it's impossible. However, based on the given snippet, there's at least one occurrence (1994). If other years in that range also have La Quinta, but not shown, we can't count them.\n\nHence, perhaps the answer is once.\n</think>\n\nThe event was held at \"La Quinta\" in 1 year between 1991 and 1994 based on the provided data.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{1}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"the highest championship score be a tie between Robert Thompson and Mike West at 211.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, there are multiple entries with different scores. My task is to check if both Robert Thompson and Mike West have the same highest score of 211.\n\nStarting with Robert Thompson: I'll scan through each row for his name. I find him in 1986 with a score of 209, not 211. Next, I look for Mike West. Checking the rows, I see Mike West is listed in 1979 with a score of 212. \n\nWait, but the claim mentions a tie at 211. Neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West have a score of 211 according to the table. Instead, Robert has 209 and Mike has 212.\n\nSo, there's no tie between them at 211 because their scores are different, and neither is exactly 211. Additionally, looking through all rows, I don't see any instance where a player scored exactly 211, except for Fred Funk in 1985 with 206, which isn't close.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both have the highest score of 211 as a tie is incorrect. The relevant cells are the rows containing Robert Thompson (row 47) and Mike West (row 33), each showing their respective scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to verify the claim: \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided and identify the relevant columns. The key pieces of information needed are:\n\n1. **Year**: To find if Fred Funk played in 1984.\n2. **Player Name**: To confirm it's Fred Funk.\n3. **Score**: To check if the score was 206.\n\nStarting with the year, I'll scan through each row to find the one where the Year is 1984. Once I locate that row, I can then check the Player Name and Score in the same row.\n\nLooking at the table, here's what I found:\n\n- The rows are listed from 2023 down to 1977. So, I'll go through each until I find 1984.\n- When I reach the year 1984, which is in row index 4 (counting starts at 0), I see the following details:\n  - **Player Name**: Fred Funk\n  - **Score**: 206\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim. The score of 206 by Fred Funk in 1984 seems to be accurate based on this data.\n\nNow, to ensure that 206 is indeed the lowest score, I'll briefly check other scores around that period. For example:\n- In 1983 (row index 5), the score was 214.\n- In 1985 (row index 3), it was 211.\n\nThese are higher than 206, supporting that 206 is the lowest in the provided data. \n\nTherefore, both the player and the score match the claim for the year 1984, making the statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Player Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to verify the claim: \"Bruce Zabriski score 284 at Thorny Lea Golf Club.\" To do this, I'll refer to the provided table and check each part of the claim against it.\n\nFirst, I should look for Bruce Zabriski in the table. Scanning through the names in the \"Name\" column, I spot his name in row 2 (assuming rows are zero-indexed; actually, looking back, the first data row is 0). Wait, let me recount: The header is row -1 perhaps? Or maybe the first actual data row is row 0. Let me check the table structure again.\n\nWait, the table starts with a header row, then the data rows begin. So the first data row is index 0. Looking at each name:\n\nRow 0: \"bruce zabriski\"\nYes, that's Bruce Zabriski. Now, checking his score in the \"score\" column for that same row.\n\nThe score listed is 284? Let me see. In row 0 under the \"score\" column, it says 284. So far, this matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm where he scored this. The \"golf_course\" column in row 0 shows \"thorny lea golf club.\" That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait a minute though; looking again, is the score indeed 284? Let me check carefully. Row 0: Bruce Zabriski, 1985? No, wait no\u2014actually, looking at the table data:\n\nLooking back, in row index 0 (assuming it's the first data row), I see \"bruce zabriski\" with a score of 284 and golf course \"thorny lea golf club.\" So that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me check all relevant rows. Sometimes, names might appear in multiple rows, so I need to make sure there isn't another Bruce Zabriski elsewhere with a different score or location.\n\nLooking through other rows: I see \"bruce zabriski\" only once in row 0. The other entries have different players.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by row 0 for all relevant details.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bruce Zabriski scored 284 at Thorny Lea Golf Club. Checking the table:\n\n- **Name**: Bruce Zabriski is found in row 0.\n- **Score**: In the same row, his score is listed as 284.\n- **Golf Course**: The location is Thorny Lea Golf Club.\n\nAll parts of the claim are accurately reflected in row 0.
