    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table in HTML format is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim is: \"the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography do not go to william ivey long.\" So, essentially, it's stating that William Ivey Long did not receive the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2005.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. There are several rows of data from different awards, both Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards, all in the year 2005.\n\nI need to find the row(s) that correspond to the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography because that's what the claim is about. Scanning through the table, I see rows with award names as \"drama desk award.\" Let me go through each of those:\n\n1. The first drama desk award row has category \"outstanding revival of a musical,\" nominee same as category, result \"won.\" Not relevant to choreography.\n2. The second drama desk award is for \"outstanding choreography\" with nominee Jerry Mitchell and result \"won.\"\n3. The third drama desk award is for \"outstanding costume design\" with William Ivey Long nominated but not won.\n\nSo, focusing on the second row here: it's about outstanding choreography, awarded to Jerry Mitchell, who won. Therefore, this directly answers whether William Ivey Long received that specific award.\n\nThe claim says that he did not receive it, which aligns with the table because it shows Jerry Mitchell won, and William was nominated for a different category (costume design) but didn't win there either.\n\nNow, to make sure I'm not missing anything else, let me check all rows again. There are other Tony Awards in the table, but since the claim is about Drama Desk, those can be ignored. The relevant cells are from the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography.\n\nSo, the key points:\n- Year: 2005 (matches)\n- Award: Drama Desk\n- Category: Outstanding Choreography\n- Nominee: Jerry Mitchell (not William Ivey Long)\n- Result: Won\n\nTherefore, since William Ivey Long is not listed as the nominee for this category, and another person won it, the claim holds true.\n\nI should also note that William was nominated in a different category (costume design) but didn't win there either. However, that's unrelated to the specific award mentioned in the claim.\n\nIn summary, the relevant cells are from row 5 (index starting at 0), specifically:\n- column \"award\": Drama Desk\n- column \"category\": outstanding choreography\n- column \"nominee\": Jerry Mitchell\n\nThese confirm that William Ivey Long did not receive this particular award.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Jerry Mitchell won the Outstanding Choreography award, not William Ivey Long.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long.\" Hmm, there might be a typo with \"qilliam\" instead of \"william,\" but I'll keep that in mind as possible user error.\n\nFirst, let's parse the key elements from the claim:\n- Year: 2005\n- Award: Tony Award\n- Category: Best Costume Design\n- Nominee: William Ivey Long\n\nNow, I need to check the table for these details. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at row 3 in the table (index starting from 0), it has:\n- year: 2005\n- award: tony award\n- category: best costume design\n- nominee: william ivey long\n- result: nominated\n\nThis seems to match all parts of the claim except for the spelling of \"William.\" The claim says \"qilliam,\" which is likely a typo. Since the table has \"william ivey long,\" I'll consider that as correct and proceed.\n\nAdditionally, row 6 in the table (index starting from 0) also mentions William Ivey Long but under Drama Desk Award. However, since the claim specifically mentions Tony Award, only row 3 is relevant for verification.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is row index 3, column \"nominee.\" Therefore, the claim holds true despite the minor spelling discrepancy.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies William Ivey Long as a nominee in the best costume design category at the 2005 Tony Awards.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are year, award, category, nominee, and result. So each row represents an award nomination with its outcome.\n\nThe claim mentions Jerry Mitchell winning a Tony Award as one of two winners. To verify this, I need to check how many times he won a Tony Award in 2005.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. Row 2: It's about the Tony Award for Best Choreography. The nominee is Jerry Mitchell and the result is \"won\". So that's one win.\n2. Are there other rows where Jerry Mitchell is a winner of a Tony Award?\n\nChecking all other rows, I see another row (Row 5) with Drama Desk Awards. There, he won Outstanding Choreography, but that's not a Tony Award.\n\nSo in the Tony Awards category, only Row 2 shows a win for Jerry Mitchell. Therefore, he only has one Tony Award win according to this table.\n\nThe claim says he was \"1 of 2\" winners, which would mean there are two people who won Tony Awards. But looking at the table, I don't see another person winning a Tony in 2005 besides Jerry Mitchell. The other results for Tony Awards either have \"nominated\" or same category as award (like Row 1 and others). So it seems only Jerry Mitchell has a 'won' result in the Tony Awards.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he is one of two winners isn't supported because there's only one winner shown here. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and identify its components. It's saying that Jerry Mitchell was one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award. So, I need to check two things: how many nominations there were for Drama Desk Awards in total, and whether Jerry Mitchell was among them.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several awards from 2005, including both Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards. Each row has details about the year, award type, category, nominee, and result.\n\nI'll focus on the rows where the \"award\" column is \"drama desk award\". Let's go through each of these rows:\n\n1. The first Drama Desk Award row (row index 4) is for \"outstanding revival of a musical\", with the same category as the nominee. The result was \"won\".\n2. The second Drama Desk Award row (row index 5) is for \"outstanding choreography\" by Jerry Mitchell, and he won.\n3. The third Drama Desk Award row (row index 6) is for \"outstanding costume design\" by William Ivey Long, which was a nomination.\n\nSo, looking at the nominees under Drama Desk Awards:\n- For outstanding revival of a musical: It's listed as the same category name, but that seems to be an award given without a specific person nominee. So, maybe this isn't a personal nomination but rather for the production itself.\n- Jerry Mitchell is nominated in the choreography category and won.\n- William Ivey Long was nominated for costume design.\n\nWait, so how many nominees are there? The claim says \"1 of 3 nominees\", implying three people were nominated. But from the table, we only have two specific nominees: Jerry Mitchell (who won) and William Ivey Long (nominated). The first Drama Desk row might not be a personal nomination but an award for the revival itself, which isn't a person.\n\nTherefore, there are only two individuals nominated for Drama Desk Awards in this table. Since the claim states that Jerry Mitchell was one of three nominees, it doesn't hold because there were only two people nominated. So, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"willam ivey long win the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Name**: willam ivey long (I notice a possible typo here; it might be \"William Ivey Long.\")\n2. **Year**: 2005\n3. **Award**: Drama Desk Award\n4. **Category**: Outstanding Choreography\n5. **Result**: Win\n\nNow, let's go through the table row by row to see if any entries match these criteria.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Tony Award\n  - Category: Best revival of a musical\n  - Nominee: Best revival of a musical (this seems like the category itself, not an individual)\n  - Result: Won\n\nThis row doesn't mention William Ivey Long or Choreography.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Tony Award\n  - Category: Best performance by a leading actor in a musical\n  - Nominee: Gary Beach\n  - Result: Nominated\n\nAgain, no mention of William Ivey Long or Choreography.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Tony Award\n  - Category: Best choreography\n  - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n  - Result: Won\n\nThis row is about Choreography but under the Tony Awards, not Drama Desk. Also, the nominee is Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Tony Award\n  - Category: Best costume design\n  - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n  - Result: Nominated\n\nHere we have William Ivey Long nominated for Costume Design at the Tony Awards. He didn't win, and this is a different award category.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Drama Desk Award\n  - Category: Outstanding revival of a musical\n  - Nominee: Same as category (outstanding revival...)\n  - Result: Won\n\nNot relevant to William Ivey Long or Choreography.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Drama Desk Award\n  - Category: Outstanding choreography\n  - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n  - Result: Won\n\nThis row mentions the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography, but the nominee is Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Year: 2005\n  - Award: Drama Desk Award\n  - Category: Outstanding costume design\n  - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n  - Result: Nominated\n\nHere, William Ivey Long is nominated for Costume Design at the Drama Desk Awards. He didn't win in this category either.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n- The claim says William Ivey Long won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2005.\n- From the table, in Row 5, Jerry Mitchell won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography. William Ivey Long was only involved in Costume Design categories (Rows 3 and 6), where he was nominated but didn't win.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table that shows William Ivey Long winning a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography.

It has columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents a different nomination or award win from 2005.\n\nThe claim is about a 2005 nominee for best costume design winning the award. So I need to find entries in the table where:\n\n1. The year is 2005.\n2. The category is \"best costume design\" (or its equivalent, like \"outstanding costume design\").\n3. Check if any of these nominees have a result indicating they won.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Best revival of a musical; the nominee and award are the same here, but it's about the musical itself, not a person.\n- Row 1: Leading actor in a musical; Gary Beach was nominated, not related to costume design.\n- Row 2: Best choreography; Jerry Mitchell won. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: Best costume design; William Ivey Long was nominated. Result is \"nominated\", so he didn't win.\n- Rows 4-6 are Drama Desk awards. \n   - Row 4: Outstanding revival of a musical, result is won.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure. The table has columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. It lists various awards from 2005, including both Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards.\n\nThe claim mentions Gary Beach being one of four nominees for a Tony Award. So, my task is to check how many nominees there are for the Tony Awards in the table, specifically looking at whether Gary Beach was among them and if there were exactly three other nominees alongside him.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, but the nominee listed here is \"best revival of a musical,\" which seems like it's referring to the production itself rather than an individual. So this doesn't count as a person nomination.\n2. The second row is where Gary Beach is nominated in the category of Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. He was nominated, according to the result column.\n3. The third row is another Tony Award for Best Choreography won by Jerry Mitchell.\n4. The fourth row lists William Ivey Long as a nominee for Best Costume Design but he was nominated, not won.\n\nSo from the Tony Awards section (rows 0-3), we have:\n\n- Gary Beach (nominated)\n- Jerry Mitchell (won)\n- William Ivey Long (nominated)\n\nThat's three individuals: Gary is one, and there are two others. Wait, that's only three nominees in total for these categories.\n\nWait a second, the claim says Gary was one of four nominees. But according to the table, under Tony Awards, we have:\n\n1. Best Revival of a Musical (the musical itself)\n2. Gary Beach as Leading Actor\n3. Jerry Mitchell for Choreography (won)\n4. William Ivey Long for Costume Design\n\nBut in terms of individuals nominated, it's Gary, Jerry, and William\u2014three people. The first row isn't an individual nominee but the show itself.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the nominees under Tony Awards:\n\n- Row 0: category is Best Revival, nominee is \"best revival...\", not a person.\n- Row 1: Gary Beach nominated\n- Row 2: Jerry Mitchell won\n- Row 3: William Ivey Long nominated\n\nSo total individual nominees for Tony Awards are Gary (nominated), Jerry (won, so he was a nominee too), and William (nominated). That's three people. So the claim says Gary is one of four nominees, but according to this, it's only three.\n\nWait, maybe there's another row I'm missing? Let me check all rows again.\n\nRows 0-3 are Tony Awards:\n\nRow 0: Best Revival, nominee is the musical.\nRow 1: Leading Actor, Gary Beach (nominated)\nRow 2: Choreography, Jerry Mitchell (won, so he was a nominee)\nRow 3: Costume Design, William Ivey Long (nominated)\n\nSo individual nominees for Tony Awards are three people. Therefore, the claim that Gary is one of four nominees would be incorrect because there were only three.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the categories. The first row's category is Best Revival, and the nominee is listed as \"best revival...\", which might imply that it's a category where multiple shows are nominated, each as an entity. But in this table, it's only one show. So maybe the number of nominees isn't four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting because row 0 is for Best Revival and counts as a nomination, but since it's not a person, does it count towards the total? The claim specifies \"nominee,\" which could refer to individual people or productions. If we consider only individual nominees, then it's three: Gary, Jerry, William.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Gary was one of four would be false because there are only three individuals nominated in Tony Awards categories here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award. Upon examining the table, under the \"Tony award\" category, we find three individual nominees: Gary Beach (nominated), Jerry Mitchell (won), and William Ivey Long (nominated). The first row refers to a production nomination, not an individual. Therefore, there are only three individual Tony Award nominees listed, making the claim FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where \"award\" is \"tony award.\"\n   - Rows 0-3 in the table pertain to Tony Awards.\n   \n2. **Count Individual Nominees**:\n   - Row 1: Gary Beach (nominated)\n   - Row 2: Jerry Mitchell (won, hence nominated)\n   - Row 3: William Ivey Long (nominated)\n\n3. **Determine Total Nominees**: Only three individuals are nominated for Tony Awards.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**: The claim states four nominees, but only three are present.

I need to determine if the claim \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards. To verify this, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries related to Jerry Mitchell and the Tony Awards.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. The relevant information will be in the \"nominee\" column where it's \"jerry mitchell\" and the \"award\" being \"tony award.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: This is about the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, but the nominee is the same as the category name, not Jerry Mitchell. So this isn't relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Gary Beach was nominated in a leading actor category for a Tony, but that's not Jerry Mitchell either.\n3. **Row 2**: Here we go. The award is a Tony Award for Best Choreography, and the nominee is Jerry Mitchell. The result is \"won.\" So this counts as one Tony win for Jerry Mitchell.\n4. **Row 3**: This is about William Ivey Long's nomination in costume design; not relevant to our claim.\n5. **Row 4**: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical, but the nominee is the category name again, so no.\n6. **Row 5**: Another Drama Desk Award, this time for Outstanding Choreography by Jerry Mitchell. But wait, the award here is a Drama Desk Award, not a Tony. So even though he won, it doesn't count towards the Tony count.\n7. **Row 6**: Again, William Ivey Long's nomination under Drama Desk for costume design; irrelevant.\n\nSo from this, only row 2 shows Jerry Mitchell winning a Tony Award. The other win in row 5 is for a different award (Drama Desk), so it doesn't apply to the claim about Tony Awards.\n\nTherefore, the claim says he won two Tony Awards, but according to the table, he only has one.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table and the claim. The table lists various awards from two categories: Tony Award and Drama Desk Award. For each entry, it provides details like the year, award name, category, nominee, and result (whether they won or were nominated).\n\nThe claim is about Jerry Mitchell being nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. So, I need to focus on entries where the award is \"drama desk award\" and the nominee is \"jerry mitchell\". \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rows 4, 5, and 6 are Drama Desk Awards.\n- Row 4: Outstanding Revival of a Musical - result is 'won', but the nominee here is the category name itself, not Jerry Mitchell. So this doesn't count.\n- Row 5: Outstanding Choreography - nominee is Jerry Mitchell, and the result is 'won'. This counts as one nomination (even though he won).\n- Row 6: Outstanding Costume Design - nominee is William Ivey Long, so this isn't relevant.\n\nWait a second, that's only one nomination for Jerry Mitchell in Drama Desk Awards. The claim says he was nominated three times. So where are the other two nominations?\n\nLooking back at the table, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me check all rows again:\n\n- Rows 0: Tony Award - Best Revival of a Musical - nominee is the category itself, not Jerry.\n- Row 1: Tony Award - Leading Actor in a Musical - Gary Beach, so no.\n- Row 2: Tony Award - Best Choreography - Jerry Mitchell, result 'won'. So this is another nomination for Jerry, but it's under Tony Award, not Drama Desk. The claim specifies Drama Desk, so this doesn't count towards the three nominations.\n\nWait, so in Drama Desk Awards, only row 5 (index 4) has Jerry Mitchell as a nominee with a result of 'won'. Rows 0-6 don't have any other Drama Desk Award entries for Jerry Mitchell beyond that one. So, he was nominated once, not three times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Jerry Mitchell was only nominated once for a Drama Desk Award, specifically in Outstanding Choreography where he won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell was nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- Only one entry lists Jerry Mitchell as a nominee under a Drama Desk Award (row 5), and it resulted in a win.\n\nSince there are no other nominations for him under Drama Desk Awards, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. The rows are from index 0 to 6.\n\nThe claim mentions Gary Beach winning one of four Tony Awards. So, I need to check two things: how many times Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony and if he won any of them.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find all entries where the nominee is Gary Beach. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1 (index 0): Not relevant; nominee is \"best revival...\" which isn't a person.\n- Row 2 (index 1): Nominee is Gary Beach, result is 'nominated'.\n- Rows after that: No other mentions of Gary Beach.\n\nSo, Gary Beach was nominated once for a Tony Award in the category of Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. The result was 'nominated', not 'won'.\n\nNow, checking how many Tony Awards were won by anyone. Looking at each row where award is 'tony award':\n\n- Row 0: Result is 'won'.\n- Row 2: Result is 'won' (Jerry Mitchell).\n- Row 5: Award is Drama Desk, so skip.\n- Row 6: Also Drama Desk.\n\nSo, there are two Tony Awards won in the table. Therefore, even if Gary Beach had won, he couldn't be one of four winners because only two were awarded here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"1 of 4 winner\". That suggests that among four nominees, Gary was a winner. But according to the table, Gary was nominated once and didn't win. Also, in the Tony awards section, there are three entries:\n\n- Best Revival: won\n- Best Actor (Gary): nominated\n- Best Choreography: won\n\nSo only two wins for Tony. Therefore, Gary wasn't a winner at all; he was just one of the nominees. So the claim is incorrect on both counts: he didn't win any Tony, and there weren't four winners.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach won one of four Tony Awards. However, according to the table, Gary Beach was nominated but did not win a Tony Award. Additionally, there were only two Tony Awards won in 2005 as per the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
