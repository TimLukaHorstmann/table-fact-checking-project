    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with data about Adelaide United matches and a specific claim: \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval.\" I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to. The claim has two main components:\n1. Adelaide United played a match.\n2. This match was attended by 25,039 people at Adelaide Oval.\n\nI need to check if both these pieces of information are present in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like \"Date\", \"Home Team\", \"Away Team\", \"Score\", and \"Crowd\". The relevant details for this claim would be under \"Crowd\" and \"Venue\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Adelaide United is either the home or away team and if they played at Adelaide Oval. \n\nStarting from Row 18 (since counting starts at 0, it's actually index 17). The details here are:\n- Date: 28 December 2007\n- Home Team: Adelaide United\n- Away Team: Sydney FC\n- Score: 1 - 3\n- Crowd: 25039\n- Venue: Adelaide Oval\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim. Adelaide United was the home team, the crowd size is 25,039, and it took place at Adelaide Oval.\n\nNext, I'll verify if there are any other rows where Adelaide United played at Adelaide Oval with a crowd of 25,039. Scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see any other instances matching these specifics.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 18 (index 17). The relevant cells are:\n- Crowd: 25039\n- Venue: Adelaide Oval\n\nSince all parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table, the answer is TRUE. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, listing the relevant row and columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like Home Team, Away Team, Date, Result, etc., but the most relevant columns for this claim are probably \"Home\", \"Away\", and \"Venue\". The claim is about Sydney FC playing at Adelaide Oval, so I need to check if there's a game where Sydney FC was either home or away, and the venue was Adelaide Oval.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 18: This row shows that on December 28, 2007, Adelaide United played against Sydney FC. The result was 1-3 in favor of Sydney FC. The venue for this game was Adelaide Oval. So, in this case, Sydney FC was the away team at Adelaide Oval.\n\nI need to confirm if this counts as Sydney FC playing at Adelaide Oval. Since they were the away team there, it does mean that they played a match at that venue. \n\nAre there any other rows where Sydney FC is either Home or Away and the Venue is Adelaide Oval? Let me scan through the rest of the table.\n\nLooking quickly: I see other venues like EnergyAustralia Stadium, Melbourne Dome, etc., but only row 18 lists Adelaide Oval as the venue for a match involving Sydney FC. There are no other instances where Sydney FC played at Adelaide Oval as the home team, but being an away team still means they played there.\n\nTherefore, based on row 18, the claim is supported because Sydney FC did play a game at Adelaide Oval.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 18,\n       \"column_name\": \"Home\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 18,\n       \"column_name\": \"Away\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 18,\n       \"column_name\": \"Venue\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim: \"adelaide united play in front of 10256 crowd in hindmarsh stadium on november 18.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what needs checking. The claim mentions three main pieces of information: Adelaide United playing a match, the attendance being 10,256 people, and the location being Hindmarsh Stadium on November 18th.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to go through each row to find the relevant details. Let's see what columns we have: Date, Opponent, Result, Crowd, Venue, and Notes. Wait, actually, looking back, the table has columns like \"Date\", \"Opponent\", \"Result\", \"Crowd\", \"Venue\", etc.\n\nWait, no, in the table provided earlier, the headers are:\n\n- Row index (but not part of the data)\n- Date\n- Opponent\n- Result\n- Crowd\n- Venue\n\nSo I need to find a row where:\n1. The venue is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n2. The date is November 18th, which would be in the \"Date\" column as \"November 18\".\n3. The crowd number is 10,256.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is December 8, Opponent Melbourne Victory, Venue Telstra Dome. Not matching.\nRow 2: November 30, Wellington Phoenix vs Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium. Crowd 18345. Doesn't match.\nWait, I think I need to check each row carefully.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 7 (index 6): Date is November 18, 2007. Opponent is Perth Glory? Wait no, let me look again. The data shows:\n\nRow 15: Date is November 30, 2007, Crowd 18345 at Westpac Stadium.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all rows for the date \"November 18\". Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking through each row in order:\n\n- Row 0 (index 0): August 3\n- Row 1: August 6\n- ...\nContinue until I find November 18.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at all the rows with dates around November. Let me check each row:\n\nRow index starts from 0. Let's list the dates:\n\nRow 0: August 3, 2007\nRow 1: August 6, 2007\n...\nWait, perhaps I should go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0 (index 0): Date Aug 3, Opponent Wellington Phoenix, Result W 3-2, Crowd 15429, Venue Westpac Stadium. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Aug 6, opponent Sydney FC, result W 1-0, crowd 18519, venue Telstra Dome.\nRow 2: Aug 11, opponent Newcastle Jets, result L 2-3, crowd 14732, venue EnergyAustralia Stadium.\n...\nWait, perhaps I should look for the date \"November 18\" in the Date column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow index 0: Aug 3\nRow 1: Aug 6\nRow 2: Aug 11\nRow 3: Aug 17\nRow 4: Sep 1\nRow 5: Sep 9\nRow 6: Sep 15\nRow 7: Oct 6\nRow 8: Oct 13\nRow 9: Oct 20\nRow 10: Oct 27\nRow 11: Nov 4\nRow 12: Nov 11\nRow 13: Nov 18 (Ah, here we go)\nSo Row index 13 has Date: November 18, 2007.\n\nNow, checking the details for row 13:\n\n- Opponent: Wellington Phoenix\nWait no, let me check again. Let's look at the data for row 13.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 20. Wait, in the table provided earlier, each row has six columns: I think the first column is Date, then Opponent, Result, Crowd, Venue, Notes.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the structure of the table:\n\nEach row has:\n- The date\n- The opponent (team)\n- The result (win/loss and score)\n- The crowd number\n- The venue\n- Notes\n\nSo for each row, I can check:\n\nRow 13: Date is November 18, 2007. Opponent is Wellington Phoenix? Or perhaps the other way around.\n\nWait no, let me get back to the specific table data provided earlier. Let's look at each row as per the structure in the problem statement.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow index 0: Date Aug 3, opponent Wellingtion Phoenix, Result W 3-2, Crowd 15429, Venue Westpac Stadium.\nRow 1: Aug 6 vs Sydney FC\n...\nWait, perhaps I should look for the row where the date is November 18.\n\nAfter checking each row:\n\nAt row index 13 (since counting from 0), Date is November 18, Opponent is Wellington Phoenix. The result is W 2-1? Or L?\n\nLooking back: Row 15 has Date Nov 30, opponent Wellington Phoenix, Result L 2-3, Crowd 18345, Venue Westpac Stadium.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the rows are presented without clear separators. Let me try to parse each row correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact crowd number mentioned in the claim: 10,256.\n\nLooking through the \"Crowd\" column:\n\nI see crowd numbers like 15429, 18519, etc. I need to find a crowd of exactly 10256.\n\nScanning each row's crowd number:\n\nRow 0: 15429\nRow 1: 18519\nRow 2: 14732\nRow 3: 12827\nRow 4: 12840\nRow 5: 16219\nRow 6: 14123\nRow 7: 13278\nRow 8: 15501\nRow 9: 13702\nRow 10: 14342\nRow 11: 15000\nRow 12: 15360\nRow 13: 10256 (Ah, here it is)\nSo row index 13 has a crowd of 10,256.\n\nNow, checking the other details for this row:\n\n- Date: November 18, 2007\n- Opponent: Let's see. The opponent in row 13 is \"Newcastle Jets\"? Or perhaps another team. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the table structure, each row has the date, then the opponent (home or away), result, crowd, venue.\n\nIn row index 13:\n\nDate: November 18, 2007\nOpponent: Newcastle Jets\nResult: L 1-2\nCrowd: 10256\nVenue: Hindmarsh Stadium\n\nYes, that matches all the claim's details. So Adelaide United played against Newcastle Jets at Hindmarsh Stadium on November 18, 2007, with a crowd of 10,256.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct based on the data in row 13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as follows:\n\n- **Date**: November 18, 2007\n- **Opponent**: Newcastle Jets\n- **Venue**: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- **Crowd**: 10,256\n\nThus, the statement is accurate.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct. Adelaide United played at Hindmarsh Stadium on November 18 with a crowd of 10,256.\n\n\\boxed{10256}",
