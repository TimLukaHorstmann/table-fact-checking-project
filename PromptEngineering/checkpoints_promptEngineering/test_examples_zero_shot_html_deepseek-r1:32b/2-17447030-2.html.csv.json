    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to check the 'record' column for entries that match \"5  -  3\". \n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Record is 6 - 4 (1). Not a 5-3.\n- Row 1: Record is 5 - 4 (1). Close, but not exactly 5-3.\n- Row 2: Record is 5 - 3 (1). This matches the claim. So one fighter with 5-3.\n- Row 3: Record is 5 - 2 (1). Doesn't match.\n- Row 4: Record is 4 - 2 (1). No match.\n- Row 5: Record is 3 - 2 (1). Not a match.\n- Row 6: Record is 3 - 1 (1). Still not matching.\n- Row 7: Record is 3 - 1. Also doesn't fit.\n- Row 8: Record is 3 - 0. Nope.\n- Row 9: Record is 2 - 0. Not relevant.\n- Row 10: Record is 1 - 0. Doesn't match.\n\nI only found one instance where the record is exactly \"5  -  3\", which is in row 2. \n\nNow, checking if there's any other fighter with this exact record. Scanning through again, no others have it. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because only one fighter has a 5-3 record.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the opponent be dan severn , the method be submission (arm triangle choke) and the event be ufc japan : ultimate japan\".\n\nFirst, I'll look for any rows where the opponent is Dan Severn. Scanning through the table:\n\nLooking at each row's 'opponent' column:\n- Row 0: Johnathan Ivey\n- Row 1: Wes Sims\n- Row 2: Dan Severn\n- Row 3: Maurice Smith\n- ... and so on.\n\nSo, the relevant row is row index 2. Now, let's check the other conditions in this row.\n\nIn row 2:\n- Method is \"submission (arm triangle choke)\" which matches the claim.\n- Event is \"wef 9 - world class\", not \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\".\n\nThe event doesn't match what's claimed. Therefore, although the method is correct when Dan Severn was the opponent, the event is different.\n\nSince all conditions must be satisfied for the claim to be TRUE, and one of them fails (event), the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}",
