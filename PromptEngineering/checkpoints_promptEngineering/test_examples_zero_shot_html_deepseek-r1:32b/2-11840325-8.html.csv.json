    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in 2012, the oakland raiders lose to the kansas city chief at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Year: 2012\n2. Teams involved: Oakland Raiders (the losing team) and Kansas City Chiefs (the winning team)\n3. Location: Arrowhead Stadium\n4. Result: 15-0\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table that corresponds to the year 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two rows for 2012:\n\nRow index 4:\n- Year: 2012\n- Date: October 28\n- Winner: Oakland Raiders\n- Result: 26 - 16\n- Loser: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Location: Arrowhead Stadium\n\nRow index 5:\n- Year: 2012\n- Date: December 16\n- Winner: Oakland Raiders\n- Result: 15 - 0\n- Loser: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Location: Oco Coliseum\n\nThe claim mentions that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0. Let's check each part:\n\n- The year is correct as both rows are from 2012.\n- The location in row index 4 is Arrowhead Stadium, but the winner there was Oakland Raiders with a result of 26-16. So, the Chiefs were the losers here, which contradicts the claim that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs.\n- In row index 5, the location is Oco Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium. The Raiders won again with a score of 15-0, meaning the Chiefs lost.\n\nWait, but the claim says the Raiders lost at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0. However, in row index 4 (Arrowhead Stadium), the Raiders won 26-16. In row index 5, they won 15-0 but at Oco Coliseum.\n\nTherefore, there's no instance where the Raiders lost to the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0 in 2012. The closest is that in December (row 5), they won 15-0, but not at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim don't align with any single row in the table. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states specific details about a game in 2012 between the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs. Checking each condition against the table shows that no such game exists where the Raiders lost at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Year Check**: The claim is set in 2012. We look for rows where `year` is 2012.\n   - Rows 4 and 5 are from 2012.\n\n2. **Teams and Outcome**: The Raiders lost to the Chiefs.\n   - In both 2012 games, the Raiders won (Rows 4: 26-16; Row 5: 15-0).\n\n3. **Location Check**: Arrowhead Stadium.\n   - Row 4 is at Arrowhead Stadium but Raiders won.\n\n4. **Result Check**: 15-0.\n   - The result 15-0 occurred in December (Row 5), but the location was Oco Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nSince none of the 2012 games meet all the claim's conditions, it is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
