    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medals, total gold medal be 13.\" So there are two parts here that I need to check.\n\nFirst part: rank 1 has a total more than 21 medals. Looking at the table, the rows are ranked from 1 to 5. For rank 1, let's find the 'total' column. The first row (rank 1) has a 'total' of 22. Since 22 is more than 21, this part checks out.\n\nSecond part: total gold medals be 13. Again, looking at rank 1, under the 'gold' column, it shows 13. So that matches exactly.\n\nNow, I need to note down which cells are relevant for each part of the claim. For the first part (total more than 21), the cell is in row 0 and column 'total'. For the second part (gold medal count), the cell is also in row 0 but under 'gold'.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the answer should be TRUE, and I'll list the relevant cells as specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: total medals over 21 for rank 1 and gold being 13. Both are true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an HTML table and a claim, asking whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"rank 3 have 6 total medal.\" My task is to verify if this statement is accurate according to the given table.\n\nNext, I need to understand the structure of the table. The table has five columns: rank, gold, silver, bronze, and total. There are five rows of data corresponding to different ranks from 1 to 5.\n\nThe claim mentions \"rank 3,\" so I'll focus on the row where the rank is 3. Looking at the HTML, each row is within a <tr> tag, and each cell is within a <td>. The first row (index 0) has rank 1, the second (index 1) has rank 2, the third (index 2) has rank 3, which is what we're interested in.\n\nIn the third row (row index 2), I'll check each column. The 'rank' column confirms it's 3. Now, looking at the 'total' column for this row: the value is 16. \n\nThe claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals. However, according to the table, the total is 16, not 6. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo provide the necessary information, I'll list the relevant cells. The 'rank' column in row index 2 confirms it's rank 3, and the 'total' column in the same row shows 16 medals. These are the two cells that help determine the answer.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim is FALSE because rank 3 has a total of 16 medals, not 6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
