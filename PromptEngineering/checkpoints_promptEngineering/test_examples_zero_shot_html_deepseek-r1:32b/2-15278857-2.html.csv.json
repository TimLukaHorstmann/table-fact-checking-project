    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest average be 0.33 lower than the highest average\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two things: the lowest average and the highest average. The claim asserts that the difference between these two averages is 0.33. So, my goal is to find out if the highest average minus the lowest average equals exactly 0.33.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several rows with a column named \"avge\". This must stand for the average goals per game or something similar. The first step is to extract all the values from the \"avge\" column to find the highest and lowest averages.\n\nLet me list out the \"avge\" values:\n\n1. Bobby Campbell: 0.44\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 0.46\n3. Dean Windass: 0.35\n4. John Hallows: 0.45\n5. Joe Cooke: 0.25\n6. Gerry Ingram: 0.37\n7. Bobby Ham: 0.34\n8. David McNiven: 0.30\n9. Sean McCarthy: 0.48\n10. John Hall: 0.15\n11. David Jackson: 0.24\n12. Bruce Bannister: 0.29\n13. Dicky Bond: 0.20\n\nNow, I'll identify the highest and lowest values from this list.\n\nLooking through these numbers:\n\n- The highest value is 0.48 (Sean McCarthy).\n- The next high is 0.46 (Frank O'Rourke), then 0.45 (John Hallows), followed by others decreasing down to 0.15 (John Hall).\n\nSo, the highest average is clearly 0.48.\n\nFor the lowest, scanning through:\n\nThe smallest number here is 0.15 (John Hall). The next lowest is 0.20 (Dicky Bond), then 0.24 (David Jackson), and so on up to the higher numbers.\n\nSo, the lowest average is 0.15.\n\nNow, the claim states that the lowest average is 0.33 lower than the highest. Let's calculate the difference between these two:\n\nHighest average: 0.48\nLowest average: 0.15\nDifference = Highest - Lowest = 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33\n\nWait, that calculation gives exactly 0.33. So according to this, the difference is precisely 0.33.\n\nBut hold on a second, let me double-check my math to be sure I didn't make an error. Subtracting 0.15 from 0.48:\n\n0.48 minus 0.15 is indeed 0.33. So the difference is exactly as stated in the claim.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table, are there any other rows that might have lower averages? For example, John Hall has 0.15, which seems to be the lowest. The next one is Dicky Bond with 0.20, then David Jackson at 0.24, so yes, 0.15 is the absolute minimum.\n\nSo, the calculation holds: 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33. Therefore, the claim that \"the lowest average be 0.33 lower than the highest average\" is correct.\n\nThus, I would conclude that the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"avge\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dicky bond and bruce bannister share the lowest number of goals\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that both Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister have the lowest number of goals compared to others in the table. So, my task is to check their goal counts against all other players in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: name, goals, apps, avge, and career. The relevant column here is \"goals\" since that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll start by identifying the rows for Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister.\n\n- Dicky Bond is in row 12 (since counting starts from 0). His goals are listed as 60.\n- Bruce Bannister is in row 11. His goals are also 60.\n\nNow, I need to check if this number, 60, is indeed the lowest across all players. So, I'll go through each player's goal count:\n\n1. Bobby Campbell: 121\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 88\n3. Dean Windass: 76\n4. John Hallows: 74\n5. Joe Cooke: 68\n6. Gerry Ingram: 64\n7. Bobby Ham: 64\n8.

Dicky Bond: 60\n\nFrom this list, I can see that the lowest goal count is indeed 60, shared by both Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond. There's no one else with a lower number of goals than 60 in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because they both have the same and lowest number of goals compared to all other players listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister share the lowest number of goals. By examining the \"goals\" column for each player, we find that their goal counts are 60, which is indeed the lowest in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"frank o'rourke's career be 1 year longer than john hallows\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me locate the relevant rows for frank o'rorke and john hallows in the table. Looking through the table:\n\n- Frank O'Rourke is listed in the second row (row index 1). His career duration is given as \"1907 - 1914\". I'll calculate this by subtracting the start year from the end year: 1914 - 1907 = 7 years. However, since he started in 1907 and ended in 1914, that's actually 8 seasons because you include both the starting and ending years.\n\n- John Hallows is listed a few rows down (row index 3). His career duration is \"1930 - 1936\". Subtracting gives 1936 - 1930 = 6 years, which equates to 7 seasons when including both start and end years.\n\nThe claim states that Frank's career was one year longer. Comparing the two: Frank has 8 years, John has 7 years. The difference is exactly one year. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells used for this determination:\n\n- For frank o'rorke: row index 1, column 'career'.\n- For john hallows: row index 3, column 'career'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at these positions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Frank O'Rourke's career is one year longer than John Hallows'.

So I need to check if Bobby Ham has 64 goals and whether there are exactly two other athletes with the same number of goals.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table for Bobby Ham. Scanning down, I see his row is listed as Bobby Ham, and under 'goals', it says 64. That's one point in favor of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are exactly two other athletes with 64 goals. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Frank O'Rourke has 88 goals.\n- Dean Windass: 76 goals.\n- John Hallows: 74.\n- Joe Cooke: 68.\n- Gerry Ingram: 64.\n- David McNiven: 64.\n\nWait, so Bobby Ham is at index 6 with 64 goals.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find where John Hall is listed. Scanning through the names, I see a row with \"john hall\". His stats are: 63 goals, 430 apps, avge of 0.15, and career from 1962-1974.\n\nNow, I need to check if this average is indeed the lowest in the table. To do that, I'll go through each player's average goal per appearance (avge) column.\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n\n- Bobby Campbell has 0.44\n- Frank O'Rourke: 0.46\n- Dean Windass: 0.35\n- John Hallow: 0.45\n- Joe Cooke: 0.25\n- Gerry Ingram: 0.37\n- Bobby Ham: 0.34\n- David McNiven: 0.30\n- Sean McCarthy: 0.48\n- John Hall: 0.15\n- David Jackson: 0.24\n- Bruce Bannister: 0.29\n- Dicky Bond: 0.20\n\nComparing all these, the lowest avge is 0.15, which belongs to John Hall.

So, my task is to check how many entries in the 'goals' column are equal to 64.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different player with their respective stats. The relevant column here is \"goals.\" I'll go through each row and note down the number of goals each player has.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. Bobby Campbell: 121 goals.\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 88 goals.\n3. Dean Windass: 76 goals.\n4. John Hallows: 74 goals.\n5. Joe Cooke: 68 goals.\n6. Gerry Ingram: 64 goals. Okay, that's one person with 64 goals.\n7. Bobby Ham: 64 goals as well. Wait, so that's another person. So now we have two players with 64 goals.\n8. David McNiven: 64 goals too. That makes three people with 64 goals.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says only one person has 64 goals, but I've already found three entries with 64 in the 'goals' column.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"david jackson have the least goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It says that David Jackson has the least goals among all the players listed in the table. To verify this, I should look at the 'goals' column for each player and check if David Jackson's goals are indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple rows with different players and their respective goal counts. Let me list out the goal numbers to compare:\n\n1. Bobby Campbell: 121\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 88\n3. Dean Windass: 76\n4. John Hallowes: 74\n5. Joe Cooke: 68\n6. Gerry Ingram: 64\n7. Bobby Ham: 64\n8.

Dicky Bond: 60\n\nFrom this list, the lowest number of goals is 60, achieved by both Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond. David Jackson has 61 goals, which is higher than these two. Therefore, David Jackson does not have the least goals; instead, he's just above those with the least.\n\nTo be thorough, I should also consider if there are any other players with even fewer goals than David Jackson. Scanning through again, it seems Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond are tied for the lowest at 60. Since 61 is more than 60, David Jackson isn't the one with the least.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any mistake in reading the table or misunderstanding the claim. The claim specifically mentions \"david jackson,\" so I need to ensure that's the correct spelling and case as per the table. In the table, it's listed as \"david jackson\" (lowercase), but sometimes names can have variations. However, in this context, since the name matches exactly except for capitalization, which is common in such data, it's safe to assume that refers to the same person.\n\nAnother point to consider: could there be a mistake in how the goals are recorded? For instance, maybe David Jackson has 61 but another player with fewer isn't listed. Looking back at the table, all players have their goal numbers clearly stated, so I don't see any discrepancies or missing data that would affect this conclusion.\n\nIn summary, after reviewing each player's goals, it's clear that Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond both scored fewer goals (60) than David Jackson's 61.

Let's start by looking at the table and understanding what each column represents.\n\nThe table has five columns: name, goals, apps, avge, and career. The 'career' column seems to indicate the years each player was active. My main focus here will be on this column for John Hallow.\n\nLooking through the rows, I find \"john hallows\" in row 3 (if we start counting from 0). His career is listed as \"1930 - 1936\". To determine how many years he played, I subtract 1930 from 1936, which gives me 6 years. \n\nWait, the claim says more than 10 years, but according to this, it's only 6 years. That doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nThe career span is from 1930 to 1936. So that's 1936 minus 1930 equals 6 years. Yeah, that seems right.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"dicky bond have a lower average than john hall\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is about. It compares two players: Dicky Bond and John Hall. Specifically, it's comparing their 'avge' (average) values to see if Dicky Bond's average is lower than John Hall's.\n\nNext, I'll look at the structure of the table to find where these names are located. The table has columns named 'name', 'goals', 'apps', 'avge', and 'career'. So, for each player, we're interested in their 'avge' value.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Dicky Bond is listed towards the end of the table. Let me check his row: yes, he's at row index 12 (since counting starts from 0). His average ('avge') is 0.20.\n  \n- John Hall is also in the table; looking through each row, I find him at row index 9. His 'avge' is listed as 0.15.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. Dicky Bond has an average of 0.20 and John Hall has 0.15. The claim says that Dicky Bond's average is lower than John Hall's. But 0.20 is higher than 0.15, which means the claim would be FALSE.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check if I've got the rows correct because sometimes it's easy to miscount or confuse similar names. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: Bobby Campbell\nRow 1: Frank O'Rourke\nRow 2: Dean Windass\nRow 3: John Hallows (different from John Hall)\nRow 4: Joe Cooke\nRow 5: Gerry Ingram\nRow 6: Bobby Ham\nRow 7: David McNiven\nRow 8: Sean McCarthy\nRow 9: John Hall\nRow 10: David Jackson\nRow 11: Bruce Bannister\nRow 12: Dicky Bond\n\nYes, that's correct.

They're talking about the 'average' which in this table is under the column named 'avge'. So each player has an avge value. The claim is that the difference between the highest avge and the lowest avge is less than 2. Wait, but looking at the numbers, all the avges are like 0.44, 0.46, 0.35, etc., so they're decimals. So a difference of less than 2 would mean that even if the highest was 1 and the lowest was -1, which isn't possible here because all avges are positive.\n\nWait, no, actually, in this table, the 'avge' is between 0.48 (the highest I think) and 0.15 (maybe the lowest). Let me check each row:\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- bobby campbell: 0.44\n- frank o'rourke: 0.46\n- dean windass: 0.35\n- john hallows: 0.45\n- joe cooke: 0.25\n- gerry ingram: 0.37\n- bobby ham: 0.34\n- david mcniven: 0.30\n- sean mccarthy: 0.48\n- john hall: 0.15\n- david jackson: 0.24\n- bruce bannister: 0.29\n- dicky bond: 0.20\n\nSo the highest avge is 0.48 (sean mccarthy), and the lowest is 0.15 (john hall). The difference between these two would be 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33. So that's less than 2, right? Yes, because 0.33 is way less than 2.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"less than 2,\" so even if it was 1.99, it would still be true. Since our difference is only 0.33, definitely less than 2.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this. The 'avge' column is key here because we're looking at each player's average. So every row has a value in 'avge', and we have to consider all of them to find the max and min. Therefore, all rows under the 'avge' column are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be every row with the column name 'avge'. The indices go from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 players). So I need to list each row's index and the column 'avge'.\n\nThat makes sense. So in JSON, it'll have \"answer\": \"TRUE\" and a list of relevant cells from row 0 to 12 with column 'avge'.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"avge\"}\n   ]\n}",
