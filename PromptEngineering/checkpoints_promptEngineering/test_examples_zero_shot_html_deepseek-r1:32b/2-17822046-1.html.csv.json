    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"none of the Latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that none of Latvia's submissions have been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. To verify this, I should check each entry in the table to see if any were actually nominated.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are five rows, each representing a different year and film submission. The relevant columns here are \"year (ceremony)\", \"film title used in nomination\", \"original title\", \"director\", and \"result\". Specifically, the \"result\" column will tell us if each submission was nominated.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Year 1992 (65th). Film title is \"the child of man\", original title in Latvian is \"cilv\u0113ka b\u0113rns\". Director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. Result: \"not nominated\".\n   - Since the result is \"not nominated\", this supports the claim.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Year 2008 (81st). Film title \"defenders of riga\", original title in Latvian is \"r\u012bgas sargi\". Director Aigars Grauba. Result: \"not nominated\".\n   - Again, not nominated, supporting the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Year 2010 (83rd). Film title \"hong kong confidential\", original title in Latvian is \"amaya\". Director M\u0101ris Martinsons. Result: \"not nominated\".\n   - Not nominated, so still supports the claim.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Year 2012 (85th). Film title \"gulf stream under the iceberg\", original title in Latvian is \"golfa straume zem ledus kalna\". Director Yevgeni Pashkevich. Result: \"not nominated\".\n   - Once more, not nominated.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Year 2013 (86th). Film title \"mother , i love you\", original title in Latvian is \"mammu  , es tevi m\u012blu\". Director J\u0101nis Nords. Result: \"tbd\".\n   - Here, the result is marked as \"tbd\", which I assume stands for \"to be determined\" or \"tentative\". This means that at the time of data entry, it was unclear whether this film would be nominated. Since the claim is about \"none...be nominated\", if any had been nominated, it would make the claim FALSE. However, since all previous entries are \"not nominated\" and one is pending, we can't definitively say for certain that none have been nominated because of the uncertainty in the last row.\n\nBut wait, does \"tbd\" mean it's possible that it could be nominated? If so, then the claim might not hold. However, the instruction says to check whether the claim is fully supported by the table. Since all previous entries are \"not nominated\", and only one is pending, the current data doesn't show any nomination. Therefore, based on the given information up until that point, none have been nominated.\n\nSo, all the films listed in the table were either not nominated or their status was pending. Therefore, according to the data provided, the claim holds true because there's no instance where a Latvian submission was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows five Latvian film submissions with their respective results as \"not nominated\" except one that is marked as \"tbd\". Since none have been confirmed as nominated, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"2 of the 5 films be directed by j\u0101nis nords\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the claim: it states that out of five films listed in the table, two are directed by J\u0101nis Nords. My goal is to verify this by checking each relevant entry in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for \"year (ceremony)\", \"film title used in nomination\", \"original title\", \"director\", and \"result\". The director's name is listed in the fourth column. Each row represents a different film submitted for nomination in various years.\n\nI'll go through each row to see who directed them:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Directed by J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\n2. **Row 1**: Directed by Aigars Grauba.\n3. **Row 2**: Directed by M\u0101ris Martinsons.\n4. **Row 3**: Directed by Yevgeni Pashkevich.\n5. **Row 4**: Directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nFrom this, only the last row (row index 4) has a director named J\u0101nis Nords. The claim mentions two films directed by him, but according to the table, there's only one such entry. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as it asserts two films when only one is present.\n\nI also need to note which cells were relevant in making this determination. Each row's \"director\" column was checked, so I'll list each of these cells in the \"relevant_cells\" section.\n\nIn summary, since there's only one film directed by J\u0101nis Nords out of five listed, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_1_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_2_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_3_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_4_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's saying that two films were submitted one year apart from each other. The films in question are \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find these two films.\n\nStarting with \"mother , i love you\": I see it's listed in the 2013 (86th) ceremony. The film was submitted that year, as per the 'year (ceremony)' column.\n\nNext, checking for \"gulf stream under the iceberg\": This film is from the 2012 (85th) ceremony. So it was submitted in 2012.\n\nNow, to verify if they were submitted one year apart: 2013 minus 2012 equals exactly one year difference. So that part checks out.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure both films are indeed submitted in consecutive years. The table shows \"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013 and \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" in 2012, which is just one year apart.

The year listed there is 2008 (81st ceremony). \n\nNext, I need to check if there's another submission before this. Looking at row index 0, there's a film titled \"the child of man\" submitted in 1992. So the previous submission was in 1992.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the time between these two submissions.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this. The user is saying that five Latvian films were submitted over a period of 21 years for the Academy Award in Best Foreign Language Film. I need to check if there are exactly five Latvian films and whether they were submitted within a span of 21 years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a film entry with details like year, film title, original title, director, and result. The relevant information here is the number of entries and their submission years.\n\nFrom the table, there are five rows:\n1. 1992\n2. 2008\n3. 2010\n4. 2012\n5. 2013\n\nSo that's five films. The years span from 1992 to 2013. To calculate the number of years between these, subtract 1992 from 2013, which gives 21 years. However, since both 1992 and 2013 are included, it's actually a span of 22 years (including both endpoints). But maybe the claim is considering the difference as 21 years without counting inclusively.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if these films are Latvian. The original titles have Latvian endings like \"b\u0113rns\" and \"sargi,\" suggesting they're from Latvia. \n\nNow, regarding submission for the Academy Award: All entries in the 'result' column show either \"not nominated\" or \"tbd.\" Since being submitted doesn't necessarily mean nomination, but as long as they were submitted (which seems to be implied by their presence in the table), then it counts.\n\nSo, the claim states there are five films over 21 years. The table shows five films between 1992 and 2013, which is a span of 21 years if calculated as 2013 - 1992 = 21. Therefore, the claim seems supported.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells as all rows since each contributes to the count of films and their submission years.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows five Latvian films submitted between 1992 and 2013, which is a span of 21 years, aligning with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions that two Latvian submissions were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. So, I should check each entry in the table to see if any of them were nominated and identify their countries.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five entries:\n\n1. 1992 (65th): \"The Child of Man\" directed by J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\n2. 2008 (81st): \"Defenders of Riga\" directed by Aigars Grauba.\n3. 2010 (83rd): \"Hong Kong Confidential\" directed by M\u0101ris Martinsons.\n4. 2012 (85th): \"Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg\" directed by Yevgeni Pashkevich.\n5. 2013 (86th): \"Mother, I Love You\" directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nWait a minute, all these directors have Latvian-sounding names: J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds, Aigars Grauba, M\u0101ris Martinsons, Yevgeni Pashkevich, and J\u0101nis Nords. Also, the original titles are in Latvian, like \"cilv\u0113ka b\u0113rns\" and \"r\u012bgas sargi.\" So it's safe to assume these are Latvian submissions.\n\nNow, looking at the 'result' column for each:\n\n- All entries except the last one have \"not nominated.\"\n- The last entry in 2013 has \"tbd,\" which probably means \"to be determined\" or no result yet. So we can't count that as a nomination.\n\nTherefore, none of these Latvian submissions were actually nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.

It seems to suggest that two films were submitted in consecutive years. The films mentioned are \"mother , i love you\" and \"defenders of riga.\" I'll check the table for these film titles.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For \"mother , i love you,\" it appears in row 4 (assuming rows start from 0), with the year listed as 2013 (86th ceremony). The result is \"tbd,\" which likely means it's either nominated or still pending, but that doesn't affect the submission timing.\n- For \"defenders of riga,\" I see that in row 1, the film title used is \"defenders of riga\" with the year 2008 (81st ceremony). The result was \"not nominated.\"\n\nWait a minute, there's a discrepancy here. The claim says these two films were submitted one year apart. However, according to the table, \"defenders of riga\" was submitted in 2008, and \"mother , i love you\" in 2013. That's five years apart, not just one. \n\nI should double-check if there are any other entries for these films. Scanning through all rows, I only find each film listed once.

It has five rows, each representing a different film with details like year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nThe claim states that two out of these five films were directed by Aigars Grauba.

The table shows \"Defenders of Riga\" in 2008 and the next submission in 2013, which is only five years apart.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim about the number of Latvian films submitted for an Academy Award over 11 years. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to extract the necessary data points. The table has five rows, each representing a different year and film submission. The columns include \"year (ceremony)\", \"film title used in nomination\", \"original title\", \"director\", and \"result\".\n\nThe claim states: \"5 latvian films in 11 years be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" I need to verify two main points here:\n\n1. **Number of Films**: The claim mentions 5 Latvian films submitted.\n2. **Time Span**: These submissions are claimed to have occurred over an 11-year period.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a single film submission. There are five rows in total, so that checks out for the number of films.\n\nNext, I'll examine the years to determine if they span approximately 11 years. The earliest year listed is 1992 (65th ceremony), and the latest is 2013 (86th ceremony). Calculating the difference: 2013 - 1992 = 21 years. However, this seems like more than an 11-year span. But wait, maybe the user meant that all submissions occurred within a consecutive 11-year period.\n\nLooking closer, the years in the table are 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. From 2008 to 2013 is just five years. It's possible that \"in 11 years\" refers to the entire span from 1992 to 2013 being roughly a 21-year period, but since the claim says 11 years, this discrepancy raises a red flag.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user might be simplifying or approximating the time frame. The key point is that five films were submitted between 1992 and 2013, which is more than an 11-year span but still includes multiple submissions over a longer period.\n\nAdditionally, all the films listed are from Latvia, as indicated by their original titles in Latvian (e.g., \"cilv\u0113ka b\u0113rns\", \"r\u012bgas sargi\"). The directors also have Latvian names. So, it's safe to assume these are Latvian film submissions.\n\nThe result column shows that all except one were \"not nominated,\" and one was \"tbd\" (to be determined). But the claim is about submissions, not necessarily nominations or wins, so this detail doesn't affect the count of submissions.\n\nIn summary, while the time span might not exactly match 11 years, the table does show five Latvian films submitted for the Academy Award. Therefore, the claim can be considered TRUE based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
