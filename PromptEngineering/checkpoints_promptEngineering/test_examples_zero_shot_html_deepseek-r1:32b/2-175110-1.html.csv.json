    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Rhodesia's medals is true or false based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal, 5 silver medal, and 10 gold medal.\" So, we're checking three specific numbers\u2014bronze (2), silver (5), and gold (10).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where Rhodesia is listed. Scanning through the rows, I see that Rhodesia is in row index 4 (since counting starts from 0: row 0 is US, row 1 GB, etc.). \n\nNow, let's check each medal count for Rhodesia. The columns are gold, silver, and bronze.\n\n- **Gold Medals**: In the gold column of Rhodesia's row, it says 10. That matches the claim.\n- **Silver Medals**: The silver column shows 5. This also aligns with what's stated.\n- **Bronze Medals**: The bronze count is listed as 2. Again, this matches.\n\nSince all three numbers (gold:10, silver:5, bronze:2) in the claim are exactly the same as those in the table for Rhodesia, the claim holds true. There's no discrepancy in any of these figures.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
