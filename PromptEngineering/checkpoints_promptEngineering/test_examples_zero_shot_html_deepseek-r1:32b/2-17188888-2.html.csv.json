    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Bobby Riggs be the winner the same number of time that he be the runner-up.\" So I need to check how many times Bobby Riggs won and how many times he was a runner-up in the tournaments listed.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents an outcome for a particular year. The columns include \"outcome,\" which is either \"winner\" or \"runner-up.\" Since the claim mentions both being equal in number, I need to count these outcomes.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Outcome is runner-up (year 1942).\n2. **Row 1**: Winner (1946).\n3. **Row 2**: Winner (1947).\n4. **Row 3**: Runner-up (1948).\n5. **Row 4**: Runner-up (1949).\n6. **Row 5**: Winner (1949).\n\nWait a minute, there are two entries for 1949: one where he's the runner-up and another where he's the winner. That might be confusing because it's unusual to have both outcomes in the same year unless it's different tournaments.\n\nSo let's count:\n\n- **Winner**: Rows 1, 2, 5 \u2192 Total of 3 times.\n- **Runner-up**: Rows 0, 3, 4 \u2192 Total of 3 times.\n\nHmm, that adds up to three wins and three runner-ups. So Bobby Riggs was a winner three times and a runner-up three times in the given data. Therefore, the numbers are equal.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes the same year can have different tournaments, so it's possible he could have both outcomes in the same year, which might be why there are two 1949 entries. However, each entry is a separate event, so each counts individually.\n\nSo yes, three wins and three runner-ups. The claim says they're equal, which matches the data.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Bobby Riggs was a winner 3 times and a runner-up 3 times.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the only game that be play on an indoor surface be play after 1946\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that all games played on an indoor surface occurred after the year 1946. So, I need to check two things: which rows have \"indoor\" as the surface and whether their corresponding years are after 1946.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows in total. The relevant columns here are \"surface\" and \"year\". \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Surface is grass, year 1942. Not indoor, so not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Surface is grass, year 1946. Again, not indoor.\n3. **Row 2**: Grass surface in 1947. Still not relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Surface is grass, year 1948. Not relevant either.\n5. **Row 4**: Here, the surface is \"indoor\" and the year is 1949. This fits because 1949 is after 1946.\n6. **Row 5**: Grass surface in 1949. Not relevant.\n\nSo, only row 4 has an indoor surface, and its year is indeed after 1946. Therefore, the claim holds true as there's no other instance of an indoor game before or during 1946.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all games on an indoor surface occurred post-1946.

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the data.\n\nFirst, the claim is about Bobby Riggs not being a winner whenever his opponent in the final was Jack Kramer. So, I'm looking for any instances where Bobby Riggs faced Jack Kramer in the finals and whether he won or lost those matches.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament outcome with details like year, championship type, surface, opponent, and score. The columns are: outcome, year, pro slam championship, surface, opponent in the final, score in the final.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for rows where the opponent is Jack Kramer and see if Bobby Riggs was a winner or runner-up.\n\nRow 0:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Opponent: Don Budge\nSo not relevant because opponent isn't Jack Kramer.\n\nRow 1:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Opponent: Don Budge\nAgain, opponent is Don, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Opponent: Don Budge\nSame as above.\n\nRow 3:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Opponent: Jack Kramer\nHere's the first instance of facing Jack. The outcome is runner-up, meaning Bobby didn't win this match.\n\nRow 4:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Opponent: Jack Kramer\nAnother time facing Jack, again, Bobby was a runner-up.\n\nRow 5:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Opponent: Don Budge\nOpponent isn't Jack, so not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, whenever the opponent is Jack Kramer (rows 3 and 4), Bobby Riggs was a runner-up. There's no instance where he won against Jack Kramer in the final. Therefore, the claim that Bobby never won when facing Jack as the opponent seems to be true based on this data.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows with Jack Kramer as the opponent, but looking through all six rows, only rows 3 and 4 have Jack as the opponent, both resulting in Bobby being a runner-up. So no cases where he won against Jack.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bobby Riggs was never a winner when his opponent was Jack Kramer.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It says that the most games were played in the 1947 championship. So, I need to check how many games each player had in their finals across different years and see if 1947 has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns like \"year\", \"score in the final\". The score will indicate how many games were played because each set is a part of the overall game count. Each line in the \"score in the final\" column represents a set's outcome.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Year 1942, Runner-up. Score: 2-6, 2-6, 2-6. That's three sets.\n2. **Row 1**: Year 1946, Winner. Score: 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. Also three sets.\n3. **Row 2**: Year 1947, Winner. Score: 3-6, 6-3, 10-8, 4-6, 6-3. That's five sets here.\n4. **Row 3**: Year 1948, Runner-up. Score: 12-14, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6. Four sets.\n5. **Row 4**: Year 1949, Runner-up (Wembley Pro). Score: 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 4-6. That's four sets as well.\n6. **Row 5**: Year 1949, Winner (US Pro). Score: 9-7, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. Four sets.\n\nSo, looking at the number of sets each final had:\n\n- 1942: 3 sets\n- 1946: 3 sets\n- 1947: 5 sets (the highest so far)\n- 1948: 4 sets\n- 1949: Both finals have 4 sets each.\n\nTherefore, the 1947 championship had the most games played with five sets.

The table includes years from 1942 to 1949, but none of them mention Bobby Riggs. Therefore, it's impossible for him to be either the winner or runner-up based on this data.\n\nSince there are no entries related to Bobby Riggs, we can't compare his wins versus runner-up finishes.

The claim is: \"Don Budge be the second most frequent person to be the opponent in the final.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant column in the table. The claim mentions \"opponent in the final,\" so that's the column I'm interested in. Let me go through each row and note who the opponents are.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. 1942: Don Budge\n2. 1946: Don Budge\n3. 1947: Don Budge\n4. 1948: Jack Kramer\n5. 1949: Jack Kramer (Wembley Pro match)\n6. 1949: Don Budge (US Pro match)\n\nSo, let's count how many times each person appears as the opponent:\n\n- Don Budge: Rows 0, 1, 2, and 5. That's four times.\n- Jack Kramer: Rows 3 and 4. That's two times.\n\nWait a second, but in row 5, it's another match in 1949 against Don Budge again, making it five times? Wait no, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: Don Budge\nRow 1: Don Budge\nRow 2: Don Budge\nRow 3: Jack Kramer\nRow 4: Jack Kramer\nRow 5: Don Budge\n\nSo that's four times for Don Budge (rows 0,1,2,5) and two times for Jack Kramer (rows 3,4). So Don Budge is the most frequent opponent with four mentions. Then, who else? Are there any other opponents?\n\nLooking at all rows, only Don Budge and Jack Kramer appear as opponents. Therefore, the frequency is:\n\n- Don Budge: 4\n- Jack Kramer: 2\n\nSo Don Budge is the most frequent, not the second. The claim says he's the second most frequent, but in reality, he's the first. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014am I miscounting? Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 0: runner-up, opponent Don Budge\nRow 1: winner, opponent Don Budge\nRow 2: winner, opponent Don Budge\nRow 3: runner-up, opponent Jack Kramer\nRow 4: runner-up, opponent Jack Kramer (Wembley Pro)\nRow 5: winner, opponent Don Budge\n\nSo that's four times for Don Budge and two times for Jack Kramer. Therefore, Don Budge is the most frequent opponent in the final. The claim says he is the second most frequent, which would imply there's someone else more frequent than him, but in reality, no one has more mentions than him.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Don Budge is the second most frequent opponent in the finals, but according to the table, he appears four times as an opponent, making him the most frequent.

The claim says that any game on an indoor surface was before 1946. But looking at row 4, the year is 1949, which is after 1946, and the surface is indoor.

It has columns: outcome, year, pro slam championship, surface, opponent in the final, and score in the final. There are six rows of data here.\n\nThe claim is about a win by Bobby Riggs against Jack Kramer in the final. So I'm looking for any row where the outcome was a win (outcome = 'winner'), the opponent in the final was Jack Kramer, and the player making that win must be Bobby Riggs.\n\nWait a second, the table doesn't have a column for the name of the player who is either the winner or runner-up. It only shows the opponent in the final and their score. So without knowing which player (Bobby Riggs) was playing against Jack Kramer, it's hard to confirm if Bobby actually won.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: Runner-up in 1942 US Pro on grass against Don Budge. Not relevant since outcome is runner-up and opponent isn't Jack Kramer.\n2. Second row: Winner in 1946 US Pro, also against Don Budge. Again, not Jack Kramer.\n3. Third row: Winner again in 1947 US Pro against Don Budge. Still no Jack Kramer.\n4. Fourth row: Runner-up in 1948 US Pro against Jack Kramer on grass.

Sixth row: Winner in 1949 US Pro against Don Budge again.\n\nWait, in the fifth row, it's a runner-up result against Jack Kramer. But the outcome is 'runner-up', meaning Bobby Riggs lost that final.

Let me go through them one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Outcome is \"runner-up\" in 1942.\n2. **Row 1**: Winner in 1946.\n3. **Row 2**: Winner in 1947.\n4. **Row 3**: Runner-up in 1948.\n5. **Row 4**: Runner-up in 1949 (Wembley Pro).\n6. **Row 5**: Winner in 1949 (US Pro).\n\nNow, I need to count how many championships occurred before 1947 and after.\n\nChampionships are when the outcome is \"winner\".\n\n- Before 1947: \n  - Row 1 is 1946, so that's one championship.\n  \n- In 1947:\n  - Row 2 is 1947, another championship.\n\n- After 1947:\n  - Rows 3, 4, and 5 are in 1948 and 1949. Rows 4 and 5 are both winners but wait: \n    - Row 4 is a runner-up in Wembley Pro.\n    - Row 5 is a winner in US Pro in 1949.\n\nWait, so for championships (winners) after 1947:\n\n- 1947 itself has one championship (Row 2).\n- After that, in 1948 and 1949: Only Row 5 is a winner. So that's another championship.\n\nSo total championships before 1947: 1 (1946)\nChampionships at or after 1947: 2 (1947 and 1949)\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before\" 1947. So 1947 is not included in \"before\". So let's recast:\n\nBefore 1947: Only 1946 (Row 1) \u2192 1 championship.\nAt or after 1947: Rows 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut wait, how many winners are there?\n\n- Row 2: Winner in 1947\n- Row 5: Winner in 1949\n\nSo two championships at or after 1947.\n\nTherefore, before 1947, only one championship. So the claim is saying that most games (championships) occurred before 1947, but actually, more happened at or after. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"most number of game occur before\". Does it mean the total number of matches played before 1947? Or just the number of championships?\n\nIf it's about the number of championships (i.e., how many times someone was a winner), then:\n\nBefore 1947: 1\nAt or after 1947: 2\n\nSo more occurred at or after, so claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about total games played in finals, meaning looking at the score in final to count how many games were played each year. For example:\n\nRow 0 (1942): Scores are three sets \u2192 maybe that's three games? Or is a game within a set?\nWait, no, in tennis, each match consists of sets, and each set has multiple games. But the claim refers to \"number of game\" which might mean total number of games played across all finals.\n\nBut I think the original interpretation was about championships (i.e., how many times someone won). Because counting games would be more complicated as we don't have exact numbers, just sets.\n\nSo probably, it's about championships. Therefore, since only one happened before 1947 and two after, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that most championships occurred before 1947. Examining the table, there was one championship in 1946 (before 1947) and two more in 1947 and 1949 (after). Thus, the majority were not before 1947.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}",
