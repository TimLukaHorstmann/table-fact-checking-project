    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the first place tie be betweem duffy waldorf, jeff sluman and frank nobilo.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Let me scan through it to see where these players are listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a player's placement, name, country, score, to par, and money. The claim mentions three players: Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo. I'll check their positions in the table.\n\nStarting with Duffy Waldorf. Scanning down the rows, I see that at row index 10 (since counting starts from 0), there's a player named \"duffy waldorf\" from the United States. The place is listed as \"t9\", score is 284, to par is \"e\", and money is 37179.\n\nNext up is Jeff Sluman. He's in row index 9 (if I'm counting correctly). His details: place \"t9\", score 284, to par \"e\", money 37179.\n\nFrank Nobilo is listed at row index 8. Place is also \"t9\", score same as the others, to par \"e\", and same money amount.\n\nWait a minute, all three players are in position t9, which probably stands for tied at 9th place, not first. The claim says they're in a first-place tie. But looking back, the top positions have 't1' under place. Let me check those.\n\nAt the top of the table, rows 0-2 all have 'place' as t1. These players are Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, and Loren Roberts. They each have a total score of 279, to par -5, and their money is listed as \"playoff.\" That makes sense because they must have tied for first and had a playoff.\n\nSo the claim mentions that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied in first place. But according to the table, these three players are actually in 9th place, not first. The t1 positions are held by the other three names mentioned earlier.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because those three aren't in the first place; they're way down at ninth.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for first place. However, the table shows all three as being in a tie for 9th place (t9), not first.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
