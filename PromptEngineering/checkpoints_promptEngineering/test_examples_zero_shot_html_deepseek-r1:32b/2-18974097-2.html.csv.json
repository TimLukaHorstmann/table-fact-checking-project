    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"3 of the team be from the same county (orange)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table and what data it contains. The table has columns: school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, and county. Each row represents a different school with its corresponding details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"3 of the team be from the same county (orange)\". So, I'm looking for three schools that are located in Orange County. \n\nI'll start by examining each row's 'county' column to see how many times \"59 orange\" appears since that seems to indicate the county. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Crawford County: The county is listed as \"13 crawford\". Not Orange.\n2. Mitchell: The county here is \"47 lawrence\". Not Orange.\n3. Orleans: County is \"59 orange\". This one counts towards our count.\n4. Paoli: County is \"59 orange\". Another one for Orange.\n5. Perry Central: County is \"62 perry\". Not Orange.\n6. Springs Valley: County is \"59 orange\". That's the third occurrence of Orange.\n7. West Washington: County is \"88 washington\". Not Orange.\n\nSo, counting up the schools in Orange County: Orleans (row 3), Paoli (row 4), and Springs Valley (row 6). That makes three teams from Orange County. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"3 of the team be from the same county (orange)\" is supported by the data. The relevant cells are those where the 'county' column indicates Orange, which are rows 2, 3, and 5 in zero-based indexing.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my row indices to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. In programming, we often use zero-based indexing, so the first row is index 0. So:\n\n- Orleans is row index 2 (third row)\n- Paoli is row index 3 (fourth row)\n- Springs Valley is row index 5 (sixth row)\n\nYes, that's correct. Each of these rows has \"59 orange\" in the county column.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those three entries in the 'county' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three teams are from Orange County. By examining the table, we find three schools (Orleans, Paoli, and Springs Valley) listed under \"59 orange\" for their county. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"mitchell, orleans and paoli be the name of school and also the town the relevant school be in.\" So, it's saying that for each of these schools\u2014Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli\u2014their names are both the school's name and the location (town) they're in. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has a 'school' column and a 'location' column. My task is to check if, for each of these three schools, their corresponding locations match exactly.\n\nLet me go through each one:\n\n1. **Mitchell**: The school name is \"mitchell\" (row index 1). Looking at the location column in that row, it says \"mitchell\". So that matches.\n\n2. **Orleans**: The school is listed as \"orleans\" in row index 2. The location for this row is also \"orleans\", so that's a match too.\n\n3. **Paoli**: The school name here is \"paoli\" (row index 3). Checking the location column, it says \"paoli\". That matches as well.\n\nSo all three schools have their names matching the locations. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true for each case. \n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for this verification. For each school, I need to look at both the 'school' and 'location' columns in the same row. So:\n\n- Mitchell: Row 1, check 'school' and 'location'.\n- Orleans: Row 2, same thing.\n- Paoli: Row 3.\n\nSo all three schools meet the condition where the school name equals the town's location.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"mitchell be the only school with an aaa ihsaa class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Mitchell is the only school in the table that has an \"aaa\" classification under the \"ihsaa class\" column. So my task is to check all the rows in the table and see if any other schools besides Mitchell have \"aaa\" as their ihsaa class.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like location, mascot, size, etc. The important columns here are \"school\" and \"ihsaa class\".\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Crawford County**: Located in Marengo, their ihsaa class is \"aa\". So that's not \"aaa\".\n2. **Mitchell**: This school has the ihsaa class as \"aaa\". So Mitchell meets the condition.\n3. **Orleans**: Their ihsaa class is \"a\". Not relevant here.\n4. **Paoli**: Also classified as \"aa\", so no match for \"aaa\".\n5. **Perry Central**: They are in \"aa\" as well, not \"aaa\".\n6. **Springs Valley**: This school has an \"a\" classification.\n7. **West Washington**: Their ihsaa class is also \"a\".\n\nFrom this review, only Mitchell is listed with the \"aaa\" ihsaa class. All other schools have either \"a\", \"aa\", or in the case of Mitchell, \"aaa\". Therefore, the claim holds true because there are no other schools besides Mitchell that have an \"aaa\" classification.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check each row again. Crawford County is \"aa\", Mitchell is \"aaa\", Orleans is \"a\", Paoli is \"aa\", Perry Central is \"aa\", Springs Valley is \"a\", and West Washington is \"a\". Yep, Mitchell is the only one with \"aaa\".\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because Mitchell is indeed the sole school in the table with an \"aaa\" ihsaa class.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Mitchell is the only school listed with an AAA classification.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the mascot except west washington's be based on animal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that all mascots except for West Washington's are based on animals. So I need to check each school's mascot and see if they are animal-based, except for maybe West Washington. Wait, actually, no\u2014the claim specifies that all except West Washington have animal-based mascots. So I should verify that every mascot listed is an animal, except possibly the one from West Washington.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows of data. Each row has a 'mascot' column. Let me list them out:\n\n1. crawford county: wolfpack\n2. mitchell: bluejackets\n3. orleans: bulldogs\n4. paoli: rams\n5. perry central: commodores\n6. springs valley: blackhawks\n7. west washington: senators\n\nNow, I need to analyze each mascot:\n\n- Wolfpack: That's a group of wolves. Wolves are animals.\n- Bluejackets: These are seabirds. So yes, an animal.\n- Bulldogs: Dogs are animals, so this is animal-based.\n- Rams: Sheep are animals, specifically male ones are rams.\n- Commodores: Hmm, this one is tricky. Commodore refers to a naval rank or someone in charge of ships. That doesn't sound like an animal. So maybe this is not animal-based?\n- Blackhawks: Hawks are birds, so that's an animal.\n- Senators: This seems more like a political title, definitely not an animal.\n\nWait, the claim says all except West Washington's. But looking at row 5 (index starts at 0, so row 4), perry central has commodores, which is not an animal. So this would mean that the claim isn't entirely true because there are other mascots besides West Washington that aren't based on animals.\n\nWait, let me recount the rows with their indices:\n\nRow 0: crawford county - wolfpack (animal)\nRow 1: mitchell - bluejackets (animal)\nRow 2: orleans - bulldogs (animal)\nRow 3: paoli - rams (animal)\nRow 4: perry central - commodores (not animal)\nRow 5: springs valley - blackhawks (animal)\nRow 6: west washington - senators (not animal)\n\nSo according to this, both perry central and west washington have non-animal mascots. Therefore, the claim that all except west washington's are based on animals is false because perry central also has a non-animal mascot.\n\nWait, but I might be making a mistake here. Let me double-check each mascot:\n\n- Wolfpack: Yes, animal.\n- Bluejackets: Seabirds, so yes.\n- Bulldogs: Dogs, definitely animal.\n- Rams: Sheep, animal.\n- Commodores: This is where I'm unsure. Commodore is a naval rank or title, not an animal. So that's correct; it's not based on an animal.\n- Blackhawks: Hawks are birds, so animal.\n- Senators: Definitely not an animal.\n\nSo the claim says all except West Washington have animal mascots. However, perry central also doesn't fit, meaning there are two exceptions. Therefore, the claim is false because more than one school has a non-animal mascot besides west washington.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. The claim specifically mentions \"except west washington.\" So perhaps only west washington is allowed to have a non-animal mascot. But since perry central also has commodores, which isn't an animal, the claim isn't fully supported because more than one exception exists.\n\nAlternatively, did I make a mistake in identifying the mascots? Let me check again:\n\nCommodores: No, that's not an animal. So it's correct to say it's non-animal.\n\nTherefore, since both perry central and west washington have non-animal mascots, the claim is false because there are more than one exceptions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all mascots except West Washington's are based on animals. Upon reviewing each mascot in the table:\n\n- crawford county: wolfpack (animal)\n- mitchell: bluejackets (animal)\n- orleans: bulldogs (animal)\n- paoli: rams (animal)\n- perry central: commodores (not an animal)\n- springs valley: blackhawks (animal)\n- west washington: senators (not an animal)\n\nSince both perry central and west washington have non-animal mascots, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"orleans be less than half the size of mitchell\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing the sizes of two schools: Orleans and Mitchell. Specifically, it's saying that Orleans' size is less than half of Mitchell's size.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows, each representing a different school. Each row has several columns: school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, and county. The relevant column here is \"size,\" which indicates the number of students or perhaps some other measure of the school's size.\n\nI'll start by locating the rows for Orleans and Mitchell. Scanning through the table:\n\n- For Orleans: The row index starts at 0. Let me check each row:\n  - Row 0: Crawford County\n  - Row 1: Mitchell\n  - Row 2: Orleans\nSo, Mitchell is in row 1, and Orleans is in row 2.\n\nNext, I need to find the \"size\" values for both schools. \n\n- For Mitchell (row 1), under the \"size\" column, the value is 620.\n- For Orleans (row 2), the \"size\" is 258.\n\nNow, the claim states that Orleans' size is less than half of Mitchell's size. To verify this, I'll calculate half of Mitchell's size and then compare it to Orleans' size.\n\nHalf of Mitchell's size: 620 / 2 = 310.\n\nOrleans' size is 258. Is 258 less than 310? Yes, because 258 < 310.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"orleans be less than half the size of mitchell\" is TRUE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Mitchell's size: 620\n- Orleans' size: 258\n- Half of Mitchell's size: 310\n- Since 258 < 310, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"orleans be less than half the size of mitchell\" is supported by the data in the table. Orleans has a size of 258, which is indeed less than half of Mitchell's size (620 / 2 = 310). Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"all of the team be from different country\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: it has columns for school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, and county. The claim mentions countries, but I don't see a column that directly refers to country in the table. Hmm, maybe \"county\" is related? Let me check what each row says under the \"county\" column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Crawford County - 13 crawford\n2. Mitchell - 47 lawrence\n3. Orleans - 59 orange\n4. Paoli - 59 orange\n5. Perry Central - 62 perry\n6. Springs Valley - 59 orange\n7. West Washington - 88 washington\n\nWait a minute, I notice that multiple schools share the same \"county\" value. For example, Orleans, Paoli, and Springs Valley all have 59 orange in the county column. If these counties are supposed to represent different countries, then having multiple teams from the same country would make the claim false.\n\nBut hold on, I'm not entirely sure if \"county\" here refers to an actual country or just a region within a larger country. The term \"county\" is more of a local administrative division rather than a country. So maybe the claim is using \"country\" incorrectly, and they actually mean counties? Or perhaps it's a mistranslation.\n\nAssuming that the claim is about countries, but since there's no country column, I have to rely on another approach. Alternatively, if \"county\" is mistakenly used instead of \"country,\" then we can analyze based on that.\n\nLooking again at the counties: Crawford (13 crawford), Lawrence (47 lawrence), Orange (59 orange appears three times), Perry (62 perry), and Washington (88 washington). So, several schools share the same county code. If each of these codes represents a country, then having multiple teams from the same \"country\" would make the claim false.\n\nBut if the claim is about different regions within the same country, maybe it's not relevant. However, since the claim explicitly says \"different country,\" I think the intended meaning is that each team should be from a unique nation.\n\nGiven that, and without explicit country data but assuming \"county\" might stand in for countries, we can see multiple teams share the same county code. Therefore, the claim would be false because not all teams are from different counties (assuming counties represent countries).\n\nAlternatively, if \"country\" is a typo or miscommunication, perhaps they meant \"state,\" but again, without that data, it's tricky.\n\nIn any case, based on the given table and interpreting \"county\" as country equivalents, multiple schools share the same county. Thus, the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all teams are from different countries. However, looking at the \"county\" column, several schools (Orleans, Paoli, Springs Valley) have the same value, 59 orange. This suggests they are from the same region or area, indicating not all are from different countries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"mitchell , orleans and paoli be the name of school and also the mascot of the relevant school.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here\u2014probably meant to say \"are\" instead of \"be.\" But regardless, the main point is that these three schools have names that are also their mascots.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is asserting. For each school mentioned (Mitchell, Orleans, Paoli), both the 'school' name and 'mascot' should be the same. So I need to check each of these schools in the table to see if their mascot matches their name.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, county. Each row represents a different school with its respective details.\n\nLet's go through each school one by one.\n\n1. **Mitchell School**: \n   - Row index 1.\n   - School name is \"mitchell.\"\n   - Mascot is \"bluejackets.\"\n   So, the mascot here is different from the school name. That means Mitchell does not have a mascot named Mitchell; instead, it's bluejackets.\n\n2. **Orleans School**:\n   - Row index 2.\n   - School name is \"orleans.\"\n   - Mascot is \"bulldogs.\"\n   Again, the mascot doesn't match the school name. So Orleans doesn't have a mascot named Orleans either; it's bulldogs.\n\n3. **Paoli School**:\n   - Row index 3.\n   - School name is \"paoli.\"\n   - Mascot is \"rams.\"\n   The mascot here is rams, not paoli. Therefore, Paoli's mascot doesn't match its school name.\n\nWait a minute, none of these schools have mascots that match their names. Mitchell has bluejackets, Orleans has bulldogs, and Paoli has rams. So the claim that all three have mascots matching their school names is not correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me double-check each row:\n\n- **Mitchell**: Mascot is \"bluejackets\" \u2260 \"mitchell.\"\n- **Orleans**: Mascot is \"bulldogs\" \u2260 \"orleans.\"\n- **Paoli**: Mascot is \"rams\" \u2260 \"paoli.\"\n\nAll three mascots are different from their respective school names. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells. For each of these schools, I need to look at both the 'school' and 'mascot' columns to verify if they match. So for Mitchell (row 1), check school and mascot. Similarly for Orleans (row 2) and Paoli (row 3).\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include:\n\n- For Mitchell: row index 1, column names \"school\" and \"mascot.\"\n- For Orleans: row index 2, same columns.\n- For Paoli: row index 3, same columns.\n\nWait, but in the output format, each entry is a separate object. So I should list each relevant cell individually.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1 (Mitchell): school and mascot\nRow 2 (Orleans): school and mascot\nRow 3 (Paoli): school and mascot\n\nThus, the relevant_cells array will have six entries: three rows each contributing two cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because none of the mentioned schools have mascots that match their names.

Their mascot is \"senators.\" Wait, senators are humans, not animals. That immediately makes me think that this claim might be false because at least one mascot isn't an animal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll go through all mascots:\n\n1. Crawford County: Wolfpack - wolves are animals.\n2. Mitchell: Bluejackets - this is a naval term, likely referring to military personnel, so not an animal.\n3. Orleans: Bulldogs - dogs are animals.\n4. Paoli: Rams - rams are animals.\n5. Perry Central: Commodores - another military or naval title, not an animal.\n6. Springs Valley: Blackhawkes - hawks are animals.\n7. West Washington: Senators - as mentioned before, these are people.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check each mascot:\n\n- Wolfpack: Yes, wolves are animals.\n- Bluejackets: This is tricky. The term \"bluejacket\" refers to sailors in the U.S. Navy. So this is human-based, not animal-based.\n- Bulldogs: Animals.\n- Rams: Animals.\n- Commodores: Another naval rank; humans, not animals.\n- Blackhawkes: These are hawks, which are birds, so animals.\n- Senators: Humans.\n\nSo, actually, the mascots for Mitchell (Bluejackets), Perry Central (Commodores), and West Washington (Senators) are all based on people or titles, not animals. Therefore, the claim that \"all of the mascot, include west washington's be base on animal\" is false because there are multiple mascots that aren't animals.\n\nBut wait, in my initial analysis, I thought only West Washington's was non-animal. Now upon re-evaluating, I see that three schools have human-based mascots. That definitely makes the claim false.\n\nHowever, let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. The user wrote: \"all of the mascot , include west washington 's be base on animal.\" Maybe they meant to say that all mascots, including West Washington's, are based on animals. So if even one isn't, then it's false.\n\nGiven that, since there are three mascots not based on animals (Bluejackets, Commodores, Senators), the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all mascots, including West Washington's, are based on animals. Upon examining each school's mascot in the table:\n\n1. **Crawford County**: Wolfpack - animal.\n2. **Mitchell**: Bluejackets - human-based (naval term).\n3. **Orleans**: Bulldogs - animal.\n4. **Paoli**: Rams - animal.\n5. **Perry Central**: Commodores - human-based (naval rank).\n6. **Springs Valley**: Blackhawkes - animal.\n7. **West Washington**: Senators - human-based.\n\nSince not all mascots are based on animals, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"mitchell be 1 of the 2 school list with an aaa ihsaa class.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that Mitchell is one of two schools listed in the table that belong to the AAA IHSAA class.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for this claim is \"ihsaa class\". Each row has a value under this column which indicates the school's classification.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"ihsaa class\" to see how many schools are in the AAA class.\n\n1. Crawford County: AA\n2. Mitchell: AAA\n3. Orleans: A\n4. Paoli: AA\n5. Perry Central: AA\n6. Springs Valley: A\n7. West Washington: A\n\nFrom this, I can see that only Mitchell has an AAA classification. The other schools are either AA or A.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's only one school (Mitchell) with an AAA class, not two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mitchell is one of two schools in the AAA class, but the table shows only Mitchell as having that classification.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the claim \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in HTML format. The table has headers: school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, and county. There are seven rows of data for different schools. My task is to extract the relevant information about Orleans and Mitchell to check their sizes and see if the claim holds.\n\nStarting with the claim: \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell.\" I need to understand what this means. It's saying that the size of Orleans should be strictly less than half the size of Mitchell. So, mathematically, that would translate to Orleans_size < (Mitchell_size / 2).\n\nNow, I'll search through the table for rows corresponding to Orleans and Mitchell.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first row is crawford county with a size of 487.\n2. The second row is mitchell with a size of 620.\n3. The third row is orleans with a size of 258.\n4. Then there's paoli, perry central, springs valley, and west washington.\n\nSo, Mitchell's size is 620 and Orleans' size is 258.\n\nNext step: Calculate half of Mitchell's size. Half of 620 is 310 (since 620 divided by 2 equals 310). Now, compare Orleans' size to this value. Orleans has a size of 258, which needs to be less than 310 for the claim to be true.\n\nIs 258 < 310? Yes, it is. So, at first glance, the claim seems TRUE. However, I need to make sure I'm interpreting \"exactly less than half\" correctly. The term \"exactly\" might imply that it's precisely half, but in this context, it probably means strictly less than half.\n\nWait a second. Let me double-check. If someone says something is exactly less than half, do they mean it's not just less than half but also perhaps equal to some exact value? Or does \"exactly\" here modify \"less than,\" meaning precisely less than? I think in this context, the phrase means that Orleans' size must be strictly less than half of Mitchell's. So as long as 258 is less than 310, it's TRUE.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate the exact value: 620 / 2 = 310. Is 258 exactly less than 310? Yes. There's no requirement for Orleans' size to be equal to half of Mitchell's; just that it is strictly less. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that were used to make this determination. The size of Mitchell is found in row 1 (since rows are zero-indexed) under the \"size\" column. Similarly, Orleans' size is in row 2 under the same column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- For Mitchell: row index 1, column name \"size\"\n- For Orleans: row index 2, column name \"size\"\n\nPutting this all together, since Orleans' size (258) is less than half of Mitchell's size (620), which is 310, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells listed as above.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n   ]\n}",
