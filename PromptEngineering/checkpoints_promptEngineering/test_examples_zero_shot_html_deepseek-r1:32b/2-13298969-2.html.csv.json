    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"brett cooper and kala hose be both knock out by punch\" is true based on the table provided. First, I'll look at what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim says two things: that Brett Cooper was knocked out by a punch, and that Kala Hose was also knocked out by a punch. So, I need to check if both fighters were defeated via a knockout (KO) due to punches in any of their matches listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like Round, Time, Result, Method, etc. The \"Method\" column is where the way the fight ended is described. \n\nFirst, I'll search for Brett Cooper in the Opponent column because that's who he fought against. Let me scan through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is Anthony Fuller, result is Win, method Submission via strikes.\n- Row 1: Lavar Johnson, Win, TKO by corner stoppage.\n- Row 2: Anthony Arria, Win, Submission armbar.\n- ...\n- I'm going down each row, and in Row 4 (index starting at 0), the opponent is Brett Cooper. The result here is a Loss for Kala Hose, with the method being KO via punches.\n\nSo, Kala Hose was knocked out by punches against Brett Cooper. That checks out one part of the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if Brett Cooper himself was ever knocked out by punches in any match listed. So, I'll look through all the rows where the Opponent is someone else, and see if Brett Cooper's result was a KO via punch.\n\nGoing through each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Kala Hose vs Anthony Fuller, method Submission.\n- Row 1: Lavar Johnson, TKO by corner stoppage.\n- Row 2: Anthony Arria, Submission.\n- ...\n- I don't see any row where Brett Cooper is the opponent and the result is KO via punch. It seems that all of Brett Cooper's matches resulted in either wins or other methods, but not a KO by punches.\n\nSo, Kala Hose was indeed knocked out by punches by Brett Cooper (Row 4), but Brett Cooper himself wasn't knocked out by punches in any listed match. Therefore, the claim is only partially true because it requires both to be knocked out by punches, which isn't the case here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Brett Cooper and Kala Hose were knocked out by punches. From the table:\n\n- Kala Hose was KO'd by punch against Brett Cooper (Row 4).\n- There's no instance where Brett Cooper was KO'd by punch.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Then, for each of those opponents, I'll check if their match resulted in a TKO due to punches.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. For Rafael Real: \n   - Scanning the \"Opponent\" column, I find Rafael Real in row 3.\n   - The result was a TKO due to punches (column \"Result\"). So this part is correct.\n\n2. For Phil Collins:\n   - Checking the \"Opponent\" column again, Phil Collins is listed in row 4.\n   - However, his result was a submission, not a TKO.

The duration here is 0:45, which is indeed less than a minute.\n- For Anthony Arria, there's another row (row index 16) where the opponent is \"anthony arria.\" The duration listed is 0:22, also under a minute.\n\nBoth matches lasted less than a minute.

It seems like the claim is stating that Lavar Johnson was in WEC 9 and Anthony Fuller was in WEC 8.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different event or fight. The columns include details like opponent, outcome, event name, etc. \n\nI'll go through each relevant cell to check where these fighters were involved. \n\nStarting with Lavar Johnson: I need to find if he was in WEC 9. Scanning the table, I see that Row 13 (0-based index) lists \"Lavar Johnson\" as the opponent in WEC 9. The result was a TKO by corner stoppage, which supports that he was indeed there.\n\nNext, Anthony Fuller: I check if he's listed in WEC 8. Looking at Row 14, it shows \"Anthony Fuller\" as the opponent for WEC 8. The outcome was a submission by strikes, confirming his participation.\n\nBoth fighters are correctly matched to their respective events as per the claim.

The claim is about two matches: one against Sultan Aliev and another against Lavar Johnson, both supposedly lasting 5 minutes.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided to find these fighters. Scanning the \"Opponent\" column, I see Lavar Johnson listed in a row where he's the opponent. There's no mention of Sultan Aliev anywhere in the table. That means there's no data about a match against him here.\n\nNext, for Lavar Johnson's fight: according to the table, it was a win by TKO due to corner stoppage. The duration is listed as 5:00, which I think stands for 5 minutes. So that part checks out\u2014he had a 5-minute match.\n\nBut since Sultan Aliev isn't in the table at all, we can't confirm if his match was also 5 minutes.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Doug Marshall took more time to win the match against Anthony Fuller than Lavar Johnson.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table correspond to these two matches. Looking through the table, each row represents a different match with details like opponent, result, and time.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries for Doug Marshall's wins. Let me scan down until I find the matches against Anthony Fuller and Lavar Johnson.\n\nLooking at the last few rows:\n- The second to last row (row index 17) shows a win against Lavar Johnson with a time of \"5:00\".\n- The very last row (row index 18) is a win against Anthony Fuller with a time listed as \"0:32\".\n\nWait, but the claim says that Doug took more time to defeat Anthony Fuller than Lavar. So according to the table, the match against Anthony Fuller only took 32 seconds (0:32), while the match against Lavar Johnson lasted five minutes (5:00). That means it actually took less time for Anthony Fuller's match compared to Lavar's.\n\nSo, since 0:32 is shorter than 5:00, Doug Marshall did not take more time against Anthony Fuller. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to extract the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. For both matches, the \"Time\" column is important because it shows how long each match took. The opponent's name is also crucial to identify which row corresponds to each fighter.\n\nSo, for Anthony Fuller (row 18), the time is in the \"Time\" column. Similarly, for Lavar Johnson (row 17), the time is also in the \"Time\" column. These are the relevant cells needed to evaluate the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Doug Marshall won against Anthony Fuller faster than he did against Lavar Johnson.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I'm given a table of match results and a claim that says, \"the match against both Brett Cooper and Kala Hose be decided in round 3.\" My task is to verify if this claim is true or false based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating two things:\n\n1. There was a match against Brett Cooper.\n2. There was a match against Kala Hose.\n3. Both of these matches were decided in round 3.\n\nSo, my goal is to check each of these points against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table columns: the relevant columns for this claim are \"Opponent\" and \"Round\". The \"Result\" column might also be useful, but since the claim is about the decision in a specific round, I'll focus on \"Round\".\n\nNow, let's scan through each row of the table to find matches against Brett Cooper and Kala Hose.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is Bret Cooper. The Round column shows 3. So this supports part of the claim.\n  \n- Next rows don't mention Kala Hose until further down, but I'm checking each row.\n\nWait, actually looking through all the rows, I only see \"Brett Cooper\" once in the table at row index 0. There's no entry for a match against Kala Hose in the provided data. The opponents listed are Bret Cooper, and others like Anthony Arria, Lavar Johnson, etc., but not Kala Hose.\n\nSo, while there is a match against Brett Cooper decided in round 3, there's no record of a match against Kala Hose in this table. Therefore, the claim that both matches were decided in round 3 isn't fully supported because one of the opponents mentioned isn't present in the data.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.
