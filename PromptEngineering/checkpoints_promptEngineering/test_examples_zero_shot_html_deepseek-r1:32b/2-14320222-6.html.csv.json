    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"game 61 be 1 of 3 game that total 86 point.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that game number 61 is one out of three games where the team accumulated a total of 86 points. So I need to check if there are exactly three games in which the team scored 86 points, and whether game 61 is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details including the game number (column \"game\") and points earned (column \"points\"). The relevant columns here are \"game\" and \"points.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find all instances where the points column equals 86. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 0: Points = 72 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 1: Points = 74 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 2: Points = 75 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 3: Points = 76 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 4: Points = 78 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 5: Points = 80 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 6: Points = 80 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 7: Points = 82 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 8: Points = 84 \u2192 Not 86.\nRow 9: Points = 86 \u2192 This is the first instance. Game number is 61 (since row index starts at 0, this would be game 61 as per the table).\nRow 10: Points = 86 \u2192 Second instance. Game number is 62.\nRow 11: Points = 86 \u2192 Third instance. Game number is 63.\n\nSo there are three games where the team has 86 points: game 61, game 62, and game 63. The claim says that game 61 is one of these three, which is correct. Therefore, the statement holds true.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. These would be the rows where points equal 86, specifically looking at their \"points\" and \"game\" columns.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 9: Column \"points\"\n- Row 10: Column \"points\"\n- Row 11: Column \"points\"\n\nAdditionally, since the claim mentions game 61, I should also include the row where game is 61 (row 9) to confirm it's part of these three.\n\nWait, actually, each relevant cell for points in rows 9, 10, and 11 are necessary because they all contribute to the total count of three games with 86 points. Therefore, I should list each of those cells as relevant.\n\nSo, compiling this, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the \"points\" column for row indices 9, 10, and 11.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the quebec nordiques and the chicago black hawk both have a game with a score of 2 - 2 ot.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what needs to be checked. The key points are:\n\n1. Identify all games where the opponent is either Quebec Nordiques or Chicago Black Hawks.\n2. For each of these games, check if the score was \"2 - 2 ot\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, I'll go through each row to find the relevant entries.\n\nStarting with the first row (game 52), the opponent is \"quebec nordiques\". The score listed is \"2 - 2 ot\", which matches the claim. So, that's one team accounted for.\n\nNext, I scan through the rest of the rows looking for \"chicago black hawks\" as the opponent. I find it in game 55 (row index 3). The score there is also \"2 - 2 ot\", which aligns with the claim.\n\nI don't see any other entries where either team plays again because each appears only once in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the winnipeg jet play the game with the highest total score of 8 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Winnipeg Jets played a game where the total score was 8-4, and this is the highest total score in the table. To verify this, I need to look at two things: who they played against (to ensure it's about the Winnipeg Jets) and whether their score is indeed the highest.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The columns are \"game\", \"february\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"record\", and \"points\".\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find the games involving the Winnipeg Jets. Scanning through the \"opponent\" column:\n\n- Game 52: Quebec Nordiques\n- Game 53: St Louis Blues\n- Game 54: Minnesota North Stars\n- Game 55: Chicago Black Hawks\n- Game 56: Buffalo Sabres\n- Game 57: New York Islanders\n- Game 58: Montreal Canadiens\n- Game 59: Winnipeg Jets (this is the opponent in game 59)\n- Game 60: Los Angeles Kings\n- Game 61: Washington Capitals\n- Game 62: Calgary Flames\n- Game 63: Vancouver Canucks\n\nWait, actually, in row 59, the opponent is \"winnipeg jets\". So that's the game where the team (I assume it's the same team throughout the table) played against the Winnipeg Jets. The score for this game was 8 - 4.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the highest total score in the table. Let me go through each row and note down the scores:\n\n- Game 52: 2-2 OT \u2192 Total = 4\n- Game 53: 4-3 \u2192 Total = 7\n- Game 54: 3-3 OT \u2192 Total = 6\n- Game 55: 2-2 OT \u2192 Total = 4\n- Game 56: 4-0 \u2192 Total = 4\n- Game 57: 6-3 \u2192 Total = 9\n- Game 58: 3-5 \u2192 Total = 8\n- Game 59: 8-4 \u2192 Total = 12\n- Game 60: 5-3 \u2192 Total = 8\n- Game 61: 3-1 \u2192 Total = 4\n- Game 62: 4-7 \u2192 Total = 11\n- Game 63: 1-3 \u2192 Total = 4\n\nLooking at these totals, the highest is in game 59 with a total of 12 (8+4). So yes, the claim that the Winnipeg Jets played a game with the highest total score of 8-4 seems to be correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if any other games have higher totals. For example, Game 62 had a total of 11, which is less than 12, so Game 59's 12 is indeed the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because in their game against the Winnipeg Jets (game 59), the score was 8-4, and this is the highest total score in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the washington capital and the vancouver canucks both play in game that have the lowest total score in february, score 3 - 1 and 1 - 3 respectively.\"\n\nSo, there are a few things to check here:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played by Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks**: \n   I need to find which rows correspond to games where these two teams were opponents.\n\n2. **Check the Scores of These Games**:\n   For each identified game, look at the 'score' column to see what the scores were.\n\n3. **Determine if These Are the Lowest Total Scores in February**:\n   Calculate the total score for each game (sum of both team's goals) and check if these are indeed the lowest totals in February.\n\nLet me start by scanning through the table rows:\n\n- Looking at each row, I need to find where 'opponent' is either \"washington capitals\" or \"vancouver canucks.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n- **Row 61**: Opponent is Washington Capitals. The score was 3 - 1.\n- **Row 63**: Opponent is Vancouver Canucks. The score was 1 - 3.\n\nNow, let's note down their scores:\n- Washington Capitals game: 3-1 (total score = 4)\n- Vancouver Canucks game: 1-3 (total score = 4)\n\nNext, I need to check all the games in February and find out if these are indeed the lowest total scores.\n\nLet me list all the games and their total scores:\n\n- Game 52 vs Quebec Nordiques: 2-2 OT \u2192 Total = 4\n- Game 53 vs St. Louis Blues: 4-3 \u2192 Total =7\n- Game 54 vs Minnesota North Stars: 3-3 OT \u2192 Total=6\n- Game 55 vs Chicago Blackhawks: 2-2 OT \u2192 Total=4\n- Game 56 vs Buffalo Sabres: 4-0 \u2192 Total=4\n- Game 57 vs New York Islanders: 6-3 \u2192 Total=9\n- Game 58 vs Montreal Canadiens: 3-5 \u2192 Total=8\n- Game 59 vs Winnipeg Jets: 8-4 \u2192 Total=12\n- Game 60 vs Los Angeles Kings: 5-3 \u2192 Total=8\n- Game 61 vs Washington Capitals: 3-1 \u2192 Total=4\n- Game 62 vs Calgary Flames: 4-7 \u2192 Total=11\n- Game 63 vs Vancouver Canucks: 1-3 \u2192 Total=4\n\nLooking at these totals, the lowest total score is 4. There are multiple games with this total.\n\nSo, both Washington and Vancouver's games have a total of 4, which is tied for the lowest. However, the claim specifies that both teams played in games with the lowest total scores, which they did. \n\nWait, but let me make sure about the \"lowest total score.\" If multiple games share the same total as the lowest, then any game with that total would be considered correct.\n\nBut there's a catch here: The claim says they both have the lowest total scores in February. Since several games have the same total of 4, which is indeed the lowest (since other totals are higher), it seems correct.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that while both teams did play in games with a total score of 4, there were multiple games in February with this same total. Therefore, these aren't the only ones; others also have the same low total. But the claim doesn't say they're the only ones, just that their games are among those with the lowest.\n\nWait another thought: The claim says \"both play in game that have the lowest total score.\" It doesn't specify that they're the only ones. So as long as each of them played a game with the lowest total, it's correct.\n\nBut wait again: Let me check the exact wording: \"... both play in game that have the lowest total score in February ...\" So, each team's game has the lowest total. Since 4 is indeed the lowest, and their games have this total, the claim holds.\n\nWait no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The scores for Washington are 3-1 (total 4) and Vancouver 1-3 (total 4). So both have total of 4, which matches the lowest in February.\n\nBut wait, looking back at all games, Game 52 vs Quebec Nordiques was also 2-2 OT (total 4), so that's another game with the same low. Similarly, Game 55 and 56 also had totals of 4. So multiple games have this total.\n\nSo the claim is correct because both teams played in a game that had the lowest total score (4), even though there were other games with the same total.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks each played in a game during February where their respective scores were 3-1 and 1-3, both resulting in a total score of 4. This is indeed the lowest total score among all February games listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"only 2 team play in game that have a total of 80 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"total of 80 points\" likely refers to the 'points' column in the table, which seems to accumulate over the games. So, we're looking for rows where the points sum up exactly to 80.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- There are columns: game, february, opponent, score, record, and points.\n- The claim mentions \"only 2 team play in game,\" so I assume it's referring to two teams having a combined point total of 80 across their games.\n\nWait, actually, the wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that each of the two teams has exactly 80 points individually, or together they sum up to 80. But given how \"total\" is used, it might be that each team has 80 points.\n\nLet me check the 'points' column:\n\nRow indices with their corresponding points:\n- Row 5: 72\n- Row 6: 74\n- Row 7: 75\n- Row 8: 76\n- Row 9: 78\n- Row 10: 80\n- Row 11: 80\n- Row 12: 82\n- Row 13: 84\n- Row 14: 86 (appears multiple times)\n- Rows beyond that have higher points.\n\nWait, looking back, the rows are from game 52 to 63. The 'points' column for each game shows cumulative points up to that game. So, if a team has 80 points at some game, it's after several games.\n\nThe claim says \"only 2 teams play in game(s) with a total of 80 points.\" That is, how many teams have a point total of exactly 80 in any of their games.\n\nLooking through the 'points' column:\n\n- At row index 9 (game 61), the points are 86.\nWait, actually, let me list all rows and their points:\n\nRow index | Game | Points\n--- | --- | ---\n52 | 72\n53 | 74\n54 | 75\n55 | 76\n56 | 78\n57 | 80\n58 | 80\n59 | 82\n60 | 84\n61 | 86\n62 | 86\n63 | 86\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the row indices. Let me recount:\n\nThe table starts at game 52 as row index 0.\n\nRow indices and their points:\n\n0: 72\n1:74\n2:75\n3:76\n4:78\n5:80 (row index 5)\n6:80 (row index 6)\n7:82\n8:84\n9:86\n10:86\n11:86\n\nSo, rows 5 and 6 have points of 80. That's two instances where the cumulative points are exactly 80.\n\nNow, does each row represent a different team? Or is it all for one team?\n\nThe table lists various opponents, so perhaps each game involves our main team (maybe Team A) against another team (Team B). So, if Team A has 80 points in two games, that would mean they played two teams where their cumulative points reached 80.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 2 team play in game that have a total of 80 point.\" Hmm. Maybe it's saying there are only two teams (including our main team) whose combined points equal 80? Or perhaps each of those games has two teams with exactly 80 points each.\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous, but given the table structure, I think we're looking for how many unique opponents were played when the main team's cumulative points were 80. Because in row indices 5 and 6, points are 80. Let's see which opponents those games were against.\n\nRow index 5 (game 57): opponent is Vancouver Canucks? Wait no, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the table, each row has an 'opponent' column. For example:\n\n- Row 5: game 62, opponent Calgary Flames?\nWait, I need to accurately map each row's details.\n\nLet me list all opponents for rows with points=80:\n\nRow index 5 (game 62): opponent is Calgary Flames.\nRow index 6 (game 63): opponent is Edmonton Oilers.\n\nSo, two different opponents when the main team's cumulative points reached 80.\n\nTherefore, in these two games, our main team played against two different teams (Calgary and Edmonton) when their points were exactly 80. So there are two teams that have played against our main team when it had 80 points each time.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE because only those two opponents played against the main team when it reached 80 points in those games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"only 2 teams play in game(s) that have a total of 80 points.\" By examining the table, we find that at row indices 5 and 6, the cumulative points are exactly 80. The opponents for these games were the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers, respectively. Thus, only two teams played against our main team when its points reached 80.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim is about two specific games: game 61 and game 60. It states that the total points in game 61 are 10 more than those in game 60. I need to check the points for both these games from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with several columns like \"game,\" \"february,\" \"opponent,\" \"score,\" \"record,\" and \"points.\" The relevant column here is the \"points\" column since that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I'll locate game 60 and game 61 in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Game 52: points = 72\n- Game 53: 74\n- Game 54: 75\n- Game 55: 76\n- Game 56: 78\n- Game 57: 80\n- Game 58: 80 (same as game 57, so no change)\n- Game 59: 82\n- Game 60: points = 84\n- Game 61: points = 86\n- Games beyond that aren't needed since we're only looking at 60 and 61.\n\nSo, game 60 has 84 points, and game 61 has 86 points. The claim says that game 61 has 10 more points than game 60. Let me calculate the difference: 86 (game 61) - 84 (game 60) = 2 points. That's only a 2-point difference, not 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Could \"total\" in the claim refer to something else? The table has columns like score and record. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at game 60:\n- Score: 5 - 3\n- Record: 40 - 16 - 4 (wins, losses, ties)\n- Points: 84\n\nGame 61:\n- Score: 3 - 1\n- Record: 41 - 16 - 4\n- Points: 86\n\nThe points column is the total points for each game.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the washington capital and the vancouver canuck have 3 point difference between them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the table for both teams mentioned: Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks. Looking at the table, each row represents a game with details like opponent, score, record, and points.\n\nI'll start by finding the row where the opponent is \"washington capitals.\" Scanning through the \"opponent\" column, I see that in row 61 (row_index 60 if starting from 0), the opponent is Washington Capitals. The corresponding \"points\" value for this game is 86.\n\nNext, I need to find the entry for Vancouver Canucks. Checking the table again, I find Vancouver Canucks as the opponent in row 63 (row_index 62). Here, the \"points\" are listed as 86 as well.\n\nNow, the claim states that there's a 3-point difference between these two teams. However, both entries show 86 points each. Subtracting them gives a difference of 0, not 3.\n\nTherefore, since both teams have the same number of points in their respective games against other opponents, the claim is incorrect. The relevant cells are the \"points\" from each team's row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because both Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks have 86 points, showing no difference. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the buffalo sabre and the los angeles king have a total of 80 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant rows in the table that mention Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings. \n\nLooking through the table:\n- The row with opponent \"buffalo sabres\" is game number 56. Here, the points are listed as 78.\n- The row with opponent \"los angeles kings\" is game number 60. In this case, the points are 84.\n\nNow, I need to add these two point values together: 78 (Buffalo Sabres) + 84 (Los Angeles Kings). \n\nCalculating that gives me 162 points in total. The claim states that their combined points are 80, which is far less than the actual sum of 162.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the total points do not add up to 80.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings show points as 78 and 84 respectively. Their total is 162, not 80.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the winnipeg jet have the same score as the new york islander",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the winnipeg jet have the same score as the new york islander\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing the scores of two teams: the Winnipeg Jets and the New York Islanders. The claim states that their scores are the same. So, I need to find the rows in the table where each of these teams appears as the opponent and check their respective scores.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple columns: game, february, opponent, score, record, points. The relevant columns here are \"opponent\" and \"score.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where the opponent is either the Winnipeg Jets or the New York Islanders.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is Quebec Nordiques. Not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is St. Louis Blues. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is Minnesota North Stars. Not relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is Chicago Black Hawks. Not relevant.\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is Buffalo Sabres. Not relevant.\n6. **Row 5**: Opponent is New York Islanders. This is one of the teams we're interested in. The score here is 6 - 3, which means the team scored 6 goals and allowed 3. So the New York Islanders have a score of 6-3 in this game.\n7. **Row 6**: Opponent is Montreal Canadiens. Not relevant.\n8. **Row 7**: Opponent is Winnipeg Jets. This is the other team mentioned in the claim. The score here is 8 - 4, meaning they scored 8 goals and allowed 4.\n9. **Row 8**: Opponent is Los Angeles Kings. Not relevant.\n10. **Row 9**: Opponent is Washington Capitals. Not relevant.\n11. **Row 10**: Opponent is Calgary Flames. Not relevant.\n12. **Row 11**: Opponent is Vancouver Canucks. Not relevant.\n\nSo, the New York Islanders' score in their game (row index 5) is 6 - 3, and the Winnipeg Jets' score in their game (row index 7) is 8 - 4.\n\nNow, comparing these two scores: 6-3 vs. 8-4. Clearly, they are not the same. The New York Islanders scored more goals against them than the Winnipeg Jets did. Therefore, the claim that they have the same score is false.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"record\" column might give some context about their performance beyond just the single game mentioned. For instance, in row 5 (New York Islanders), the record after that game was 38-15-4, and in row 7 (Winnipeg Jets), it was 39-16-4. However, since the claim is specifically about their scores being the same, this doesn't directly impact the truth of the statement but might indicate they were both performing similarly overall.\n\nIn conclusion, after examining the relevant rows for each team and comparing their scores, it's clear that their scores are different. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
