    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"robert manzon who have 88 lap with a maserati have average 22 grid\". Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Robert Manzon in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find his name at row index 16. Now, let me check each part of the claim.\n\nThe claim states he has 88 laps with a Maserati. Looking at the \"Laps\" column for Robert Manzon, I see it's actually 59, not 88. That doesn't match. \n\nNext, the average grid position is mentioned as 22. The \"Grid\" column shows 7 for him, which again doesn't align with the claim.\n\nSince both the laps and grid numbers don't support the claim, I conclude it's false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Grid\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with data about drivers and their performance in a race, and a specific claim to verify: \"cesare perdisa of brm have a time / retire of + 6 lap with 18 grid\". My task is to check if this claim is supported by the data in the table. If it's fully supported, I'll answer \"TRUE\"; otherwise, \"FALSE\". Additionally, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It mentions several pieces of information:\n\n1. **Driver Name**: cesare perdisa\n2. **Team**: brm\n3. **Time/Retire**: +6 lap (which I assume means they retired 6 laps behind or something similar)\n4. **Grid Position**: 18\n\nI need to verify each part of the claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows representing different drivers and columns providing details such as the driver's name, time/retire status, grid position, etc. Let me go through each part:\n\n**Step 1: Check for \"cesare perdisa\" in the table**\n\nI'll scan through the 'Driver' column to see if there's an entry for cesare perdisa.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The first few rows include drivers like cesare perdisa, mike hawthorn, etc. Wait, let me check row by row.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table, I notice that \"cesare perdisa\" is listed in one of the rows. Let me find his exact position.\n\nLooking through the 'Driver' column:\n\n- cesare perdisa is in a row towards the middle. Let's note down his row index for reference.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Team (brm)**\n\nThe claim says cesare perdisa is of brm. I need to check what team he was driving for in the table.\n\nIn the 'Team' column, let me find which team corresponds to cesare perdisa's row.\n\nLooking at his row, the team listed is maserati, not brm. So there's a discrepancy here between the claim and the data.\n\n**Step 3: Check Time/Retire**\n\nThe claim states that he has a time/retire of +6 lap. Let me check what is recorded for him in the 'Time/Retire' column.\n\nIn his row, the 'Time/Retire' says \"gearbox\". So instead of \"+6 lap\", it mentions \"gearbox\" as the reason for retirement.\n\n**Step 4: Check Grid Position**\n\nThe claim mentions a grid position of 18. Let me check what grid position is listed for cesare perdisa in the table.\n\nLooking at his row under 'Grid', I see that his grid position is actually 24, not 18.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n- **Driver Name**: Correct (cesare perdisa exists)\n- **Team**: Incorrect (brm vs maserati)\n- **Time/Retire**: Incorrect (\"+6 lap\" vs \"gearbox\")\n- **Grid Position**: Incorrect (18 vs 24)\n\nSince multiple aspects of the claim do not match the data in the table, the overall claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells Identified:**\nTo verify each part, I looked at:\n1. The row where cesare perdisa is listed to check his team.\n2. His time/retire status.\n3. His grid position.\n\nThese correspond to specific cells in the table, which I'll note down with their respective row indices and column names as per instructions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim isn't supported by the data because the team, time/retire reason, and grid position don't align with what's stated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Time/Retire\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Grid\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"cesare perdisa have a time / retire of + 6 lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that contains Cesare Perdisa in the 'Driver' column. Scanning through the rows, I find his name at row index 12 (assuming rows start from 0). \n\nIn that row, the relevant columns are 'Time / Retire' and possibly others to confirm details about him. The 'Time / Retire' column shows '+6 lap', which matches the claim exactly. \n\nI should also check if there's any other information that might affect this claim. For example, verifying his team or position could be useful, but since the claim is only about the time/retire status, those details aren't necessary for verification.\n\nSo, I'll collect the relevant cells: Cesare Perdisa's row has 'Time / Retire' as '+6 lap', which fully supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Time / Retire\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
