It's saying that in game number 82, which occurred after date 7, the score was 2-3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, etc. The rows are indexed from 0 to 5 since there are six games listed (game numbers 77 to 82).\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to game 82. Scanning the \"game\" column, I see that the last row has game number 82. So this is the relevant row for the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if this game took place after date 7. The dates in the table are listed under the \"date\" column. For game 82, the date is 11. Comparing 11 and 7, since 11 comes after 7, this condition holds true.\n\nNow, checking the score. The claim states that the score was 2-3 for game 82. Looking at the \"score\" column in that row, it indeed shows 2 - 3. This matches exactly with what the claim is stating.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in the table: game 82 has a date after 7 and a score of 2-3. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"pittsburgh penguin be the opponent at the mellon arena 17132 fan in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nThe first part mentions \"Pittsburgh Penguins\" as the opponent. So I need to check if there's a row where the opponent is the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nLooking at the table, row indexes go from 0 to 5 (since there are 6 rows in total). Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is \"pittsburgh penguins\". That matches.\n- Rows 1 to 5 have different opponents: Tampa Bay Lightning, Buffalo Sabres, Toronto Maple Leafs, Ottawa Senators, Carolina Hurricanes. So only the first row has Pittsburgh Penguins as the opponent.\n\nNext part of the claim is about the location/attendance being \"mellon arena\" with 17132 fans. The relevant column here is \"location / attendance\".\n\nLooking back at row 0: \"location / attendance\" is listed as \"mellon arena - 17132\". So both parts of the claim match this row.\n\nSo, putting it together: The opponent was Pittsburgh Penguins, and they played at Mellon Arena with an attendance of 17,132. Both details are correctly represented in row 0 of the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all conditions mentioned are satisfied by the data in the first row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information found in the first row of the table where Pittsburgh Penguins were the opponent at Mellon Arena with an attendance of 17,132 fans.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Opponent:** The claim mentions \"Pittsburgh Penguins\" as opponents.\n   - Checked each row's 'opponent' column and found a match in row 0.\n\n2. **Check Location and Attendance:** Claim specifies \"mellon arena 17132\".\n   - Looked into the 'location / attendance' column of the same row (row 0) and confirmed it matches exactly.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the score, 3 - 2, be on date 4 after game 78\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that there was a game with a score of 3-2 on date 4, which comes after game number 78. So I need to find if such a game exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for 'game', 'date', and 'score'. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI'll start by checking each row to see when the date is 4. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 0: Date 1\n- Row 1: Date 3\n- Row 2: Date 4\n- Rows beyond that have dates after 4, so they come later.\n\nSo the game on date 4 is row 2 (index starting at 0). Now I need to check if this game's score is 3-2 and whether it comes after game 78.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- Game number: 79\n- Score: 3 - 2\n\nThe claim states that the score 3-2 occurs on date 4, which matches this row. Now, I need to confirm if this is indeed after game 78.\n\nGame numbers in order are from 77 (row 0) up to 82 (row 5). So, game 79 comes right after 78, as game 78 is row 1 and game 79 is row 2. Therefore, the score of 3-2 on date 4 does occur after game 78.\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are met: the score is correct, it's on the specified date, and it occurs after game 78. The relevant cells are 'date' where value is 4 (row index 2) and 'score' which is 3-2 (same row).\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the 'opponent' column, I see that game number 78 has the opponent listed as \"tampa bay lightning.\" So that's one relevant cell: row index 1, column 'opponent'.\n\nNext, I need to check the score for that same row. The claim mentions a score of 4 - 5 in overtime. Looking at the 'score' column in row 1, it says \"4 - 5 (ot)\", which stands for overtime. That matches exactly with the claim's description.

The claim states: \"the game with a score of 4 - 5 that go into overtime be hold at the prudential center and have 17625 attendance.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's talking about a specific game with a score of 4-5 (which went into overtime) being held at Prudential Center with an attendance of 17,625.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find a game that matches these criteria.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Game 77 vs Pittsburgh Penguins. The score is 1-6, not 4-5. So this doesn't match.\n- Row 1: Game 78 against Tampa Bay Lightning. The score here is 4-5 (OT), which matches part of the claim. Let me check where it was held and attendance. Location/attendance is \"prudential center - 17625.\" So both location and attendance match.\n- Row 2: Game 79 vs Buffalo Sabres, score 3-2. Doesn't fit.\n- Rows 3 to 5: Scores don't match the 4-5 OT criteria.\n\nSo, only row 1 (index 1) matches all parts of the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"final score of the game 82 hold before date 7 be 2 - 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems a bit confusing because of the wording. The phrase \"hold before date 7\" might mean that game 82 took place after date 7, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as the score being held at 2-3 before date 7, which doesn't make much sense. Maybe the claim is trying to say that in game 82, which was played before date 7, the final score was 2-3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. The dates are listed as numbers, probably representing days in a month or something similar.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 82\" and its final score being 2-3 before date 7. So I need to check two things: the score of game 82 and whether it occurred before date 7.\n\nFirst, let's find game 82 in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Game 77: date 1\n- Game 78: date 3\n- Game 79: date 4\n- Game 80: date 7\n- Game 81: date 9\n- Game 82: date 11\n\nSo game 82 is on row index 5 (since counting starts at 0) and has a date of 11. The score for game 82 is indeed 2 - 3, as per the claim.\n\nNow, checking if this game happened before date 7. The claim says \"before date 7,\" but in the table, date 7 corresponds to game 80 (row index 3). Since game 82 has a higher game number and a later date (11), it actually occurred after date 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the claim. The claim states that the final score of game 82 before date 7 was 2-3. But according to the table, game 82 is on date 11, which is after date 7. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because game 82 didn't occur before date 7; it happened after.\n\nSo, putting this together: The score of game 82 is correct (2-3), but the timing is wrong\u2014it was played after date 7, not before. Hence, the entire statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in game 82, which occurred before date 7, the final score was 2-3. However, game 82 took place on date 11, which is after date 7. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the location / attendance be mellon arena  - 17132 for the game against opponent buffalo sabre.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. There are two main parts here: the location/attendance and the opponent. The claim is stating that when the opponent was the Buffalo Sabres, the location was Mellon Arena with an attendance of 17,132.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find where the opponent is listed as \"buffalo sabres.\" Scanning down, in row index 2 (since rows start from 0), under the 'opponent' column, it says \"buffalo sabres.\" So that's the game we're interested in.\n\nNow, I need to check two things for this row: the location/attendance and whether the opponent is indeed Buffalo Sabres. The claim mentions the opponent as \"buffalo sabre,\" which seems like a slight typo missing the 's' at the end. In the table, it's spelled with an 's,' so that might be a point to consider, but perhaps it's just a minor error in the claim.\n\nNext, looking at the 'location / attendance' column for this row. The entry is \"hsbc arena  - 18690.\" Wait, Mellon Arena isn't mentioned here; instead, it's HSBC Arena with an attendance of 18,690. So according to the table, when they played against Buffalo Sabres (row index 2), the location was HSBC Arena, not Mellon Arena.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other rows where the opponent is Buffalo Sabres. Looking through all the rows, row indices 0 to 5: only row 2 has \"buffalo sabres\" as the opponent. So that's the only relevant game for this claim.\n\nTherefore, the location/attendance in that game was HSBC Arena with attendance 18,690, not Mellon Arena with 17,132 as claimed. That means the claim is incorrect because it attributes the wrong location and attendance to that specific opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against Buffalo Sabres took place at Mellon Arena with 17,132 attendees, but according to the table, the game was at HSBC Arena with a higher attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions two main points: the score of game 79 and that this game was held before date 4. The claim asserts both these conditions as facts.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game played by the team.\n\nThe claim is about game 79, so I'll first look for the row where the \"game\" column is 79. Scanning through the table, I find that in row index 2 (since counting starts at 0), the game number is 79.\n\nNext, checking the score for this game. The \"score\" column in that row shows \"3 - 2\", which matches the claim's score of 3-2. So far, so good.\n\nNow, regarding the date condition: the claim says the game was held before date 4. Let me check the \"date\" column in row 2. It indicates date 4. Wait a minute\u2014that means the game took place on date 4, not before it. The claim specifies that the game occurred before date 4, but according to the table, it's exactly on date 4.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that part of the claim isn't accurate. Even though the score is correct, the timing aspect (held before date 4) is incorrect because the game was actually on date 4.\n\nSo, while the score does match, the condition about the date being before 4 doesn't hold true. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states the score of game 79 as 3-2 but incorrectly claims it was held before date 4 when it was on date 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"final score against the opponent tampa bay lightning be 5 - 4 (ot)\". So, I'm looking for a game where the opponent was Tampa Bay Lightning and checking if their final score was 5-4 in overtime.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. There are six rows, from game 77 to game 82. Let me go through each one:\n\n1. Game 77: Opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins. Doesn't match Tampa Bay Lightning.\n2. Game 78: Opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning. This seems relevant.\n3. Games 79-82 have opponents Buffalo Sabres, Toronto Maple Leafs, Ottawa Senators, and Carolina Hurricanes respectively, none of which are Tampa Bay.\n\nSo, the only relevant row is game 78. Now, let's look at the details in that row:\n\n- The score is listed as \"4 - 5 (ot)\". That means the team scored 4 goals, their opponent scored 5, and it went into overtime.\n- The claim says \"final score against... tampa bay lightning be 5 - 4 (ot)\", which suggests the opponent's score is higher.\n\nWait a second. In the table, the team's score is 4, and the opponent's is 5 in OT. So the final score from their perspective would be 4-5 (OT). But the claim says \"final score... 5 - 4 (ot)\", which implies they won 5-4 in overtime.\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory. Did I read it right? Let me double-check:\n\nThe table shows \"4 - 5 (ot)\" for game 78. So, if the opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning, and the score is 4-5 (OT), then the final score was a loss for the team in question.\n\nBut the claim states that against Tampa Bay Lightning, their final score was 5-4 OT. That would mean they won with 5 goals to the opponent's 4. But according to the table, it's the opposite: they lost 4-5 in OT.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the team actually lost 4-5 in overtime against Tampa Bay Lightning, not winning 5-4 as stated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is row index 1 (game 78) where the opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning and the score was 4 - 5 (OT), which does not match the claim of a 5 - 4 OT win.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
