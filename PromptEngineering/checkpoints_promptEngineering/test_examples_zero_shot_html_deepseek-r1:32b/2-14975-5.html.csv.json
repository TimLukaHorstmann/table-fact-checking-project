    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a number of games: 90. Then it says these are played in a series related to the \"sawhorse dollar trophy.\" So I'm looking for a row where both the number of games and the trophy name match this information.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows. Each row represents a pair of teams and their series details. The columns include 'teams', 'name', 'trophy', 'first met', 'games played', and 'series record'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the 'sawhorse dollar' is mentioned as the trophy.\n\n- **Row 0**: Teams are Columbia - Cornell, Trophy is Empire Cup. The games played here are 98, which doesn't match 90.\n- **Row 1**: Teams are Cornell - Penn, Trophy is Trustee's Cup. Games played: 118, so no.\n- **Row 2**: Teams are Dartmouth - Princeton, Trophy is Sawhorse Dollar. Here, the games played are listed as 90 games. This matches both the trophy name and the number of games in the claim.\n- **Row 3**: Harvard - Yale, Trophy is none. Games: 129, doesn't match.\n- **Row 4**: Princeton - Yale, Trophy is none. Games: 134, not matching.\n\nSo, Row 2 has both the trophy \"sawhorse dollar\" and the number of games as 90. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n\nI need to note the relevant cells for verification. The 'trophy' column in row 2 shows \"sawhorse dollar,\" and the 'games played' column also in row 2 shows 90 games. These are the two pieces of information that confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were 90 games played for the sawhorse dollar trophy, which matches the data in row 2 where both the trophy name and the number of games align.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"more than 100 games be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements are:\n\n1. The number of games played in a specific series.\n2. That series must have the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy.\n\nI should look through each row of the table to find where the trophy is mentioned as \"sawhorse dollar.\"\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: Trophy is Empire Cup.\n- Row 1: Trophy is Trustee's Cup.\n- Row 2: Trophy is Sawhorse Dollar. This matches the claim.\n- Rows 3 and 4 don't mention a trophy related to the sawhorse.\n\nNow, focusing on Row 2 (index 2), which has the Sawhorse Dollar trophy. The relevant columns here are \"games played\" and \"trophy.\"\n\nIn this row, under \"games played,\" it says \"90 games.\" The claim mentions \"more than 100 games,\" so I need to check if 90 is more than 100.\n\nSince 90 is less than 100, the number of games played isn't more than 100. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in this row.\n\nI also consider if there's any other row with the Sawhorse Dollar trophy. But looking at all rows, only Row 2 has that trophy. \n\nThus, based on the table, the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy has played 90 games, which doesn't exceed 100. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a series with the Sawhorse Dollar trophy having over 100 games. The relevant row shows only 90 games, so the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
