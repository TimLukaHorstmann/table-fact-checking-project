    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim is: \"winter gymnastics have 1 division in the 2011 - 2012 state tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. It mentions \"winter gymnastics,\" so I should look for that sport in the table. The season is winter, which narrows it down further.\n\nNext, the claim talks about the number of divisions being 1 during the 2011-2012 state tournament. So I need to find the row where the sport is gymnastics, season is winter, and then check the \"of divisions\" column for that specific year.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nI'll scan each row for the Sport column and Season. The relevant row seems to be the one where Sport is \"gymnastics\" and Season is \"winter.\" \n\nIn that row, under the \"of divisions\" column, it says \"1\". Now, I need to check if this corresponds to the 2011-2012 state tournament location. Wait, no\u2014the \"1st tournament\" column has the year 1977 for gymnastics. That doesn't match 2011-2012.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the columns. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table columns are: season, sport, tournament structure, of divisions, 1st tournament, and 2011 - 2012 state tournament location.\n\nSo for winter gymnastics, in the row where Sport is \"gymnastics,\" the relevant columns would be:\n\n- Tournament Structure: sectional, district, & state\n- Of Divisions: 1\n- 1st tournament: 1977\n- 2011 - 2012 state tournament location: hilliard bradley high school , hilliard\n\nWait, but the claim is about the number of divisions in the 2011-2012 state tournament. So I think the relevant column here is \"of divisions\" which shows 1.\n\nBut wait, the 2011-2012 location's row doesn't directly have a division count\u2014it has the structure as \"sectional, district, & state.\" The \"of divisions\" might refer to how many levels or sections there are before the state tournament. So in this case, it's 1 division leading up to the state.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be where Sport is gymnastics, Season is winter, and column_name is \"of divisions.\"\n\nSo the row index for gymnastics is 4 (since it's the fifth row, starting from 0). The column in question is \"of divisions,\" which is column 3 if we count from 0.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of divisions\"}].\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: For winter gymnastics, the number of divisions is 1. The claim says that in the 2011-2012 state tournament, they have 1 division. So I'm looking for whether, during that year's state tournament, there was 1 division.\n\nIn the table, each row has the \"of divisions\" as a separate column, which is fixed and doesn't change per year. So in this case, it's always 1 for gymnastics. Therefore, regardless of the year, it's 1 division. However, the claim specifically refers to 2011-2012, but that row's data is about 1977.\n\nWait, no\u2014the \"1st tournament\" column has 1977, which doesn't align with 2011-2012. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Maybe the \"of divisions\" refers to how many levels of competition exist before the state tournament, and that number hasn't changed since 1977.\n\nBut the claim is about the 2011-2012 state tournament. Looking at the row for winter gymnastics, the \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\" is hilliard bradley high school. The \"of divisions\" is still 1, regardless of the year. So perhaps the number of divisions hasn't changed since then.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each sport has a fixed number of divisions. For example, cross country has 3, field hockey has 1, etc. So for gymnastics, it's always 1 division leading up to state.\n\nSo the claim is correct because winter gymnastics have 1 division in their state tournament, as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that winter gymnastics have exactly 1 division in the relevant state tournament.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of divisions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"the 1st tournament of bowling be in 2007.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, 1st tournament year, and location for the 2011-2012 state tournament. \n\nI need to focus on the relevant parts that prove or disprove the claim. The claim specifically mentions the \"1st tournament\" of bowling and whether it was in 2007. So I should look at the row where the sport is bowling and see what year is listed for the 1st tournament.\n\nLooking through each row, I see that there's a winter season with bowling as the sport. In this row, under \"1st tournament,\" it says 2007. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The table has multiple entries for different sports and seasons. Since the claim is only about the bowling tournament in 2007, I don't need to consider other rows unless they also mention bowling with a conflicting year.\n\nIn this case, there's only one row for bowling, and it clearly states the 1st tournament was in 2007. So that should support the claim as true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data where the \"1st tournament\" of bowling is listed as 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st tournament\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the 2011 - 2012 soccer state tournament be held in crew stadium, columbus.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has several columns: season, sport, tournament structure, number of divisions, 1st tournament year, and the location of the 2011-2012 state tournament.\n\nLooking for the relevant parts of the claim, it mentions \"2011 - 2012 soccer state tournament\" and the location is \"crew stadium, columbus.\" So I need to find in the table where this information is.\n\nI'll start by searching for the row that has \"2011-2012\" in the '1st tournament' column. Wait, no, actually, looking at the table's columns, the last column is '2011 - 2012 state tournament location.' So that's the exact cell we need to check.\n\nNext, I should find which row corresponds to soccer in the 'sport' column and see if it matches the location given. The third row has \"soccer\" as the sport. Let me check that row's last cell for the location.\n\nYes, in the third row under '2011 - 2012 state tournament location,' it says \"crew stadium, columbus.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other relevant cells needed. The 'season' is fall, which aligns with soccer being played in the fall.

The claim says: \"the winter season's 2011 - 2012 state tournament location be in crew stadium , columbus.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions the winter season, specifically the 2011-2012 state tournament location at crew stadium in Columbus.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different sport and season. So I need to focus on rows where the season is winter. Let's scan through the 'season' column:\n\nRow 4: winter\nRow 5: winter\nRow 6: winter\n\nSo there are three winter sports: bowling, gymnastics, swimming and diving.\n\nNext, I check if any of these have a 2011-2012 state tournament location listed as crew stadium in Columbus. \n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nFor bowling (row 4), the location is Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl.\nFor gymnastics (row 5), it's Hilliard Bradley High School.\nFor swimming and diving (row 6), it's Branin Natatorium.\n\nNone of these locations mention crew stadium or columbus.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"in 1978 there be 1 winter season with exactly 1 division.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's making two main points: \n1. In 1978, there was a winter season.\n2. That winter season had exactly one division.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different sport with its respective details. The columns relevant here are \"season\", \"tournament structure\", and the year.\n\nI'll start by checking if any of the entries from the table match 1978 in the \"1st tournament\" column because that's the year specified in the claim. \n\nExamining each row:\n- The first row has season 'fall' with a 1st tournament year of 1978. This is about cross country, so it's not winter.\n- The second row is fall field hockey from 1979, which doesn't apply.\n- Third row is soccer in 1985, again fall and not relevant.\n- Fourth row is bowling in 2007, winter but the year is 2007, not 1978.\n- Fifth row is gymnastics in 1977, winter but earlier than 1978.\n- Sixth row is swimming in 1977 as well.\n\nSo, from the \"1st tournament\" column, I don't see any winter sports with a tournament year of 1978. That suggests that there might not be a winter season in 1978 with exactly one division.\n\nNext, looking at the \"tournament structure\" column for each sport during winter seasons: \n- Bowling has sectional, district, state\u2014three divisions.\n- Gymnastics also has three divisions.\n- Swimming and diving have two divisions.\n\nWait, but none of them mention having just one division in 1978. The claim says \"exactly 1 division,\" so I need to see if any winter sport had only one division in 1978. \n\nSince the table doesn't show any such entry for 1978, especially with a single division, it looks like the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check if there's an oversight. Let me look again. No, all the winter sports listed have more than one division each. So, the claim that in 1978 there was exactly one winter season with one division doesn't hold true based on the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
