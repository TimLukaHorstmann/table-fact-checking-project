    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the total attendance on may 28 be 17132\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand what information it contains. The table has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. Each row represents a game or event with its details.\n\nThe claim is about the total attendance on May 28th being 17,132. So my task is to find the relevant cell in the table that corresponds to May 28th and check if its attendance matches this number.\n\nLooking at the date column, I see the rows have dates: May 24, May 26, May 28, May 31, June 2, and June 4. So May 28 is one of the dates in the table, specifically row index 2 (since we start counting from 0).\n\nNow, for each relevant row, I need to check which column holds the attendance data. The column is clearly labeled \"attendance.\" Therefore, for May 28, the attendance cell is important.\n\nI'll locate the May 28 row in the table. In that row, under the attendance column, the value is 17132. That matches exactly with the claim of 17,132.\n\nSo, to verify this, I should check both the date (row index) and the specific column (attendance). No other columns seem relevant here because the claim is only about attendance on a particular day.\n\nTherefore, since May 28 has an attendance figure of 17,132, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the row for May 28 and the \"attendance\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support my conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066.\"\n\nSo, I'm looking for matches where the score is 0-4 and among those, identify if the highest attendance is exactly 20,066.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row (row index 0) has a date of May 24. The visitor is Pittsburgh, with a score of 0-4 against Detroit. Attendance here is 20,066. The series is 1-0.\n2. The second row (index 1) also has Pittsburgh as the visitor, but their score is 0-3 against Detroit. Attendance is again 20,066, series 2-0.\n3. The third row (index 2): Detroit is visiting Pittsburgh, score is 2-3, so not a 0-4 situation.\n4. Fourth row (index 3): Same as above, score is 2-1, which doesn't fit.\n5. Fifth row (index 4): Score is 4-3; no match for 0-4 here.\n6. Sixth row (index 5): Score is 3-2; also not a 0-4.\n\nSo only the first two rows have a score of 0-4, both with attendance 20,066.\n\nSince there are two matches with that score and same attendance, the highest is indeed 20,066. No other match with 0-4 has higher or lower attendance beyond these two.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the first two rows for 'attendance' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the attendance on may 28 be lower than the attendance on may 31.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has a few columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. For this claim, the relevant columns are 'date' and 'attendance'. \n\nNext, I need to identify which rows correspond to May 28 and May 31. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row is May 24.\n- Second: May 26.\n- Third: May 28. This is the one we're interested in for attendance on May 28.\n- Fourth: May 31. That's our other relevant date.\n\nNow, I'll extract the 'attendance' values from these two rows. From the table:\n\nOn May 28, the attendance is 17132.\nOn May 31, it's also 17132.\n\nSo both attendances are equal. The claim says that on May 28, attendance was lower than on May 31. But since both numbers are the same, the claim isn't true\u2014it's actually false because the attendance wasn't lower; it stayed the same.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the attendance on May 28 (17132) is not lower than that on May 31 (also 17132). Both attendances are equal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the total lowest attendance with a score of 4 - 2 be higher than 20066.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is asking. It mentions two specific things:\n\n1. **Total Lowest Attendance**: I think this means we're looking for the lowest attendance figure in any row where the score is \"4-2.\" So, among all the games with a score of 4-2, which one had the smallest attendance? Then, it's comparing that number to 20066.\n\n2. **Score of 4 - 2**: I need to find all rows where the score column exactly matches \"4-2.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'score' column. Let me go through each row to identify which ones have \"4-2\" as their score.\n\nScanning the table:\n\n- Row 0: Score is \"0 - 4\"\n- Row 1: Score is \"0 - 3\"\n- Row 2: Score is \"2 - 3\"\n- Row 3: Score is \"2 - 1\"\n- Row 4: Score is \"4 - 3\"\n- Row 5: Score is \"3 - 2\"\n\nHmm, none of the scores in the table are exactly \"4-2.\" Wait a minute. The claim says there's a score of \"4 - 2,\" but looking at all six rows, I don't see that specific score. Each game has different scores, like \"0 - 4,\" \"0 - 3,\" \"2 - 3,\" etc., but none have \"4-2.\"\n\nSo if there are no games with a score of \"4-2\" in the table, does that mean the claim is false? Because it's based on the premise that such a game exists. If the data doesn't support the existence of a game with that specific score, then the statement can't be true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: \"may 24\" has a score of \"0 - 4.\"\nRow 1: \"may 26\" has \"0 - 3.\"\nRow 2: \"may 28\" has \"2 - 3.\"\nRow 3: \"may 31\" has \"2 - 1.\"\nRow 4: \"june 2\" has \"4 - 3.\"\nRow 5: \"june 4\" has \"3 - 2.\"\n\nNo, none of these are \"4-2.\" So the first part of the claim is about attendance in games that have a score of \"4-2,\" but since no such game exists, there's no attendance to consider. Therefore, the comparison doesn't hold because there's nothing to compare.\n\nSo, the claim can't be true because the premise isn't met. There are no games with a score of 4-2 in the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are no games in the table with a score of \"4 - 2,\" so comparing their attendance doesn't apply.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
