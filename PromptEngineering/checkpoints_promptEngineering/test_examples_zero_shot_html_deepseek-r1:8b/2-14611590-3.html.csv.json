It mentions two players: Billy Mayfair and Lee Janzen. The key part here is \"number of event\" from the 1995 PGA Tour. So, I need to find out how many events each of them participated in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there's a column called \"events.\" This seems relevant because it directly addresses the number of events each player took part in. \n\nNext, I'll check the rows for Billy Mayfair and Lee Janzen to get their respective event counts. \n\nBilly Mayfair is ranked second in the table. His row shows that he has 28 events listed under \"events.\" On the other hand, Lee Janzen is ranked third with 28 events as well.\n\nWait a minute, so both have 28 events? That would mean they have the same number of events. But I should double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. \n\nLet me go through each row again. For Billy Mayfair (row 2), \"events\" is indeed 28. Lee Janzen (row 3) also has 28 events. So, yes, both participated in the same number of events.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because their event counts match.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for Billy Mayfair and Lee Janzen's \"events\" column.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"greg norman and lee janzen both have 3 win in the 1995 pga tour.\" So I need to check if both these players had exactly 3 wins that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various golf players with their rankings, country, earnings, events, and wins. The columns are rank, player, country, earnings, events, and wins. \n\nLet me locate Greg Norman in the table. His name is listed as \"greg norman\" in row 0 (row_index: 0). In that row, under the 'wins' column, it says 3. So that matches the claim for Greg.\n\nNext, Lee Janzen is another player mentioned in the claim. Looking through the rows, I find him in row 2 (row_index: 2) with his name \"lee janzen.\" Checking the 'wins' column here, it also shows 3. That seems to support the claim as well.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other relevant players or details I'm missing. The table has rows from index 0 to 4. Only Greg Norman and Lee Janzen are mentioned in the claim, so I don't need to check others unless the claim refers to them, which it doesn't.\n\nNow, considering the instruction about the JSON structure: I need to provide a list of relevant cells. Each cell should have \"row_index\" as an integer and \"column_name\" as a string. For Greg Norman, he's in row 0 and column 'wins'.

It's an HTML table with headers: rank, player, country, earnings, events, wins. There are five rows of data. My focus is on the players Corey Pavin and Steve Elkington and their respective countries.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is rank 1, player Greg Norman from Australia.\n2.

Therefore, the claim should be true.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Sometimes tables can have errors or typos. Let's confirm their rows and columns again.\n\nCorey Pavin is in row 4 (index 3 if we start from 0), column \"country\" shows United States.\nSteve Elkington is in row 5 (index 4), country Australia.

Specifically, it's saying that Greg Norman's rank was higher than Billy Mayfair in the 1995 PGA Tour. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for these two players. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Player is Greg Norman from Australia. His rank is 1.\n2. Row 1: Player is Billy Mayfair from the United States. His rank is 2.\n\nSo, in the table, Greg Norman is ranked higher (rank 1) than Billy Mayfair (rank 2). That seems to support the claim. \n\nWait, but I should make sure that this data is specifically for the 1995 PGA Tour. The table doesn't specify the year, so I have to assume it's about 1995 based on the claim. If the data in the table isn't from 1995, then my assumption could be wrong. But without more context, I'll proceed with what's given.\n\nThe relevant columns for this comparison are \"rank\" because that directly shows their positions.

Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Greg Norman and Steve Elkington. I need to find out their countries based on the table. \n\nLooking at the first part of the claim about Greg Norman: according to the table, Greg Norman is in the first row (row index 0). His country is listed as Australia. The claim says he's from the United States, which doesn't match because Australia and the United States are different countries. So this part of the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nNext, Steve Elkington: he's in the fifth row (row index 4). His country is also Australia. The claim states that he should be from Australia, which does match correctly.\n\nSo, out of the two parts of the claim, only the second part about Steve Elkington is true. Since one part is false and the other is true, the overall claim isn't entirely accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that confirm each part of the claim. For Greg Norman, his country is in column \"country\" at row index 0. For Steve Elkington, his country is also in the \"country\" column but at row index 4.

The claim says, \"Billy Mayfair alone have the most event in the 1995 PGA Tour.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of this claim means. The key points here are that Billy Mayfair has the most events and that no one else shares this position.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several players with their rankings, country, earnings, events, and wins. The ranking is probably based on some criteria like earnings or total points. \n\nI need to focus on the \"events\" column because the claim is about having the most events. So I should look for Billy Mayfair's row in that column. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- Row 0: greg norman - 16 events\n- Row 1: billy mayfair - 28 events\n- Row 2: lee janzen - 28 events\n- Row 3: corey pavin - 22 events\n- Row 4: steve elkington - 21 events\n\nWait, so Billy Mayfair has 28 events and Lee Janzen also has 28.

Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the claim: It says that Greg Norman and Lee Janzen each have only 1 win during the 1995 PGA Tour. So I need to check their number of wins in that year from the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are rank, player, country, earnings, events, and wins. The rows list players with their respective statistics. \n\nStarting with Greg Norman: His row is the first one (row index 0). The \"wins\" column for him shows a value of 3. That's more than 1, so according to the table, he has 3 wins, not 1.\n\nNext, Lee Janzen: He is in the third row (row index 2). His \"wins\" column also shows 3. Again, this is more than 1. So both Greg Norman and Lee Janzen have 3 wins each according to the table.\n\nNow, considering the claim states that they only have 1 win each, but the table contradicts this by showing 3 wins for both. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm looking at the correct year. The table doesn't specify the year, just the earnings and other stats. If the claim refers to the 1995 PGA Tour, perhaps the table's data isn't from that exact year? But without knowing the context or the actual data for 1995, I have to rely solely on what's given.\n\nAssuming the wins listed in the table are accurate for whatever year the data represents, which might not be 1995. However, since the claim is about 1995 and the table doesn't specify, there could be a discrepancy. But the instruction is to check based on the table, regardless of external context.\n\nSo, if the table shows both having 3 wins each, then the claim that they only have 1 win is false. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The columns I need to look at are \"wins\" for both players. So Greg Norman's row index is 0 and column is \"wins,\" Lee Janzen is row 2, same column.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim isn't supported because both have 3 wins.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
