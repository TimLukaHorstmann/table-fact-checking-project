The column 'tournament' includes names like \"florence,\" \"wellington,\" \"sydney,\" etc. The row for Indian Wells is on line 12 (row_index: 12) and the tournament name is \"indian wells.\" The date for this particular match is listed as \"8 march 1992.\"\n\nSo, the date in the table exactly matches the claim made. Therefore, the statement should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'date' column (column index 1) and the 'tournament' column (column index 2) are both important because they confirm both the specific date and that it's referring to Indian Wells.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include both the row for Indian Wells and their respective columns: date and tournament.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier be the opponent in the match that be play in nice on a clay court.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to identify what needs to be checked.\n\n1. **Opponent**: The claim mentions j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier as the opponent.\n2. **Match location**: The match takes place in Nice.\n3. **Surface type**: It's a clay court.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with details like outcome, date, tournament name, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the tournament is Nice on a clay court and see if j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier is the opponent in that match.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- The first few rows don't mention Nice. For example, row 0 has Florence, then Wellington, Sydney, Orlando, Toulouse, etc.\n- I'll keep scanning until I find 'nice' in the tournament column.\n\nFound it! Row index 5 (since the table starts at 0). Let me check:\n\n- **Row 5**: Tournament is Nice. Surface is clay. Opponent is j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier. The score is 6-4, 6-4.\n  \nSo, in this match, j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier is indeed the opponent on a clay court in Nice.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the match that be play in nice.\" I should check if there's any other match in Nice with a different opponent. Let me look further down.\n\nLooking beyond row 5:\n\n- Row 8: Tournament is Monte Carlo, not Nice.\n- Then row 9: Rome, row 10: Tel Aviv, row 11: Montreal, row 12: Indian Wells, etc., none mention Nice again.\n\nSo, the only match in Nice with a clay court is row 5 where j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier was the opponent.

The claim says, \"the score in the match against sergi bruguera was 5 - 7 , 4 - 6.\" \n\nFirst, I should find out which rows involve Sergei Bruguera. Looking at the table, each row has a column called \"opponent\". So I need to scan through each row's opponent name and see if it matches \"sergi bruguera\".\n\nStarting from the top, the opponents are Alessandro de minicis, Ramesh krishnan, John Fitzgerald, Miloslav me\u010d\u00ed\u0159, Jimmy Connors, J\u00e9r\u00f4me potier, Martin St\u0159elba, Scott Davis, Thomas Muster (twice), Amos Mansdorf, Petr Korda, Michael Chang, and finally, Michael Stich. Hmm, none of these are Sergei Bruguera.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed one? Let me go through each row again. The last few rows have opponents like Michael Chang, then Michael Stich, and the next is Sergei Bruguera in the 8 August 1993 row. So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, in that row, the score column has \"5 - 7 , 4 - 6\". That matches exactly what the claim says. So the score for the match against Sergei Bruguera was indeed 5-7 and 4-6.\n\nI should also note which columns are relevant here. The opponent is in the \"opponent\" column, so that's one. And the score is in the \"score\" column. So the relevant cells would be row_index of 12 (since it's the 13th row, but zero-indexed), and both \"opponent\" and \"score\" columns.\n\nWait, the rows are numbered starting from 0? Let me check the table again. The first row is index 0, then 1, up to 12 for Sergei Bruguera. So yes, row_index 12.\n\nSo the relevant cells are: opponent (row 12) and score (row 12).\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a match where Sergei Bruguera was the opponent, and the score is 5-7, 4-6. The table has this exact match in the last row before Michael Chang's entry.

I need to find out if there's a corresponding row in the table that matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an outcome with details like date, tournament name, surface, opponent, and score. The tournaments are listed under the \"tournament\" column, so I'll focus on that column first.\n\nI remember that one of the rows is for Wellington. Let me check each row's tournament to see which one it is. Scanning through:\n\n1. Florence\n2. Wellington (runner-up)\n3. Sydney\n4. Orlando\n5. Toulouse\n6. Nice\n7. Munich\n8. Auckland\n9. Monte Carlo\n10. Rome\n11. Tel Aviv\n12. Montreal\n13. Indian Wells\n14. Hamburg\n15. Prague\n\nYes, there's a row for Wellington. Now, I need to look at the score column for that specific row. \n\nLooking back at the table, the second row (index 1) is for Wellington with an outcome of runner-up and the opponent Ramesh Krishnan. The score is listed as \"7 - 6 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\". That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, it seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly references a specific tournament's score as per the provided HTML table.

The claim says: \"the tournament in indian well on 8 march 1992 be play on a clay surface.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the relevant information. Let's see, the table has columns like outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nThe key parts of the claim are:\n- Tournament location: Indian Wells\n- Date: 8 March 1992\n- Surface: clay\n\nSo I need to check if there is a row in the table that matches all these criteria. \n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n1. The first few rows don't mention Indian Wells, so skip.\n2. Then I see a row where tournament is \"indian wells\", date is 8 march 1992. Let's check that row.\n\nIn that row, the 'surface' column has the value 'hardcourt'. Hmm, that's not clay. So according to this row, the surface was hardcourt, which doesn't match the claim of clay.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check if there are multiple rows for Indian Wells on 8 March 1992. Let me scan through all the rows again.\n\nLooking at each 'tournament' column:\n- The first few tournaments are like florence, wellington, etc.\n- Then I see Auckland, Monte Carlo, Rome, Tel Aviv, Montreal, Indian Wells, etc.\n\nWhen I find the row for \"indian wells\", it's on 8 March 1992. So that's the one. But surface is hardcourt, not clay.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the tournament was played on a clay surface is incorrect based on this table data.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, I need to identify the relevant cells. The 'surface' column is where we found the discrepancy. So the relevant cell is row 12 (since indexing starts from 0, maybe it's row 11 or 12? Wait, let me count the rows properly.)\n\nWait, the table has 14 rows because I can see up to row 13 in the given data. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the HTML, the tbody has tr elements. The first tr is row 0, then 1, and so on until the last one which would be row 13.\n\nSo the Indian Wells row is probably the 12th or 13th? Wait, no. Looking back, the rows provided are from 0 to 13. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: tournament florence\n...\nLooking through the list, I see \"indian wells\" as the 11th row (since starting from 0). So row_index is 11.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is in row 11, column 'surface'.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}]}",

The tournament location is Wellington.\n2. The date is April 24, 1989.\n3. The surface is hardcourt.\n4. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier is the opponent.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table for any matches that fit these criteria.\n\nLooking at each row one by one:\n\n- The first row is May 25, 1987, in Florence on clay. Not relevant.\n- Second row: January 3, 1988, Wellington, hardcourt. Opponent is Ramesh Krishnan. Not Potier.\n- Third row: January 10, 1988, Sydney, grass. Not Wellington or hardcourt.\n- Fourth row: March 14, 1988, Orlando, hardcourt. Opponent Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159. Not our date.\n- Fifth row: October 16, 1988, Toulouse, hardcourt. Not Wellington.\n- Sixth row: April 24, 1989, Nice, clay. Wait, that's the date and surface mentioned in the claim. But let me check the tournament location. It's in Nice, not Wellington. Hmm, but the claim says \"wellington\", so this might not be relevant yet.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. The sixth row is April 24, 1989, in Nice on clay. So the opponent is J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier. But the tournament isn't in Wellington. So does that mean the claim is incorrect?\n\nBut let me continue checking all rows to make sure there's no match in Wellington with Potier as opponent on that date.\n\nSeventh row: May 8, 1989, Munich, clay. Opponent St\u0159elba. Not Wellington.\n\nEighth row: January 14, 1990, Auckland, hardcourt. Opponent Davis. Not relevant.\n\nNinth row: April 30, 1990, Monte Carlo, clay. Opponent Muster. Not Potier.\n\nTenth row: May 20, 1990, Rome, clay. Opponent someone else.\n\nEleventh row: March 9, 1992, Indian Wells, hardcourt. Opponent Chang.\n\nTwelfth row: May 8, 1993, Hamburg, clay. Opponent Stich.\n\nThirteenth row: August 8, 1993, Prague, clay. Opponent Bruguera.\n\nSo after going through all the rows, I don't see any match in Wellington on April 24, 1989 with hardcourt surface where Potier is the opponent. Instead, I found a match in Nice on the same date and surface where Potier was the opponent.\n\nWait, that means the claim might be incorrect because it refers to Wellington, but the actual match was in Nice. So the relevant cells would be the one for April 24, 1989, which is row index 5 (since rows start at 0). The columns are 'tournament location' and 'opponent'.\n\nSo I need to check the 'tournament location' column for that date. In row 5, the tournament is in Nice, not Wellington. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the tournament being in Wellington is wrong.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because Potier was indeed the opponent but on a different location, and there's no match in Wellington as claimed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"tournament location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I'll scan each row of the table under the 'opponent' column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has an opponent named \"alessandro de minicis\" \u2013 not Bruguera.\n2. Second row: \"ramesh krishnan\" \u2013 no.\n3. Third: \"john fitzgerald\" \u2013 nope.\n4. Fourth: \"miloslav me\u010d\u00ed\u0159\" \u2013 no.\n5. Fifth: \"jimmy connors\" \u2013 no.\n6.

The claim says: \"the score in the tournament in in tel aviv be 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 and the match be win by amos mansdorf.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the score in Tel Aviv and that Amos Mansdorf won the match. So I need to find the relevant rows and columns in the table that relate to these pieces of information.\n\nI'll start by looking for any row where the tournament is \"Tel Aviv.\" Scanning through the table, I see a row with tournament name \"tel aviv\" on row 14 (assuming rows are 0-indexed or not; actually, looking at the HTML, each <tr> represents a row. Let me count: row 1 is first, so maybe it's 0-based? Wait, in the example given, they have row_index starting from 0, but in the table, the first row after <thead> is the first match on May 25, 1987, which would be row 0 if 0-indexed. So I'll go through each row to find \"tel aviv\".\n\nLooking at the tournament column:\n\n- Row 12: montreal\n- Row 13: indian wells\n- Row 14: tel aviv (I think that's correct)\n- Then others follow.\n\nWait, no, looking back, in the table provided, the tournaments are:\n\n1. florence\n2. wellington\n3. sydney\n4. orlando\n5. toulouse\n6. nice\n7. munich\n8. auckland\n9. monte carlo\n10. rome\n11. tel aviv (row 14)\n12. montreal\n13. indian wells\n14. hamburg\n15. prague\n\nSo yes, row 14 is Tel Aviv.\n\nNow, in this row, the outcome is \"winner,\" and the score is \"6 - 4 , 6 - 3.\" So that's one part of the claim correct: the score is as stated.\n\nThe opponent in this match is Amos Mansdorf. So yes, he won the match, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are present in row 14. Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index: 14\n- column_name: \"score\"\n- and \"opponent\"\n\nWait, but the claim mentions two things: score and the match being won by Amos Mansdorf. So both the opponent's name and the score need to be checked.\n\nTherefore, I need to include both columns: 'opponent' and 'score'.\n\nSo in the relevant_cells list, each will have their respective row_index and column_name.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be TRUE because all conditions are met in row 14.
