    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"neuza silva have partner with ana catarina nogueira on 6 occasion.\" My goal is to determine whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. It seems to suggest that Neuza Silva has partnered with Ana Catarina Nogueira six times across different editions of the Fed Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific edition, round, date, partnering details, and other information about matches. The relevant columns for this claim would likely be \"edition,\" \"partnering,\" and perhaps \"opponents\" to track partnerships over time.\n\nI'll scan through each row in the table to see if there are instances where Ana Catarina Nogueira is involved as a partner alongside someone named Neuza Silva. \n\nGoing row by row:\n\n1. The first few rows mention \"Ana Catarina Nogueira\" as the partnering player, but the opposing partners are different each time (Georgia, Norway, Turkey, etc.). I need to check if any of these opponents are Neuza Silva.\n\n2. As I continue scanning, I notice that most of the partners listed under the \"partnering\" column are either \"Ana Catarina Nogueira\" or \"Frederica Piedade.\" There's no mention of someone named Neuza Silva in any of these rows.\n\n3. Since there's no row where both Ana Catarina Nogueira and Neuza Silva are partners, it seems the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n\nAdditionally, considering that the table spans from 2009 to 2010, I wonder if there might be editions before or after this range where such partnerships occurred. However, since the table only covers specific years, and there's no evidence of Neuza Silva being a partner with Ana Catarina Nogueira in any of these rows, it leans towards the claim being FALSE.\n\nI also check for any possible overlaps or interpretations, but nothing seems to support six occasions as claimed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Edition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Partnering\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"neuza silva have only play 4 match on a non - clay surface\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's about Neuza Silva playing only four matches that weren't on clay courts.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists various editions of the Fed Cup, rounds, dates, partnering players, opponents, surface type, and results. The relevant columns for the claim would likely be \"partnering\" and \"surface.\" However, the claim mentions \"neuza silva,\" so I need to check if she is listed as a player in any row.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) has \"angela cardoso\" and \"georgia\" as opponents. No Neuza Silva here.\n2. Row 1 mentions \"ana catarina nogueira\" but no Neuza Silva.\n3. Similarly, rows 2-5 don't list her either. \n4. In row 6, it's about \"ana catarina nogueira\" again.\n5. Rows 7 and 8 have different names, still not Neuza.\n6. Rows 9 and 10 mention \"frederica piedade,\" but no.\n7. Rows 11-13: No.\n8. Rows 14-17: Doesn't seem like it.\n9. Then rows 18 and 19 are about \"michelle larcher de brito\" and \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler.\" Still, no Neuza.\n\nWait, I didn't see any row where \"neuza silva\" is listed as either the player or the opponent. So maybe she isn't in the table at all. That would mean the claim is incorrect because if she hasn't played four matches on a non-clay surface, the statement can't be true.\n\nBut wait, I should check again. Perhaps she's listed under \"partnering\" column. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: partnering is \"angela cardoso\"\n- Rows 1-5: all \"ana catarina nogueira\" except row 2 which might be different.\nWait, row 2 says \"frederica piedade,\" so perhaps she's a player but not Neuza.\n\nNo, none of the rows mention \"neuza silva.\" So she's not in the table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because she hasn't played any matches that are non-clay if she didn't play at all. Alternatively, maybe she has played more than four on non-clay, but since her name isn't there, we can't confirm or deny.\n\nBut the instruction says to check each condition against the table. The claim is about her playing only four matches on a non-clay surface. Since she's not in the table, it's likely the claim is FALSE because either she hasn't played four such matches or she's not involved at all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on checking if Neuza Silva has played exactly four matches on non-clay surfaces. The table doesn't list her as a player or opponent in any row, meaning she isn't present. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any rows where \"neuza silva\" appears as a player. Scanning through each row, I don't see her name listed in the 'against' column or anywhere else. The players mentioned are like Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, etc. So, it seems Neuza Silva isn't present in this table.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that she competed on a clay surface in 8 matches. I need to check if there's any match where the surface was clay and if her name is associated with it. Looking at each row, the 'surface' column only lists either clay or hard. But since Neuza Silva isn't present as an opponent or participant, even if there are eight clay matches in total, she didn't participate in them.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true based on the table provided.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for any mentions of \"neuza silva\" in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that in the last two rows (row index 8 and 9), the partnering column has names like \"jelena kostani\u0107 to\u0161i\u0107 silvia njiri\u0107\" and \"irina - camelia begu ioana raluca olaru\", but none of these are \"neuza silva\". So, I'm not sure if she's in the table at all. Wait, maybe I missed her. Let me check again. Hmm, no, I don't see \"neuza silva\" listed as a partner in any row.\n\nNext, looking for \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\". In row index 9, the partnering column mentions \"irina - camelia begu ioana raluca olaru\", which includes \"ioana raluca olaru\". Wait, no, that's not \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\". Let me check again. Oh, in row index 8, it's \"jelena kostani\u0107 to\u0161i\u0107 silvia njiri\u0107\", and row index 9 has \"irina - camelia begu ioana raluca olaru\". So, I don't see \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" either.\n\nWait, but the claim says that \"neuza silva\" only partnered once with \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\". Since neither of these names appears in the table together, does that mean the claim is false? Because if both partners aren't present, then they never partnered, let alone just once.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" be involved without being listed as a partner? Let me check the columns again. The relevant columns are Partnering. So each row shows who she partnered with. If neither \"neuza silva\" nor \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" is in any of these cells, then they never partnered.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"neuza silva have only partner with maria jo\u00e3o koehler 1 time\" isn't supported by the table because both names are missing. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"neuza silva have only partner with maria jo\u00e3o koehler 1 time\", we need to check for occurrences of both \"neuza silva\" and \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" in the Partnering column.\n\n- **Looking for \"neuza silva\"**: This name does not appear in any row's Partnering column.\n- **Looking for \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\"**: This name also does not appear in any row's Partnering column.\n\nSince neither name is present, there is no evidence of a partnership between them.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the name \"neuza silva\" in the table. Scanning through each row, I don't see \"neuza silva\" appearing as a player in any of the 'partnering' or 'opponents' columns. The partners listed include names like Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, etc., and the opponents are various countries such as Georgia, Norway, Turkey, Kenya, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Latvia, Greece, Morocco, Croatia, Romania, etc. None of these seem to be \"neuza silva.\"\n\nNext, I'll check if there's any indication that she participated in a play-off in 2005. The term 'play off' is not explicitly mentioned in the table columns provided. However, looking at the row for 2005 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group III, I see two entries:\n\n1. For the first entry under 2005:\n   - Partner: Ana Catarina Nogueira\n   - Opponent: Kenya\n   - Surface: Clay\n   - Result: 6-0, 6-0\n\n2. The second 2005 entry is labeled as \"giii play-offs\":\n   - Partner: Ana Catarina Nogueira\n   - Opponent: Bosnia and Herzegovina\n   - Surface: Clay\n   - Result: 6-0, 6-1\n\nWait, there's a mention of 'play-off' here. The second entry for 2005 is under \"giii play-offs,\" which might indicate that she participated in a play-off round in 2005.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions \"neuza silva.\" Since her name doesn't appear anywhere in the table related to 2005, even if there was a play-off, it wouldn't be linked to her. Therefore, the claim is likely false because she didn't participate in any play-offs in 2005 as per the data given.\n\nAlso, considering that 'play off' isn't a column in the table provided, maybe the user made a mistake or is referring to an internal classification like group stages being called play-offs. But without specific mention of her name, it's impossible to confirm she was part of it.\n\nSo, putting this together, since \"neuza silva\" doesn't appear in the relevant cells, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"neuza silva have partner with ana catarina nogueira on 5 occasion\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and try to understand what it's asking. It mentions two people: neuza silva and ana catarina nogueira. The claim states that they were partners on five different occasions.\n\nI need to check the table provided to see if there are any instances where these two individuals partnered against each other or co-played in any matches. \n\nLooking through the table, I'll go row by row and look at the \"against\" column since that's where the opposing player is listed. Each row seems to represent a match or event.\n\nI start scanning each row for \"ana catarina nogueira\" as a partner. But wait, in the table, the \"partnering\" column lists who they are partnering against, so maybe I should look at the \"against\" column for ana catarina's name? No, actually, the \"against\" column is the opponent, not the partner. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the \"partnering\" column seems to list the names of the partners, not the opponents. Wait, looking back: in the table, each row has a \"partnering\" column and an \"against\" column. For example, the first row shows Angela Cardoso as the partner and Georgia as the opponent.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the columns:\n\n- edition: the year and group\n- round: seems to be either 'rr' which might indicate a round or type\n- partnering: who they are partnered with\n- against: who they played against\n\nSo in each row, \"partnering\" is their partner, and \"against\" is their opponent.\n\nWait no, in the first few rows, the \"partnering\" column lists someone like Angela Cardoso, and the \"against\" column is Georgia. So perhaps in this table, \"partnering\" refers to teammates or partners, while \"against\" is the opposing player.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"partnering\" refers to being on the same team or opponents. Wait, no, in tennis terms, you partner with someone and play against another pair. So each row represents a match where two players are partnered together, playing against another two players.\n\nSo for example, in the first row:\n\nEdition: 2000 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group II\nRound: rr\nPartnering: Angela Cardoso\nAgainst: Georgia\n\nSo they are partnering with Angela and playing against Georgia. But I'm looking to see if neuza silva and ana catarina were partners on five occasions.\n\nI need to find any rows where the \"partnering\" column lists both neuza silva and ana catarina nogueira together, meaning they were partners in a match. \n\nNow, going through each row:\n\n1. Edition 2000... Partnering: Angela Cardoso\n2. Edition 2009... Partnering: Frederica Piedade\n3. Edition 2010... Partnering: Michell Lacher de Brito and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler\n\nWait, looking at the \"partnering\" column across all rows, I don't see any mention of \"neuza silva\" or \"ana catarina nogueira\". \n\nBut wait, in some rows, there are multiple partners listed, like in 2010, it's Michell Lacher de Brito and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler. So maybe the \"partnering\" column can list more than one person?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the \"against\" column lists two players, meaning that the partnering is split. But no, each row seems to show a single partnering with one player.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if \"ana catarina nogueira\" is ever listed as a partner in any row. Let's scan:\n\nLooking through all the rows, the \"partnering\" column has names like Angela Cardoso, Frederica Piedade, Michell Lacher de Brito, Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler, etc. I don't see \"ana catarina nogueira\" there.\n\nSimilarly, checking for \"neuza silva\" in the \"partnering\" or \"against\" columns: \n\nIn the 2010 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group I rows, the partnering is Michell Lacher de Brito and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler. The against column has Croatia and Romania.\n\nLooking through all rows, there's no mention of neuza silva or ana catarina nogueira in any of the columns except perhaps \"against\". \n\nWait, checking row 4: Edition 2009... Against is Morocco and Latvia. No, that's not relevant.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps I should look for instances where \"ana catarina nogueira\" is the partner, which would mean she is playing with someone else against another team. But in this case, we are looking to see if neuza silva was her partner on five occasions.\n\nSince neither name appears in any of the \"partnering\" or \"against\" columns together, it's likely that there's no evidence supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list any instances where neuza silva and ana catarina nogueira were partners on five occasions.

Looking through each row, I don't see \"neuza silva\" listed as a partnering or opponent. The partners and opponents mentioned are names like Angela Cardoso, Georgia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, etc. So it seems like Neuza Silva isn't in the table.\n\nWait, but maybe she's not listed because she didn't play any matches in this dataset?

So, I need to look for any rows where Neuza Silva is involved as a partner and check how many times she partners specifically with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a different match or event. The columns relevant here are \"partnering\" and \"against\". The \"partnering\" column lists the names of players, and \"against\" lists their opponents.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **2002 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group I**: Partner is Angela Cardoso against Georgia.\n2. **2003 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group II** (two entries): Partners are Ana Catarina Nogueira vs Norway and Frederica Piedade vs Turkey.\n3. **2005 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group III** (two entries): Both involve Ana Catarina Nogueira as partner against Kenya and Bosnia & Herzegovina.\n4. **2006 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group II** (three entries): All have Ana Catarina Nogueira as partner against Poland, Latvia, Greece.\n5. **2009 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group II** (two entries): Partners are Frederica Piedade vs Morocco and Latvia.\n6. **2010 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group I** (two entries): Partners are Michelle Lacher de Brito vs Croatia and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler vs Romania.\n\nNow, focusing on rows where Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler is the partner in \"partnering\" and seeing who she's against:\n\n- In 2010, there's a row where Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler partners with someone (against Croatia). Wait, actually, looking at the table:\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The column named \"partnering\" lists who is partnered with whom. So in the 2010 rows, one has \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" as the partner against Croatia, and another row has her as the partner against Romania? Or wait, looking at the table:\n\nIn 2010, there are two rows:\n- One where \"partnering\" is \"michelle larcher de brito\" against Croatia.\n- Another where \"partnering\" is \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" against Romania.\n\nSo Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler partners with someone (against Romania), and in another row, she's the partner against Croatia.\n\nWait, no. The 2010 rows are:\n\n1. **2010 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group I**: Partnering is \"michelle larcher de brito\" vs Croatia.\n2. Another row for same group: Partnering is \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" vs Romania.\n\nSo Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler partners with someone, and her opponent is Romania. So in this case, it's Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler as the partner, not being partnered by someone else.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the column names: The columns are \"partnering\" (player) and \"against\" (opponent). So if a row shows \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" in \"partnering\", that means she is partnering with someone against an opponent. For example, in 2010, one row has \"michelle larcher de brito\" as the partner against Croatia, and another row has \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" as the partner against Romania.\n\nSo Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler is partnered once, against Romania, but also, looking at other rows, she might be an opponent. Wait, no, in 2010, only two rows: one with her as partner, another where someone else (michelle larcher de brito) is partnered against Croatia.\n\nNow, the claim says \"neuza silva have only partner with maria jo\u00e3o koehler 2 time\". So I need to check if Neuza Silva has only partnered twice with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nI don't see any row where \"neuza silva\" is in the \"partnering\" column. The closest is checking if she's an opponent, but the claim is about her being a partner. So from the table, there are no rows where Neuza Silva is partnered with anyone.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that Neuza Silva has only partnered twice with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler, it's incorrect because according to the table, she hasn't partnered anyone. Thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Neuza Silva has only partnered with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler twice, but upon reviewing the table, there are no instances where Neuza Silva is listed as a partner in any row. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2010, \"column_name\": \"Partnering\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2010, \"column_name\": \"Against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"neuza silva have reach play offs 2 time in 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the name mentioned is \"neuza silva.\" Looking at the table, I should check if any rows list her as a partner or opponent in the relevant years. The table has several rows, and each row includes a player's name under the \"partnering\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if \"neuza silva\" appears anywhere. Scanning through all the entries, I notice that most of them have names like \"ana catarina nogueira,\" \"frederica piedade,\" and others, but none mention \"neuza silva.\" That makes me think she might not be present in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I should check more carefully. Let's look at each row again:\n\n- The first few rows have players like Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, etc.\n- In 2005, there are two rows for group iii and one for play-offs. Neither mentions \"neuza silva.\"\n- Similarly, other years don't list her either.\n\nSince the claim is about \"reach play offs\" in 2005 happening twice, I need to see if she was involved in any play-offs that year. But from the table, I don't see any entry where she's a player or partner during 2005 play-offs. The players listed are different names each time.\n\nAlso, the term \"reach play offs\" suggests she participated in play-offs on two occasions in 2005. However, without her name appearing in the table for that year, it seems the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the claim is not fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
