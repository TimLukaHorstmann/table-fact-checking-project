    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to verify if the claim \"Ben Frank has 30 cap for the Hawke's Bay Hurricane\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts: \"Ben Frank,\" \"has 30 cap,\" and \"for the Hawke's Bay Hurricane.\" So, Ben Frank is a person, he has 30 caps, and these caps are for the Hawke's Bay Hurricanes team.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's an entry for someone named Ben Frank who plays for Hawke's Bay Hurricanes and has 30 caps. Alternatively, since the team might be referred to as \"Hawke's Bay Hurricane\" without the 's', I should check both possibilities.\n\nI'll start by searching the table for any row where the player's name is \"Ben Frank.\" Let me go through each row one by one. \n\nGoing down the rows:\n- Row 0: Ryan Crotty\n- Row 1: Ma'a Nonu\n- Row 2: Francis Saili\n- Row 3: Frank Halai\n- Row 4: Cory Jane\n- Row 5: Julian Savea\n- Row 6: Ben Smith\n- Row 7: Israel Dagg\n- Row 8: Charles Piutau\n\nI don't see \"Ben Frank\" here. Wait, maybe I should look further down the table. Let me check the lower part.\n\nRows continuing:\n- Row 9: Tom Taylor\n- Rows 10 and onwards are for other players like Dan Carter, Aaron Cruden, etc., but none of these names include \"Ben Frank.\"\n\nHmm, so maybe Ben Frank isn't listed in the table at all. If that's the case, then he doesn't have any caps mentioned here. The claim says he has 30 caps, which would mean there should be a row with his name and cap count as 30.\n\nSince I don't find \"Ben Frank\" in the table, it's likely that the information isn't provided, so the claim can't be fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Caps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
