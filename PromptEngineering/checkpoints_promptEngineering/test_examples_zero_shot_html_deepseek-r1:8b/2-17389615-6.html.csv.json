Each row represents a different team with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"goebel soccer complex\" as the most used venue. So, I need to check how many times this venue appears in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'venue' column:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants - Bosse Field\n2. Evansville Vipers - Goebel Soccer Complex\n3. Evansville Bluecats - Roberts Municipal Stadium\n4. Evansville Express - Goebel Soccer Complex\n5. Tri-State Titans - Goebel Soccer Complex\n6. Ohio River Bearcats - Reitz Bowl\n\nNow, count the number of times \"goebel soccer complex\" appears. It's in rows 2, 4, and 5. So that's three times.\n\nI need to see if any other venue is used more frequently. Bosse Field, Roberts Municipal Stadium, Reitz Bowl each appear once. Goebel Soccer Complex has the highest count at three venues.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is TRUE because \"goebel soccer complex\" is indeed the most frequently used venue in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check how often \"goebel soccer complex\" appears as a venue compared to other venues.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the event at the reitz bowl take place after the event at bosse field\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: team, sport, played, venue, and championships. The rows represent different teams from Evansville and their respective events. The key parts of the claim are \"reitz bowl\" and \"bosse field,\" which are venues where events take place.\n\nThe claim is about the order in which these two specific venues hosted events. It says that the event at the reitz bowl happened after the one at bosse field. So, I need to check if any team played at bosse field before any team played at the reitz bowl.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that bosse field is listed as a venue for the Evansville Crimson Giants in 1921-1922 and the Evansville Express in 2004-2005. On the other hand, the reitz bowl is mentioned only once, associated with the Ohio River Bearcats from 2008 to 2010.\n\nI need to find if there's a team that played at bosse field whose event occurred before any team that played at reitz bowl. From the table:\n\n- The Crimson Giants played at bosse field in 1921-1922.\n- The Express also used bosse field in 2004-2005, but they played earlier than the Bearcats' 2008-2010 season.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the reitz bowl taking place after bosse field. So if any event at reitz bowl happened after an event at bosse field, then it's TRUE.\n\nIn the table, the Ohio River Bearcats played at reitz bowl from 2008-2010. The last event at bosse field was in 2005 for the Express. Since 2005 is before 2008, that means the event at reitz bowl took place after the event at bosse field.\n\nSo, the claim should be TRUE because there's a team (Ohio River Bearcats) that played at reitz bowl after a team (Evansville Express) played at bosse field in a later year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Ohio River Bearcats' event at the Reitz Bowl in 2008-2010 occurred after the Evansville Express's event at Bosse Field in 2004-2005.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the tri - state titans be not the team who win the gmfl title 2008.\" Hmm, first, I should check how the name is spelled in the table because there's a possible typo in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, under the 'team' column, I see \"tri - state titans\" with a hyphen. The claim uses \"Tri - State Titan\" without the 's' after 'state.' Wait, actually, let me check again. In the table, it's written as \"tri - state titans,\" but in the claim, it's \"Tri - State Titan.\" So there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nNext, I need to find if any team won the GMFL title in 2008. Scanning through the 'championships' column, I see that the Ohio River Bearcats have \"gmfl title 2008\" listed. That's under the row for the Ohio River Bearcats, which plays football and was active from 2008 to 2010.\n\nSo the claim says that the Tri-State Titans did not win the GMFL title in 2008. But according to the table, it's actually the Ohio River Bearcats who won it. Therefore, the claim is false because the Tri-State Titans didn't win that particular championship.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where \"tri - state titans\" and \"gmfl title 2008\" appear.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"4 of the team have the name evansville in their team name.\" So, we're looking for teams where \"evansville\" appears in their names. The task is to check if exactly four teams meet this criterion.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team with various details like sport, played years, venue, and championships. My focus here is on the 'team' column to see which names include \"evansville.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Team name is \"evansville crimson giants.\" Clearly, \"evansville\" is part of the name.\n2. **Row 1**: \"evansville vipers\" \u2013 same here, starts with \"evansville.\"\n3. **Row 2**: \"evansville bluecats\" \u2013 again, \"evansville\" is at the beginning.\n4. **Row 3**: \"evansville express\" \u2013 same pattern as before.\n5. **Row 4**: \"tri - state titans\" \u2013 This doesn't have \"evansville.\" The name is \"tri-state titans,\" so no match here.\n6. **Row 5**: \"ohio river bearcats\" \u2013 This also lacks \"evansville.\"\n\nSo, out of the six teams listed, four of them (rows 0-3) include \"evansville\" in their names. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The claim is about the team names, so the 'team' column is crucial. Each row where the team name contains \"evansville\" is relevant. Therefore, rows 0 through 4 (since row 5 doesn't qualify) are the ones to consider. Wait, actually, only rows 0-3 have \"evansville,\" and row 4 does not. So the relevant cells would be the 'team' column for those four teams.\n\nWait, no, in my initial count, I saw that rows 0 through 3 have \"evansville\" in their names, which is four teams. So rows 0-3 correspond to four teams with \"evansville.\" Therefore, each of these four team entries in the 'team' column is relevant.\n\nI should list each relevant cell by row index and the column name. Since the claim is about the number (four) of such teams, I need to identify which rows meet this condition. So, rows 0,1,2,3 are the ones where \"evansville\" is present in the team name.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the 'team' entries from row 0 to row 3.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we check how many teams have \"evansville\" in their names. From the table, four such teams exist: evansville crimson giants, evansville vipers, evansville bluecats, and evansville express.\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the 'team' column for these four rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It seems like it's stating that Bosse Field is the most used venue in the context of the data provided in the table. My task is to verify if this claim holds true by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents a different team, along with details like the sport played, years they were active (played), their venue, and the number of championships they've won. The columns are: team, sport, played, venue, and championships.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the venue being Bosse Field. So I need to find all the rows where the venue column mentions Bosse Field. That way, I can count how many times it's used and compare it to other venues.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has the venue as \"bosse field\" (all lowercase). Since the claim refers to \"Bosse Field,\" which might be a proper noun, but in the table, it's written differently. I should check if the capitalization matters here. Typically, venues are Proper Nouns, so \"Bosse Field\" would have the first letter capitalized. The table entry is all lowercase, which might be an error or just how it's stored. For now, I'll note that it's Bosse Field regardless of case.\n\n2. The second row has \"goebel soccer complex\" as the venue.\n3. The third row has \"roberts municipal stadium.\"\n4. The fourth row again mentions \"goebel soccer complex.\"\n5. The fifth row is also at \"goebel soccer complex.\"\n6. The sixth row lists \"reitz bowl.\"\n\nSo, only the first row refers to Bosse Field as the venue.\n\nNext, I need to check if any other venues are used more frequently than Bosse Field. From the table, let's count how many times each venue appears:\n\n- Bosse Field: 1 time\n- Goebel Soccer Complex: 3 times (rows 2,4,5)\n- Reitz Bowl: 1 time\n- Roberts Municipal Stadium: 1 time\n\nSo, Goebel Soccer Complex is used three times, which is more than Bosse Field's single occurrence. Therefore, Bosse Field isn't the most used venue.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that I'm considering all possible venues. From the table, the only ones mentioned are Bosse Field, Goebel Soccer Complex, Reitz Bowl, and Roberts Municipal Stadium. Since Goebel Soccer Complex is used more times than Bosse Field, the claim that Bosse Field is the most used is false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any rows have other venues not listed here, but from the table provided, these are all the possibilities. So, based on this analysis, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Bosse Field is the most frequently used venue in the table.

I need to check if there's a row in the table that matches both of these.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the following columns: team, sport, played, venue, championships. \n\nI'll start by searching for \"evansville viper.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n1. evansville crimson giants - no\n2. evansville vipers - yes, this is the second row.\n3. evansville bluecats - no\n4. evansville express - no\n5. tri-state titans - no\n6. ohio river bearcats - no\n\nSo, the second row corresponds to \"evansville vipers.\" Now, I need to check if they won a championship at \"goebel soccer complex.\"\n\nLooking at the \"venue\" column for the evansville vipers: it's \"goebel soccer complex.\" So that matches. However, I should also check the \"championships\" column to see if they actually won any championships there.\n\nIn the row for evansville vipers, the \"championships\" column has \"none.\" That means they didn't win any championships during their active years (2000-2007). Therefore, even though they played at goebel soccer complex, they didn't win a championship there.\n\nSo, the claim that they won the championship at goebel soccer complex isn't accurate because the table shows no championships for evansville vipers. \n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"none\" in the championships column always means they didn't win any, or if it's possible that maybe they did, but it's not recorded here. Given the data provided, there's no indication of a championship win, so it's safe to assume that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the evansville vipers played at goebel soccer complex without winning any championships.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
