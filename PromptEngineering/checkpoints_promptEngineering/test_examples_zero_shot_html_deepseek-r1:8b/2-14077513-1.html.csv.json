    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read the claim again: \"there be 0 drawn for 7 game with 4 loss , 19 - 19 point differential and 6 point.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions several conditions:\n\n1. 0 drawn games\n2. 7 games in total\n3. 4 losses\n4. A points difference of 19 - 19 (which is 0)\n5. 6 points\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's a row that matches all these conditions.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: drawn=1, games=7, lost=0, points=13\n- Row 1: drawn=4, games=7, lost=0, points=10\n- Row 2: drawn=1, games=7, lost=2, points=9\n- Row 3: drawn=2, games=7, lost=2, points=8\n- Row 4: drawn=1, games=7, lost=3, points=7\n- Row 5: drawn=0, games=7, lost=4, points=6\n- Row 6: drawn=0, games=7, lost=6, points=2\n- Row 7: drawn=1, games=7, lost=6, points=1\n\nI need to find a row where drawn is 0. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 5 has drawn=0, games=7, lost=4, points=6.\n\nNow check if it meets all the claim's conditions:\n\n- Drawn: 0 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Games: 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Losses: 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Points difference: 19 - 19? Wait, in the table, the points difference is given as \"19 - 19\" for row 5. So yes, that's 0. \u2714\ufe0f\n- Points: 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo all conditions are met by row 5 (index 5). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other rows or if I missed something. No, row 5 is the only one with drawn=0. So yes, it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each condition against the table:\n\n- **Drawn:** Found in `drawn` column. Row 5 has 0 drawn.\n- **Games:** Found in `games` column. All rows have 7 games.\n- **Losses:** Found in `lost` column. Row 5 has 4 losses.\n- **Points Difference:** Calculated as goals difference. For row 5, it's 19 - 19 = 0.\n- **Points:** Found in `points` column. Row 5 has 6 points.\n\nSince all conditions are met by row 5, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
