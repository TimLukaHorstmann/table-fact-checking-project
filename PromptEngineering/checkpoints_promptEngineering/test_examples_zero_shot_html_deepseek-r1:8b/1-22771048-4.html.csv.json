Let me break down what I need to do step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that corresponds to \"overlake village\". Scanning through the table, I see a few entries: overlake transit center, overlake village, and se redmond. The one we're interested in is \"overlake village.\"\n\nNow, focusing on that row, which columns are relevant? The claim mentions \"park and ride project propose,\" so I should check the columns related to park and ride. In the table, there's a column called \"park and ride.\" So, looking at the \"park and ride\" column for overlake village.\n\nFrom the table, the \"park and ride\" cell under \"overlake village\" is marked as \"yes.\" That means there is indeed a park and ride project proposed for overlake village. \n\nAdditionally, I should check if the number of projects mentioned in the claim matches. The claim says \"1 park and ride project propose,\" but the table doesn't specify how many are proposed; it just indicates whether one exists. Since the cell is \"yes,\" that supports the claim without needing to count multiple projects.\n\nSo, all conditions in the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts: Bellevue has a proposed station located at a hospital. So, I'm looking for any mention of Bellevue with a station and specifically at a hospital.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various stations, their extensions, cities/neighborhoods, projected opening dates, whether they are park and ride, and if funded by ST2.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries related to Bellevue. Scanning the 'city / neighborhood' column, I notice several rows mention Bellevue:\n\n1. Row 17: \"south bellevue\" under city/neighborhood.\n2. Row 19: \"downtown bellevue\"\n3. Row 20: \"bellevue\"\n4. Row 21: \"bellevue\"\n5. Row 22: \"bellevue\"\n6. Row 23: \"bellevue\"\n\nEach of these is under the 'city / neighborhood' column, which corresponds to the location of each station.\n\nNow, looking at the columns relevant for the claim: 'column_name' should be 'city / neighborhood', and we're searching for rows where this cell mentions \"hospital\".\n\nI check each relevant row:\n\n- Row 20: City/neighborhood is Bellevue. No mention of a hospital here.\n- Row 21: City/neighborhood is Bellevue, again no hospital mentioned.\n- Row 22: City/neighborhood is Bellevue; no hospital.\n- Row 23: City/neighborhood is Bellevue; no hospital.\n\nNone of these rows specify a hospital as the location. The claim mentions \"at a hospital,\" so I need to see if any station in Bellevue is proposed at a hospital. However, none of the listed stations under Bellevue are at a hospital. Instead, they're at locations like downtown Bellevue, overlake, etc.\n\nAdditionally, looking for 'hospital' as part of the city/neighborhood column, only rows 20-23 mention Bellevue but not hospitals.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table supporting the claim that Bellevue has a station proposed at a hospital.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the station in question is \"redondo / star lake\". I'll look for this exact name in the 'station' column of the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that the 9th row has \"redondo / star lake\" as the station name. That's row index 8 if we start counting from 0.\n\nNext, the claim mentions being \"funded by st2\". Looking at the table, there's a column called \"funded by st2\". So I need to check what value is in this column for the redondo / star lake station. In row 8, under \"funded by st2\", it says \"yes\".\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, the columns are: station, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, funded by st2. So yes, for \"redondo / star lake\", the value in \"funded by st2\" is \"yes\". That means the claim's second part is supported.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The station exists in the table as redondo / star lake, and it's funded by st2 according to the relevant column.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which parts of the claim need to be checked in the table. The claim mentions \"park and ride\" and specifically refers to \"overlake village.\" So, I'm looking for cells related to these two aspects.\n\nLooking at the table headers, the relevant columns are \"park and ride\" and possibly any that mention \"overlake village.\" Let me scan each row to find where \"overlake village\" is mentioned in the \"city / neighborhood\" column. \n\nI start from the top of the tbody:\n\n1. Boeing Access Road \u2013 Not related.\n2. Jackson Park \u2013 Shoring, not our focus.\n3. Shoreline \u2013 No.\n4. Mountlake Terrace \u2013 No.\n5. Lynnwood \u2013 No.\n6. Alderwood \u2013 No.\n7. 164th / Ash Way \u2013 No.\n8. Everett Station \u2013 No.\n9. Highline Community College \u2013 Des Moines, no.\n10. South Bellevue \u2013 No.\n11. East Main \u2013 No.\n12.

This row mentions \"overlake village\" in the city/neighborhood column.\n17. Overlake Transit Center \u2013 Also mentions overlake village.\n\nNow, I check the \"park and ride\" column for these rows. \n\nFor row 16 (Overlake Village), the \"park and ride\" cell is \"yes.\" \nFor row 17 (Overlake Transit Center), it's also \"yes.\"\n\nSo, the claim says that \"1 park and ride haven't been proposed,\" but according to the table, there are indeed parks and rides proposed for Overlake Village. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"1 park and ride haven't been propose.\" Is it possible that the user meant only one hasn't been proposed? Looking at the data, both Overlake Village and Overlake Transit Center have \"yes\" for park and rides. So, there are multiple parks and rides proposed, contradicting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the data shows that park and rides have been proposed for Overlake Village.\n</think>\n\nThe table indicates that \"park and ride\" is present for both \"overlake village\" and \"overlake transit center,\" which contradicts the claim that none were proposed. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

It seems to suggest that there's at least one neighborhood where a proposed station isn't located at a hospital. Alternatively, it might mean that no station was proposed for one specific hospital in a neighborhood. \n\nLooking at the table columns, the relevant ones are \"station,\" \"city / neighborhood,\" and \"park and ride.\" The claim mentions hospitals, so I need to focus on entries where the station name includes \"hospital\" or where the city/neighborhood is associated with a hospital.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Hospital Station**: There's a row for \"hospital\" with the station name \"east link\" and city \"bellevue.\" The \"park and ride\" column says \"yes,\" but I need to check if this relates to a hospital. It seems like it's a transit station, not necessarily a hospital-adjacent one.\n\n2. **130th Station**: This is under \"east link,\" with the city as \"bellevue.\" No mention of a hospital here either.\n\n3. **Overlake Stations**: These are in \"overlake\" neighborhood. The stations are transit centers but not directly linked to hospitals in their names or descriptions.\n\nNone of the rows explicitly state that a station is proposed at a hospital. Instead, they all seem to be regular transit stations or community centers, like the Bellevue Transit Center or Overlake Transit Center, which aren't hospitals. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. The \"hospital\" row is labeled as a station under \"east link,\" but it's not clear if that's specifically near a hospital or just another location. There's no direct indication that any proposed station in the table is at a hospital.\n\nTherefore, the claim suggests that one neighborhood lacks a proposed station at its hospital. From the table, I don't see any entries where a station is proposed at a hospital.
