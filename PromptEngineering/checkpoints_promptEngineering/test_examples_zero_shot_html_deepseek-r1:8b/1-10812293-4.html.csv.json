    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"On December 23, T.J. Ford was the highest scorer with 24 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant information in the table. The date mentioned is December 23, and the player is T.J. Ford. So I need to find the row corresponding to December 23. Looking through the rows, I see that row number 28 is for December 23.\n\nNext, I'll check what column corresponds to the points scored. The columns are \"Points\" since it's about scoring. In row 28, under the \"Points\" column, it shows T.J. Ford scored 24 points. \n\nNow, I need to ensure that no other player scored higher than 24 on that day. Looking at the same row, the next highest score is from Jorge Garbajosa and Radoslav Nesterovi\u0107, both with 7 points. So yes, T.J. Ford was indeed the highest scorer.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "for game on december 20 , the high point get more than 25",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is about a specific game on December 20th where the high point (I assume this refers to the player with the highest points) scored more than 25. My task is to verify this based on the provided table and then return whether the statement is true or false along with the relevant cells checked.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the row corresponding to December 20th. Looking at the table, each row has a game number and the date. Scanning through, I find that game number 26 is on December 20th against LA Clippers.\n\nNext, within this row, I should identify which column contains the points scored by the high point player. The columns relevant to this are \"high_point\" or similar, but looking at the table headers, it seems the relevant column is labeled as \"high_point\" (though in the example provided, it's referred to as \"Revenue\", so maybe the actual header might be something else). Wait, upon reviewing the table again, I realize that each row ends with a points value. The columns vary, but for this purpose, I need to find which specific cell holds the high point for December 20th.\n\nLooking at game 26 on December 20th, the \"high_point\" column (or whatever it's named) should have the player's name who scored the most that game. In this case, Fred Jones scored 23 points. However, the claim is that the high point got more than 25, which would mean 23 does not exceed 25. Therefore, this suggests the statement is false.\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure I'm looking at the correct columns. The table has multiple columns: game number, date, opponent, result (win/loss), and then various player statistics like high point, rebounds, etc. The exact column for points might be labeled differently, but in this context, it's essential to find where the highest scorer's points are listed.\n\nIn the given data, each row includes a \"high_point\" value, which is the player with the most points that game. For game 26, Fred Jones had 23 points, as per the \"high_point\" column. Since 23 is less than 25, the claim that the high point was more than 25 is false.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify the relevant cells: row index for December 20th is 26 (assuming rows start at 0 or 1). Looking back, game numbers go from 1 to 30. Game 26 is on December 20th, so its row index is likely 25 if starting from 0, but I need to confirm the actual indices. Alternatively, each row can be identified by the \"game\" number, which in this case is 26.\n\nThe relevant column would be the one that holds the high point for that game, probably labeled as \"high_point\" or something similar. So, in the JSON response, I should list the cells that correspond to row 26 and column \"high_point\".\n\nPutting it all together, since Fred Jones scored 23 points, which is less than 25, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"high_point\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
