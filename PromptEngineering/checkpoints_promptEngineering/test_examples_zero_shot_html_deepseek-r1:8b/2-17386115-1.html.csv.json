    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"ken irvin,\" so I'm looking for that name in the table. It also mentions \"be drag,\" which might refer to a specific action or role. Finally, it talks about the fourth round, which is a column in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: there's a column for 'round,' 'pick,' 'player,' 'position,' and 'school/club team.' Each row represents a different draft pick, with details for each player selected.\n\nNow, I'll scan through the rows to find any mention of Ken Irvin. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Player is Ruben Brown.\n2. Row 1: Todd Collins.\n3. Row 2: Marlon Kerner.\n4. Row 3: Damien Covington.\n5. Row 4: Ken Irvin \u2013 found him here.\n\nSo, Ken Irvin is in row 4 (but since rows start at 0, the index would be 4). Now, checking his details: round 4, position 'defensive back,' school 'memphis.'\n\nThe claim says \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round.\" I think \"be drag\" might refer to a specific role or action, but looking at the table, there's no mention of any action like 'drag' in his position. His position is listed as 'defensive back.'\n\nWait, maybe \"be drag\" was intended to mean he was selected in the fourth round. So, checking the 'round' column: yes, round 4. So the claim could be saying Ken Irvin was picked in the fourth round.\n\nTherefore, I need to check if the relevant cells are present that support this. The player's name is in row 4, which would correspond to a row index of 4 (since rows start at 0). The column for 'round' is where his selection round is listed.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are: row 4, column 'round' because it shows he was picked in the fourth round. There's no cell indicating any action like 'drag,' but perhaps that part of the claim doesn't need to be matched directly from the table. It might just be a way to say he was selected in that round.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 4 for 'round' column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round,\" I checked the HTML table for Ken Irvin's details. He is indeed listed in row 4 (index 4) under the 'round' column as round 4 and his position as defensive back. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1st round , ken irvin be draft\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"1st round,\" which refers to the first selection in the draft process. The player in question is \"ken irvin.\" I need to check if Ken Irvin was selected in the first round as per the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different pick number. The columns relevant here are \"round\" and \"player\". My task is to find out which rows correspond to the 1st round (which would be round 1) and see if any of those entries have Ken Irvin as the player.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n- Row 0: Round 1, Pick 14, Player Ruben Brown. Not Ken Irvin.\n- Rows 1 to 6: These are rounds 2 to 6. None of these players are Ken Irvin either.\n- Then I see rows 3 and 4: Wait, no, looking again, the first round is round 1 (row 0). Row 3 is round 3, row 4 is also round 4, so I need to check for any entries where round is 1.\n\nWait, but in the table, the rounds start from 1. So let me look specifically at round 1. In row 0, the player is Ruben Brown, not Ken Irvin. So there's no entry for Ken Irvin in round 1.\n\nThe claim says that in the first round, Ken Irvin was drafted. But according to the table, Ken Irvin is listed under round 4, pick 109 and others. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Ken Irvin wasn't selected in the first round.\n\nSo I need to check which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for this check would be \"round\" and \"player.\" Specifically, I need to find all rows where round=1 and player=\"ken irvin\". But since there's no such row, only Ruben Brown is in round 1.\n\nThus, the claim is false, and the relevant cells are the ones in row 0 for round and player.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 4th round player from michigan select\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It seems to be stating that a player selected in the 4th round came from Michigan. So I need to look for players picked in the 4th round and see if any of them are from Michigan.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a pick with details like round, pick number, player name, position, and school/club team. I'll go through each row related to the 4th round.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 1: Round 1, so not relevant.\n- Rows 2-3: Rounds 2 and 3, also not relevant.\n- Now, looking for Round 4. Scanning through:\n  - The first entry with Round 4 is row 4 (since it's a table with multiple rows, I'll assume the index starts at 0 or 1; but in the example provided, they start from 0, so let me check that). Wait, in the example, the relevant cells are listed as {\"row_index\":0,...}, which suggests row indices start at 0. So the first round is row 0, second row1, etc.\n\nWait, no, the table has rows numbered starting from 1 to 8, but in the JSON example, they used 0-based indexing. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again: The table's tbody has multiple tr elements. Each tr represents a round from 1 to 7 (I think). So for Round 4, we have rows with row indices starting at 0? Or are the rows in order from 1 onwards?\n\nWait, looking at the HTML structure:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr> ... </tr> (first pick is round 1)\n<tr> ... </tr> (second pick is round2)\n...\nSo each tr corresponds to a round number. So for Round4, we have multiple trs.\n\nLooking back, the claim is about the 4th round. So I need to find all players picked in Round4 and check their schools.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nRound4 starts with row index 3 (since first three rounds are 1,2,3). Let me confirm: rows are ordered as per the HTML code. So the first tr is round1, second round2, third round3, fourth round4, and so on.\n\nSo in the table, the first tr is round1, then round2, etc. So for Round4, we have three trs:\n\n- The 4th tr (row index 3) has pick 109, player Ken Irvin from Memphis.\n- The next tr after that (index4) is pick113, Justin Armour from Stanford.\n- Then tr5 (index5) is Tony Cline from Stanford.\n\nSo all these players are in Round4. Now, check if any of them are from Michigan.\n\nKen Irvin is from Memphis, so not Michigan. Justin Armour and Tony Cline are both from Stanford, again not Michigan. So none of the 4th round picks in the table are from Michigan.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"in 4th round player from michigan select\" is FALSE because there's no such player from Michigan selected in the 4th round according to this table.\n\nI should list the relevant cells: all players in Round4. That would be row indices 3,4,5 (assuming rows are 0-based starting at tr1 as index0). So their columns are 'player', so column_name is \"player\".\n\nWait, but the instruction says to include each cell's \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". Each relevant cell should refer to a cell in the table that supports or contradicts the claim. Since the claim refers to a player from Michigan selected in Round4, I need to check if any such cells exist.\n\nSo, looking for cells where:\n\n- round is 4 (so row_index is 3, since first tr is index0 as round1)\n- school/club team is \"michigan\"\n\nBut none of the Round4 players are from Michigan. So no cell in the table supports this claim. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and all relevant cells are those that show the Round4 picks (player column), so their row indices would be 3,4,5,6? Wait, let me check how many trs are under round4.\n\nLooking at the HTML:\n\nAfter Round3 (index2), we have:\n\n- index3: pick109, Ken Irvin, Memphis\n- index4: pick113, Justin Armour, Stanford\n- index5: pick131, Tony Cline, Stanford\n\nThen comes Round5 starting at index6. So for Round4, the relevant rows are indices3,4,5.\n\nEach of these has column 'player' as \"ken irvin\", \"justin armour\", and \"tony cline\".\n\nSo in the JSON response, I should list all three cells that are relevant, each with their row index (starting at 0) and column name.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if there's a player selected in the 4th round from Michigan. \n\nLooking through the table:\n- Round4 players are Ken Irvin (Memphis), Justin Armour (Stanford), and Tony Cline (Stanford).\n- None of these players are from Michigan.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"explanation\": \"No player selected in the 4th round is from Michigan.\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
