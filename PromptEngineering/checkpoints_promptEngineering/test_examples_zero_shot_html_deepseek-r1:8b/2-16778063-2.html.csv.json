    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. The claim states: \"on week 12 the attendance be 64217.\"\n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant row in the table. Since it's week 12, I look for a row where the 'week' column has the value 12. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Week 1\n- Week 2\n- Week 3\n- Week 4\n- Week 5\n- Week 6\n- Week 7\n- Week 9\n- Week 10\n- Week 11\n- Week 12\n\nYes, week 12 is the relevant row. Now, I'll check the 'attendance' column for that specific week. The attendance listed for week 12 is \"57161.\"\n\nThe claim says the attendance was 64,217 on week 12. Comparing this number to what's in the table: 57,161 does not equal 64,217. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate.\n\nSo, I need to map which cells are relevant. The row index for week 12 is 11 (since it's zero-indexed), and the column is 'attendance'. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the attendance number in the table doesn't match the claimed value.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"week 12 be on december 2 , 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the HTML table provided. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim in question is about week 12 occurring on December 2, 2001. So, my task is to check if there's a row in the table where \"week\" is 12 and the \"date\" matches December 2, 2001.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to locate the one that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: week 1, September 9, 2001\n- Row 2: week 2, September 23, 2001\n- Row 3: week 3, September 30, 2001\n- Row 4: week 4, October 7, 2001\n- Row 5: week 5, October 14, 2001\n- Row 6: week 6, October 21, 2001\n- Row 7: week 7, October 28, 2001\n- Row 9: week 9, November 11, 2001\n- Row 10: week 10, November 18, 2001\n- Row 11: week 11, November 25, 2001\n- Row 12: week 12, December 2, 2001\n- Row 13: week 13, December 9, 2001\n- Row 14: week 14, December 16, 2001\n- Row 15: week 15, December 23, 2001\n- Row 16: week 16, December 30, 2001\n- Row 17: week 17, January 6, 2002\n\nFrom this list, I can see that row 12 corresponds to week 12 with the date December 2, 2001. This matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there's a direct match in the table, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the ones for week 12 and date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 12 of the table, which matches the specified week and date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the opponent be at cleveland brown on week 14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. The key points are:\n1. Week 14: There's a specific week mentioned, so I need to look for that in the table.\n2. Opponent is Cleveland Brown: This means I'm searching for the team played against on week 14.\n3. The result of that game: It doesn't specify if it's a win or loss, just that the opponent was Cleveland Brown.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, starting from week 1 to week 17 in 2001-2002.\n\nI need to find the row where the week is 14. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 0: Week 1\nRow 1: Week 2\nRow 2: Week 3\n...\nContinuing this way, I'll go all the way up to Week 17.\n\nWait, but doing it manually might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can note that week numbers are sequential. So, after Week 13 comes Week 14, and then Week 15, etc. Looking at the table, row 13 is labeled as week 14? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the HTML table:\n\n- The first <tr> after <thead> is for week 1 (row 0), then week 2 (row 1), up to week 17 which is row 16. So, each row corresponds directly to the week number.\n\nWait no, actually, the rows are listed as:\nRow 0: week 1\nRow 1: week 2\n...\nSo, row index n corresponds to week n+1. Therefore, week 14 would be at row index 13.\n\nYes, that makes sense because the first row (index 0) is week 1, so adding 1 gives us week 14 at row 13.\n\nNow, looking at row 13, which is week 14:\n\n- Week: 14\n- Date: December 16, 2001\n- Opponent: new york jets\n- Result: l 15 - 14\n- Attendance: 77745\n\nWait, the opponent here is \"new york jets\", not Cleveland Brown. That means in week 14, the opposing team was the New York Jets.\n\nSo, the claim says that the opponent was at Cleveland Brown on week 14. But according to the table, it's the New York Jets who were the opponents in week 14. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Maybe I made a mistake with the row numbering. Let me count:\n\nStarting from week 1 (row 0) up to week 17 (row 16):\n\nWeek | Row Index\n--- | ---\n1 | 0\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 4\n6 | 5\n7 | 6\n8 | 7\n9 | 8\n10 | 9\n11 | 10\n12 | 11\n13 | 12\n14 | 13\n15 | 14\n16 | 15\n17 | 16\n\nYes, that's correct. Week 14 is row index 13. So, opponent is New York Jets, not Cleveland Brown.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the opponent in week 14 was not Cleveland Brown but the New York Jets.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]}",
