    "claim": "during the johnson v moraga event there be 2.4 million viewer",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"during the johnson v moraga event there be 2.4 million viewer.\" So they're talking about a specific event between Johnson and Moraga. My task is to check if the number of viewers for this event is exactly 2.4 million according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. Each row represents a different event with corresponding details.\n\nI need to find the row where the event is \"johnson vs moraga\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos - November 12, 2011\n2. evans vs davis - January 28, 2012\n3. diaz vs miller - May 5, 2012\n4. shogun vs vera - August 4, 2012\n5. henderson vs diaz - December 8, 2012\n6. johnson vs dodson - January 26, 2013\n7. henderson vs melendez - April 20, 2013\n8. johnson vs moraga - July 27, 2013\n\nThe eighth row is the one we're interested in because it's \"johnson vs moraga\". Now, let's look at the viewers column for this event. The number listed is 2.4 million.\n\nComparing that to the claim which also states 2.4 million viewers, they match exactly. So the claim is correct.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this claim. Each cell is identified by its row index and column name. The row in question is the eighth one (since it's zero-indexed as 7), but wait, actually, looking at the rows:\n\nWait, the first data row is for \"velasquez vs dos santos\" which would be row_index 1? No, because in JSON, arrays are zero-indexed. Let me count again.\n\nThe table has a header row (row 0) and then each subsequent row starts from 1. So the rows after the header:\n\nRow 1: velasquez vs dos santos\nRow 2: evans vs davis\n...\nRow 7: johnson vs moraga\n\nSo the \"johnson vs moraga\" event is in row 8 (row_index=7) because we start counting from 0. Wait no, actually, let me clarify:\n\nThe <tbody> has multiple <tr> tags. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first data row: velasquez vs dos santos - row index 1\n2. evans vs davis - row 2\n3. diaz vs miller - row 3\n4. shogun vs vera - row 4\n5. henderson vs diaz - row 5\n6. johnson vs dodson - row 6\n7. henderson vs melendez - row 7\n8. johnson vs moraga - row 8\n\nWait, no, in the provided HTML, the first data row is for \"velasquez vs dos santos\" as the second <tr> (since the header is one <tr>). So the rows are:\n\n- Row 0: header\n- Row 1: velasquez...\n- Row 2: evans...\n...\n- Row 8: johnson vs moraga\n\nSo, in terms of the JSON structure, each data row starts from index 1. But in the table provided, it's unclear if the first data row is index 0 or 1. Wait, no, the user didn't specify whether the first data row is considered row_index 0 or not. Let me check:\n\nIn the example given by the user, they showed a JSON with \"row_index\": 0 and \"Employees\". So probably the first data row (after header) is index 0.\n\nWait, in their example, it's:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo the first data row is index 0. Therefore, in our case, \"johnson vs moraga\" is the eighth data row, so it would be index 7.\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nThe table has a header (row 0), then each <tr> after that is a data row. So:\n\n1. velasquez... - row 1\n2. evans... - row 2\n3. diaz... - row 3\n4. shogun... - row 4\n5. henderson... - row 5\n6. johnson vs dodson - row 6\n7. henderson vs melendez - row 7\n8. johnson vs moraga - row 8\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the <tbody> has multiple <tr>s. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the HTML provided:\n\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>event</td>\n      <td>date</td>\n      <td>rating</td>\n      <td>share</td>\n      <td>viewers</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>velasquez vs dos santos</td>\n      ... etc.\n\nSo each <tr> after the header is a data row. So:\n\n- The first <tr> after header is index 0.\nWait, no: in JSON arrays, it's zero-indexed. But in the example, the relevant cells are for \"row_index\": 0 and 1.\n\nIn the user's example, they have two rows, so probably each data row is assigned an index starting at 0.\n\nTherefore, in our case:\n\nThe header is one <tr>, then each data row follows. So:\n\n- First data row: velasquez... - row_index 0\n- Second data row: evans... - row_index 1\n...\n- Eighth data row: johnson vs moraga - row_index 7\n\nBut wait, that can't be because the user's example shows \"row_index\": 0 for the first data row. So in our case, to get the correct index, it's zero-based.\n\nTherefore:\n\nRow numbers (zero-indexed):\n\n1. velasquez... - row 0\n2. evans... - row 1\n...\n8. johnson vs moraga - row 7\n\nSo the \"viewers\" value for johnson vs moraga is in row 7, column viewers.\n\nHence, the relevant_cells array should have {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"viewers\"}.\n\nWait, no: Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nThe user shows an answer where relevant_cells are two entries. The first is for row index 0 (probably header?), but that seems incorrect because the header is a separate row.\n\nWait, perhaps in their example, it's considering the data rows as starting from index 1, not zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they count the header as row_index 0 and each subsequent <tr> as +1. So:\n\n- Header: row_index 0\n- Data row 1: row_index 1\n- ...\n- johnson vs moraga is row 8 (since it's the eighth data row after header).\n\nBut that would make the row index 8, but in the example, they only have up to row_index 1.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nIn the user's example:\n\nThey have a JSON with two relevant cells: row 0 and 1. It's unclear if these are data rows or header. Since column name is \"Employees\", which isn't in the header, it's likely that they are considering the first data row as index 0.\n\nSo perhaps each data row after the header is assigned row_index starting at 0.\n\nThus:\n\nFirst data row: velasquez vs dos santos - row 0\nSecond data row: evans vs davis - row 1\n...\nEighth data row: johnson vs moraga - row 7\n\nTherefore, in our case, the \"viewers\" value is in row 7, column viewers.\n\nSo the relevant_cells array should be:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"viewers\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, two entries are made: one for row 0 and another for row 1. It seems that each data row is considered as a separate entry.\n\nSo to make it clear, each <tr> after the header is assigned a row index starting at 0.\n\nTherefore, \"johnson vs moraga\" is the eighth data row, which would be row_index 7.\n\nHence, the relevant_cells should include {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"viewers\"}.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The event in question is found in row 7 (zero-indexed), viewers column.\n- The viewers number matches the claim (2.4 million).\n\nThus, the answer should be that the claim is true, and the relevant cell is at row_index 7, column \"viewers\".\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying a claim about the number of viewers for an event and identifying the relevant data cell.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:** The claim states that \"Johnson vs Moraga\" had 2.4 million viewers.\n2. **Identify the Event Row:** Each event is listed in a table row after the header. We need to find the correct row for \"Johnson vs Moraga\".\n3. **Count Data Rows (Zero-Indexed):**\n   - The first data row after the header is for \"Velasquez vs Dos Santos\" at index 0.\n   - Continue counting each subsequent event:\n     - Evans vs Davis: Index 1\n     - Diaz vs Miller: Index 2\n     - Shogun vs Vera: Index 3\n     - Henderson vs Diaz: Index 4\n     - Johnson vs Dodson: Index 5\n     - Henderson vs Melendez: Index 6\n     - Johnson vs Moraga: **Index 7**\n4. **Check Viewers Column:** In row 7, the viewers are listed as 2.4 million.\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim is accurate, and the relevant data cell is in row 7.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is verified to be true, with the number of viewers for \"Johnson vs Moraga\" being recorded in the viewers column at row index 7. \n\n\\boxed{2.4 \\text{ million}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim specifically mentions the \"shogun v vera\" event and states two things: the rating was 1.4 and the viewers were 2.4 million.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several rows, each representing a different event with details like date, rating, share, and viewers. My task is to find the relevant cells that check these two claims against the table.\n\nLooking for \"shogun vs vera\" in the 'event' column. Scanning through each row, I see that the fifth row (index 4) has the event \"shogun vs vera\". So row_index would be 4 because it's zero-indexed.\n\nNext, checking the rating for this event. In the same row, under the 'rating' column, it shows 1.4. That matches the claim's first part.\n\nThen, looking at the viewers column, the same row has \"2.4 million\" which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are met in this row. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the rating and viewers from row 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"At the Johnson v Dodson event, the rating be 2.4.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the table. The key elements here are the event name and the rating. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different event with details like date, rating, share, and viewers. My task is to find the relevant cells that correspond to the claim.\n\nThe event mentioned in the claim is \"Johnson v Dodson.\" I'll scan through each row to see if this exact name appears. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first row after headers doesn't match.\n- Second row: \"evans vs davis\" \u2013 nope.\n- Third: \"diaz vs miller\" \u2013 not it.\n- Fourth: \"shogun vs vera\" \u2013 no.\n- Fifth: \"henderson vs diaz\" \u2013 different fighters.\n- Sixth row: \"johnson vs dodson.\" Oh, that's the one. So this is the relevant event.\n\nNow, I need to find the rating for this event. In the same row, under the \"rating\" column, it says 2.4. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, the cells involved are the ones in the row where the event is \"Johnson v Dodson.\" The specific columns are \"event\" and \"rating.\"\n\nI should also note their positions. Since each row starts from index 0 or 1? Wait, the example given in the problem uses row indices starting at 0. Let me check the table structure.\n\nLooking at the HTML, each <tr> is a row. The first data row is \"velasquez vs dos santos\" which should be row 0. Then \"evans vs davis\" is row 1, and so on. So \"johnson vs dodson\" is row 6, right? Because there are 8 rows in total (from 0 to 7). Wait no, let me count:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos \u2013 row 1\n2. evans vs davis \u2013 row 2\n3. diaz vs miller \u2013 row 3\n4. shogun vs vera \u2013 row 4\n5. henderson vs diaz \u2013 row 5\n6. johnson vs dodson \u2013 row 6\n7. henderson vs melendez \u2013 row 7\n8. johnson vs moraga \u2013 row 8\n\nWait, no. The first data row after the headers is index 0 or 1? Let me see: the <tbody> has multiple <tr>s. Each <tr> represents a row in the table.\n\nThe first <tr> after <thead> is for \"velasquez vs dos santos\" \u2013 that's the first data row, so row index 0. Then each subsequent one increments by 1. So:\n\nRow 0: velasquez vs dos santos\nRow 1: evans vs davis\nRow 2: diaz vs miller\nRow 3: shogun vs vera\nRow 4: henderson vs diaz\nRow 5: johnson vs dodson\nRow 6: henderson vs melendez\nRow 7: johnson vs moraga\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me recount:\n\n- The first <tr> after the thead is \"velasquez vs dos santos\" \u2013 row 0.\n- Next is evans vs davis \u2013 row 1.\n- Then diaz vs miller \u2013 row 2.\n- shogun vs vera \u2013 row3\n- henderson vs diaz \u2013 row4\n- johnson vs dodson \u2013 row5\n- henderson vs melendez \u2013 row6\n- johnson vs moraga \u2013 row7\n\nYes, so the \"johnson vs dodson\" event is in row 5. Wait no, that can't be because when I count:\n\n1. velasquez \u2013 0\n2. evans \u2013 1\n3. diaz \u20132\n4. shogun \u20133\n5. henderson vs diaz \u20134\n6. johnson vs dodson \u20135\n7. henderson vs melendez \u20136\n8. johnson vs moraga \u20137\n\nWait, no, the table has 8 <tr> elements inside tbody:\n\n- velasquez: tr1\n- evans: tr2\n- diaz: tr3\n- shogun: tr4\n- henderson: tr5\n- johnson: tr6\n- henderson again: tr7\n- johnson vs moraga: tr8\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rows:\n\n1. <tr for velasquez vs dos santos \u2013 row 0?\n2. evans vs davis \u2013 row1\n3. diaz vs miller \u2013 row2\n4. shogun vs vera \u2013 row3\n5. henderson vs diaz \u2013 row4\n6. johnson vs dodson \u2013 row5\n7. henderson vs melendez \u2013 row6\n8. johnson vs moraga \u2013 row7\n\nYes, that's correct. So the event \"johnson vs dodson\" is in row index 5.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- In row 5, the \"event\" column: value is \"johnson vs dodson\"\n- In row 5, the \"rating\" column: 2.4\n\nTherefore, the claim checks out because the rating for that event is indeed 2.4.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves verifying the accuracy of a statement regarding the rating of an event in a table.

It has columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers.\n\nNext, I need to search for the specific date mentioned in the claim. The date is December 8, 2012. So I should scan through each row's date column for this exact date.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n1. November 12, 2011\n2. January 28, 2012\n3. May 5, 2012\n4. August 4, 2012\n5.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"viewer of johnson v moraga be above 3 million\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate which rows and columns in the table are relevant to verifying this claim. The claim mentions \"viewers\" for a specific event: \"johnson vs moraga\". So, I should look for an event row where the fighters are Johnson vs Moraga.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row starts with the event name. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos\n2. evans vs davis\n3. diaz vs miller\n4. shogun vs vera\n5. henderson vs diaz\n6. johnson vs dodson\n7. henderson vs melendez\n8. johnson vs moraga\n\nAh, here's the one: row 8 is \"johnson vs moraga\". Now, I need to check the \"viewers\" column for this event.\n\nEach row has five columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. So, for row 8, the \"viewers\" data is in the fifth column. Let me confirm that number. In the table, the last row (row index 8) has \"2.4 million\" under viewers.\n\nThe claim states that the viewers should be above 3 million. So, I need to compare 2.4 million with 3 million. Since 2.4 is less than 3, this doesn't meet the condition of being \"above 3 million\".\n\nWait, but the instruction says if fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise FALSE. In this case, the viewers are 2.4 million, which is not above 3 million. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to specify which cells were checked. The relevant_cells should be a list of objects with row_index and column_name. Since only one cell is relevant here, it's row index 8 (since it's zero-indexed? Wait, no, looking back at the example, in the sample JSON provided, the first row was index 0, so I think the rows are zero-indexed.\n\nWait, wait: in the table, the first row after <thead> is row 1, but when counting for the JSON, it's probably zero-indexed. Let me check the sample again. The example given had:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo, in that example, the first row is index 0. So applying that here, the \"johnson vs moraga\" event is the 8th row, which would be row index 7.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nThe table has 9 rows including the header? No, wait, no: the <thead> has one row (the header), then the <tbody> has 9 data rows. So each of those 9 is a tr element, so their indexes are from 0 to 8.\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos - index 0\n2. evans vs davis - index 1\n3. diaz vs miller - index 2\n4. shogun vs vera - index 3\n5. henderson vs diaz - index 4\n6. johnson vs dodson - index 5\n7. henderson vs melendez - index 6\n8. johnson vs moraga - index 7\n9. I think the last one is at index 8.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all the tr elements:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos (row 0)\n2. evans vs davis (row 1)\n3. diaz vs miller (row 2)\n4. shogun vs vera (row 3)\n5. henderson vs diaz (row 4)\n6. johnson vs dodson (row 5)\n7. henderson vs melendez (row 6)\n8. johnson vs moraga (row 7)\n9. Is there a ninth row? Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, in the table provided, after \"johnson vs moraga\", there's no more rows listed beyond that. So it seems that the event \"johnson vs moraga\" is at row index 7.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}]\n\nSo putting it all together, since the viewers for this event are 2.4 million, which doesn't exceed 3 million, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In the table, the events listed are:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos\n2. evans vs davis\n3. diaz vs miller\n4. shogun vs vera\n5. henderson vs diaz\n6. johnson vs dodson\n7. henderson vs melendez\n8. johnson vs moraga\n\nThe claim mentions \"johnson v dodson,\" which matches row 6: \"johnson vs dodson.\" So that's the event we're focusing on.\n\nNow, let's check the rating and viewers for this event. The columns relevant are \"rating\" and \"viewers.\"\n\nFrom the table, row_index is 6 (since counting starts from 0). Looking at column \"rating,\" it's 2.4. Wait, that's exactly 2.4, not greater than 2.4. So the first condition isn't met because the rating isn't higher; it's equal to 2.4.\n\nNext, for viewers: the number is 4.2 million. The claim says \"more than 4.2 million,\" but here, it's exactly 4.2 million. So the second condition also isn't met because it's not more than 4.2 million; it's equal to it.\n\nSince both conditions require greater than and more than respectively, but in reality, they are equal, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails because the rating is exactly 2.4, not higher, and viewers are exactly 4.2 million, not more.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the johnson v moraga fight took place just after july 27, 2013 and have a rating of close to 1.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant parts of the table. The event in question is \"johnson vs moraga.\" Let me scan through each row to find that exact event name.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 0: \"event\" column has \"event\", which isn't specific.\n- Row 1: \"velasquez vs dos santos\"\n- Row 2: \"evans vs davis\"\n- Row 3: \"diaz vs miller\"\n- Row 4: \"shogun vs vera\"\n- Row 5: \"henderson vs diaz\"\n- Row 6: \"johnson vs dodson\" \u2013 this is close but not the one we're looking for.\n- Row 7: \"henderson vs melendez\"\n- Row 8: \"johnson vs moraga\" \u2013 found it at row index 8.\n\nSo, the event happens on July 27, 2013, as per the date in that row. Now, checking the rating column for that row shows a value of 1.5. The claim says \"rating close to 1,\" but 1.5 is actually higher than 1 and closer to 2.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. The claim specifies a rating close to 1, but the table shows 1.5 for that event. That's not close to 1; it's halfway between 1 and 2. So, the rating doesn't match the claim.\n\nAlso, the date is exactly July 27, 2013, as mentioned in the claim, so that part checks out. But since the rating is higher than expected, the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the row with \"johnson vs moraga\" for both date and rating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the event henderson v melendez take place before april 20 , 2013\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading the problem and understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. Each row represents a different event with its details. My task is to check whether the specific event \"henderson vs melendez\" took place before April 20, 2013.\n\nSo, the claim mentions that this event happened before April 20, 2013. I need to find out if there's an entry in the table for this event and check its date.\n\nLooking at the rows one by one:\n\n1. The first row seems to be headers.\n2. Then, each subsequent row lists different events with their details.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any of them match \"henderson vs melendez\".\n\n- The third row down: 'henderson vs diaz' happened on December 8, 2012.\n- Next, the seventh row: 'johnson vs dodson' is on January 26, 2013.\n- Then the eighth row: 'henderson vs melendez' on April 20, 2013.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The event \"henderson vs melendez\" took place exactly on April 20, 2013. So, if the claim says it took place before April 20, 2013, then it would be false because it happened on that very date. \n\nBut I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me count the rows properly.\n\nStarting from row index 0 as headers:\n\n- Row 1: velasquez vs dos santos\n- Row 2: evans vs davis\n- Row 3: diaz vs miller\n- Row 4: shogun vs vera\n- Row 5: henderson vs diaz\n- Row 6: johnson vs dodson\n- Row 7: henderson vs melendez\n\nYes, so row 7 is April 20, 2013. Therefore, the event happened on that date, not before.\n\nNow, to structure the response as per instructions. The answer should be \"FALSE\" because it didn't happen before April 20th but exactly on that date. For relevant cells, I need to list which cells were checked. Since the claim refers to an event's date, the relevant columns are 'event' and 'date'. So, the row index for henderson vs melendez is 7 (assuming rows start at 0 after headers). But wait, in the table provided, the first data row is index 1. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the table starts with <thead> and then the first data row is row index 1. So, \"henderson vs melendez\" is on the 7th data row (row_index=6 if starting from 0 after headers). Wait, no, let's count:\n\n- Row 0: header\n- Row 1: event 1\n- ...\n- Row 6: henderson vs melendez\n\nYes, so row index is 6 for the event in question. Therefore, I'll include both 'event' and 'date' columns from that row.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at row_index=6, column_name='event' and 'date'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"henderson v melendez\" occurred before April 20, 2013. However, checking the table, this event took place on April 20, 2013, not before it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the number of viewers for the fight on december 8 , 2012 be over 4.4 million.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: event, date, rating, share, and viewers. Each row represents a different event with corresponding data.\n\nThe claim mentions December 8, 2012, so I need to find the row that corresponds to this date. Scanning through the rows, I see a row where the date is \"december 8 , 2012\". That's the fifth row from the top (row index 5, since we start counting from 0).\n\nLooking at the \"viewers\" column for that row, the number is 4.4 million. The claim says it should be over 4.4 million. Wait, does \"over\" mean strictly more than 4.4? If the viewers are exactly 4.4 million, then the claim would be false because it's not over\u2014it's equal. \n\nSo, I need to check if the number is greater than 4.4. The table shows 4.4 million. Therefore, the claim is stating that it's over, which isn't accurate. So the answer should be false.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells. The relevant columns are \"date\" and \"viewers\".
