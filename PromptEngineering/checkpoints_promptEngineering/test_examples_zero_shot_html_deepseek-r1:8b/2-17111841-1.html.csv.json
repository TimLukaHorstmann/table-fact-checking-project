    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"Episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally aired on June 8, 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly is being claimed. It's about two things: the episode number and the airdate. So I need to check if Episode 4 was indeed the first one to air on June 8, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, original airdate, etc. The columns relevant here are 'episode' and 'original airdate'. \n\nI'll go through each row to find which episodes aired on June 8, 2008. Scanning down:\n\n- Episode 1: May 18, 2008\n- Episode 2: May 25, 2008\n- Episode 3: June 1, 2008\n- Episode 4: June 8, 2008\n\nSo, Episode 4 is the first one to air in June. Now, I need to check if any earlier episode (before June) aired on or before June 8. \n\nWait, no. The claim is about being the earliest episode number that originally aired on June 8. So actually, it's about whether Episode 4 is the first among all episodes to have been aired on June 8. But looking at the table, let me check if any other episodes after Episode 4 also aired on June 8.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- Episode 5: June 15\n- Episode 6: June 22\n- Episode 7: June 29\n- Episode 8: July 6\n- ... and so on until November.\n\nSo, only Episode 4 aired on June 8. Now, is there any earlier episode number that also aired on June 8? No, because the episodes before 4 are in May. So Episode 4 is indeed the earliest one to have aired on June 8.\n\nWait, but the term \"earliest episode number\" could be confusing. The claim says Episode 4 is the earliest (meaning the first in terms of numbering) that originally aired on June 8. Since Episode 4 is number 4 and all earlier episodes (1-3) aired before June, none of them are on June 8. So yes, Episode 4 is both numbered as 4 and was the first among the episodes to air on June 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because Episode 4 is indeed the earliest (by number) episode that originally aired on June 8, 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4.\" So, they're saying that among all episodes aired on June 8th, 2008, the one with the lowest viewership is episode number 4.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on rows where the 'original airdate' matches \"8 june 2008\" and check their 'viewers (millions)' column. Also, since the claim mentions the least watched episode, I need to see if the value in that column is indeed the smallest among those episodes.\n\nFrom the table, there's only one row with \"8 june 2008,\" which is episode number 4. The viewers for this episode are 1.364 million. Now, I have to check all other episodes on June 8th to see if any have a lower viewership.\n\nWait, but there's only one episode on that date, so the least watched would be itself. However, I should make sure there aren't other dates with the same original airdate. Scanning through the table, it seems like \"8 june 2008\" only appears once for episode 4.\n\nTherefore, since there are no other episodes from that specific date, the claim is true because the least watched (and only) episode on that date has a viewership of 1.364 million, which is indeed ranked 4 in terms of viewership when compared to others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
