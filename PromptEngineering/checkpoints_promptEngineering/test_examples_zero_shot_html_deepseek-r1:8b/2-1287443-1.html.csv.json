    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"geoffrey fitton have 44 performance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: opening date, closing date, performances, role, and theatre. Each row represents a different engagement or performance period with various details filled in.\n\nThe claim mentions \"geoffrey fitton\" having 44 performances. So, my task is to find if there's any row where the 'role' column lists Geoffrey Fitton and the 'performances' column has 44.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Role is \"tom junior - replacement\". Not Geoffrey Fitton.\n2. **Second Row**: The role is \"aaron jablonski schuyler grogan\". Not relevant.\n3. **Third Row**: Role is \"shorty ensemble\". No match.\n4. **Fourth Row**: Role is \"stage manager\". Not Geoffrey.\n5. **Fifth Row**: Role is \"geoffrey fitton\". This seems promising. Let's check the performances column: it says 44. Yes, that matches.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Role is \"unknown\". Doesn't match.\n7. **Seventh Row**: Role mentions \"joe (monopoly) mr stein...\", which is someone else.\n\nSo, only in the fifth row does the role column mention Geoffrey Fitton, and the performances are 44. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data point.\n\nI also need to ensure that there's no other occurrence of Geoffrey Fitton with 44 performances. Scanning through all rows again confirms that he only appears once with exactly 44 performances. There's another row where performances are 8, but that's for a different role (unknown).\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are the fifth row under 'performances' and 'role'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"performances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"role\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the role for aaron jablonski schuyler grogan be close on feb 4 , 1961\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asserting. It mentions two main things: the person (Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Gorgan) and the role they had, which was \"close\" on February 4, 1961.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different performance or engagement, including details like opening date, closing date, number of performances, role, and theatre. My task is to find if there's any row that matches this claim accurately.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to see if any mention Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Gorgan as the role holder. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. The first row has a role \"tom junior - replacement\" and theatre \"martin beck theatre\". Doesn't match.\n2. Second row: opening date Oct 29, 1960 to Feb 4, 1961 with 113 performances. Role is \"aaron jablonski schuyler grogan\". That's exactly the person mentioned in the claim. The role doesn't explicitly say \"close\", but since the claim says \"be close on feb 4, 1961\", maybe it refers to the closing date? Wait, the closing date here is Feb 4, 1961, which matches. So this row seems relevant.\n\nWait, but the claim says the role was \"close\" on that date. The word \"close\" isn't in the table's role description; it just lists the name of the person. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps \"close\" refers to the closing date being Feb 4, 1961, which is accurate for this row.\n\nSo, checking if the role is for Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Gorgan on or around Feb 4, 1961. The second row's closing date is Feb 4, 1961, and the role is his name. Therefore, it matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the role... be close\". Maybe they mean that the role ended on that date? So the relevant columns here would be row_index for this row (which is 1) and the column_name as \"role\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are where the role is \"aaron jablonski schuyler grogan\" and the closing date is Feb 4, 1961. But looking at the table, only one row matches that.\n\nTherefore, since the claim refers to a specific person with a specific role on a specific date, which is present in the table, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the second row of the table, where Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Gorgan's role ended on Feb 4, 1961.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"role\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"the most performance for geoffrey fitton be 8.\" So, the claim is saying that Geoffrey Fitton had the highest number of performances with a count of 8. \n\nI should look through each row of the table to find any entries where the role is Geoffrey Fitton and see how many performances he had.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. First row: Role is \"tom junior - replacement\" \u2013 not Geoffrey.\n2. Second row: Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Gorgan \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: Shorty Ensemble \u2013 no.\n4. Fourth row: Stage manager \u2013 different person.\n5. Fifth row: Geoffrey Fitton \u2013 yes! He had 44 performances.\n6. Sixth row: Unknown role, so not him.\n7. Seventh row: Joe (Monopoly)... \u2013 different person.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the most performance for geoffrey fitton be 8.\" But in the table, when his name appears, he had 44 performances, which is more than 8. So, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that the maximum was 8, but actually, it's much higher.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, for relevant cells: I need to find the row where Geoffrey Fitton is mentioned and his performance count.\n\nLooking back, the fifth row (row_index 5) has the role as Geoffrey Fitton with 44 performances. So the relevant cell is that row's \"performances\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"performances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan be the name of the role for April 17, 1966 closing date.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is stating. It mentions a specific role name and a specific closing date. So, I need to find in the table if there's an entry where the role is \"Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan\" and the closing date is April 17, 1966.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different engagement with details like opening and closing dates, performances, roles, and theatres. I'll go through each row one by one to check for matches.\n\nStarting from the first row: The role here is \"tom junior - replacement\" which doesn't match. Next row has a longer role name but it's not the same as Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan either. Moving on, the fourth row mentions \"stage manager,\" which isn't relevant. Fifth row lists \"geoffrey fitton\" as the role, so no match there. Sixth row is \"unknown,\" so that's also a no.\n\nThe seventh row has a closing date of April 17, 1966. Now, I need to check what the role was for this date. According to the table, on April 17, 1966, the role was \"joe (monopoly) mr stein (suburban tragedy)\". That's not Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier rows: The second row has a closing date of Feb 4, 1961 and the role is \"aaron jablonski schuyler grogan.\" So that's a different date than April 17, 1966. So the claim specifically mentions April 17, 1966 as the closing date, but in the table, there isn't any entry for that exact date with that role.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no row where both the closing date is April 17, 1966 and the role is \"Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan.\" The only mention of that name is in a different time frame.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"role\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
