Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"european junior championship.\" Looking at the table, I see that in 1973, there's an entry for \" european junior championships\". That matches the claim, so this part seems correct.\n\nNext, the claim states that they were \"1st\" in 1973. I need to check if there was a first-place result in that year. Looking at the table's 1973 row, under the \"result\" column, it says \"1st\". So yes, they came in first place.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells that support this claim. The columns involved here are \"year\", \"tournament\", and \"result\". Specifically, for 1973, the row index is 0. So the relevant cells would be at row 0, columns \"year\" and \"result\".\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure and understand what each column represents. The columns are: year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. Each row corresponds to a specific event in a particular year.\n\nThe claim mentions the year 1973, so my focus is on the rows where the year is 1973. From scanning through the table, I see that there's only one row for 1973. Let me locate that row carefully.\n\nIn row 0 (the first row), the year is indeed 1973. The tournament is \"European junior championships,\" held in \"duisburg , west germany.\" The result column here says \"1st.\" The extra column mentions \"4x400 m relay.\"\n\nSo, the key part of the claim is the result for 1973. According to the table, in that year, the result was \"1st.\" That seems to directly support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows with the same year and result to see if it conflicts. However, looking at the table, each row has a unique combination of tournament and venue. The only 1973 entry is in row 0 with the result as \"1st.\" There's no conflicting information elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, since the result for 1973 matches the claim, I can conclude that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data for the year 1973, which shows a first-place result. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 1979 the tournament of european indoor championship play where the extra be 800 m and the result be 2nd.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with columns: year, tournament, venue, result, and extra.\n\nI need to find the row for the year 1979 because the claim is about that specific year. Scanning through the rows, I see there's a row where year is 1979. That's the fifth row in the table body (since the first is 1973). So row index would be 4 if we start counting from zero.\n\nNext, let's check the columns mentioned in the claim: tournament, extra, and result. For the 1979 row, the tournament is \"european indoor championships,\" which matches the claim. The result column has \"2nd,\" so that's correct too. \n\nNow, looking at the 'extra' column for 1979, it says \"800 m.\" That's exactly what the claim states. So all three parts of the claim are present in this specific row.\n\nTherefore, since all the information in the claim is accurately represented in the table for 1979 European Indoor Championships, the claim must be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"extra\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the european championship have an extra 400 m hurdle\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that there's an extra 400m hurdle event in the European Championships. To verify this, I need to check if any row in the table mentions \"400 m hurdles\" under the 'extra' column for the European Championship.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and event. The columns are: year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. \n\nI'll go through each relevant row one by one:\n\n1. **1973**: This is the European Junior Championships with an 800m relay as the extra. No mention of 400m hurdles here.\n\n2. **1975**: European Indoor Championships with 800m. Not relevant.\n\n3. **1976**: Olympic Games, 4th place in 800m. No.\n\n4. **1978**: First row shows European Championships in Prague, result is 6th in 800m. The extra is also 800m. Second row same tournament but different event: 400m hurdles. So here, the extra column does mention \"400 m hurdles\".\n\n5. **1979**: European Indoor Championships, 2nd place in 800m. Not relevant.\n\nSo, focusing on the 1978 rows for European Championships, one of them has an extra of \"400 m hurdles\". This directly supports the claim that the European Championship includes this event as an extra.\n\nI should check if there are any other instances beyond 1978 to be thorough, but looking at the table, the next years after 1979 aren't provided. So based on what's given, yes, there is a row where \"400 m hurdles\" is listed under 'extra' for European Championships in 1978.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data, making it TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"extra\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"european junior championship come in second place since 1975\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It's saying that the European Junior Championships have finished in second place starting from 1975. So, I need to look for any occurrences of \"European Junior Championships\" in the 'tournament' column and check their corresponding 'result' column for the years 1975 onwards.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- The first row is 1973, with the tournament as \"european junior championships\", result as \"1st\".\n- Then in 1975, it's \"european indoor championships\" with a result of \"1st\".\n- In 1976, it's the \"olympic games\" with a \"4th\" place.\n- In 1978, there are two entries: one for \"european championships\" with \"6th\", and another also for \"european championships\" but different events (\"400 m hurdles\").\n- In 1979, it's \"european indoor championships\" again with \"2nd\".\n\nNow, focusing on the claim about the European Junior Championships. From the table, I see that in 1973, there was a tournament called \"european junior championships\" where they got \"1st\". However, in 1975, the tournament is listed as \"european indoor championships\", not the juniors. \n\nSo, the key here is to check if after 1975, the European Junior Championships came in second place. But looking at the table, there's no entry for \"european junior championships\" beyond 1973. The closest is in 1975 but it's under a different tournament name.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true because after 1975, there are no entries for the European Junior Championships that placed them second. Also, the initial occurrence in 1973 was first place, not second.\n\nI need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. Since the relevant information is about \"european junior championships\" and their results starting from 1975, the only relevant row is the first one (row_index:0). The other rows either don't mention the European Junior Championships or are before 1975.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- Row 0 (year 1973) for the tournament name and result.\n- Any rows after that which reference European Junior Championships and have a result. However, in this table, there are none beyond row 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the European Junior Championships didn't come in second place since 1975 as per the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"european junior championship come in second place since 1975\" is true or false, we analyze the table:\n\n1. **Check for presence of \"european junior championships\":**\n   - Only found in row 0 (1973), with a result of \"1st\".\n   \n2. **Look for entries after 1975:**\n   - No further entries for \"european junior championships\" beyond 1973.\n   \n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no second-place finishes by the European Junior Championships after 1975, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells identified:**\n- Only row 0 provides information on the European Junior Championships with their result.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"french championship have an extra of 400 m hurdle\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it mentions \"French Championship\" and specifically looks for an \"extra\" of 400m hurdles. So I need to find any rows in the table that match both criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: year, tournament, venue, result, extra. The tournaments listed are European junior championships, European indoor championships, Olympic games, European championships, and so on. None of these are \"French championship.\" So immediately, there's no direct match for the tournament name in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe the term \"championship\" is a general term and could include French ones? However, the specific entries don't mention anything about France. The venues are cities in countries like Germany, Poland, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Austria\u2014no French locations here.\n\nNow, checking the \"extra\" column: looking for 400m hurdles. In the table, I see that one of the extras is indeed \"400 m hurdles\" (row index 4). But the tournament name in that row is \"European championships.\" So even though there's an extra of 400m hurdles, it's not associated with French championship.\n\nSo the claim is saying that within French championship events, there's an extra of 400m hurdles. Since none of the tournaments in the table are French championship, and even if we consider that maybe French championship could be a type of European championships, which includes 400m hurdles, it still doesn't directly tie to French specifically.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data because there's no row for French championship, and the extra 400m hurdles is under a different tournament.

So, my task is to find the row where the year is 1973 and then check the value under the \"result\" column for that specific row.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row's year until I find the one that matches 1973. The first row has a year of 1973, so that's the relevant row. Now, I need to look at the \"result\" column for this row.
