    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"episode no 53 in the series be directed by paul holahan\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns like 'no in series', 'no in season', 'title', 'directed by', and others. The claim specifically mentions episode number 53 and director Paul Holahan. So, my main focus will be on finding the relevant cells related to these two pieces of information.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for episode no 53. Scanning through the 'no in series' column, I see that it goes from 47 up to 61. Episode 53 is there, so that's the correct row.\n\nNext, I need to find out who directed episode 53. Looking at the 'directed by' column for this row, the name listed is Paul Holahan. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim check out: episode 53 has no. 53 in series and is directed by Paul Holahan. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. I should also identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim mentions two specific pieces of data ('no in series' as 53 and 'directed by' as Paul Holahan), those are the columns to include in relevant_cells.\n\nI think that's all. No conflicting information or errors spotted, so the answer is TRUE with both relevant cells pointing to their respective data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 53, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 53, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the production code for the episode directed by robert duncan mcneill be bcw404\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main things: the director's name and the production code.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details, including who directed it and the production code assigned to that episode.\n\nI need to find an episode where the director is Robert Duncan McNeill and the production code is bcw404. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 4: The title is \"parting shots\". Directed by Robert Duncan McNeill. Production code is bcw404.\n- Other rows either have different directors or different codes.\n\nSo, this matches perfectly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bcw410 be the production code for episode 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that bcw410 is the production code for episode number 10. To verify this, I should look for two specific pieces of information in the table: the production code and the episode number corresponding to that code.\n\nFirst, I'll need to find where the production code 'bcw410' appears in the table. Scanning through each row's \"production code\" column, I see that bcw410 is listed in the 56th row (since rows start at 1). So, the production code for episode 56 is bcw410.\n\nNext, I need to check what episode number corresponds to production code bcw410. Looking at the table, each row has a \"no in series\" column which represents the episode number. The row with production code bcw410 is row 56, and that row's \"no in series\" value is 10.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the first row is no 47, then 48, up to 56 for bcw410. So yes, the \"no in series\" for bcw410 is 10. Therefore, the production code bcw410 indeed corresponds to episode 10.\n\nNow, checking the claim again: it says bcw410 is the production code for episode 10. Since both the production code and the episode number match, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant cells are where \"production code\" equals 'bcw410' and the corresponding \"no in series\" is 10. From the table, bcw410 is in row 56 under \"production code,\" and the \"no in series\" for that row is 10.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 56 (since rows start at 0 or 1? Wait, looking back, the user didn't specify. But in programming, often rows are 0-indexed. However, in the example given, the first row is 0 with \"Revenue\" and 1 with \"Employees.\" So probably the rows are 0-indexed.\n\nWait no, in the table, each row represents a single episode, starting from 47 as the first. So if I'm looking for bcw410, it's in row 56 (since 56th row is row index 55 if 0-indexed). But wait, actually, let me clarify: The user provided an example with rows starting at 0. For instance, in the example, the first relevant cell is row_index:0 and column_name:\"Revenue\". So probably, the table's rows are 0-indexed.\n\nTherefore, the row where production code is bcw410 is row index 55 (since it's the 56th row starting from 1), and within that row, the \"no in series\" is 10. Wait, no: Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row after <tbody> is row 0, which has \"no in series\":47.\n- Each subsequent row increments by 1. So bcw410 is in row 55 (since it's the 56th row) and \"no in series\" is 10.\n\nWait, no: Looking at the table, the first <tr> is row 0 with no_in_series=47, then row 1 has no_in_series=48, and so on. So bcw410 is in row 55 (since 56th row) and \"no in series\" is 10.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For production code 'bcw410', it's in row 55 under column \"production_code\".\n- The episode number for that row is 10, which is in the same row under \"no_in_series\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n{\"row_index\":55, \"column_name\":\"production_code\"},\n{\"row_index\":55, \"column_name\":\"no_in_series\"}\n\nWait no, the claim says bcw410 is the production code for episode 10. So to verify, I need both the production_code and the corresponding no_in_series (episode number). Therefore, I need two cells: one where column is production_code and value is bcw410, and another where column is no_in_series and value is 10.\n\nFrom the table, bcw410 is in row 55 of \"production_code\" column. The same row has no_in_series as 10, so that's in the same row under a different column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are both from row 55: one for production_code and one for no_in_series.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because bcw410 is indeed the production code for episode 10. The table confirms this with the corresponding entries in the relevant rows and columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":55, \"column_name\":\"production_code\"},\n    {\"row_index\":55, \"column_name\":\"no_in_series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the production code for the episode directed by robert duncan mcneill be bcw403\". \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's about finding an episode where Robert Duncan McNeill is the director and the production code is bcw403.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various attributes like \"directed by\" and \"production code\". So I need to find if any row matches both the director and the production code mentioned in the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 3: Directed by Stefan Schwartz, so not McNeill. Production code is bcw403. Wait, but the director here isn't McNeill, so even though the code matches, the director doesn't. So this row doesn't fully support the claim.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, row 3 has \"directed by\" as Stefan Schwartz and production code bcw403. The claim is about Robert Duncan McNeill directing with that code. So maybe I need to check if there's an episode where both conditions are met.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 4: Directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, but the production code is bcw404. So not matching the code in the claim.\n\nRow 5: Directed by Arlene Sanford, so no.\n\nRow 6: Directed by David Straiton.\n\nRow 7: Directed by Paul Holahan.\n\nRow 8: Directed by Russell Lee Fine.\n\nRow 9: Directed by Anton Cropper.\n\nRow 10: Directed by Tim DeKay.\n\nRow 11: Directed by Russell Lee Fine again.\n\nRow 12: Directed by Anton Cropper.\n\nRow 13: Directed by Tim DeKay.\n\nWait, row 4 has the director as Robert Duncan McNeill but production code is bcw404. So no match for bcw403.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at row 3 again: it's episode number 3, directed by Stefan Schwartz, production code bcw403. The claim says the production code is bcw403 and directed by Robert Duncan McNeill. So in this row, the production code matches, but the director doesn't. Therefore, this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nNext, looking for an episode where \"directed by\" is Robert Duncan McNeill AND production code is bcw403.\n\nChecking all rows:\n\n- Row 4: Directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, code bcw404.\n- Any other rows with his name as director? Let me check the entire table.\n\nLooking at the 'directed by' column:\n\nRow 0: Paul Holahan\nRow 1: Jim Campolongo\n...\nWait, actually, in the given data, I need to look for Robert Duncan McNeill. From the table provided, the rows go from 0 to 14 and then continue up to row 15.\n\nLooking through all the 'directed by' entries:\n\nRow 3: Stefan Schwartz\nRow 4: Robert Duncan McNeill (code bcw404)\nRow 7: Paul Holahan\nRow 8: Russell Lee Fine\nRow 12: Anton Cropper\nRow 13: Tim DeKay\nRow 14: Russell Lee Fine\nRow 15: John Kretchmer\n\nWait, in row 4, the director is Robert Duncan McNeill with code bcw404. So no match for bcw403.\n\nIs there any other row where he's the director and code is bcw403? Looking again:\n\nNo, because in row 3, code is bcw403 but directed by Stefan Schwartz. No other rows have both the director as Robert Duncan McNeill and production code bcw403.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there is no episode that matches both the director and production code specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that an episode directed by Robert Duncan McNeill has a production code of bcw403. Checking each row in the table, I find that while Robert Duncan McNeill directs one episode (row 4), its production code is bcw404, not bcw403. No other episodes match both the director and the production code specified.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"production_code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"directed_by\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"paul holahan only direct episode for season 1 through season 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Paul Holohan only directed episodes from Season 1 to Season 6. So, I need to check if all the episodes he directed are within these seasons and that there are no episodes in Season 7 or later where he directs again.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like 'no in series', 'title', 'directed by', etc. The columns relevant here are 'no in series' which is a numeric identifier, 'title', and 'directed by'.\n\nI need to find all rows where the director is Paul Holahan and check their season numbers (since each season's episodes start with a specific no in series, I can infer the season based on that number).\n\nFrom the table:\n- Season 1: no 47,48,49,50,51,52\n- Season 2: no 53,54,55,56\n- Season 3: no 57,58\n- Season 4: no 59\n- Season 5: no 60\n- Season 6: no 61\n\nNow, let's look for Paul Holahan as the director:\n- Row 0 (no 47): directed by Paul Holahan. Season 1.\n- Row 1 (no 48): same director, Season 2.\n- Row 3 (no 49): Season 3.\n- Row 6 (no 57): Season 7. Wait, no: looking at row index, it's row 6 which is no 57, and the 'directed by' is Paul Holohan. The season for no 57 is in the second set of double digits beyond 50, so that would be Season 7 because each season starts at 1:\nWait, actually, looking again: the 'no in series' goes from 47 to 61.\n\nWait, I think my initial categorization was off. Let me correctly map the no_in_series to seasons based on the table structure:\n\nFrom the table, each row is an episode with unique no_in_series. The first 6 seasons would have their own ranges. For example:\n- Season 1: 47-52 (6 episodes)\n- Season 2: 53-56\n- Season 3: 57-58\n- Season 4: 59\n- Season 5: 60\n- Season 6: 61\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because from the table, Season 1 would be 47,48,49,50,51,52 (6 episodes), then Season 2 is 53,54,55,56,57,58? No, wait no. Looking at row 0 to row 13:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rows, each season starts after a certain number of episodes. For example:\n- Season 1: 47 (no 47),48,49,50,51,52\n- Season 2: 53,54,55,56\n- Season 3: 57,58\n- Season 4:59\n- Season5:60\n- Season6:61\n\nWait no, that's not correct because the table goes up to 61. So perhaps each season has a specific range:\n\nLooking at the 'no in series' and their corresponding seasons based on when they were aired:\n- Seasons 1: episodes 47-52 (6)\n- Season 2:53-56 (4)\n- Season3:57,58 (2)\n- Season4:59 (1)\n- Season5:60 (1)\n- Season6:61 (1)\n\nBut actually, from the table structure, each season's first episode is when 'no in series' increases by 13 for each new season beyond 1. Wait no, looking at the rows:\n\nWait, the 'no in series' starts at 47 and goes up to 61.\n\nSo, let's list all episodes with Paul Holahan directing and their 'no_in_series':\n\nRow 0: no 47, directed by Paul H.\nRow1:48, same dir.\nRow2:49, same.\nRow3:57, same dir. (Wait row3 is no 49? Wait no, looking at the table:\n\nWait the rows are numbered from 0 to 39.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: no 47, directed by Paul H., Season1\n- Row1:48, same, S1\n- Row2:49, same, S1\n- Then row3 is no50? Wait no, the 'no in series' increments as follows:\n\nWait each row's first entry is 'no_in_series', so:\n\nRow0:47\n\nRow1:48\n\n...\n\nSo for example:\n\nLooking at rows 0-5:\n\nRows0-5 (no47-52): all Season1.\n\nThen rows6-9 (53-56): Season2.\n\nRows10-11:57,58: Season3.\n\nRow12:59:Season4.\n\nRow13:60:Season5.\n\nRow14:61:Season6.\n\nWait that doesn't make sense because the initial 6 would be 47-52 as S1, then next 4 (53-56) S2, next 2 (57-58) S3, etc. So yes, 47-52:S1,53-56:S2,57-58:S3,59:S4,60:S5,61:S6.\n\nSo Paul Holohan directs:\n\nRow0: no47, S1\n\nRow1:48,S1\n\nRow2:49,S1\n\nThen row3 is50? Wait no, in the table, each row's first entry is 'no_in_series', so let me list all rows with Paul H. as director and their no_in_series:\n\nLooking through the table, columns are: no_in_series, title, directed_by,...\n\nSo for each row, if directed_by is \"Paul Holahan\", note the no_in_series.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow0:47\n\nRow1:48\n\nRow2:49\n\nRow3:50 (no, wait row3's first entry is 50? Wait let me check.\n\nWait the table has rows from 0 to39. Each row starts with 'no_in_series', then title, etc.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow0:47, \"The First Episode\", Paul H., S1\n\nRow1:48, ..., Paul H., S1\n\nRow2:49, ..., Paul H., S1\n\nThen Row3 is50, someone else, S1\n\nWait but wait, in the initial data, up to row13 (no53? Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me instead list all no_in_series for each row where directed_by is Paul Holahan.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row0: no47\n- Row1:48\n- Row2:49\n- Then further down, at row6: no50? No, let's see.\n\nWait no, better to go step by step.\n\nList all rows and check 'directed_by':\n\nRow0: no_in_series=47, directed_by Paul H. So S1\n\nRow1:48, same dir., S1\n\nRow2:49, same, S1\n\nThen at row3:50, someone else.\n\nContinue:\n\nLooking through the table, which rows have Paul H. as director beyond S1.\n\nAt row6: no57? Wait let's see:\n\nWait from the initial data, the 14th row (row13) is no61, directed by Paul H., so that would be Season6.\n\nSo:\n\nPaul H. directs in S1:47,48,49\n\nIn S2:53\n\nNo, wait S2 starts at53, but check if any of those are directed by Paul H.\n\nLooking through the rows beyond row3:\n\nFor example, row13 is no61, directed by Paul H., which is S6.\n\nSo in between, at say row9 (no55), not Paul H. Row10:57, someone else.\n\nWait no, let me get a better approach.\n\nI'll list all no_in_series where directed_by=Paul H.:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 47: S1\n\n-48:S1\n\n-49:S1\n\nThen next, at row13 (no61): S6\n\nSo between 50 and60, any with Paul H.? Let's check rows.\n\nRow3:50: not Paul H.\n\nRow4:51: someone else.\n\n...\n\nRow12:59, someone else.\n\nRow13:60: no, wait row13 is no61.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake. The 'no_in_series' goes up to 61. So in the table:\n\nLooking for directed_by=Paul H., beyond S1:\n\n- At row13 (the last one), no61, which is S6.\n\nSo Paul H. directs only in S1:47,48,49; then in S7? Wait that can't be because S6 ends at61.\n\nWait perhaps I missed some rows where Paul H. directs beyond S1.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLet's list all directed_by=Paul H. and their no_in_series:\n\nFrom the table, these are rows where 'directed_by' is \"Paul Holahan\":\n\n- Row0:47\n\n-Row1:48\n\n-Row2:49\n\nThen continuing through the rest of the rows:\n\nLooking for any more instances.\n\nWait row14 would be beyond 61, so likely not. Wait no, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the table as provided (though it's not fully visible), but based on initial data, it seems Paul H. directs in S1:47,48,49 and then again in S7? No, that doesn't fit because S6 is up to61.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nEach season starts at 13 more than the previous.\n\nBut actually, looking back, from no_in_series=47 (S1), next season would be +14: 47+14=61, which is S2? That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, each new season may start after a certain number of episodes, but I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe key point is that Paul H. directs:\n\n- In S1: no47,48,49\n\n- Then again in S7: no70 (if any), but since the highest is61, he doesn't direct in higher seasons beyond S6 except for no61, which is S6.\n\nWait no, because no61 is still S6. So perhaps Paul H. only directs in S1 and S6.\n\nBut that would mean:\n\n- 47,48,49:S1\n\n-61:S6\n\nSo two separate instances.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Paul Holahan directed episodes from season 1 to season7\" would be incorrect because he doesn't direct in S2-S5 or S7.\n\nThus, the initial claim is incorrect. Paul H. only directed in S1 and S6.\n\nBut wait, let's check again:\n\nFrom the table, after row2 (no49), do any more rows have Paul H. as director?\n\nYes, at row13: no61.\n\nSo that's another instance.\n\nSo the total episodes directed by Paul H. are:\n\nS1:47,48,49\n\nS6:61\n\nThat's it.\n\nTherefore, the initial claim that he directed from S1 to S7 is wrong because he didn't direct in S2-S5 and only directed in S1 and S6.\n\nSo the user is mistaken in that statement.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that Paul Holahan directed episodes from season 1 through season 7 is incorrect. Based on the analysis, Paul Holahan directed episodes in seasons 1 (episodes 47, 48, 49) and season 6 (episode 61). He did not direct any episodes in seasons 2 through 6 or in season 7.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim that Paul Holahan directed episodes from Season 1 to Season 7 is incorrect.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about an episode is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"episode number 10 of the season have bcw410 as a production code and an air date of september 11 , 2012.\" I need to verify if this information is accurate based on the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, us viewers (million), original air date, and production code. Each row represents an episode with specific details.\n\nThe claim refers to \"episode number 10 of the season.\" In the context of a TV show's season, the \"no in series\" column usually indicates the overall episode number across all seasons, while \"no in season\" would be specific to that particular season. For example, if it's Season 1, Episode 10, then \"no in series\" would likely be higher than 10, but since the table starts at no in series=47 and goes up to 61, it seems like this is a multi-season dataset.\n\nWait, looking closer, each row has both \"no in series\" and \"no in season.\" So \"no in series\" might be the overall episode count across all seasons, while \"no in season\" is per season. For example, in Season 1, Episode 10 would have \"no in series\" as 47 or higher if it's part of a subsequent season.\n\nBut the claim specifies \"episode number 10 of the season.\" So I'm looking for an episode within a specific season where the production code is bcw410 and the air date is September 11, 2012.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one that matches these criteria. Starting from no in series=47 upwards:\n\n- At row 57 (no in series=57), the details are: title=\"family business\", directed by Paul Holahan, production code bcw411, air date January 22, 2013.\n- Next, row 58 is brass tacks with bcw412 and air date January 29, 2013.\n- Then row 59 is empire city with bcw413 and air date February 5, 2013.\n- Row 60 is shoot the moon with bcw414 and air date February 19, 2013.\n- Row 61 is the original with bcw415 and air date February 26, 2013.\n\nWait, I don't see a production code of bcw410 in these rows. Let me check again. Maybe I missed it. Alternatively, perhaps the table doesn't include all episodes up to 10, or maybe the numbering starts later.\n\nLooking back at the earlier rows:\n\n- Row 57 is no in series=57, which might be Season 1, Episode 10 if \"no in season\" goes from 1 upwards. But looking at the \"no in season\" column: row 57 has no in season=11, so it's likely that each season increments after a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for bcw410 specifically. Let me scan through all production codes:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- bcw411 (row 57)\n- bcw412 (58)\n- bcw413 (59)\n- bcw414 (60)\n- bcw415 (61)\n\nNo bcw410 is listed in any of these rows up to row 61. That suggests that either the episode hasn't been included in this table or it's part of a later season not covered here.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to \"episode number 10 of the season.\" If I'm looking for no in season=10, perhaps in an earlier part of the table. Let me check rows from the start:\n\nRow 57: no in series=57, no in season=11\nRow 58: no in season=12\nRow 59: no in season=13\nRow 60: 14\nRow 61:15\n\nSo maybe the table starts at Season 1 with higher numbers. For example, if \"no in season\" is per season, perhaps Season 2 starts at no in series=47.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me think differently. The claim is about episode number 10 of the season. So within a specific season, there should be an episode numbered 10. Each row has \"no in series\" and \"no in season.\" If \"no in season\" increments per season, then for Season X, \"no in series\" would be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps each season starts at a certain point in the \"no in series\" column. For example:\n\n- Season 1: episodes 1-10\n- Season 2: episodes 11-20\n- etc.\n\nBut looking at the table, row 57 has no in series=57 and no in season=11. So if no in season is per season, then no in series would be 10 + number of seasons before it.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps \"no in season\" is the episode number within the season, so for Season X, \"no in season\" ranges from 1 to some number, and \"no in series\" accumulates across all seasons.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for an episode numbered 10 in the season, I need a row where \"no in season\" is 10. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\nRow 47: no in series=47, no in season=1\nRow 48: no in season=2\n...\nRow 56: no in season=9\nRow 57: no in season=10?\n\nWait, that can't be because row 57 has no in season=11. So maybe each row increments \"no in series\" and \"no in season\" together per episode.\n\nSo the first episode of the show would have no in series=1, no in season=1, then next episode no in series=2, no in season=2, etc. But looking at the table, it starts at no in series=47, so perhaps this is a continuation or a different context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"no in series\" refers to the overall episode count across all seasons, and \"no in season\" is per season. So Season 1 has episodes 1-10, Season 2 has 11-20, etc., with each season's episodes having higher no in series numbers.\n\nSo if I'm looking for an episode numbered 10 in its season, it would be somewhere in the first season. But the table starts at no in series=47, which is way beyond that. So perhaps the table doesn't include earlier seasons or only certain episodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"no in series\" is not per overall count but something else.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the better approach is to check for bcw410 and September 11, 2012.\n\nLooking through all production codes: none are bcw410 up to row 61. Therefore, either the episode hasn't been included, or it's in a later season not covered here.\n\nAdditionally, the air date of September 11, 2012 would likely correspond to an earlier part of the table if \"no in series\" starts at 47 around that time.\n\nWait, but without knowing exactly when bcw410 was produced, it's hard to say. However, based on the information given, there is no row with production code bcw410 and air date September 11, 2012.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the episode does not exist in the provided data, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to verify if an episode titled \"episode number 10 of the season\" exists with production code bcw410 and air date September 11, 2012. Upon reviewing the provided table, no such episode was found. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is false.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false because there is no evidence in the provided data of an episode titled \"episode number 10 of the season\" with production code bcw410 and air date September 11, 2012.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about episode number 57 is correct based on the given table. The claim says that episode 57 had 2.75 million US viewers. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to episode 57 in the series. Looking at the \"no in series\" column, each row starts with a number. So row 57 is indeed episode 57. Now, I need to check the specific data for that episode.\n\nNext, I look at the columns relevant to the claim. The claim mentions US viewers, so I should focus on the \"us viewers (million)\" column. In the table, this column has values like 3.21, 2.98, etc., which are in millions. For episode 57, the value is listed as 2.77.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says it's 2.75 million, but the table shows 2.77 million. There's a slight difference here\u20140.02 million viewers apart. That might seem like a small number, but it's still a discrepancy.\n\nSo, does this difference make the claim false? I think so because the numbers don't match exactly. The user is claiming 2.75 million, but the actual figure is 2.77 million. Unless there's a rounding issue or a data entry mistake in the table, which I can't verify here, it seems the claim isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the US viewers for episode 57 are not exactly 2.75 million according to the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 57,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
