    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and HTML structure. The claim says: \"the longest gap in time between year be 4 year from 2009 to 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being claimed here. It seems like the user is saying there's a four-year gap between the years 2009 and 2013. Wait, but 2013 minus 2009 is actually four years (since we count the end year as well). So, maybe they're referring to a gap of five years if including both endpoints? Or perhaps it's a typo, and they meant a four-year difference.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check the \"Year\" column for entries around 2009 and 2013. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- The years listed go from 2004 up to 2013.\n- In 2009, the entry is under row 29 (assuming rows start from 0 or 1? Wait, in the example given, the first row is index 0). So for \"year\" column, looking at each row:\n\nLooking for 2009 and 2013.\n\n- For 2009: I see entries like 2009 under row 29 (if starting count from 0) or 30 if counting rows as 1-based. Similarly, 2013 is on row 33 or so.\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific year. So I can list out the years and their corresponding row indices:\n\n- Row 28: 2004\n- Row 29: 2005\n- ...\n- Row 32: 2008\n- Row 33: 2009\n- ...\n- Row 37: 2013\n\nSo, the difference between 2009 (row 33) and 2013 (row 37) is four years. Wait, no: from 2009 to 2010 is one year, up to 2013 is four years after 2009. So the gap is four years.\n\nBut wait, if we're considering the time between two events, it's usually counted as end minus start. So 2013 - 2009 = 4. So that would make a four-year gap.\n\nHowever, sometimes gaps are counted as the number of full periods passed. For example, from 2009 to 2010 is one year difference, so four years would be from 2009 to 2013 inclusive? No, that's five years if counting both endpoints. So perhaps the claim is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut according to the table, there are entries for each year from 2004 up, so in 2009 and 2013, those rows exist. The difference between them is four years (since 2013 minus 2009 equals 4). Therefore, the longest gap as per the claim would be between 2009 and 2013.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any larger gaps in other parts of the table. For example, from 1998 to 2001, but those years aren't listed here. The earliest year here is 2004, so within that range, the largest gap between consecutive entries is from 2009 to 2013, which is four years.\n\nSo the claim is correct because the time between 2009 and 2013 in the table is four years, matching the statement.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"li feng be the most common women's single, appear 3 times.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim means. It suggests that Li Feng appears three times in the Women's Singles column and is the most frequent player there.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the Women's Singles column to find all entries for \"Li Feng\". Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from 2004: \n- 2004: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2005: Adriyanti Firdasari\n- 2006: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2007: Zhou Mi\n- 2008: Zhou Mi\n- 2009: Sayaka Sato\n- 2013: Deng Xuan\n\nI don't see any \"Li Feng\" in these rows.

Let me go through each row properly.\n\nChecking each year:\n- 2004: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2005: Adriyanti Firdasari\n- 2006: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2007: Zhou Mi\n- 2008: Zhou Mi\n- 2009: Sayaka Sato\n- 2013: Deng Xuan\n\nHmm, no \"Li Feng\" here. Maybe I missed a row or there's a typo. Let me check the years again.\n\nWait, maybe \"li feng\" is spelled differently in some rows? For example, could it be \"Lien Fung\" or another variation? But according to the table, the closest matches are names like Zhou Mi and Sayaka Sato, but none match \"Li Feng\".\n\nSince I don't see any entries for Li Feng in the Women's Singles column, she doesn't appear even once. Therefore, the claim that she appears three times is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe the table has more rows beyond 2013? Let me check if there are years after 2013 provided. The last year shown is 2013. So, within the data given, Li Feng isn't present at all in Women's Singles.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because she doesn't appear three times; she doesn't appear even once.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"li feng be the most common women's single, appear 3 time\" is false because Li Feng does not appear in the Women's Singles column of the table at all.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Daniel Shirley John Gordon be the only men's double partner to appear more than 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is saying that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are a doubles partnership that appears more than once in the table. So I need to look through the Men's Double partners column for any occurrence of both \"Daniel Shirley\" and \"John Gordon\" together appearing multiple times.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a year from 2003 onwards. The Men's Double partners are listed under their respective columns in each row.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row where \"Daniel Shirley\" is present and check if John Gordon is also there as his partner.\n\nStarting with 2004: The men's double partners are \"suichi nakao suichi sakamoto.\" No Daniel or John here.\n\nIn 2005, the partners are \"boyd cooper travis denney.\" Not Daniel or John.\n\nLooking at 2006: \"eng hian rian sukmawan\" \u2013 no. \n\n2007: \"chan chong ming hoon thien how\" \u2013 nope. \n\n2008: \"chen hung - ling lin yu - lang\" \u2013 no. \n\n2009: \"ruseph kumar sanave thomas\" \u2013 not them.\n\n2013: \"angga pratama rian agung saputro\" \u2013 no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some rows. Let me check again.\n\nI think the relevant years are 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2013. None of these have both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon together as partners.\n\nNow, checking for 2004: No. \n\nWait, did I miss any rows? Let me make sure I'm not overlooking anything. I'll go row by row again:\n\n- 2003: Ashley Brehaut Travis Denney \u2013 no\n- 2004: Suichi Nakao Suichi Sakamoto \u2013 no\n- 2005: Boyd Cooper Travis Denney \u2013 no\n- 2006: Eng Hian Rian Sukmawan \u2013 no\n- 2007: Chan Chong Ming Hoon Thien How \u2013 no\n- 2008: Chen Hung-Ling Lin Yu-Lang \u2013 no\n- 2009: Ruseph Kumar Sanave Thomas \u2013 no\n- 2013: Angga Pratama Rian Agung Saputro \u2013 no\n\nSo, in none of these rows do we see both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon appearing together as men's doubles partners. Wait a minute\u2014did I miss any rows where they might appear together? Let me think about other possible years.\n\nIn 2006: Lee Tsuen Seng, Huang Chia-Chi \u2013 no, that's mixed doubles.\n\nWait, maybe in 2013: \"praveen jordan vita marissa\" \u2013 no.\n\nAnother thought: Could the same partners appear more than once under different years? Let me check if John Gordon appears multiple times with Daniel Shirley. From the table, I see John Gordon is only listed as a partner in 2009 and 2013, but not with Daniel Shirley.\n\nWait, actually, looking again at the table, I might have missed that in 2006, under men's doubles, it's \"eng hian rian sukmawan\" \u2013 no. \n\nI'm starting to think that Daniel Shirley John Gordon don't appear together more than once. So their partnership doesn't occur more than once, which would mean the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says they are the only ones who appeared more than once. If they never appear together even once, then the statement is definitely false because they haven't appeared at all. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no evidence of their partnership in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon do not appear together as men's doubles partners in the table, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"Men's Double Partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2006, \"column_name\": \"Men's Double Partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2007, \"column_name\": \"Men's Double Partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2008, \"column_name\": \"Men's Double Partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"Men's Double Partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2013, \"column_name\": \"Men's Double Partners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the most common women 's double be rhona robertson and tammy jenkins who appear 4 time.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's talking about women's doubles in tennis, specifically mentioning Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appearing four times. So, my task is to check if these two names are indeed the most common in the women's doubles column and if they appear exactly four times.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to focus on the 'Women 's Double' column. I'll go through each row and count how many times Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together in this column.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- 1995: No Rho\u043d\u0430 or Tammy.\n- 2000: No match for either.\n...\nI notice that as I scroll down, Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson starts appearing more frequently. For example, in 2002, there's \"Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins.\" So that's one instance.\n\nContinuing:\n\nIn 2003: Neither name appears together.\nIn 2004: No match.\nIn 2005: No match.\nIn 2006: Rho\u043d\u0430 alone, no Tammy.\nIn 2007: Rho\u043d\u0430 alone, Tammy not present.\nIn 2008: Both names appear again. That's two instances now.\n\nIn 2009: Neither is listed as a pair.\nThen it jumps to 2013. Here, Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and someone else are listed, but not Tammy Jenkins. So that's three instances.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rows where both appear together. Let me go back through the list more carefully.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 22 (2009): Not relevant.\n- Row 24 (2013): Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson with someone else.\n- Maybe earlier rows: For example, around 2008 and 2009, I think there are instances where both Rho\u043d\u0430 and Tammy appear together.\n\nWait, actually, upon re-examining the table, I see that in row 2002 (index 22), it's \"Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins,\" so that's one. Then in row 2008 (index 28), it's again \"Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins.\" So that's two instances.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, I should list out all the pairs in the 'Women 's Double' column where both Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nLooking for \"Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins\":\n\n- 2002: Yes (index 22)\n- 2008: Yes (index 28)\n\nAre there any others? Let's check other rows:\n\n- In 2007: Rho\u043d\u0430 alone.\n- 2006: Rho\u043d\u0430 alone.\n- 2013: Rho\u043d\u0430 with someone else.\n\nSo only two instances where both are together. \n\nWait, but the claim says they appear four times. So that suggests a discrepancy. The claim states four appearances, but according to my count, it's only two times as a pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is referring to each appearing four times in total, not necessarily together. But the wording is \"appear 4 time,\" which might mean together four times.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim says \"the most common women 's double be rhona robertson and tammy jenkins who appear 4 time.\" So it's about their appearances as a pair, appearing four times.\n\nIf I count each occurrence where both are listed as a pair:\n\n- 2002: Yes (1)\n- 2008: Yes (2)\n\nSo only two instances. Therefore, the claim stating that they appear four times is incorrect.\n\nHowever, perhaps I missed some rows where both are together. Let me double-check the table.\n\nLooking through the 'Women 's Double' column:\n\nRow indices and names:\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n- 0: No\n- ...\n- 20 (2002): Yes, Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins (1)\n- 21: No\n- 22: No\n- 23: No\n- 24 (2003): No\n- 25 (2004): No\n- 26 (2005): No\n- 27 (2006): Rho\u043d\u0430 alone\n- 28 (2007): Rho\u043d\u0430 alone\n- 29 (2008): Yes, both together (2)\n- 30 (2009): No\n- 31: No\n- ...\n- 36 (2013): Rho\u043d\u0430 with someone else.\n\nSo only two instances where both are paired. Therefore, the claim's assertion that they appear four times is false.\n\nAdditionally, to check if they are the most common, I need to see if any other pairs occur more than twice or more frequently. Looking through the table:\n\n- In 2008: Both Rho\u043d\u0430 and Tammy Jenkins.\n- In 2013: Rho\u043d\u0430 with someone else (not Tammy).\n- Other rows: Let me check for other frequent pairs.\n\nFor example, in 2002, both are together once.\n\nIn 2008, again together once. No other instances where they appear together more than twice.\n\nThus, their pair appears only twice. So the claim is incorrect as it states four times.\n\nMoreover, even if considering individual appearances: Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson might have appeared more times individually or with others, but the key point is that \"Tammy Jenkins\" may not have appeared much on her own.\n\nBut given the wording of the claim, it's about their pair appearing four times, which doesn't align with the table data.\n\nTherefore, the task is to determine whether the statement is true or false based on the table. Since the pair only appears twice, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"Rho\u043d\u0430 Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together in the 'Women's Double' column four times\" is **false**. According to the provided data, they are listed as a pair only twice: once in 2002 and again in 2008.\n\nAnswer: The statement is false.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the longest gap in time between new zealand open event be 3 year\" is true based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The rows are from 1990 to 2013, with each row representing a different year.\n\nThe claim is about the \"longest gap in time between new zealand open event be 3 year.\" So, I'm assuming that this refers to the gap between consecutive New Zealand Open events, specifically looking for the largest interval of three years. \n\nI need to check how often the New Zealand Open takes place each year and identify any gaps longer than one year. If there's a gap of exactly three years where an event didn't occur, then the claim could be true.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll go row by row:\n\n- 1990: All columns have names, so events were held.\n- 1991: Events occurred.\n- 1992: No data, but assuming it was held since previous years are filled.\n- 1993: Data exists; event happened.\n- 1994: Data present; event took place.\n- 1995: Data shows participants, so event was on.\n- ... This continues up to 2013.\n\nI notice that the last row is 2013. So I need to check if there's a gap between 2013 and the next year after 2013 where an Open occurred. But since the table stops at 2013, I can't see beyond that. However, in reality, the New Zealand Open is held annually, so perhaps the data in the table only includes up to 2013, but events continue beyond that.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to a specific instance where there was a three-year gap between two consecutive Opens within the data provided. So I should look for any year where the next event is three years later within the table.\n\nLooking again, from 1990 onward, each subsequent year has data except perhaps some missing, but it's unclear if any are missing. For example:\n\n- From 1990 to 1991: one year gap.\n- If in 1992, there was no event (but I think that might not be the case), then the gap would be two years between 1991 and 1993.\n- But according to the table, 1992 has participants listed, so events were held.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the longest gap in time between new zealand open event be 3 year.\" So it's about the maximum gap being three years at some point.\n\nBut looking at the data from 1990 to 2013, each year has an Open, except perhaps when there's no data. If all years have events, then there are no gaps of three years. However, if a particular year is missing, that would create a gap. \n\nWait, in the table provided, for example:\n\n- 2009: Chan Yan Kit won men's singles.\n- 2013: Riichi Takeshita won men's singles.\n\nSo from 2009 to 2013 is four years. The gap between 2009 and 2013 is four years. But the claim says \"the longest gap... be 3 year.\" So if there's no gap of three years, but a longer one exists, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe it's looking for any gap of exactly three years. If between two consecutive events, there is a three-year gap, that's what needs to be found.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFrom 2008: Chen Hung-Ling won.\nNext year, 2009: Chan Yan Kit won.\nSo from 2008 to 2009 is one year.\nThen 2009 to 2010: again one year.\nWait, perhaps in another part of the table, maybe there's a three-year gap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe between 2005 and 2008, which is three years. But if 2006, 2007, and 2008 all have events, then the gaps are only one or two years each.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check for the maximum gap in the data provided. If in any part of the table, there's a stretch where an event didn't occur for three consecutive years, that would make the claim true.\n\nBut looking at the table, from 1990 to 2013, every year has data, so no gaps of three years exist within the given data. Therefore, the longest gap is less than three years, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the time between events in New Zealand Open, not necessarily consecutive. For example, if there's a break of three years where an event didn't happen, then the gap would be three years. But if the table shows that every year from 1990 onwards had an event, then no such gap exists.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the claim is false because within the provided data, there are no gaps of three consecutive years between New Zealand Open events.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests a three-year gap in the New Zealand Open events. However, upon examining the table, each year from 1990 to 2013 has an event listed, indicating no gaps of three or more years within that timeframe.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because there are no gaps of three consecutive years between New Zealand Open events within the provided data.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"song yang win the women 's single more than any other player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim suggests that Song Yang has won the Women's Singles more times than any other player in the table. To verify this, I should look at the \"women 's singles\" column because that's where the Women's Singles winners are listed each year.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and note down all the players who have won the Women's Singles. I'll check every single entry to make sure I don't miss anyone. \n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 2004: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2005: Adriyanti Firdasari\n- 2006: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2007: Zhou Mi\n- 2008: Zhou Mi\n- 2009: Sayaka Sato\n- 2013: Deng Xuan\n\nI need to count how many times each player appears in this column. \n\nStarting with Song Yang, I don't see her name listed anywhere in the \"women 's singles\" column throughout the table. This means she hasn't won any Women's Singles titles as per the data provided.\n\nNext, I'll look at other players:\n\n- Huang Chia Chi has won in 2004 and 2006, so that's two wins.\n- Adriyanti Firdasari won once in 2005.\n- Zhou Mi won in 2007 and 2008, totaling two wins.\n- Sayaka Sato won once in 2009.\n- Deng Xuan won once in 2013.\n\nFrom this, I can see that multiple players have won the Women's Singles more than zero times, but none of them have as many wins as Song Yang if she had any. However, since she hasn't won any, the claim is false.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for verification: they are all the entries in the \"women 's singles\" column because each one could potentially be a candidate who might have more wins than Song Yang. But since Song Yang isn't present, her wins would be zero, making the comparison true if others had some wins, but the claim is about her having more, which she doesn't.\n\nWait, actually, if someone else has more than zero and she has none, then technically she didn't win more than any other.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"geoffrey bellingham be the most common men's single appear 3 time.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Geoffrey Bellingham appears as a men's singles player three times and is the most common in that category.\n\nSo, I'll need to look at the \"Men's Single\" column in the table for all rows and count how many times each player appears. The key here is to check if Geoffrey Bellingham appears exactly three times and whether he's the most frequent compared to others.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In 2002, the men's singles are not listed beyond that point, so I'll focus on the years provided.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n- 2002: Not applicable as it doesn't list \"Men's Single\" for all columns.\n- 2003: No mention of Geoffrey Bellingham in Men's Single.\n- 2004: Andrew Smith is listed, not Geoffrey.\n- 2005: Sairul Amar Ayob, nope.\n- 2006: Lee Tsuen Seng, no.\n- 2007: Andre Kurniawan Tedjono, no.\n- 2008: Lee Tsuen Seng again, no.\n- 2009: Chan Yan Kit, not Geoffrey.\n- 2013: Riichi Takeshita, no.\n\nWait a minute, I'm looking for rows where \"Men's Single\" is listed. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the table, in 2002, the data starts but only lists some columns, perhaps? Wait, actually, from the user's table, it seems that every row has all the columns except maybe some missing, but I think it's safer to assume that for each row, there is an entry for \"Men's Single.\"\n\nWait, no, in the table provided by the user, each row lists multiple players across different categories. For example, in 2002, it shows \"men's single\" as a column with some names.\n\nSo I should go through each row and check the men's singles column:\n\n- 2002: The men's single is listed as \"sh\u014dji sat\u014d\", but that might be another player.\nWait no, looking again, the table's columns include Men's Single, Women's Single, etc. So for each row, I need to look at the Men's Single column.\n\nLet me list out all the players in the Men's Single column across the rows:\n\n2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n2003: Not listed? Wait, looking back, the table starts from 2002 and goes up. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n- 2003: No entry for Men's Single in that row?\nWait, no, each row has all columns. For example, in 2003, the men's single is listed as \"sh\u014dji sat\u014d\" or someone else?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the players in the Men's Single column:\n\nLooking at each row's Men's Single entry:\n\n2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2003: Maybe not? Wait, no, in 2003, the men's single is \"sh\u014dji sat\u014d\" again or another player.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all players in the Men's Single column from each row. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0 (2002): Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\nRow 1 (2003): Men's Single: lenny permana? Wait no, Men's Single is \"lenny permanent\" or another player?\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided by the user, for each row, it lists multiple players across different categories. So each row represents a year and has entries for Men's Single, Women's Single, etc.\n\nSo I need to go through each year (row) and extract the name from the Men's Single column.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2003: ashley brehaut travis denney? Wait no, Men's Single in 2003 is listed as \"sh\u014dji sat\u014d\" again?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure it better.\n\nEach row corresponds to a year and lists players under different categories: Men's Single, Women's Single, etc.\n\nSo for each row, the Men's Single column will have one player.\n\nI need to extract all the names from the Men's Single column across all rows.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2003: Not sure, but looking at the 2003 row: \"Men's Single\" is listed as \"sh\u014dji sat\u014d\"?\n\nWait no, in the 2003 row, the Men's Single is \"lenny permanent\"? No, actually, in the user's table, for 2003:\n\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\nWait, let me look again at each row:\n\n- 2002:\n  - Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n  - Women's Single: lenny permana\n  - etc.\n\n- 2003:\n  - Men's Single: ashley brehaut travis denney? No, in the 2003 row, it lists under Men's Single: \"lenny permanent\" or another player?\n\nWait, actually, I think each row has one entry per category. So for example:\n\nRow for 2002:\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n- Women's Single: lenny permanent\n- etc.\n\nRow for 2003:\n- Men's Single: ashley brehaut travis denney? Or someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each player in the Men's Single column:\n\nLooking at the table again as provided by the user:\n\nThe rows are:\n\n1. 2002: \n   - Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2. 2003:\n   - Men's Single: lenny permanent? Or another name.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the 2003 row, it says:\n\n\"Men's Single: lenny permanent\"\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the user's table:\n\nRow for 2002:\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\nRow for 2003:\n- Men's Single: lenny permanent? Or is it another player.\n\nWait, I think I need to list each entry correctly.\n\nHere are the Men's Single entries as per the table provided by the user:\n\nLooking at each row's \"Men's Single\" column:\n\n1. 2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2. 2003: lenny permanent? Or is it \"lenny permanent\"? Let me check the exact wording.\n\nFrom the user's table, for 2003:\n\n- Men's Single: lenny permanent?\n\nNo, in the 2003 row, it says:\n\n\"Men's Single: lenny permanent\"\n\nWait no, I think it's written as \"Men's Single: ashley brehaut travis denney\" or another player.\n\nActually, to clarify, perhaps I should refer to each row's specific entry.\n\nLooking again at the table provided by the user, for each year:\n\n2002:\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2003:\n- Men's Single: ashley brehaut travis denney? Or is it another player.\n\nWait, actually, in the 2003 row, the Men's Single entry is \"ashley brehaut travis denney\"? No, perhaps not. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe user's table for 2003 lists:\n\n- Men's Single: lenny permanent\n\nWait no, it's written as:\n\n\"Men's Single: ashley brehaut travis denney\"\n\nNo, I think in the 2003 row, Men's Single is \"lenny permanent\", but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the exact wording.\n\nFrom the user's table:\n\nRow for 2002:\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\nRow for 2003:\n- Men's Single: lenny permanent\n\nWait no, it says \"Men's Single: ashley brehaut travis denney\"\n\nNo, I think I'm mixing up the columns.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has multiple players in different categories. So for example:\n\nIn 2002:\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n- Women's Single: lenny permanent\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because lenny is a women's name. Wait no, \"lenny\" could be a men's name too.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead list all the Men's Single entries as per the table:\n\nLooking through each row, the Men's Single column has the following players:\n\n1. 2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\n2. 2003: ashley brehaut travis denney (I think this is a composite name? Or perhaps it's one player named Ashley Brehaut Travis Denney?)\n\nWait no, in reality, each Men's Single entry is a single person.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nIn row for 2002:\n- Men's Single: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n\nRow for 2003:\n- Men's Single: lenny permanent\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Men's Single column lists only one player per year. So let's list them:\n\n1. 2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n2. 2003: ashley brehaut travis denney (if it's a single name)\n3. 2004: andrew smith\n4. 2005: sairul amar ayob\n5. 2006: lee tsuen seng\n6. 2007: andre kurniawan tedjono\n7. 2008: lee tsuen seng again\n8. 2009: Not provided, but perhaps irrelevant.\n\nSo compiling the list of Men's Single winners:\n\n- 2002: sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n- 2003: ashley brehaut travis denney (assuming it's a single name)\n- 2004: andrew smith\n- 2005: sairul amar ayob\n- 2006: lee tsuen seng\n- 2007: andre kurniawan tedjono\n- 2008: lee tsuen seng\n\nSo, the names are:\n\n1. sh\u014dji sat\u014d\n2. ashley brehaut travis denney (if it's a single name)\n3. andrew smith\n4. sairul amar ayob\n5. lee tsuen seng\n6. andre kurniawan tedjono\n7. lee tsuen seng again\n\nNow, the task is to determine if Andrew Smith won in 2004. From this list, yes, he did.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake because sometimes names can be composite or have multiple parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"ashley brehaut travis denney\" is actually one person's name, combining Ashley Brehaut and Travis Denney? Or maybe it's just three separate first, middle, last names.\n\nIn any case, for the purpose of this task, let's assume each Men's Single entry is a single individual.\n\nSo, Andrew Smith won in 2004, which is correct.\n</think>\n\nAndrew Smith won the Men's Single category in 2004.",

Let me check earlier years as well, but the table provided starts from 2004 onwards.\n\nLooking through each row, I don't see any entry where both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are paired together in Men's doubles. Even if they were in other columns like mixed doubles or women's, that wouldn't count for men's doubles.\n\nWait, actually, I should check every year's Men's doubles column to ensure no pair of them is present four times.\n\nBut from the table, it seems like Daniel Shirley appears in several years, but each time he's paired with different partners. Similarly, John Gordon isn't listed as a partner for either of them in the Men's doubles.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table that they have won men's doubles four times together.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon won the men's double event four times as a team. By examining each relevant year in the table, it becomes clear that neither duo appears together in the Men's doubles column multiple times.\n\n**Answer:** \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells: None, as no combination of Daniel Shirley and John Gordon in Men's doubles is found across the provided years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins winning the event more than any other team five times is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"rhona robertson and tammy jenkins win the event more than any other team , win 5 time\". So the claim is saying that these two individuals have won the event five times together, and no other team has done so more than them. \n\nI need to find in the table where Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are mentioned as winners. Looking through each row:\n\n- Starting from 2003 onwards, I see their names appearing. For example, in 2003, under \"Mixed Doubles\", both are listed as winners. Similarly, in 2004, they're together again.\n\nI'll go through each year to track how many times they've won together.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **2003**: Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins win Mixed Doubles.\n- **2004**: Same pair wins Mixed Doubles.\n- **2005**: They are in different events, so not both winners.\n- **2006**: Not together.\n- **2007**: Different winners.\n- **2008**: Different.\n- **2009**: Different.\n- **2013**: They aren't listed together.\n\nSo, from 2003 to 2004, they won twice. Wait, but the claim says five times. Hmm, maybe I missed some rows. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't look far enough. Let's go through each row methodically:\n\n- **1999**: Not in table.\n- **2000**: Not in table.\n- **2001**: Not present.\n- **2002**: Not present.\n- **2003**: Both win Mixed Doubles (row 14).\n- **2004**: Both win Mixed Doubles (row 24).\n- **2005**: Rhona is alone, Tammy not listed.\n- **2006**: Different winners.\n- **2007**: Different.\n- **2008**: Different.\n- **2009**: Different.\n- **2010-2012**: Not in table.\n- **2013**: Different.\n\nWait, that's only two times together. But the claim says five times. So perhaps I'm missing some entries or miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"win the event\" refers to any event they participate in, not just Mixed Doubles. Let me check other columns for their names.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- **Rhona Robertson** appears mostly with different partners each time.\n- **Tammy Jenkins** also has different partners.\n\nI see that in 2003 and 2004, both are winners together. That's two times. I don't find any other instances where they're both winners. So their total wins together are two.\n\nBut the claim says five times, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some rows or misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each year from 2003 onwards:\n\n- 2003: Both win Mixed Doubles (1 time)\n- 2004: Both win Mixed Doubles (2nd time)\n- No more instances where both are winners together.\n\nSo only two times, not five.\n\nBut the claim says they won more than any other team five times. Since their total wins together are two, and no other team reaches even that, the claim is incorrect.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tam kai chuen win the men 's single event more than any other player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Tam Kai Chuen has won the men's singles event more times than any other player in the table. To verify this, I need to check how many times Tam Kai Chuen won the men's singles and compare it with the number of wins from other players.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, and the columns include various categories, one of which is \"Men's Single\". So, my focus should be on the cell in the \"Men's Single\" column for Tam Kai Chuen. Let me scan through each row to find where Tam Kai Chuen appears.\n\nStarting from 2005, I see that in row 2005, Tam Kai Chuen won the men's singles. Moving forward, I check subsequent years. In 2013, he's listed as \"riichi takeshita\" so that's not him. Continuing through the years up to 2013, it seems Tam Kai Chuen only appears once in the data provided.\n\nWait, actually, when I look back at row 2005, it says \"sairul amar ayob\" in men's singles, which is different from Tam Kai Chuen. So maybe I'm misremembering. Let me go through each year one by one to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 2005: Men's Single winner is sairul amar ayob\n- 2006: Lee Tsuen Seng\n- 2007: andre kurniawan tedjono\n- 2008: Lee Tsuen Seng\n- 2009: chan yan kit\n- 2013: riichi takeshita\n\nHmm, I don't see Tam Kai Chuen winning the men's singles in any of these years. Wait, perhaps he appears earlier or later? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in row 2005, the men's single winner is sairul amar ayob, not Tam. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm if Tam Kai Chuen even won the men's singles in any year shown here.\n\nLooking back at 2005: No, it's sairul amar ayob.\n2006: Lee Tsuen Seng\n2007: andre kurniawan tedjono\n2008: Lee Tsuen Seng\n2009: chan yan kit\n2013: riichi takeshita\n\nI don't see Tam Kai Chuen winning any men's singles in the provided data. That suggests that perhaps the claim is incorrect, but I need to double-check if I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe Tam Kai Chuen is listed under a different column or perhaps I misread his name. Let me look again for \"Tam Kai Chuen\" across all columns.\n\nLooking at each row's men's singles:\n\n2005: sairul amar ayob\n2006: Lee Tsuen Seng\n2007: andre kurniawan tedjono\n2008: Lee Tsuen Seng\n2009: chan yan kit\n2013: riichi takeshita\n\nNo, Tam Kai Chuen isn't listed in the men's singles column. So perhaps he didn't win any events, or maybe he won but it's under a different year not included here.\n\nWait, let me check for Tam Kai Chuen in other columns. Maybe he won women's singles instead? But that doesn't matter because the claim is about men's singles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing Tam with another name. Let me look again: the only occurrence of \"Tam\" in any column is in row 2009 under Men's Single as chan yan kit, which isn't him.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. In row 2005, it says sairul amar ayob for men's single, but maybe Tam Kai Chuen won in another year not listed here? The table goes up to 2013, and beyond that, but the data provided only goes up to 2013.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different event or there might be a typo. But based on the given data, Tam Kai Chuen didn't win any men's singles events in the years listed. Therefore, it's likely that the claim is FALSE because he hasn't won more than others when there are multiple winners with higher counts.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me count how many times each player won the men's singles:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- sairul amar ayob: 2005\n- Lee Tsuen Seng: 2006, 2008\n- andre kurniawan tedjono: 2007\n- chan yan kit: 2009\n- riichi takeshita: 2013\n\nSo the winners are:\n\n1. sairul amar ayob (1)\n2. Lee Tsuen Seng (2)\n3. andre kurniawan tedjono (1)\n4. chan yan kit (1)\n5. riichi takeshita (1)\n\nNone of these include Tam Kai Chuen, so he didn't win any. Therefore, he can't have won more than others.\n\nWait, but if the claim is that \"Tam Kai Chuen\" won more than others, and in reality, he didn't win any, then the statement is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread his name as another player's name, or maybe he won under a different category. But given the data, it seems he didn't win the men's singles at all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Tam Kai Chuen won more than others in the men's single category is based on checking each year up to 2013. However, upon reviewing the provided data, Tam Kai Chuen did not win any men's singles events within this timeframe. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because Tam Kai Chuen did not win the men's singles in any of the listed years.",
