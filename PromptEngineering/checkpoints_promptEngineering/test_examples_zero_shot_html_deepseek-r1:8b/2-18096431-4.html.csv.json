    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says, \"the player with 66 points have the first place.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There's a column called \"score\" and another called \"to par.\" The claim mentions \"66 points,\" which likely refers to the score column because that's where numerical values are listed. So I need to find the row(s) where the score is 66.\n\nLooking through each row in the table:\n\n1. The first row has a score of 66 for Kenny Perry from the United States.\n2. The next rows have scores like 67, 68, etc., but none repeat 66 again.\n\nSo, there's only one player with a score of 66, which is Kenny Perry in the first row (row_index: 0).\n\nNow, I need to check if this player is in first place. In golf tournaments, rankings are often based on scores where lower is better, but sometimes it's about being tied or leading. The term \"place\" in the table uses terms like t1, t2, t4, etc., which likely stands for tied positions.\n\nWait, looking at the \"place\" column: the first row has a place value of 1, which indicates first place. So Kenny Perry is indeed in first place with a score of 66.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the player with 66 points is in first place is true because Kenny Perry's score is 66 and his place is listed as 1.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Kenny Perry has a score of 66 and is placed at position 1. This verifies the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells in the table support this claim. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"Phil Mickelson from the United State have a score of 67.\" Wait, actually, I think there might be a typo here. It says \"from the united state,\" but earlier in the table, Phil Mickelson is listed as being from the \"united states\" with a capital 's'. Maybe that's just a formatting difference, so I'll go with that.\n\nNext, I need to check the table provided. The table has several columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. So, for Phil Mickelson, I should look for his name in the player column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has Kenny Perry from the US with a score of 66.\n2. The second row is Steve Elkington from Australia with 67.\n3. Third row: Phil Mickelson from the United States with 67.\n4. Mark Brooks and others follow, but they have higher scores.\n\nSo Phil Mickelson's row has a score of 67. That matches the claim.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The player column is where his name appears. Looking at the table structure, each row has the player in the second <td>. So, for Phil Mickelson, that would be row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed: first row is 0, so third row is index 2).\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Column \"player\" at row_index 2.\n- Also, the score column might be relevant to check if his score is indeed 67. So column \"score\" at row_index 2.\n\nTherefore, I need to include both of these in relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because Phil Mickelson's score is indeed 67 according to the table. The relevant cells are where his name and score are listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"t2 be the place for a 66 score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It's saying that in the second place (t2), there's a player who scored 66. So I need to check the 'place' and 'score' columns for t2 entries.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'place' which is either a number like 1 or t2, t4, etc., followed by the player's name and their score. The relevant columns here are 'place' and 'score'.\n\nSo I should look for any rows where 'place' is t2 and 'score' is 66.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: place is 1, score is 66. But the claim is about t2, so this doesn't apply.\n2. Second row: place is t2, player is Steve Elkington, score is 67. Not 66, so no match here.\n3. Third row: place is t2, player is Phil Mickelson, score is 67 again. Still not 66.\n\nWait, none of the t2 rows have a score of 66. The only person with a 66 is Kenny Perry in first place. So the claim that t2 has a 66 is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, about relevant cells: The 'place' column for t2 rows and the 'score' column to check if it's 66. So I need to list the row indices where 'place' is t2 and 'score' is not 66 because they don't support the claim.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row index 1 (second row) has place t2, score 67.\n- Row index 2 (third row) also has place t2, score 67.\n\nSo the relevant cells are these two rows because they show that t2 doesn't have a 66 score. Hence, their columns 'place' and 'score' are the ones to include in relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says, \"the united state have a 67 score by greg norman.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a player with their details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: \"the united state\" (which might be a typo for \"United States\") having a 67 score, and that this score is achieved by Greg Norman.\n\nStarting with the country part, I'll scan through each row's country column to see if any player from the United States has a score of 67. Alternatively, since the claim says \"the united state,\" which is probably a mistake, maybe it refers to the USA. So I'll look for players from the USA with a 67.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Kenny Perry from the US, score 66.\n- Row 1: Steve Elkington from Australia, score 67. Not US.\n- Row 2: Phil Mickelson from the US, score 67.\n- Then rows 3-10 have other players with scores of 68.\n\nSo Phil Mickelson is a US player with a score of 67. Now, does Greg Norman have a 67 in the table?\n\nLooking through each row's player column:\n\n- Row 0: Kenny Perry\n- Row1: Steve Elkington\n- Row2: Phil Mickelson\n- Rows3-10 include Mark Brooks, Russ Cochran, Joel Edwards, Lee Janzen, Greg Norman, Nick Price, Ian Woosnam.\n\nWait, Greg Norman is in row7 (assuming rows are 0-based or not). Let me count:\n\nThe first row after Kenny Perry is Steve Elkington (row1), then Phil Mickelson (row2), Mark Brooks (row3), and so on. So row6 would be Greg Norman, as per the table: \n\nRow indices start from 0. Let's see:\n\n- Row0: Kenny Perry\n- Row1: Steve Elkington\n- Row2: Phil Mickelson\n- Row3: Mark Brooks\n- Row4: Russ Cochran\n- Row5: Joel Edwards\n- Row6: Lee Janzen\n- Row7: Greg Norman\n- Row8: Nick Price\n- Row9: Ian Woosnam\n\nSo Greg Norman is in row7. His score is 68, as per the table (td value). So he scored 68, not 67.\n\nWait, but the claim says that \"the united state have a 67 score by greg norman.\" So according to the table, Greg Norman's score is 68, not 67. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread. The player Greg Norman is in row7, with a score of 68 (td value). So he doesn't have a 67.\n\nSo the claim is false because Greg Norman's score isn't 67 but 68.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"the united state,\" which might be a typo for \"United States.\" But even if we consider that, there are multiple US players with 67: Phil Mickelson in row2 and Steve Elkington from Australia actually has 67 but he's not US. Wait no, Steve is from Australia, so only Phil Mickelson in the US has 67.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the united state\" which might be referring to the USA having a score of 67 by Greg Norman. But since Greg didn't score 67, it's false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row again for Greg Norman and his score.\n\nYes, in row7, Greg Norman has a score of 68. So he didn't have a 67.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Greg Norman's score isn't 67.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the united state\" has a 67 score by Greg Norman. Upon examining the table, we see that Greg Norman scored 68, not 67. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
