    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the friendly competition on 26 may 1999 take place at lugo , emilia - romagna.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into key parts:\n\n1. **Event Type**: Friendly competition\n2. **Date**: 26 May 1999\n3. **Location**: Lugo, Emilia-Romagna\n\nNext, I'll look through the table to find any rows that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: goal, date, venue, result, competition, scored.\n\nI need to check each row to see if it has a friendly competition on 26 May 1999 in Lugo, Emilia-Romagna.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row based on date:\n\n- **Row 17**: Date is 26 May 1999. Venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna\". Competition is \"friendly\". So this matches all the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n  \nOther rows with dates around that time:\n- Row 18: 22 August 1999, different date and venue.\n- Rows before 17 are either earlier or not friendly competitions.\n\nSo only row 17 fits. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"lugo , emilia - romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 may 1999 and the result be 2 - 4.\" So I need to check if there's a match in the table that meets all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns are: goal, date, venue, result, competition, and scored. \n\nI'll start by identifying the key points from the claim:\n1. Venue: \"lugo , emilia - romagna\"\n2. Competition: friendly\n3. Date: 26 May 1999\n4. Result: 2 - 4\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to see if any match all these conditions.\n\nStarting from the top, most entries are related to the 1995 UEFA Championship Qual, which doesn't fit the competition type \"friendly.\" Let's skip those and look for the ones labeled as \"friendly.\"\n\nLooking further down:\n- Row 17: venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna,\" date is 26 May 1999. The competition is \"friendly.\" So this seems relevant.\n- The result here is 1 - 4, not 2 - 4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, the claim says the result should be 2 - 4, but in the table, row 17 has a result of 1 - 4 for the friendly match on 26 May 1999 at \"lugo , emilia - romagna.\" So this doesn't match all the criteria.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other rows that fit. The next entry is row 18, which is another friendly match but on a different date and venue. Row 24 is an Algarve Cup match, not friendly. Rows 25, 26, etc., don't mention \"lugo\" either.\n\nSo, none of the matches in the table have all the criteria specified in the claim. The closest is row 17, but it doesn't match the result. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
