    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"During the 1993 Minnesota Viking season, there were two weeks in which the team did not play.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game played by the Vikings during the 1993 season.\n\nI'll start by checking if the team had games on weeks where they didn't play. The claim suggests that in two specific weeks, there were no games. To verify this, I need to identify which weeks are missing from the table and then check if those weeks are indeed not present.\n\nLooking at the 'week' column, the values listed are 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. I notice that some weeks are missing: 3,7,19. Wait, no, the table goes up to week 18 but skips some numbers. Let me list all the weeks present:\n\nWeeks 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nSo, missing weeks are 3,7,19. Wait, week 19 isn't in the table either. But the season probably only has 18 weeks? Or maybe more. I think the NFL season typically has 16 games, but sometimes teams have bye weeks where they don't play. So, the Vikings might have had some bye weeks not listed as games.\n\nNow, let's check for two weeks where they didn't play. From the table, the missing weeks are week 3 and week 7. Wait, no, looking again: the weeks go from 1 to 18, but in the table, the highest is week 18, so perhaps there were games up to week 18.\n\nWait, the initial list of weeks in the table includes weeks 1,2,4,5,6,8,... up to 18. So, missing weeks are 3,7,19? But wait, week 19 isn't even part of the season; maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me count: from week 1 to week 18, the weeks present in the table are:\n\nWeeks 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. So that's 16 weeks. Therefore, missing weeks would be 3,7,19? Wait, but week 19 isn't a standard part of the season. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the table skips some weeks because those were bye weeks where the Vikings didn't play. So, looking for two such weeks. From the list above, the missing weeks in terms of sequence are:\n\nWeeks 1,2,4 (so week 3 is missing), then week 5 follows, so week 7 is also missing. Wait, let's see:\n\nAfter week 2 comes week 4, meaning week 3 is a bye. Then after week 6 comes week 8, so week 7 is another bye. So that's two weeks where the Vikings didn't play: week 3 and week 7.\n\nTherefore, there are at least two weeks in the 1993 season where the Vikings did not play. This supports the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by counting the number of games in the table. The table has 18 rows, but each row is a game. So if they played 16 games (weeks 1-2,4-6,8-18), that's 16 weeks. Therefore, two bye weeks are missing: week 3 and week 7.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there were indeed two weeks where the Vikings didn't play.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Week\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Week\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"there be 2 week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to zero point.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any weeks where the Minnesota Vikings played and won by a score of 0 points against their opponents. Wait, no, actually, if they're holding their opponent to zero points, that would mean their opponents scored zero points. So it's about games where the Vikings' opponents didn't score at all.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. The result is given as a string like \"w 10 -7\" or \"l 24-7\". So, for each game, I need to check if the Vikings' opponents scored zero points.\n\nLet me go through each week:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent is Los Angeles Raiders. Result is l 24-7. So the Vikings lost, and their opponent scored 24 points. Not relevant because it's a loss for Vikings, but also not zero.\n\nWeek 2: Opponent is Chicago Bears. Result is w 10-7. Vikings won by 3 points. Their opponents scored 7 points. Not zero.\n\nWeek 4: Opponent is Green Bay Packers. Result is w 15-13. Vikings won, opponent scored 13 points.\n\nWeek 5: Opponent is San Francisco 49ers. Result is l 38-19. Vikings lost, opponent scored 38. Not relevant.\n\nWeek 6: Opponent is Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Result is w 15-0. Wait, here the Vikings won by a score of 15-0. So the opponent scored zero points. That's one week.\n\nWeek 8: Opponent is Chicago Bears again. Result is w 19-12. Opponents scored 12 points. Not zero.\n\nWeek 9: Opponent is Detroit Lions. Result is l 30-27. Vikings lost, opponents scored 27.\n\nWeek 10: Opponent is San Diego Chargers. Result is l 30-17. Lost, opponent scored 17.\n\nWeek 11: Opponent is Denver Broncos. Result is w 26-23. Opponents scored 23 points.\n\nWeek 12: Opponent is Tampa Bay Buccaneers again. Result is l 23-10. Vikings lost, opponents scored 23.\n\nWeek 13: Opponent is New Orleans Saints. Result is l 17-14. Lost, opponents scored 14.\n\nWeek 14: Opponent is Detroit Lions. Result is w 13-0. Here, the Vikings won by a score of 13-0. So the opponent scored zero points again. That's two weeks now.\n\nWeek 15: Opponent is Dallas Cowboys. Result is l 37-20. Lost, opponents scored 20.\n\nWeek 16: Opponent is Green Bay Packers (Milw). Result is w 21-17. Opponents scored 17.\n\nWeek 17: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs. Result is w 30-10. Opponents scored 10.\n\nWeek 18: Opponent is Washington Redskins. Result is w 14-9. Opponents scored 9.\n\nSo from the table, there are two weeks where the Vikings' opponents were held to zero points:\n\n1. Week 6 against Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n2. Week 14 against Detroit Lions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are indeed two weeks where the Vikings held their opponents to zero points.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are weeks 6 and 14 where the Minnesota Vikings' opponents scored zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the game on November 21, 1993 having the lowest attendance is true or false. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that on November 21, 1993, there was a game with the lowest attendance among all games listed in the table, with only 40,848 people attending.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different week of games, including details like the date, opponent, result, and attendance. My task is to find out if the game on November 21 had the lowest attendance compared to other games in the same season or overall.\n\nI notice that the table starts from week 1 and goes up to week 18. Each row has a 'week' column which seems to be numbered sequentially but skips some weeks, like weeks 3, 7, etc. However, when checking for the lowest attendance, it's important to consider all games listed, not just the ones with consecutive week numbers.\n\nNext, I'll list out all the attendances from each game:\n\n- Week 1: 44,120\n- Week 2: 57,921\n- Week 4: 61,746\n- Week 5: 63,071\n- Week 6: 54,215\n- Week 8: 64,677\n- Week 9: 53,428\n- Week 10: 55,527\n- Week 11: 67,329\n- Week 12: 40,848\n- Week 13: 53,030\n- Week 14: 63,216\n- Week 15: 63,321\n- Week 16: 54,773\n- Week 17: 59,236\n- Week 18: 42,836\n\nNow, I need to identify the lowest attendance. Let's arrange these numbers in ascending order:\n\n40,848 (Week 12), 42,836 (Week 18), 44,120 (Week 1), 53,030 (Week 13), 53,428 (Week 9), 54,215 (Week 6), 55,527 (Week 10), 57,921 (Week 2), 61,746 (Week 4), 63,071 (Week 5), 63,216 (Week 14), 63,321 (Week 15), 67,329 (Week 11), 59,236 (Week 17), 54,773 (Week 16).\n\nFrom this list, the lowest attendance is indeed 40,848 on November 21, which corresponds to Week 12. \n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other games with lower attendances than this. Scanning through the numbers again, all others are higher except for Week 18 at 42,836 and Week 1 at 44,120. Since 40,848 is the smallest among these, it's indeed the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct as stated.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the game on November 21, 1993 having the lowest attendance, we need to check if 40,848 is the minimum attendance in the table. By examining each row's attendance, we find that this number is indeed the smallest among all listed attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about the game on November 14, 1993 having the lowest attendance is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the game on november 14 , 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with 67329 attendee.\" So, they're saying that on November 14th, 1993, there was a game with 67,329 attendees, and this is the lowest attendance among all games listed in the table.\n\nI need to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, my focus should be on the 'date' and 'attendance' columns, specifically for the row where the game was played on November 14, 1993.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row's date to find the one that matches November 14, 1993. From the data, I see that row number 11 corresponds to November 14, 1993. So, row_index is 10 (since counting starts from 0 in programming but here it seems rows are numbered starting at 1 as per the 'week' column). Wait, no, looking again, the first row is week 1, so row indices would be 0-based: row 0 is week 1, row 1 is week 2, and so on. So, November 14, 1993 is in week 11, which would be row_index 10.\n\nIn that row (row 10), the 'attendance' column shows 67,329. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest attendance among all games in the table.\n\nTo do this, I'll list out all the 'attendance' numbers from each row:\n\nRow 0: 44120\nRow 1: 57921\nRow 2: 61746\nRow 3: 63071\nRow 4: 54215\nRow 5: 64677\nRow 6: 53428\nRow 7: 55527\nRow 8: 67329\nRow 9: 40848\nRow 10: 53030\nRow 11: 63216\nRow 12: 63321\nRow 13: 54773\nRow 14: 59236\nRow 15: 42836\n\nNow, I'll find the minimum value in this list. Let's see:\n\nLooking at each number:\n- 44120, 57921, 61746, 63071, 54215, 64677, 53428, 55527, 67329, 40848, 53030, 63216, 63321, 54773, 59236, 42836.\n\nThe smallest number here is 40,848. Wait, no, actually, let me double-check:\n\nWait, row 9 (week 10) has attendance 55,527, which is higher than 40k. Row 12 (week 13) is 53,030, which is also higher. But wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me list them again in order to find the smallest.\n\nLooking through each row's attendance:\n\nRow 0: 44120\nRow 1: 57921\nRow 2: 61746\nRow 3: 63071\nRow 4: 54215\nRow 5: 64677\nRow 6: 53428\nRow 7: 55527\nRow 8: 67329\nRow 9: 40848\nRow 10: 53030\nRow 11: 63216\nRow 12: 63321\nRow 13: 54773\nRow 14: 59236\nRow 15: 42836\n\nNow, the smallest is 40,848 (row 9), followed by 53,030 (row 10), then 54,215 (row 4?), wait no:\n\nWait, let me list them in ascending order:\n\n40,848 (row 9)\n42,836 (row 15)\n47,473? No, row 13 is 54,773.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the numbers. Let's actually sort them:\n\nLooking at each attendance number:\n\n- 40,848\n- 42,836\n- 41,220?\nNo, wait: 44120 (row 0), 47,473? No, row 13 is 54,773. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the numbers correctly:\n\nRow 0: 44,120\nRow 1: 57,921\nRow 2: 61,746\nRow 3: 63,071\nRow 4: 54,215\nRow 5: 64,677\nRow 6: 53,428\nRow 7: 55,527\nRow 8: 67,329\nRow 9: 40,848\nRow 10: 53,030\nRow 11: 63,216\nRow 12: 63,321\nRow 13: 54,773\nRow 14: 59,236\nRow 15: 42,836\n\nNow, arranging these numbers in order from smallest to largest:\n\nSmallest:\n40,848 (row 9)\n42,836 (row 15)\n44,120 (row 0)\n47,473? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, row 13 is 54,773.\n\nSo after 40,848 and 42,836, next would be 44,120, then 53,428 (row6), 53,030 (row10), 54,215 (row4), 55,527 (row7), 59,236 (row14), etc. So the smallest attendance is 40,848 in row9.\n\nTherefore, the game on November 14th has 67,329 attendees, but there's another game with lower attendance: 40,848 on December 31st (wait, no, row15 is week18, which is December 31st with 42,836. Wait, row9 is week10 (October 25th) with 40,848? Wait, the dates might not be in order because the weeks are numbered sequentially but the dates may not be.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct that. The table lists 'week' and 'date', so the date for each game is specific. So, the lowest attendance is actually on December 31st with 42,836 attendees, which is lower than 67,329.\n\nThus, the claim that the November 14th game has the lowest attendance of 67,329 is incorrect because there's another game with lower attendance (40,848). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe game on November 14, 1993, had an attendance of 67,329. However, the lowest attendance in the table was 42,836 on December 31, 1993. Since 42,836 is less than 67,329, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that during the 1993 Minnesota Viking season, the team won 9 games and lost 7. \n\nFirst, I should figure out which columns are relevant here. Looking at the table headers: week, date, opponent, result, attendance. The key points in the claim are wins and losses, so \"result\" column seems important because it shows if they won or lost each game.\n\nNow, I need to check how many wins and losses are there. Since it's the 1993 season, I should look at all the games listed in the table for that year. Wait, but the weeks go from 1 up to 18. However, not every week is accounted for\u2014some numbers like 3, 7, etc., are missing. So, maybe the season didn't have a game every week, or perhaps some games are not included in the table.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of wins and losses from the provided data. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Win (24-7)\n- Week 2: Win (10-7)\n- Week 4: Win (15-13)\n- Week 5: Loss (38-19)\n- Week 6: Win (15-0)\n- Week 8: Win (19-12)\n- Week 9: Loss (30-27)\n- Week 10: Loss (30-17)\n- Week 11: Win (26-23)\n- Week 12: Loss (23-10)\n- Week 13: Loss (17-14)\n- Week 14: Win (13-0)\n- Week 15: Loss (37-20)\n- Week 16: Win (21-17)\n- Week 17: Win (30-10)\n- Week 18: Win (14-9)\n\nCounting the wins: weeks 1,2,4,6,8,11,14,16,17,18. That's 10 wins.\n\nLosses are at weeks 5,9,10,12,13,15. That's 6 losses.\n\nWait, but the claim says they won 9 and lost 7. According to my count, it's 10 wins and 6 losses. So that doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the results:\n- Win: 1,2,4,6,8,11,14,16,17,18 \u2192 10\n- Loss:5,9,10,12,13,15 \u2192 6\n\nSo total games counted are 16 wins and losses, but the season might have more games. However, the table doesn't include all weeks, so perhaps only the games played are listed here.\n\nBut according to the data provided, they won 10 times and lost 6 times. That's a total of 16 games, which is less than the 18 weeks in the table. So maybe there were 18 games but not all are wins or losses\u2014could there be ties? But looking at the results, each game has a win or loss.\n\nWait, the claim doesn't specify the number of games played but focuses on wins and losses. So if the team won 10 and lost 6, then they didn't reach 9 wins and 7 losses. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Minnesota Vikings had 10 wins and 6 losses in the 1993 season based on provided game results.

    "claim": "during the 1993 minnesota viking season there be no week in which the team do not play",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"During the 1993 Minnesota Viking season, there be no week in which the team do not play.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is saying. It's stating that in the entire 1993 season for the Minnesota Vikings, every week (from week 1 to whatever week they played) had a game where they did play, meaning there were no weeks off where they didn't have a game.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists games from week 1 through week 18. Each row represents a week, and the opponent for that week is listed in the 'opponent' column. If there's no opponent listed for any particular week, that would mean the Vikings didn't play that week. \n\nSo my task is to go through each week (each row) and check if there's an opponent listed. If I find a week without an opponent, that means the Vikings didn't play that week, making the claim FALSE. Otherwise, if all weeks have opponents, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent is Los Angeles Raiders\nWeek 2: Chicago Bears\nWeek 4: Green Bay Packers\nWeek 5: San Francisco 49ers\nWeek 6: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nWeek 8: Chicago Bears\nWeek 9: Detroit Lions\nWeek 10: San Diego Chargers\nWeek 11: Denver Broncos\nWeek 12: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nWeek 13: New Orleans Saints\nWeek 14: Detroit Lions\nWeek 15: Dallas Cowboys\nWeek 16: Green Bay Packers (Milwaukee)\nWait, is that a typo? It says \"Green Bay Packers (Milwaukee)\". Maybe it's indicating the location or something else. But regardless, they played against them.\nWeek 17: Kansas City Chiefs\nWeek 18: Washington Redskins\n\nI notice that weeks 3 and 19 aren't listed. Wait, but in the table, week numbers go from 1 to 18, skipping some like week 3 and maybe others? Let me check again.\n\nWait no, looking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Week 1\nRow 1: Week 2\nRow 2: Week 4 (skipped week 3)\nRow 3: Week 5\nRow 4: Week 6\nRow 5: Week 8 (skipped week 7)\nWait, hold on. The table's row indices don't match the week numbers sequentially. For example:\n\n- Row 0 is Week 1\n- Row 1 is Week 2\n- Row 2 is Week 4 (so missing Week 3)\n- Row 3 is Week 5\n- Row 4 is Week 6\n- Then row 5 is Week 8, skipping Week 7\nWait no, actually, looking again:\n\nThe first row is week 1, then week 2, then week 4, which means weeks 3 and possibly others are missing. Wait, but the claim is about \"the team do not play,\" meaning any week where they didn't have a game.\n\nBut in this table, all the rows have opponents listed except if I'm miscounting. Let me list out the weeks:\n\nFrom the table:\n\nWeeks played: 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nWait, that's only 16 weeks, but a season typically has 16 or 17 weeks. However, the claim is about whether there are any weeks where they didn't play. So in this case, looking at the table, all rows from 0 to 18 (but wait, the table has 19 rows? Let me check:\n\nWait no, the table has 18 rows because it goes up to week 18. But some weeks are skipped.\n\nBut the key is: In the table provided, for each week number that's present, they have an opponent. However, since the table skips some weeks (like week 3,7, etc.), those could be weeks where they didn't play. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Week 3 isn't listed, so if that was a week off, then the Vikings did not play in week 3.\n\nSimilarly, week 7 is missing as well.\n\nSo, looking at the table, the opponent column has entries for certain weeks but not all. Since some weeks are missing (like week 3 and 7), those would mean that during those weeks, the Vikings didn't play a game. Therefore, the claim stating \"there be no week in which the team do not play\" is FALSE because there are indeed weeks where they didn't play.\n\nSo, to identify relevant cells, I need to find the weeks where there's no opponent listed. From the table structure, each row corresponds to a week. The columns are:\n\n- Week (implied)\n- Opponent\n\nTherefore, any row without an entry in the 'Opponent' column would be a relevant cell.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Week 1 - Opponent exists\nRow 1: Week 2 - Opponent exists\nRow 2: Week 4 - Opponent exists\nRow 3: Week 5 - Opponent exists\nRow 4: Week 6 - Opponent exists\nRow 5: Week 8 - Opponent exists\nRow 6: Week 9 - Opponent exists\nRow 7: Week 10 - Opponent exists\nRow 8: Week 11 - Opponent exists\nRow 9: Week 12 - Opponent exists\nRow 10: Week 13 - Opponent exists\nRow 11: Week 14 - Opponent exists\nRow 12: Week 15 - Opponent exists\nRow 13: Week 16 - Opponent exists\nRow 14: Week 17 - Opponent exists\nRow 15: Week 18 - Opponent exists\n\nWait, but that only covers weeks 1 to 18 in steps. So if the table is structured with week numbers not in order and some missing, perhaps the rows are ordered by week number but some are skipped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row corresponds directly to a specific week, so for example:\n\nRow 0: Week 1\nRow 1: Week 2\nRow 2: Week 3? But no, looking at the data, it's Week 4. So maybe the table is not in order.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that for each week, if there's no opponent listed, then they didn't play. Therefore, any row without an opponent entry is a relevant cell.\n\nBut looking at the table provided, all rows have entries under 'opponent', so perhaps in this case, the table doesn't show weeks where they didn't play? That can't be because that would make the claim TRUE, but I think that's not the case.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The table as given is:\n\nIt has 18 rows, each with a week number and opponent. But in reality, a season might have more weeks. However, the claim refers to \"the 1993 Minnesota Viking season,\" which may have 16 or 17 games.\n\nBut regardless of that, the key is whether any week is missing from the table, meaning they didn't play.\n\nWait, but perhaps the table includes all the weeks they played, and if a week is not listed, then they didn't play. So in this case, since some weeks are skipped (like 3,7, etc.), those would be the weeks where they didn't play.\n\nSo to find relevant cells, I need to identify which weeks were skipped. From the table, the opponents start at Week 1, but there's no entry for Week 3 or Week 7 and so on.\n\nBut since each row corresponds to a week, perhaps the structure is such that if a week isn't present in the table, it means they didn't play that week.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be any weeks not listed, which are:\n\nWeek 3\nWeek 7\nAnd others where there's no opponent listed.\n\nBut wait, looking at the provided table, each row corresponds to a specific week, so perhaps it's better to list all the weeks from 1 onwards and mark those without an entry as relevant.\n\nAlternatively, if the table only lists games played, then any missing week is when they didn't play.\n\nTherefore, I think that in this case, since some weeks are not listed in the opponent column, those are the relevant cells where the Vikings did not play.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying weeks during the 1993 Minnesota Viking season where the team did not play a game. The provided table lists games with opponents but skips certain weeks. These missing entries indicate that the Vikings did not play on those specific weeks.\n\nTo identify the relevant cells:\n\n1. **Identify Skipped Weeks**: From the table, weeks like Week 3 and Week 7 are absent, indicating no opponent was listed.\n2. **List Relevant Cells**: Each row without an opponent corresponds to a week where the Vikings didn't play.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- **Relevant Cells**: All rows in which the 'Opponent' column is missing correspond to weeks the Vikings did not play.\n- **Example Weeks**: Week 3, Week 7, etc.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"there be no week in which the minnesota vikings hold their opponent to more than zero points.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It's saying that in every week listed in the table, when the Minnesota Vikings played a game, they didn't allow their opponents to score more than zero points. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if they lost, the opponent would have scored some points.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again. The claim is saying there are no weeks where the Vikings let their opponents score more than zero points. But in reality, when a team loses, the opponent scores more than zero points, right?\n\nSo looking at the table, each row represents a week and includes the result of the game. For example, in week 1, the Vikings lost with the score l 24 - 7. That means the Raiders scored 24 points, and the Vikings scored 7. So the Vikings allowed the opponent to score 24 points.\n\nIf I go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: loss, opponent scored 24\n- Week 2: win, but that's irrelevant because the claim is about weeks where they let opponents score more than zero.\nWait no, the claim is saying that in every week, the Vikings didn't allow opponents to score more than zero. But if a team loses, then the opponent did score points. So the only way this could be true is if the Vikings never lost any games where their opponents scored points.\n\nBut looking at the table, I see weeks 1,5,9,12,13,15, and 16 as losses. In each of these weeks, the Vikings allowed their opponents to score more than zero points. For example:\n\n- Week 1: Raiders scored 24\n- Week 5: 49ers scored 38\n- Week 9: Lions scored 30\n- Week 12: Buccaneers scored 23\n- Week 13: Saints scored 17\n- Week 15: Cowboys scored 37\n- Week 16: Packers (Milw) scored 21\n\nIn all these weeks, the Vikings allowed opponents to score more than zero points. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are indeed weeks where they let their opponents score more than zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says \"there be no week in which the minnesota vikings hold their opponent to more than zero point.\" So it's saying that in every week, the Vikings' opponents didn't score more than zero points. But that's impossible because any game where the Vikings lost would result in their opponents scoring points. Therefore, the claim is definitely FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any weeks where the Vikings won but perhaps no opponent points? No, when they win, the opponent would have scored some points as well, like week 2: Bears scored 10, Vikings won 10-7. So even in their wins, opponents scored points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is definitely false because there are multiple weeks where the Vikings allowed their opponents to score more than zero points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are multiple weeks where the Minnesota Vikings allowed their opponents to score more than zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"the game on november 21 , 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with only 55527 crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant row in the table. Looking at the 'date' column, November 14, 1993 is one entry, but the claim mentions November 21, 1993. Scanning through the rows, I see that row 12 has the date November 21, 1993.\n\nNext, I should check the attendance for this game. The 'attendance' column in row 12 shows 40848. Now, I need to verify if this is the lowest attendance among all games listed in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row's attendance:\n\n- Week 1: 44120\n- Week 2: 57921\n- Week 4: 61746\n- Week 5: 63071\n- Week 6: 54215\n- Week 8: 64677\n- Week 9: 53428\n- Week 10: 55527\n- Week 11: 67329\n- Week 12: 40848 (this is the attendance we're looking at)\n- Week 13: 53030\n- Week 14: 63216\n- Week 15: 63321\n- Week 16: 54773\n- Week 17: 59236\n- Week 18: 42836\n\nNow, let's list out all the attendance numbers:\n\n41,420; 57,921; 61,746; 63,071; 54,215; 64,677; 53,428; 55,527; 67,329; 40,848; 53,030; 63,216; 63,321; 54,773; 59,236; 42,836.\n\nLooking for the lowest number, I see that week 12 has 40,848. Another game in week 10 has 55,527 and week 16 has 54,773. None of these are lower than 40,848 except maybe week 18 at 42,836, which is higher than 40,848.\n\nWait, no: 40,848 is lower than 42,836. So the lowest attendance is indeed in row 12 (November 21, 1993) with 40,848 attendees.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because November 21's game has the lowest attendance of all games listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the game on november 14 , 1993 have the highest attendance of any game with 54215 attendee.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the specific row in the table that corresponds to November 14, 1993. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- November 7: nope\n- November 14: yes, that's row 11.\n\nNow, check the 'attendance' column for this row. The attendance is 67329.\n\nThe claim mentions 54215 attendees. Wait, 54215 is lower than 67329. So the attendance on November 14 was higher than 54215. Therefore, the game on November 14 didn't have the highest attendance with 54215 attendees because there were other games with higher attendances.\n\nI need to check if any other games had a higher attendance than 54215. Looking at the table:\n\n- Week 6: October 10, 1993 vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, attendance 54215.\nWait, no, that's week 6 with 54215. Then week 11 (November 14) has 67329, which is higher.\n\nSo, the game on November 14 had a higher attendance than 54215, meaning it can't be the highest among games with 54215 attendees because 54215 itself was already achieved by another game. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: for week 11, the columns are 'week', 'date', and 'attendance'. So row_index is 10 (since it's zero-indexed) or wait, looking at the table, the rows start from index 0 as week 1. So November 14 is week 11, which is row_index 10? Wait no, let me count:\n\nRow 0: week 1\nRow 1: week 2\n...\nRow 10: week 11.\n\nYes, so row index is 10 for week 11.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row 10, column 'date' (to check the date)\n- row 10, column 'attendance' (to get 67329)\n\nWait, but why 'date'? Because the claim specifies November 14. So to verify it's that game, yes, the date is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not necessary because if you already have week 11, you can find the attendance. But perhaps better to include both for clarity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"during the 1993 Minnesota Viking season, the team won 8 games and lost 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that in the 1993 Vikings' season, they won 8 games and lost 6. So, I need to check if the data in the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game played during the season. The 'result' column shows whether the Vikings won (w) or lost (l) each game, along with the score.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find all the games where the Vikings won and lost and count them. If they have 8 wins and 6 losses in total, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent is the LA Raiders. Result is 'l 24 -7'. So that's a loss.\n2. Week 2: Chicago Bears. Result 'w 10-7'\u2014that's a win.\n3. Week 4: Green Bay Packers. Result 'w 15-13'\u2014another win.\n4. Week 5: SF 49ers. Result 'l 38-19'\u2014loss.\n5. Week 6: Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 'w 15-0'\u2014win.\n6. Week 8: Chicago Bears again. 'w 19-12'\u2014win.\n7. Week 9: Detroit Lions. 'l 30-27'\u2014loss.\n8. Week 10: SD Chargers. 'l 30-17'\u2014loss.\n9. Week 11: Denver Broncos. 'w 26-23'\u2014win.\n10. Week 12: Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 'l 23-10'\u2014loss.\n11. Week 13: New Orleans Saints. 'l 17-14'\u2014loss.\n12. Week 14: Detroit Lions. 'w 13-0'\u2014win.\n13. Week 15: Dallas Cowboys. 'l 37-20'\u2014loss.\n14. Week 16: Green Bay Packers (Milwaukee). 'w 21-17'\u2014win.\n15. Week 17: Kansas City Chiefs. 'w 30-10'\u2014win.\n16. Week 18: Washington Redskins. 'w 14-9'\u2014win.\n\nNow, let's count the wins and losses:\n\nWins are in weeks 2,4,6,8,9,11,14,16,17,18\u2014wait, that's 10 wins? Let me recount.\n\nWeek 2: W (1)\nWeek4: W (2)\nWeek6: W (3)\nWeek8: W (4)\nWeek9: No, Week9 is a loss. Wait no, Week9: Opponent is Detroit Lions, result 'l'\u2014so that's a loss.\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list them again:\n\nFrom the 18 weeks listed in the table, which are week 1 to 18, but some weeks like week3 and week7, etc., are missing. So perhaps the season didn't have all 18 games.\n\nBut the claim is about total wins and losses for the entire season. So I need to check how many wins and losses there were in total.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Week1: Loss (1)\n2. Week2: Win (1)\n3. Week4: Win (2)\n4. Week5: Loss (2)\n5. Week6: Win (3)\n6. Week8: Win (4)\n7. Week9: Loss (3)\n8. Week10: Loss (4)\n9. Week11: Win (5)\n10. Week12: Loss (5)\n11. Week13: Loss (6)\n12. Week14: Win (6)\n13. Week15: Loss (7)\n14. Week16: Win (7)\n15. Week17: Win (8)\n16. Week18: Win (9)\n\nWait, that's 9 wins? Or am I missing something.\n\nLet me list all the games where the result is 'w':\n\nWeek2: W\nWeek4: W\nWeek6: W\nWeek8: W\nWeek11: W\nWeek14: W\nWeek16: W\nWeek17: W\nWeek18: W\n\nThat's 9 wins. Wait, but in my initial count, I thought it was 10. Let me recount:\n\n1. Week2: W (1)\n2. Week4: W (2)\n3. Week6: W (3)\n4. Week8: W (4)\n5. Week11: W (5)\n6. Week14: W (6)\n7. Week16: W (7)\n8. Week17: W (8)\n9. Week18: W (9)\n\nSo 9 wins.\n\nBut wait, the table has 18 rows, but the season might have only 18 games. However, some weeks are missing, so perhaps the Vikings played more than 18 games? Or maybe the table doesn't include all the games.\n\nWait, in the table, the last week is Week18, which is December 31st. So it's likely that the Vikings played 18 games, but there are weeks missing because they didn't play every week (for example, if they had a bye week or didn't have a game).\n\nBut in reality, an NFL season has 16 games per team, so perhaps this table is from a different league, maybe USFL? Or it's a hypothetical.\n\nWait, the user provided a table with weeks from 1 to 18, but that doesn't make sense for the NFL. So I'm assuming this is a fictional scenario, possibly from a different football league or just a made-up schedule.\n\nTherefore, considering all the 'w' results in the table:\n\nRows where result is 'w':\n\n- Week2: W\n- Week4: W\n- Week6: W\n- Week8: W\n- Week11: W\n- Week14: W\n- Week16: W\n- Week17: W\n- Week18: W\n\nThat's 9 wins.\n\nSo the total wins are 9, and losses would be 18 - 9 = 9? But wait, no. Because some games might have ties or other outcomes, but in this table, it's only 'w' or 'l'.\n\nWait, each game is either a win or a loss, so total games = number of wins + number of losses.\n\nFrom the table, there are 18 rows. Each row represents a game result. So if they have 9 wins and 9 losses, that would be 18 games. But that's impossible because in reality, a team can't have only 9 wins in a season unless it's a very weak season.\n\nBut the claim is that they won 8 and lost 6. So according to the table, with 9 wins and 9 losses, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the count of 'w's:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week1: l\n- Week2: w (1)\n- Week3: missing?\nWait, no, the table doesn't skip weeks; it goes from week1 to week18, regardless of whether they played or not. So perhaps in reality, some weeks are bye weeks, but in this table, each row represents a game.\n\nSo if I go through all 18 rows:\n\nWeek1: l (1)\nWeek2: w (1)\nWeek3: ?\nWait, no, the table starts at Week1 and goes to Week18. So perhaps they played every week, but it's possible that some results are missing or it's a different format.\n\nBut according to the table, each row has an opponent and a result, so it's likely that each row is a game they played.\n\nTherefore, from 18 games:\n\nWins: 9\nLosses: 9\n\nSo total wins = 9, which doesn't match the claim of 8.\n\nThus, the claim would be incorrect, making the answer that the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that the team won 8 and lost 6 games is incorrect based on the provided data. According to the table, there are 9 wins and 9 losses, totaling 18 games.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; the team actually won 9 and lost 9 games.",
