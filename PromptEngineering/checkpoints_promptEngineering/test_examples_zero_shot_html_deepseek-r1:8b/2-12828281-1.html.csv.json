    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be during week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a week with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions December 6, 1964, which I need to find in the 'date' column. Scanning through each row's date:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- Week 3: September 27, 1964\n- Week 4: October 3, 1964\n- Week 5: October 10, 1964\n- Week 6: October 16, 1964\n- Week 7: October 25, 1964\n- Week 8: November 1, 1964\n- Week 9: November 8, 1964\n- Week 10: November 15, 1964\n- Week 11: November 22, 1964\n- Week 12: November 29, 1964\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964\n- Week 14: December 20, 1964\n\nYes, week 13 is on December 6, 1964. So the game did take place during week 13.\n\nNow, to check if the claim's details are correct. The relevant cells would be the ones confirming both the date and the week number for that specific date.\n\nSo, row_index is 12 (since it starts at 0), but wait: looking at the table, each <tr> corresponds to a week starting from week 1 as index 0? Let me count:\n\n- Week 1: first row after thead, which is index 0.\n- Week 2: index 1.\n- So, week 13 would be index 12.\n\nSo the relevant cells are for row_index 12 and column_name \"week\" and \"date\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a game on December 6, 1964 during week 13. The relevant cells are those two columns in that specific row.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check whether the game on December 6, 1964 occurred during week 13. By examining the 'date' and 'week' columns, we find that both correspond correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there was a game played by the team on December 6, 1964, and that this game occurred after week 13. So, my task is to check if such a game exists in the table, specifically looking for a game that happened on December 6, 1964, and whether it falls after week 13.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see each row represents a week (from 1 to 14) with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. The columns of interest here are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". \n\nI'll start by searching for the specific date December 6, 1964 in the table. Scanning through each row's date:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- Week 3: September 27, 1964\n- Week 4: October 3, 1964\n- Week 5: October 10, 1964\n- Week 6: October 16, 1964\n- Week 7: October 25, 1964\n- Week 8: November 1, 1964\n- Week 9: November 8, 1964\n- Week 10: November 15, 1964\n- Week 11: November 22, 1964\n- Week 12: November 29, 1964\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964\n- Week 14: December 20, 1964\n\nSo, week 13 corresponds to December 6, 1964. That's the specific game we're looking for.\n\nNext, I need to determine if this game occurred after week 13. Wait a second\u2014week numbering typically starts at week 1 and progresses through each subsequent week, so week 13 would be the thirteenth game of the season. Therefore, the game on December 6, 1964 (which is week 13) wouldn't logically be considered as \"after\" week 13 because it's exactly week 13. \n\nThe claim says \"the game play... be after week 13.\" If the game was played in week 13, it's not after that week; it's during that week. So the claim would imply that the game occurred later than week 13, but since week 13 is when it happened, this doesn't hold.\n\nAdditionally, checking the table again, there is no entry beyond week 14 after December 6, 1964\u2014week 14 is December 20, which is a later date. But since our specific game is on week 13, it's not after week 13 but exactly at that point in time.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the game was held during week 13, not after it.\n</think>\n\nThe game on December 6, 1964 corresponds to week 13. Since the claim states it occurred after week 13, which is incorrect as it happened exactly on that week.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is saying that there was a game played on December 2, 1963, which was week 15. I need to check if this information matches the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a week of games.\n\nThe claim mentions a game on December 2, 1963. Looking at the table, the dates go from September 13, 1964, up to December 20, 1964. Wait, that's interesting. The earliest date is in September 1964, and it goes through December 1964. So there's no game on December 2, 1963, because all games are in 1964.\n\nSo if the claim says the game was on December 2, 1963 (which would be a year before), that can't be found in the table. The table doesn't have any entries for 1963. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no corresponding week 15 in 1963.\n\nNow, to determine which cells are relevant. Since the date in question is December 2, 1963, but there's no such row in the table, I need to see if any columns can help confirm this. The 'week' column goes up to week 14 and 15? Wait, let me check the weeks.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRows 1-4: September\nRows 5-8: October\nRows 9-12: November\nRows 13-14: December\n\nSo each row corresponds to a week. The last game in the table is week 14 on December 20, 1964. There's no week 15 in the table, which aligns with the claim trying to reference week 15. But since that week isn't present and the date doesn't match any entry, it's false.\n\nTherefore, there are no relevant cells because the dates and weeks don't align, so I shouldn't include any cells in the response.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's no game on December 2, 1963, in the table. The table only goes up to December 20, 1964, with week numbers not reaching 15 in that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
