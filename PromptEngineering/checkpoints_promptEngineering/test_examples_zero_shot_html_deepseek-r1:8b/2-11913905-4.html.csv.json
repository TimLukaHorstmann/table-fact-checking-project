    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the date list for the item that be undergo overhaul , restoration or repair be 1956.\" Hmm, it's a bit unclear, but I think they're asking if there's an item in the table that undergoes overhaul, restoration, or repair and its date is 1956. So I need to look through each row where the description mentions \"undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repairs\" and check if any of those have a date of 1956.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows (like no 15097, etc.) don't mention undergoing overhaul. They have dates like 1919, 1920, which are way before 1956.\n2. Then there's a row with \"undergoing overhaul...\" and the date is 1956? Wait, let me check each relevant row.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, the rows after the initial ones start mentioning \"undergoing overhaul\" in some columns. Let me see:\n\n- The sixth row (index 6) has all cells as \"undergoing overhaul...\" and the date is \"1956\". So that's one relevant cell.\n- Then there are other rows like \"stored or static\", but those don't mention overhaul.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-examine each row with \"undergoing overhaul\".\n\nWait no, the sixth row is all \"undergoing overhaul\" and date 1956. So that's one relevant cell. The claim says \"the item that be undergo...\" so it's about items undergoing repair, etc., and their dates. Since there is an item (row 6) with date 1956, that matches.\n\nWait, but in the table, row indices start at 0. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: operational\n...\nRow 5: stored or static\nRow 6: no d4279 arthur wright? No, wait, looking again, I think I might have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the table has a row where all cells say \"undergoing overhaul...\" and that's at row index 7 (since rows start from 0). Wait, let me count:\n\n1. Row 0: operational\n2. Row 1: no 15097...\n3. ...\n6. Row 5: stored or static\n7. Row 6: no d4279 arthur wright...\n\nWait, no, the table has 8 rows before \"undergoing overhaul\" starts at row index 6? Wait, no, in the HTML, the tbody has 8 tr elements.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nRow 0: operational\nRow 1: no 15097...\nRow 2: no 15099 morris...\nRow 3: marblaegis...\nRow 4: qwag...\nRow 5: no 28 bardon...\nRow 6: d2959 staythorpe...\nRow 7: undergoing overhaul...\nRow 8: stored or static\nRow 9: no d4279 arthur wright...\n\nWait, so the row where all cells are \"undergoing overhaul...\" is at row index 7. And its date column (column 4) has \"1956\". So that's the relevant cell.\n\nAdditionally, the claim might also refer to any other rows where items undergo repair but have a date of 1956. Let me check if any other rows match.\n\nLooking further, in row 9: no d4279 arthur wright... The description column says \"john fowler 0 - 4 - 0dm\", and the date is 1952. So that's not 1956.\n\nSo only row 7 has both undergoing overhaul and date 1956.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 7 (since it's the eighth row in the tbody, but in code, it's index 7)\n- Column \"date\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. There is an item undergoing overhaul with a date of 1956.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
