    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true based on the provided table. The claim says, \"At the venue the stoop, the score was 24 - 28.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The venue mentioned is \"the stoop,\" which should be one of the venues in the table. Looking at the table, there's a column labeled \"Venue\" and another labeled \"Score.\" My task is to find if there's an entry where both the Venue is \"the stoop\" and the Score matches 24 - 28.\n\nI'll start by scanning the \"Venue\" column for \"the stoop.\" Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Venue is \"headingley stadium\" \u2013 not it.\n2. Row 1: Venue is \"knowsley road\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Continue until I find a matching venue.\n\nWait, in the table provided earlier, the relevant rows are as follows (assuming row indices start from 0):\n\n- Looking through each row:\n\nRow 25 (assuming the count starts at 0): Let me check each line carefully. There's a row where Venue is \"the stoop\" \u2013 that's probably row 31 (if indexing starts at 0, but I need to recount). Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the table provided earlier, the rows go up to 31. Let me count:\n\n- The last few entries are:\n  - 25 / 8 / 97: Venue is \"odsal stadium\" \u2013 not it.\n  - 31 / 8 / 97: Venue is \"the stoop\" \u2013 yes, this is the row.\n\nSo the relevant row is row 31. Now, looking at the Score column for that row: It's 24 - 28. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I might have miscounted because the rows go from 0 to 31, so \"the stoop\" is indeed row 31 (if starting at 0). Alternatively, if it's 1-based indexing, it would be row 32. But the example given uses 0-based indices, like {\"row_index\": 0, ...}, so I should stick with 0-based.\n\nSo for row 31, Venue is \"the stoop,\" and Score is \"24 - 28.\" Therefore, both parts of the claim are satisfied.\n\nBut wait, in the table, row indices go up to 31 (since it's a list from 0 to 31). Let me double-check that. The last entry is 31 / 8 / 97, which is row index 31.\n\nSo, the Venue is \"the stoop\" at row 31, and the Score there is indeed 24 - 28. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if \"the stoop\" venue has a score of 24-28.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: The Venue column shows \"the stoop\" at row index 31 (0-based).\n2. **Check the Score for that row**: The Score at row 31 is \"24 - 28\".\n\nSince both conditions are met, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to check whether the claim \"mcnamara score 3 / 4 goal when the venue be the stoop\" is true based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions two things: \n1. Mc Namara scored 3/4 goals.\n2. This scoring happened when the venue was \"the stoop.\"\n\nI need to verify both parts.\n\nStarting with the first part, looking at the table for any instance where Mc Namara's goal tally is exactly 3/4. I'll scan each row under the \"mcnamara\" column. \n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: 1/2\n- Row 1: 6/7\n- Row 2: 5/6\n- ...\n- Continuing until the end, I don't see any entry where Mc Namara scored exactly 3/4 goals. So that part of the claim doesn't hold.\n\nNow, checking the venue condition. The claim specifies \"the stoop\" as the venue. Scanning each row's \"venue\" column:\n\n- Row 25: the stoop\n- Any others? Let me check. No, only row 25 lists \"the stoop.\"\n\nBut wait, since the first part of the claim is incorrect\u2014no 3/4 goals\u2014does that make the entire statement false? Or do I need to consider if there's a case where both conditions are met?\n\nIn this case, even though the venue matches in one instance, the goal scoring doesn't reach 3/4. So, the combination of both conditions isn't satisfied anywhere.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"mcnamara\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
