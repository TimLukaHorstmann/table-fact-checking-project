    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"artist maggie toal have draw 7 for the song fee him with love.\" So, the key elements here are:\n\n1. The artist's name is Maggie Toal.\n2. She has a draw number of 7.\n3. This corresponds to the song \"feed him with love.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find rows where the 'artist' column matches \"maggie toal\" and see if there's an entry for draw 7 with that song.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row in the table:\n\n- Row 0: artist is \"the memories,\" not relevant.\n- Row 1: artist is \"ann breen,\" no match.\n- Row 2: artist is \"fran meen,\" no.\n- Row 3: artist is \"dreams,\" nope.\n- Row 4: artist is \"connor stevens,\" no.\n- Row 5: artist is \"linda martin and friends,\" not matching.\n- Row 6: artist is \"maggie toal.\" Ah, this is the row we're interested in.\n\nIn row 6, the draw number is 7, which matches. The song listed is \"feed him with love.\" So all parts of the claim are satisfied here.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because there's a matching row where Maggie Toal has draw 7 for that specific song.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the artist \"maggie toal\" exists in the table and if she has a corresponding draw number of 7 with the song \"feed him with love.\"\n\n1. **Locate the artist's row**: Search the 'artist' column for \"maggie toal.\"\n2. **Check draw number and song**: In that row, confirm if 'draw' is 7 and 'song' is \"feed him with love.\"\n\nBoth conditions are met in row index 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
