    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"tatjana maria lose all of her game in the australian open.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant parts of the table. Since the claim is about the Australian Open, I'll focus on the row for \"australian open\". In the table, that's the first data row, so row_index 0.\n\nLooking at the columns under \"australian open\", each cell corresponds to a year from 2007 to 2012. The cells have values like 'a', '1r', etc. I remember that in tennis, 'a' usually stands for absent or not playing, and '1r' means the player lost in the first round.\n\nSo, in row 0 (Australian Open), let's see each year:\n\n- 2007: a\n- 2008: a\n- 2009: a\n- 2010: 1r\n- 2011: 1r\n- 2012: a\n\nThe claim says she lost all her games there. Losing all games would mean she didn't win any matches, so every time she played (not 'a'), she lost.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, she lost in the first round ('1r'). So those are losses. But what about when she was absent? Did that count as a loss or not playing? The claim says \"lose all of her game,\" which might mean she didn't win any matches she played.\n\nWait, but in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2012, she didn't play (marked 'a'). So did she lose those games? Or did she not participate, so they aren't counted as losses. The term \"lose all of her game\" might imply that she lost every match she played in the Australian Open.\n\nIn this case, she lost in 2010 and 2011, but didn't play in other years. So does that mean she didn't lose all her games because she didn't play in some years? Or is 'a' considered a loss because she didn't win?\n\nI think 'a' typically means she didn't participate or withdraw, not necessarily losing. So she lost the matches she played but didn't play in others. The claim says she \"lose all of her game,\" which might mean every match she entered, she lost. But since she didn't enter some years (marked 'a'), she didn't lose those games.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because she only lost in two rounds and didn't participate in others.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not entirely accurate because Tatjana Maria did not play in all editions of the Australian Open, specifically marked as 'a'. She only lost in 2010 and 2011, but did not participate in other years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"she do the best in the us open by record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It seems like the person achieved the best performance in the US Open according to their win-loss record. So I should look for the US Open row and see her win-loss statistics there.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and then a summary row. The columns are for each year from 2007 to 2012, plus \"career win - loss\" as the last column.\n\nThe relevant part here is the US Open row. Let's find that in the table. The fourth row from the top is labeled \"us open\". So I should focus on this row.\n\nNow, looking at the columns under \"us open\", each cell corresponds to a year: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012. In each of these cells, the entries are either 'a', '1r', '2r' or sometimes numbers like '1 - 3' in the last column.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"record\", which likely refers to her performance over time in the US Open, not just a single year. So I should check the entire row for the US Open tournament, including each year's result and the overall career record.\n\nLooking at the 'us open' row:\n- 2007: a\n- 2008: a\n- 2009: 2r\n- 2010: 1r\n- 2011: a\n- 2012: 2r\n\nIn each of these, except for 2009 and 2010, it's 'a' which probably means she didn't reach the main draw or was absent. In 2009, she reached the second round (2r), in 2010 the first round, and in 2012 also the second round.\n\nThe last column, \"career win - loss\", for the US Open is 2 - 3. That means over her career in the US Open, she has 2 wins and 3 losses, which isn't particularly impressive. It's not the best record if we consider more successful players might have higher wins.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding 'a' as an abbreviation. If 'a' stands for advanced or absent, perhaps it means she didn't participate in those years. So her actual participation was limited to 2009, 2010, and 2012 with only a few matches won.\n\nTherefore, her overall record in the US Open isn't the best. She hasn't consistently performed well or had many wins. The claim says \"she do the best in the us open by record,\" implying she is the top performer based on her record. But from the table, her win-loss is 2-3, which is not exceptional.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other tournaments, her performance isn't better than others. For example, in Wimbledon, she has a career record of 1 - 4, which is worse. The last row's summary shows her overall career as 4 - 12, which is quite poor across all tournaments combined.\n\nSo putting this together, the claim that she did the best in the US Open by record doesn't hold up because her win-loss record isn't superior; it's actually on the lower side compared to others or not significantly the best.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that she achieved the best record in the US Open. Checking the \"us open\" row, her performance isn't exceptional\u2014she has only 2 wins and 3 losses, with several years of limited participation. This does not indicate the best record.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** The claim refers to the US Open, so focus on the row labeled \"us open\".\n2. **Analyze Each Column:** Check each year's result for the US Open.\n3. **Evaluate Career Record:** Summing her wins and losses in the US Open shows a 2-3 record, not the best overall performance.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"us open\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"she win 1 time at wimbledon and the french open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. First, I'll break down the claim into two parts: winning 1 time at Wimbledon and 1 time at the French Open.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it's organized by tournaments and years, with a column for each tournament and another for \"career win - loss.\" The last row seems to be aggregating overall career stats. \n\nStarting with Wimbledon, I'll look for the row where the tournament is Wimbledon. Scanning the first data row under \"thead,\" I see \"wimbledon\" in one of the rows. In that row, each cell corresponds to a specific year and then the \"career win - loss.\" For Wimbledon, across the years 2007-2012, there are entries like '2r', '1r', etc., but none indicate a win. The last column shows career wins and losses. For Wimbledon, it's 1 - 4, meaning she has one win and four losses in her career at Wimbledon.\n\nNow, checking the French Open, I'll look for that row. In the French Open row, each year also doesn't show a win except possibly '2r' or others, but again, no 'W' or clear indication of a win. The last column shows 1 - 2 for French Open, meaning one win and two losses in her career there.\n\nThe claim states she won once at Wimbledon and once at the French Open. From the table, it's clear she has one win each in both tournaments. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is true or false and identify which cells in the table are relevant to support the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim is: \"she be 4 and 12 in win loss during this open.\" Breaking that down, it's referring to someone's performance across different tennis tournaments, specifically looking at their wins and losses, with numbers 4 and 12 mentioned.\n\nNow, let me look at the table provided. The table has columns for each year from 2007 to 2012 and a column called \"career win - loss.\" Each row represents a tournament: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and then a summary row for \"win - loss.\"\n\nThe user is claiming that in one of these tournaments, specifically during an open (which I assume refers to one of the major tennis tournaments like the majors), she had 4 wins and 12 losses. So, I need to check if any cell in the table matches this.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Australian Open**: The win-loss columns are a mix of 'a', '1r', etc., but not numbers like 4 or 12.\n2. **French Open**: Similarly, there's a '1 - 2' and other non-numeric entries except for the summary.\n3. **Wimbledon**: Again, non-numeric except for the summary.\n4. **US Open**: Same pattern here; no cells with 4 or 12.\n5. **Summary Row (win - loss)**: Here, I see \"4 - 12\" in the last column.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"during this open.\" The term 'open' is a bit ambiguous\u2014does it refer to one specific tournament (like the US Open) or the general term? If it's referring to a specific open, then none of the individual rows have 4 and 12. However, if it's referring to her overall performance across all opens (the summary row), then \"4 - 12\" is present.\n\nBut the claim says \"she be 4 and 12 in win loss during this open.\" The term 'this open' could be ambiguous. If it's a specific tournament, none of them have that. But if it's considering her overall career across all opens, then yes, the summary row shows 4-12.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, the last row is labeled \"win - loss,\" not \"career win - loss.\" Let me check: the header has a column called \"career win - loss\" and the last row under that column says \"4 - 12.\" So, it's her overall career record in wins and losses across all tournaments.\n\nSo, the claim is saying she has 4 and 12 in terms of win-loss during this open. But 'during this open' could mean one specific tournament, which doesn't have those numbers. However, if we interpret \"this open\" as referring to her overall performance (i.e., across all opens), then the summary row applies.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because she has a career win-loss record of 4-12 across all opens. The relevant cell is in the last row, under the \"career win - loss\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if the claim's information aligns with any cells in the table.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim refers to a win-loss record of 4 and 12 during an open (tournament). \n2. **Table Review**: The only occurrence of numbers 4 and 12 is found in the \"career win - loss\" column's last row, which shows \"4 - 12\".\n3. **Relevance Check**: This cell pertains to her overall performance across all opens, aligning with the claim's context when interpreted broadly.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"she probably need to work on her craft before the next year of event.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. It seems like it's about improving one's skills (craft) before an upcoming event. So, I'm looking for cells in the table that might relate to performance trends or the need for improvement.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for each tournament from 2007 to 2012 and \"career win - loss.\" The rows are for different tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a summary row labeled \"win - loss.\"\n\nI should check if there's any data that shows an upward trend or indicates the need for improvement. For instance, if her performance in previous years was poor, it might suggest she needs to work on her craft before next year.\n\nLooking at each tournament:\n\n- Australian Open: From 2007 to 2012, it's 'a' except in 2011 where it's 1r (first round). So consistent performance.\n- French Open: Similar pattern, mostly 'a' with some years as 2r. Not much change.\n- Wimbledon: Shows a 2r in 2007, then 1r the next three years. Improved to 1r in 2008 onwards.\n- US Open: 'a' until 2010, then 1r in 2011 and 2r in 2012. So improved from 2011 onward.\n- The summary row shows her overall wins and losses: 4 -12. That's quite low.\n\nSo, looking at her performance over the years, there isn't a significant trend indicating a need for improvement before next year. Most of her performances are consistent or improving slightly, but not drastically so that would require working on craft.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be making an assumption based on data that doesn't strongly support it.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"tatjina maria win all of her game in the australian open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking at the table structure and the data it contains.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the table represents. It seems to be about different tennis tournaments over several years (2007-2012) and tracks each tournament's performance for \"australian open,\" \"french open,\" etc., as well as a summary of her career wins and losses.\n\nThe claim in question is about Tatjana Maria winning all her games at the Australian Open. So, I need to look specifically at the Australian Open column in the table to see if there's any year where she didn't lose a game.\n\nLooking at the \"australian open\" row under each year:\n\n- 2007: a\n- 2008: a\n- 2009: a\n- 2010: 1r (which means she lost in the first round)\n- 2011: 1r\n- 2012: a\n\nEach 'a' probably stands for an absence or that she didn't play, but at least from 2007 to 2008 and 2009, it's marked as 'a,' which I think means she didn't participate or lost. Wait, actually, in tennis terms, sometimes 'a' could mean 'absent' or not playing, so maybe those years she didn't enter the tournament, but other times like 2010, 2011, and 2012, it's '1r' which is her losing in the first round.\n\nBut the claim says she \"won all of her games.\" So I'm looking to see if there's any year where she won all her matches in the Australian Open. From the table, in 2007, 2008, 2009, it shows 'a' which might mean she didn't play or lost. Wait, but actually, sometimes in tournaments, if you don't play, your record isn't affected, so maybe those 'a's are neutral.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The column is labeled as \"career win - loss,\" which is a summary of her overall wins and losses across all tournaments, not just the Australian Open. So that last row might be irrelevant to this specific claim about the Australian Open.\n\nSo focusing on the \"australian open\" column: in 2007, it's 'a,' so maybe she didn't play or lost. In 2008, same thing. In 2009, also 'a.' Then in 2010 and 2011, it's '1r,' meaning first round loss. In 2012, it's 'a' again.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"win all of her game,\" so I need to see if she ever had a year where she didn't lose any matches in the Australian Open. If 'a' means she didn't play or lost, then in those years (2007-2008, 2012), it's not clear whether she won or lost because it's just 'a.' Maybe 'a' stands for absence, meaning she didn't participate that year.\n\nSo perhaps the only concrete losses are in 2010 and 2011, with '1r,' which means she lost those times. Therefore, in none of the years shown does she have a win in the Australian Open\u2014either she didn't play or she lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'a' stands for \"absent\" but her wins would be when it's not marked as 'a' or '1r.' So if there's a year where it's just 'a,' perhaps that means she won all her matches in that tournament. But I'm not sure about that interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the table is indicating whether she won or lost each specific match. So for each tournament, each cell shows either a win ('w'), loss ('l'), or absence ('a'). If that's the case, then 'a' would mean she didn't participate in that particular game. So if she didn't participate, she doesn't have a win or loss there.\n\nIn that scenario, her wins would only be when it's not marked as 'a' or 'l.' Looking at the Australian Open row:\n\n- 2007: a (no match)\n- 2008: a\n- 2009: a\n- 2010: 1r (loss)\n- 2011: 1r (loss)\n- 2012: a\n\nSo in none of the years from 2007 to 2012 did she have a win. Therefore, the claim that she \"won all her games\" would be false because there are years where she didn't participate (so not wins) and other years where she lost.\n\nWait, but maybe 'a' doesn't mean absence but just a default value. Maybe it's indicating the result, where 'a' is an abbreviation for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the table uses 'a' to represent that she advanced past the first round without losing any matches. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in 2007-2009 and 2012, she didn't play, so she didn't have any losses or wins in those years. In 2010 and 2011, she lost in the first round. So over all these years, she didn't win any matches at the Australian Open; either she didn't play or she lost.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she \"won all her games\" is incorrect because there are instances where she did lose (in 2010 and 2011) and other instances where she didn't play. So she didn't win all of her games in the Australian Open.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check the relevant cells in the table for any indication that Tatjana Maria won all her matches at the Australian Open. From 2007-2012, the cells for the Australian Open show 'a' (possibly indicating absence or default) in most years and specific losses ('1r') in 2010 and 2011. This indicates she didn't win all games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The table shows that Tatjana Maria did not win any matches in the Australian Open during the evaluated years, as there are recorded losses and other instances where she did not participate.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"she do the worst in the us open by record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that \"she did the worst in the US Open by record.\" The key points here are \"US Open,\" \"did the worst,\" and \"record.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it's an HTML table with columns for different tennis tournaments from 2007 to 2012 and then a column for \"career win - loss.\" Each row represents a tournament (like Australian Open, French Open, etc.), but the last row seems to be the summary of the winner's performance across these tournaments.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking closer, each row is for a specific tournament. The columns under 2007-2012 are probably indicating her performance in each year, with 'a' meaning absent or not relevant, and entries like \"1r\" meaning first round loss, while some have numbers and hyphens, which likely represent wins and losses.\n\nThe last row of the table seems to be a summary, as it's labeled \"win - loss,\" but that might actually refer to her overall performance across those tournaments. Let me check:\n\n- Australian Open: 0 - 3\n- French Open: 1 - 2\n- Wimbledon: 1 - 4\n- US Open: 2 - 3\nAnd the last row has \"win - loss\" as 4 - 12, which probably totals her wins and losses across all tournaments.\n\nThe claim is about the US Open. So I should focus on that specific tournament's data in the table.\n\nLooking at the US Open row (which is the fourth row), the \"career win - loss\" column says \"2 - 3.\" That would mean she has 2 wins and 3 losses, but wait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Wait, each tournament's performance is shown separately, so in 2007, she was 'a', which probably means she didn't participate or didn't reach beyond a certain round.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"career win - loss\" column is her overall record across all tournaments listed, but that seems unlikely because the last row has \"win - loss\" as 4-12, which probably is an aggregate. But in the US Open row, it's specifically \"2 - 3.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe each tournament's performance is in a specific year, and the \"career win - loss\" column refers to her overall record up to that point or across all tournaments.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the table structure. The table has a header row with columns: tournament, 2007, 2008, ..., up to 2012, and then \"career win - loss.\"\n\nEach subsequent row lists a tournament along with her performance in each year. For example, the first data row is for \"australian open\" with entries 'a' from 2007 to 2011 and '0 - 3' in the last column.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the tournaments are separate; maybe I'm misreading it. Perhaps each row after the header is a specific tournament's performance over the years listed (from 2007 onwards). So the first data row is about the Australian Open, showing her results in each year from 2007 to 2012, and then the last column is \"career win - loss,\" which might be her overall record up to that point.\n\nBut looking at the US Open row, it shows 'a' for 2007, 'a' for 2008, '2r' for 2009, '1r' for 2010, and '2r' for 2012. The last column is \"2 - 3,\" which would indicate her performance in the US Open over those years. However, since some years have 'a,' it's unclear whether she participated or not.\n\nThe claim is that she did the worst in the US Open by record. So I need to see if her performance in the US Open was indeed worse than others, but perhaps the table doesn't provide enough info about other players. Alternatively, maybe the \"career win - loss\" column indicates that she had 2 wins and 3 losses overall.\n\nWait, but looking at the last row, it's labeled as \"win - loss,\" which might be a total across all tournaments: 4-12. So perhaps each tournament's performance is in their respective years, and the \"career win - loss\" column isn't per tournament but overall. That would mean that for each tournament, she has certain wins and losses over her career.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The claim is about the US Open. So I need to find data in the table related to the US Open and whether it supports the claim of her doing the worst by record.\n\nLooking at the row for \"us open,\" the last column is \"2 - 3.\" If that's her performance in the US Open, perhaps over multiple years, but with 'a' indicating non-participation. So in 2007, she didn't participate (a), same for 2008. In 2009, she reached 2r, which is the second round, so she lost there as well. In 2010, she also lost in the first round. In 2012, she made it to the second round again but lost.\n\nSo over her career in the US Open, from 2007 onwards, she didn't win any matches; she either retired or lost every time she played. Her win-loss record would be 0-5? But according to the table, the last column is \"2 - 3.\" Wait, no\u2014the \"career win - loss\" column for US Open is \"2 - 3,\" which seems contradictory because if she didn't win any matches, it shouldn't be 2-3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Maybe the \"career win - loss\" column isn't for the US Open specifically but her overall career across all tournaments listed. But that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the last row is a summary of her performance in each tournament. So for the US Open, she has 2 wins and 3 losses? That would mean over her participation in the US Open, she's won twice and lost thrice. But looking at the data, it seems she didn't have any wins because all entries are 'a' or with loss indicators.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different angle. The claim is that she did the worst in the US Open by record. If her record (as per the table) shows she has 2-3 wins and losses, then perhaps it's implying that others have better records. But without data on others, I can't compare.\n\nAlternatively, if her performance was worse than others', but how is that reflected? Maybe the \"career win - loss\" column indicates that across all tournaments, including US Open, she has 4-12 wins and losses, which is quite poor. So perhaps in the US Open, she didn't perform well, contributing to this overall record.\n\nBut without more data on her performance relative to others, I can't confirm whether she did worse than others in the US Open specifically.\n\nWait, maybe it's about being the lowest performer in the US Open among her peers, but that's not directly indicated. The table doesn't provide comparison with others.\n\nAlternatively, if \"2 - 3\" indicates her wins and losses in the US Open, then she has a worse record there than elsewhere.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Let me focus on the data given. In the US Open row, the last column is \"2 - 3.\" Perhaps that means she had two wins and three losses across her career in the US Open. So she didn't perform well, leading to a worse record than others.\n\nBut without knowing how other players performed, it's hard to say definitively. However, if this data shows that she has the lowest win-loss record in the US Open compared to others not shown here, then the claim holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"2 - 3\" is her overall career wins and losses, not just in the US Open. If so, it might not specifically reflect her performance in the US Open but overall.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the answer is that yes, she did worse than others in the US Open as evidenced by her \"2 - 3\" win-loss record, which is lower than competitors who might have better records elsewhere or more wins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not supported by the data because we don't know how others performed. The table doesn't provide comparison data for other players.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information given in the table, her US Open performance is shown with \"2 - 3\" wins and losses, which suggests she did worse than others in that tournament. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, the claim that she performed worse than others in the US Open by having a \"2 - 3\" win-loss record is supported. This indicates her performance was lower compared to competitors, as her wins and losses are fewer than those typically seen in the tournament.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is supported by the data showing her \"2 - 3\" win-loss record in the US Open, suggesting she performed worse than others.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"she win 2 time at wimbledon and the french open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says she won two times at Wimbledon and the French Open. So, I need to check how many times she won in those tournaments according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns for each year from 2007 to 2012, plus a column for career wins and losses. The rows represent different tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and some summary row.\n\nThe relevant information here is in the 'tournament' column and the corresponding years. For Wimbledon and the French Open, I need to see how many times she won based on the table data.\n\nStarting with Wimbledon:\n\nIn the table, under Wimbledon, each year's result is listed as:\n- 2007: 2r (which means she reached the second round)\n- 2008: 1r (first round)\n- 2009: 1r\n- 2010: a (maybe an abbreviation for 'absent' or didn't participate)\n- 2011: a\n- 2012: a\n\nSo, from this, it seems she only reached the second round in 2007 and first rounds otherwise. The key here is that 'a' might mean she didn't play or win that year.\n\nWait, but the last row has \"win - loss\" which shows her career stats as 4-12. That suggests she's won 4 times and lost 12 times across all tournaments listed. But I need to focus on specific wins at Wimbledon and French Open.\n\nNow, for the French Open:\n\nLooking at the French Open row:\n- 2007: a\n- 2008: a\n- 2009: a\n- 2010: 2r\n- 2011: a\n- 2012: a\n\nAgain, mostly 'a's, with a 2r in 2010. So she reached the second round once.\n\nThe claim says she won two times at Wimbledon and French Open. But looking at the table data, she only reached the second round once each in those tournaments. The term \"win\" might refer to winning the tournament itself. \n\nWait, but the 'career win - loss' column shows her total wins as 4 and losses as 12. That suggests she's won four times across all these tournaments. So perhaps she has won Wimbledon twice and French Open once? Or maybe she has only won each once.\n\nWait, looking back at each tournament:\n\n- Australian Open: No wins in any year.\n- French Open: Only 2r in 2010, so no win.\n- Wimbledon: No wins; she didn't go past the first round except in 2007 where she got to 2r but not winning.\n- US Open: She won in 2010 (1r) and 2012 (2r), so maybe two wins there.\n\nBut according to the table, her career win - loss is 4-12. So across all tournaments listed, she's won four times.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each cell represents whether she won that particular year or not. But it's unclear because 'a' might mean something else. The term 'win' in the claim refers to winning the entire tournament, not just advancing through rounds.\n\nLooking again, the table's 'tournament' column for Wimbledon shows no years where she won the tournament. Similarly for French Open, except perhaps 2010 she got to 2r but didn't win. So maybe she never won either of those tournaments.\n\nAlternatively, if 'a' means absence or not participating, then her wins would be only in US Open: 2007, 2010, 2012? But wait, the last row's career stats show 4-12. So perhaps she has four wins total across all tournaments, but not specifically at Wimbledon or French Open.\n\nSo the claim says she won two times at Wimbledon and French Open. But from the table, it doesn't look like she ever won either of those tournaments. She might have reached the second round in 2007 for Wimbledon and 2010 for French Open, but that's not winning the tournament itself.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because she hasn't won two times at Wimbledon or French Open based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"she be 6 and 10 in win loss during this open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions \"win loss,\" which refers to the career win-loss record. The specific numbers mentioned are 6 and 10. So, I need to look for cells in the table that mention wins and losses totaling these numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row labeled \"win - loss\" at the bottom. That seems like it could be relevant. Let me check what values are in that row for each year from 2007 to 2012.\n\nIn the \"win - loss\" row:\n- 2007: 1 - 1\n- 2008: 0 - 1\n- 2009: 1 - 2\n- 2010: 1 - 3\n- 2011: 0 - 1\n- 2012: 1 - 1\n\nI need to sum up the wins and losses. Let's calculate the total wins:\n1 (2007) + 0 (2008) + 1 (2009) + 1 (2010) + 0 (2011) + 1 (2012) = 4 wins.\n\nTotal losses:\n3 (2007) + 1 (2008) + 2 (2009) + 3 (2010) + 1 (2011) + 1 (2012) = 11 losses.\n\nSo, the total career win-loss record is 4 - 11, which is not 6-10. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because it doesn't match the numbers in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The user wrote \"she be 6 and 10 in win loss.\" It could mean that in a particular tournament (like during this open), her win-loss record is 6-10. However, the table shows for each tournament separately, not an overall total.\n\nLooking at individual rows:\n- Australian Open: Never reached beyond 1r except in 2012 where she had a.\n- French Open: Reached 2r once.\n- Wimbledon: Reached 2r in 2007 and 1r otherwise.\n- US Open: Reached 2r in 2009, 2010, and 2012.\n\nNone of the tournaments show a win-loss record of 6-10. The \"win - loss\" row at the bottom is an aggregate, but that's 4-11, not 6-10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is based on a misunderstanding. The numbers in the table don't support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a win-loss record of 6 and 10 during \"this open,\" but the table shows the total career record as 4 - 11, not 6 - 10. No individual tournament matches 6-10 either.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
