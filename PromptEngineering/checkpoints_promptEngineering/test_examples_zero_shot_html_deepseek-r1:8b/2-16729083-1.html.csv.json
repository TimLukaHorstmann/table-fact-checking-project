    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions three things:\n1. The opponent should be the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2. This should occur in week 14.\n3. The attendance for that game should be 74,524.\n\nI'll start by looking at the table to find any matches. The table lists each week from 1 to 17, with details including the opponent and attendance.\n\nLooking through the weeks, I see that week 14 is listed. In week 14, the opponent is Kansas City Chiefs. So that part checks out. \n\nNext, checking the attendance for week 14: according to the table, the attendance was 77,778. The claim mentions 74,524, which doesn't match. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, did I read it right? Let me double-check. Week 14 has opponent Kansas City Chiefs and attendance 77,778. So the attendance in the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since one of the facts (attendance) doesn't align with the table data, the overall claim should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
