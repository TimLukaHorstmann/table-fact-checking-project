    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"only 2 player score under par at the 1971 us open\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that only two players scored under par. Under par in golf typically refers to a score lower than par, which is usually indicated by a negative number or an \"e\" for even. In this table, the column labeled \"to par\" shows values like -3, -1, e, +1, etc. So, I should look at this column to determine if a player scored under par.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their scores and the \"to par\" status. The rows are numbered from 0 to 8 (since there are 9 rows). But wait, in the JSON example provided, the row indices started at 0. So I need to map the table's row numbers correctly.\n\nLet me list out each player's \"to par\" value:\n\n1. Jim Simons: -3 (row 0)\n2. Jack Nicklaus: -1 (row 1)\n3. Bobby Nichols: e (row 2)\n4. Lee Trevino: +1 (row 3)\n5. George Archer: +1 (row 4)\n6. Jim Colbert: +1 (row 5)\n7. Bob Erickson: +1 (row 6)\n8. Ken Still: +2 (row 7)\n9. Larry Hinson: +2 (row 8)\n10. Bruce Devlin: +2 (row 9)\n\nWait, actually, the table has 9 rows, but in the JSON example, it's 0-indexed up to row 8 for 9 entries. So, the first row is index 0.\n\nNow, checking each player's \"to par\" status:\n\n- Jim Simons: -3 \u2192 under par\n- Jack Nicklaus: -1 \u2192 under par\n- Bobby Nichols: e \u2192 considered even, which I think means under par because it's not above by a stroke.\n- Lee Trevino and others: +1 or higher \u2192 not under par.\n\nWait, but in golf terms, \"e\" stands for even. So if the player scored exactly par, they get an \"e\". If they're under, they have a negative number, like -3 or -1. If over, it's positive like +1 or +2.\n\nSo, players with \"to par\" as \"-3\", \"-1\", or \"e\" are under par. Others are not.\n\nSo let me count how many players are under par:\n\n- Jim Simons: -3 \u2192 yes (row 0)\n- Jack Nicklaus: -1 \u2192 yes (row 1)\n- Bobby Nichols: e \u2192 yes (row 2)\n- Lee Trevino: +1 \u2192 no\n- George Archer: +1 \u2192 no\n- Jim Colbert: +1 \u2192 no\n- Bob Erickson: +1 \u2192 no\n- Ken Still: +2 \u2192 no\n- Larry Hinson: +2 \u2192 no\n- Bruce Devlin: +2 \u2192 no\n\nSo that's 3 players under par: rows 0, 1, and 2.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 2 player score under par\". So this is false because there are at least three.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"e\" isn't considered under par. Let me double-check that.\n\nIn golf tournaments, typically, a score of e means exactly par, not under. But sometimes in certain contexts, like match play, even can mean something else. However, looking at the table, \"to par\" for Bobby Nichols is marked as \"e\", which I think means his total was equal to par. So he didn't go under.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: if a player scores exactly par, it's even (e). If they're under, their score would be lower, leading to negative numbers or e with a lower number? Wait, in the table:\n\nJim Simons has 71+71+65=207. The course par for each round is likely 70 or 72. Let me check:\n\nWait, each row shows three scores added together. For example, Jim Simons: 71 + 71 + 65 = 207. Each of these could be per round, so if the par for each round is, say, 70, then 71 would be one over, and 65 would be five under. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here because the \"to par\" column seems to be summing up.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again, it shows the total score and then the \"to par\" as either -3, -1, e, etc. So each player's total is compared to the par. For example, Jim Simons scored 207, which is 3 under par (since 207 = 70*3, so par would be 210 perhaps?), but I'm not exactly sure.\n\nWait, maybe each round has a certain par. Let's assume each of the three rounds has a par of 70, so total par would be 210. Then:\n\n- Jim Simons: 71+71+65=207 \u2192 3 under (par 210), so -3.\n- Jack Nicklaus: Suppose he had 72 per round; 72*3=216. If he scored 215, that's 1 under, hence -1.\n- Bobby Nichols: Maybe he scored exactly par, hence e.\n\nBut regardless of the exact calculation, the key is how many players have \"to par\" as negative or e (which might be considered under). But if e is considered even, perhaps it's not under. Wait, in some scoring systems, a player who scores e in match play can still lose if they're behind by more than their score.\n\nBut for total scores, I think that the \"to par\" of -3, -1, or e (which could be equivalent to par) would mean that Bobby Nichols didn't go under. So perhaps only Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus are under par, making it 2 players, which aligns with the claim.\n\nWait, but then why is Bobby Nichols marked as 'e'? Maybe in this context, 'e' means under by one or something else. Alternatively, maybe each round has a different par. For example:\n\nIf the first round was 70, second 71, third 72, total par would be 211. Then Jim's 207 is 4 under, which would be -4, but he's marked as -3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each round's par is the sum of their scores? No, that doesn't make sense because the \"to par\" is a single number, not per round.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. Let me just take the given data: players with 'to par' values of -3 and -1 are under, and 'e' might be exactly par, so they aren't under. So that would make 2 players under par (Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus), which matches the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, Bobby Nichols has 'e'. If 'e' is considered as not under, then only two are under. So the statement \"only 2 player score under par\" is correct.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that Bobby Nichols was under because of e, but if e means exactly par, then he's not under. So perhaps the initial count is only two players.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me see:\n\nIf 'to par' is a number indicating how much the player was under or over:\n\n- Negative numbers: under\n- Positive: over\n- Zero (or e): exactly at par\n\nSo Bobby Nichols has 'e', which means he didn't go under; he stayed at par.\n\nTherefore, only Jim Simons (-3) and Jack Nicklaus (-1) are under par. So that's 2 players, matching the claim.\n\nSo then the statement is correct: only 2 players scored under par.\n\nThus, in the JSON response, I need to include these two players: their names and \"to par\" value.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 0: Jim Simons \u2192 -3\nRow 1: Jack Nicklaus \u2192 -1\n\nSo these are the two players who scored under par.\n</think>\n\n{\"response\": {\"players\": [{\"name\":\"Jim Simons\", \"to_par\": \"-3\"}, {\"name\":\"Jack Nicklaus\", \"to_par\": \"-1\"}]}}",

The claim says: \"the top golfer defeats the player tie for eighth by 5 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's about a top performer (probably the first place) winning by a significant margin over the players tied at eighth place by five strokes.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a golfer with their placement, country, score, and to par. The scores are calculated as the sum of three rounds. \n\nI need to identify who is in first place and who is tied for eighth, then calculate the difference in their scores to see if it's five strokes.\n\nStarting with the top performer: looking at the table, the first row has \"jim simons (a)\" with a score of 207. No one else has a lower score than that, so he's definitely in first place.\n\nNow, the players tied for eighth are the ones in the t8 row. There are three players there: ken still, larry hinson, and bruce devlin. Let me check their scores:\n\n- ken still: 71 + 72 + 69 = 212\n- larry hinson: 71 + 71 + 70 = 212\n- bruce devlin: 72 + 69 + 71 = 212\n\nSo all three have a total of 212. \n\nNow, the first place has 207, and the eighth-place players have 212. The difference between 212 and 207 is 5 strokes. That's exactly what the claim states\u2014the top golfer defeats the tie for eighth by five strokes.\n\nI don't see any other relevant cells because the rest of the players are either in higher positions or not tied at eighth. So the only relevant cells are the first row (row index 0) and the t8 rows (rows 7, 8, 9).\n</think>\n\nThe top golfer's score is 207, and the tied eighth-place golfers have a score of 212.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"3 player score better on the first round than the eventual winner\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The rows list players with their scores and positions after three rounds (since it seems like each row sums up three rounds as per the score calculation).\n\nThe claim mentions \"3 player\" which likely refers to the 3rd-place player or perhaps the third position. I think it's referring to the third-place finisher. It says that this player scored better in the first round than the eventual winner.\n\nSo, who is the eventual winner? The table doesn't explicitly state a winner, but typically, the lowest score wins in such competitions. Let me check each row:\n\n- 1st place: Jim Simons with 71 + 71 + 65 = 207\n- 2nd place: Jack Nicklaus with 69 + 72 + 68 = 209\n- 3rd place: Bobby Nichols with 69 + 72 + 69 = 210\n- T4 (tie for 4th): Lee Trevino, George Archer, Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson each with scores summing to 211\n- T8 (tie for 8th): Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin each with 212\n\nSo the lowest score is Jim Simons at 207, making him the winner. Now, we need to check if the 3rd-place player, Bobby Nichols, scored better than Jim Simons in the first round.\n\nLooking at their individual rounds:\n\nJim Simons: First round score was 71.\nBobby Nichols: His first round score is also 69.\n\nSo in the first round, Bobby Nichols scored 69 and Jim Simons scored 71. Since 69 < 71, Bobby did indeed have a better score in the first round than the eventual winner.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE because the third-place player (Bobby Nichols) had a lower (better) score than the winner (Jim Simons) in the first round.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I compared the first-round scores of the 3rd-place player with the winner. Bobby Nichols scored 69, and Jim Simons scored 71.

It mentions that only three golfers have scores under par across two separate rounds. So, my task is to check each row in the table and see which golfers scored below par.\n\nLooking at the 'score' column: \n- jim simons (a) has 207.\n- jack nicklaus has 209.\n- bobby nichols has 210.\n- lee trevino, george archer, jim colbert, bob erickson each have 211.\n- ken still, larry hinson, bruce devlin have 212.\n\nThe 'to par' column indicates whether the score is under, at, or above par.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more than 2 player scores under par at the 1971 US Open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim is about the number of players with scores under par in the tournament. \"Under par\" means their score is lower than a par score. Typically, par is 70, so a score of 69 would be under par by one stroke.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has a player's name, country, score, and to par status. The 'score' column shows each player's total after three rounds, and the 'to par' column indicates their final score relative to par (e.g., -3 for under par by 3 strokes).\n\nI need to count how many players have scores that are under par, which is when the 'to par' is negative or if the score is less than 70. Wait, in this table, the 'score' column includes all three rounds summed, so it's a total score. The 'to par' might be after considering all four rounds, but I think in golf tournaments like majors, they often have a 72-hole format, but sometimes it's 54 holes for champions. Hmm, maybe the 'score' is the final total, and 'to par' is based on that.\n\nWait, looking at the table: For example, Jim Simons has a score of 207, which is 3 under par (71+71+65=207). So his 'to par' is -3. Similarly, others have their totals and to par calculated.\n\nSo I need to look at each player's total score and see if it's below the standard par of 70 or not. But actually, in professional golf, a player's score is considered under par relative to the par of the course. The US Open is usually played at a par 70 or par 71 course, depending on the year and venue. Since this is the 1971 US Open, I should check what the course par was.\n\nWait, I don't have that information here, but looking up typical US Opens, in 1971, it was held at the Canterbury Golf Club in Ohio, which I believe had a par 71 layout. So par would be 70 or 71? Maybe each hole has different par, but overall, the total for 72 holes might have a par of 70 or 71.\n\nBut since the 'to par' is given as, for example, -3 (for Simons) and -1 (Nicklaus), etc., that suggests that the total score relative to par is being calculated. So if the player's total is below the course's par, they are under par.\n\nSo, in this table, each player has a 'to par' which can be negative or positive. If it's negative, that means their total score was less than the par of the course, thus under par.\n\nTherefore, to count players with scores under par, I need to look at all rows where 'to par' is negative.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: Jim Simons (a) -3 \u2192 Under par.\nRow 1: Jack Nicklaus -1 \u2192 Under par.\nRow 2: Bobby Nichols: e \u2192 Maybe this is a typo. The column is 'to par', so perhaps it's '+e'? Wait, in the table, for row 2, to par is 'e'. That might be an error, or perhaps it's a specific notation. Alternatively, maybe it's a plus two? But looking at the other rows, they have numbers with '+' signs, like +1 and +3.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nRow 0: -3\nRow 1: -1\nRow 2: 'e' \u2192 Hmm, that's confusing.\nRow 3: t4 players have +1 each.\nRows t8 have +2 each.\n\nSo, Bobby Nichols has 'to par' as 'e', which might be a mistake. Maybe it should be '+e'? Or perhaps it's 'Even'? Because if you make no birdies or eagles, your score is even. So maybe Bobby Nichols had an even score, so his to par is 0.\n\nBut in that case, 0 isn't under par. So only players with negative numbers are under par.\n\nTherefore:\n\nJim Simons: -3 \u2192 Under\nJack Nicklaus: -1 \u2192 Under\n\nBobby Nichols: 'e' \u2192 Maybe 0 \u2192 Not under.\nLee Trevino: +1 \u2192 Over\nGeorge Archer: +1 \u2192 Over\nJim Colbert: +1 \u2192 Over\nBob Erickson: +1 \u2192 Over\nKen Still: +2 \u2192 Over\nLarry Hinson: +2 \u2192 Over\nBruce Devlin: +2 \u2192 Over\n\nSo only two players are under par. The claim says \"more than 2 player scores under par.\" So if it's exactly 2, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Jim Simons -3 \u2192 Under\nRow 1: Jack Nicklaus -1 \u2192 Under\nRow 2: Bobby Nichols 'e' \u2192 Maybe 0 or even, so not under.\nRows 3-6 (t4): +1 each \u2192 Over\nRows t8: +2 each \u2192 Over\n\nSo only two players are under par. Therefore, the number of players under par is 2.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 2,\" which would be 3 or more. So if it's exactly 2, then the statement is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about Bobby Nichols' 'e'. If his to par is even (0), he's not under. But if 'e' stands for something else, maybe under? Or maybe in this context, 'e' is used differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some scoring systems, 'e' could mean a birdie or an eagle, but I think that affects the score positively, not negatively. So Bobby Nichols would have no under par.\n\nSo total of 2 players under par.\n\nThus, the claim says \"more than 2,\" which is false because it's exactly 2. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe number of players with scores under par in the 1971 U.S. Open was two: Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus. The claim that there were more than two players under par is therefore incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; only two players had scores under par.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"more than 4 player score better on the first round than the eventual winner.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The \"eventual winner\" would be the player who ended up in the highest position, which from the table looks like Jim Simons (a) because he's ranked number 1. So, we're comparing his first-round score against other players' first-round scores to see if more than four players scored better than him.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their place, country, score, and to par. The \"score\" column shows the sum of three rounds. But wait, the claim is about the first round, but in the table, it seems like the total score is given as the sum of all three rounds (like 71 + 71 + 65 = 207). So that might be a problem because the claim refers to the first round, but the table only shows the total or maybe each round's scores are not explicitly given. Hmm, this could be confusing.\n\nWait, in the table, under \"score\", it's written as \"71 + 71 + 65 = 207.\" So that seems like the sum of all three rounds. But if the claim is about the first round score, I need to figure out what each player's first-round score was. However, the table only shows the total or maybe individual scores per round aren't explicitly provided beyond their sum.\n\nWait no, looking again, actually, perhaps each number before the plus sign represents a single round's score. For example, for Jim Simons: 71 + 71 + 65 = 207. So each of those numbers is a separate round, maybe? So first round could be the first number in each player's score. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at another row: Jack Nicklaus has 69 +72+68=209. So his first round would be 69. Similarly, Bobby Nichols: 69 +72+69=210, so first round 69 as well. Lee Trevino: 70 +72+69=211, first round 70.\n\nSo each player's score is the sum of three rounds, with each round's score listed before the plus signs. So, for each player, their first-round score is the first number in that sequence.\n\nNow, the claim is about \"player score better on the first round than the eventual winner.\" The eventual winner is Jim Simons (a) with a first-round score of 71.\n\nSo, I need to check how many players had a first-round score higher than 71. Let's go through each player:\n\n1. Jim Simons: 71\n2. Jack Nicklaus: 69 (tied at 69)\n3. Bobby Nichols: 69\n4. Lee Trevino:70\n5. George Archer:71\n6. Jim Colbert:69\n7. Bob Erickson:71\n8. Ken Still:71\n9. Larry Hinson:71\n10. Bruce Devlin:72\n\nWait, but the table has \"t4\", \"t8\" etc., so I think each row represents a player's position after all rounds. But for the first round, we need to see their individual scores.\n\nSo for each row:\n\n- Jim Simons (row 0): 71\n- Jack Nicklaus (row1):69\n- Bobby Nichols (row2):69\n- Lee Trevino (row3):70\n- George Archer (row4):71\n- Jim Colbert (row5):69\n- Bob Erickson (row6):71\n- Ken Still (row7):71\n- Larry Hinson (row8):71\n- Bruce Devlin (row9):72\n\nWait, but in the table, row indices start at 0. So row 0 is Jim Simons, and so on.\n\nNow, to find how many players scored better than Jim Simons' first round score of 71.\n\nLooking at all the first-round scores:\n\n- Jim Simons:71\n- Jack Nicklaus:69\n- Bobby Nichols:69\n- Lee Trevino:70\n- George Archer:71\n- Jim Colbert:69\n- Bob Erickson:71\n- Ken Still:71\n- Larry Hinson:71\n- Bruce Devlin:72\n\nSo, how many players have a first-round score higher than 71? Only Bruce Devlin with 72.\n\nWait, that's just one player. So more than four would be false because only one has a higher score than Jim Simons in the first round.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\n- Jim Simons:71\nOthers:\nJack N:69 <71\nBobby N:69<71\nLee T:70<71\nGeorge A:71=71\nJim C:69<71\nBob E:71=71\nKen S:71=71\nLarry H:71=71\nBruce D:72>71\n\nSo only Bruce Devlin has a higher first-round score than Jim Simons. So that's one player.\n\nTherefore, more than four players did not score better; only one did. So the claim is false because it says \"more than 4,\" which would require at least five. Since there's only one, it's false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misunderstood the table. Maybe the scores after \"+\" are cumulative or something else.\n\nWait, in the table:\n\nFor example, Jim Simons:71 +71+65=207\n\nSo each of those 71s is probably a different round? Or maybe it's three rounds with those scores.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"score\" column is the total score, not individual rounds. But the claim refers to first-round scores, so if that's ambiguous in the table, we might have an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps each number before \"+\" is a separate round. So 71+71+65=207 implies three rounds with scores 71,71,65.\n\nSo, the first round for Jim Simons is 71, second 71, third 65.\n\nIf that's the case, then in his first round he scored 71, which is what we have.\n\nOther players' first rounds:\n\nJack Nicklaus:69\nBobby Nichols:69\nLee Trevino:70\nGeorge Archer:71\nJim Colbert:69\nBob Erickson:71\nKen Still:71\nLarry Hinson:71\nBruce Devlin:72\n\nSo, only Bruce Devlin has a higher first-round score than Jim Simons. Therefore, more than four players didn't; only one.\n\nThus, the claim is false because only one player (Bruce Devlin) scored higher in the first round than the eventual winner.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that more than four players scored better than Jim Simons in their first rounds. However, upon analyzing the scores:\n\n- **Jim Simons** had a first-round score of 71.\n- Only **Bruce Devlin** scored higher with a first-round score of 72.\n\nNo other player achieved a higher score than 71 in their first round. Therefore, there are not more than four players who outperformed Jim Simons in the first round; only one did.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false.",

    "claim": "more than 3 golfer score under par on 3 separate round",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim says, \"more than 3 golfers scored under par in separate rounds.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The rows list each golfer's performance. My focus is on the 'score' and 'to par' columns because the claim is about scoring under par.\n\nUnderstandably, in golf, a \"under par\" score means that the golfer scored less than the par (which is typically 70 or 71 depending on the course). Wait, actually, I think it's relative. A player scores under par if their total over three rounds is less than the par. So, for example, in the table, Jim Simons has a score of 207. Since par is usually around 210 (as some players have +1 or -3), his 207 would indeed be under par.\n\nSo I need to go through each row and check if the 'score' is under par. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Jim Simons: Score 207, To Par -3 \u2192 Under par.\n2. Jack Nicklaus: 209, -1 \u2192 Under par.\n3. Bobby Nichols: 210, E (even) \u2192 Not under par since it's equal to par.\n4. Lee Trevino: 211, +1 \u2192 Not under par.\n5. George Archer: 211, +1 \u2192 Same as above.\n6. Jim Colbert: 211, +1 \u2192 Not under par.\n7. Bob Erickson: 211, +1 \u2192 Not under par.\n8. Ken Still: 212, +2 \u2192 Not under par.\n9. Larry Hinson: 212, +2 \u2192 Not under par.\n10. Bruce Devlin: 212, +2 \u2192 Not under par.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"more than 3 golfers score under par in separate rounds.\" Hmm, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Maybe it's about more than three players having scores below par in their respective rounds? Or perhaps it's about each of their total scores being under par across the three rounds.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nJim Simons: 207 (-3) \u2192 Under.\nJack Nicklaus: 209 (-1) \u2192 Under.\nBobby Nichols: 210 (E) \u2192 Not under.\nLee Trevino: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\nGeorge Archer: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\nJim Colbert: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\nBob Erickson: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\nKen Still: 212 (+2) \u2192 Not under.\nLarry Hinson: 212 (+2) \u2192 Not under.\nBruce Devlin: 212 (+2) \u2192 Not under.\n\nSo only the first two players (Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus) scored under par. That's only two, which is less than three. Wait, but the claim says \"more than 3,\" so does that mean over three? Then it's false because there are only two.\n\nBut wait, I think I might be misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's about each round individually? So in separate rounds, more than three golfers scored under par. Looking at the 'to par' column, which shows for each round how they did. But that doesn't seem right because the 'score' is per player across all rounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to each golfer having a score that's under par in separate events or something else. The wording isn't entirely clear. However, based on how the table presents the total scores, it's about whether their three-round total was under par.\n\nIn that case, only two golfers had totals under par. So the claim stating more than 3 is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"more than 3 golfer score under par on 3 separate rounds,\" we need to analyze each player's total score across three rounds. A score is considered under par if it's less than the standard par (typically around 210). \n\nChecking each row:\n\n1. Jim Simons: 207 (-3) \u2192 Under par.\n2. Jack Nicklaus: 209 (-1) \u2192 Under par.\n3. Bobby Nichols: 210 (E) \u2192 Not under.\n4. Lee Trevino: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\n5. George Archer: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\n6. Jim Colbert: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\n7. Bob Erickson: 211 (+1) \u2192 Not under.\n8. Ken Still: 212 (+2) \u2192 Not under.\n9. Larry Hinson: 212 (+2) \u2192 Not under.\n10. Bruce Devlin: 212 (+2) \u2192 Not under.\n\nOnly two players (Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus) scored under par, which is less than three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
