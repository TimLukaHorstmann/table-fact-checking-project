    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latyna\" is true by checking the provided table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nI know Michael Phelps and Larisa Latyna are both Olympians, but from different times. So their medal counts would likely be from different Olympics. The table seems to list their achievements, so I need to parse it correctly.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific achievement with details like the event and whether it's a gold (g) or silver (s). For both Phelps and Latyna, there are multiple rows, which suggests they've won several medals. \n\nI should look for all the rows where their names appear and tally up the number of medals each has. Michael Phelps is listed from 2012, so those would be recent achievements, probably across different events like swimming. Larisa Latyna, on the other hand, is listed with achievements from 1964, which were likely in gymnastics.\n\nStarting with Michael Phelps: his entries are from row 18 to 22. Each of these rows represents a unique medal\u2014so that's 5 medals so far. Wait, actually, each row might represent one medal because the column seems to be for specific events, not totals. So if there are multiple rows for Phelps, each would add to his total count.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data, each row is an individual achievement. For example, row 18: 200m butterfly s (silver), row 19: 4x200m freestyle g (gold), and so on. So each of these is a separate medal. Michael Phelps has 5 entries in the table, meaning he's won 5 medals.\n\nLarisa Latyna's entries are from rows 21 to 26, but looking at the table, her entries start at row 21: \"22 october 1964\" etc., and she has multiple achievements: all - around s, vault s, uneven bars b, balance beam b, floor exercise g. That seems like more than one medal per event, perhaps? Or maybe each is a different medal.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row in the table seems to represent one specific achievement or medal. So for Larisa Latyna, from row 21 to 26, that's 6 entries. Each of those would be a separate medal. Therefore, she has 6 medals.\n\nBut wait, let me count again. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 18: Michael Phelps\n- Rows 19-22: Phelps (5 rows)\n- Rows 21-26: Larisa Latyna (6 rows)\n\nWait, but in the table provided, rows go from 0 to 26? Let me recount.\n\nThe user's table has 27 entries because it starts at row_index 0 and ends at 26. So:\n\nMichael Phelps is listed at row indices 18-22: that's 5 rows (2012 games).\nLarisa Latyna is listed at row indices 21-26: that's 6 rows (1964 games).\n\nSo Michael has 5 medals, Larisa has 6. But wait, looking again, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, no\u2014Michael Phelps starts at row 18 and ends at 22, which is 5 entries. Larisa Latyna starts at row 21 and goes up to row 26, which is 6 entries. So Michael has fewer medals than Larisa.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latyna\" would be false because he has fewer (5 vs 6).\n\nBut wait, I should double-check each athlete's count.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Michael Phelps: rows 18,19,20,21,22 \u2192 5 entries.\n- For Larisa Latyna: rows 21,22,23,24,25,26 \u2192 6 entries.\n\nYes, that's correct. So Michael has 5 medals, and Larisa has 6. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latyna, we analyze their respective achievements listed in the table. Each row represents one medal, with \"g\" for gold and \"s\" for silver.\n\n- **Michael Phelps**: 5 medals (rows 18 to 22)\n- **Larisa Latyna**: 6 medals (rows 21 to 26)\n\nThus, Michael Phelps does not have more medals than Larisa Latyna. The claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Michael Phelps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Michael Phelps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Michael Phelps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Michael Phelps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Michael Phelps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Larisa Latyna\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Larisa Latyna\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Larisa Latyna\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Larisa Latyna\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Larisa Latyna\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Larisa Latyna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by looking at the table structure and see where these names appear.\n\nFirst, I'll search for Robert Garrett in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find him in row 2 under the \"Name\" column with the value \"Robert Garrett\". The country listed there is \"United States\".\n\nNext, I'll look for James Connolly.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check whether the claim \"Larisa Latyna has 7 more medals than Carl Osburn\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's required here.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row and column in the table to find all relevant cells that relate to Larisa Latyna and Carl Osburn. The claim mentions their names, so I'll focus on rows where either name appears.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Larisa Latynina** is listed 13 times (rows 21, 22, etc.), but her name here might be a typo; it should probably be Larisa Latyna.\n  \n- **Carl Osburn** is in row 18 with a medal count of 1 for the event \"Balance Beam B\".\n\nNow, I need to check how many medals Larisa has. Scanning through her rows:\n\n- Row 14: All-around S (1)\n- Row 15: Vault S (1)\n- Row 16: Uneven Bars B (1)\n- Row 17: Balance Beam B (1)\n- Row 18: Floor Exercise G (1)\n\nWait, that's five medals. But I think I might be missing some because there are more rows for her. Let me recount properly.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows for Larisa Latynina:\n14,15,16,17,18,21,22. Wait, no, row 21 is Michael Phelps. So correct rows are 14,15,16,17,18.\n\nSo that's five medals in total: All-around (S), Vault (S), Uneven Bars (B), Balance Beam (B), Floor Exercise (G). Hmm, that adds up to five medals. But wait, row 21 is Michael Phelps, so maybe I'm missing some. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, no, rows 14-18 are her five medals. So she has five medals. Carl Osburn has one medal.\n\nThe claim says Larisa has seven more than Carl. If Larisa has five and Carl has one, that's four more, not seven. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the table because perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Carl Osburn**: row 18 is \"Balance Beam B\", so 1 medal.\n- **Larisa Latynina** (assuming that's correct in the table): rows 14,15,16,17,18. Wait, no, row 18 is also Larisa? Let me check:\n\nYes, rows 14-18 are all Larisa except row 18 is her as well. So five medals.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again, rows 21 and beyond are Michael Phelps, so maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list out each medal for Larisa:\n\n- Row 14: All-around S (1)\n- Row 15: Vault S (1)\n- Row 16: Uneven Bars B (1)\n- Row 17: Balance Beam B (1)\n- Row 18: Floor Exercise G (1)\n\nThat's five medals. So 5 - 1 = 4, which is not seven. Therefore, the claim seems to be false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again because maybe I missed some rows for Larisa. Looking at the table:\n\nRows where name is Larisa Latynina (assuming that's correct):\n\n- Row 14: All-around S\n- Row 15: Vault S\n- Row 16: Uneven Bars B\n- Row 17: Balance Beam B\n- Row 18: Floor Exercise G\n\nThat's five medals.\n\nCarl Osburn is in row 18 with one medal. So Larisa has five, Carl has one. 5 -1 =4, not seven. Therefore, the claim that she has seven more is false.\n\nSo I need to check which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be:\n\n- All rows where Larisa's medals are listed (rows 14,15,16,17,18)\n- Carl's row (row 18)\n\nWait, but in the table, Carl's row is row 18 for \"Balance Beam B\" with a count of 1. So I need to include all cells where Larisa's medal counts are: rows 14,15,16,17,18.\n\nEach of these rows has a column_name, which is the event, and the count (though in the table it's not shown; perhaps the counts are in another column). Wait, no, the columns are fixed as per the initial table. The user didn't provide a \"Medals\" column, so I think each row is an individual medal? Or maybe the last column is the medal count.\n\nWait, looking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: row_index, Event, Medal Count? Or perhaps the event and then a count in another column? Wait, the initial problem says to look for the number of medals. So I think each row represents an individual medal, so the count is the sum across the row.\n\nWait no, looking at row 14: \"All-around S\" with a count. But without seeing the actual table, it's hard to tell. Wait, in the initial problem, the user provided a table where each row has event and medal count? Or perhaps each cell is an event and the sum per row is the total medals.\n\nWait, no. The table seems to be structured with columns: Event, then medal counts (but without seeing it, I'm assuming that each row's last entry is the number of medals for that event). Alternatively, maybe each row is a single medal.\n\nBut in this case, for Larisa, she has multiple medals across different events. So to find her total, we need to sum all her medals across rows 14-18.\n\nSimilarly, Carl has one medal in row 18.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Larisa: rows 14,15,16,17,18\n- For Carl: row 18\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row might represent a single medal. So for each of her events, she has one medal, so five in total.\n\nTherefore, the number of medals per person is:\n\nLarisa: 5\n\nCarl:1\n\nDifference:4, not7.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Larisa Latyna has seven more medals than Carl Osburn is incorrect. Based on the table analysis, Larisa has five medals and Carl has one, resulting in a difference of four medals.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - **Larisa Latyna:** Rows 14 (All-around S), 15 (Vault S), 16 (Uneven Bars B), 17 (Balance Beam B), 18 (Floor Exercise G).\n   - **Carl Osburn:** Row 18 (Balance Beam B).\n\n2. **Count Medals:**\n   - Larisa: 5 medals.\n   - Carl: 1 medal.\n\n3. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - 5 (Larisa) - 1 (Carl) = 4.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Larisa Latyna has four more medals than Carl Osburn, not seven.",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that one athlete received a medal specifically for the pommel horse event. So, I should look through the table to find any row where an athlete's name is listed under \"pommel horse\" and see if they received a medal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a row index, athlete name, country, sport, and event. I need to check each row for the \"event\" column to see if it matches \"pommel horse.\" Once I find that event, I should verify if any medals were awarded in that category.\n\nI'll start from row 0:\n- Row 0: Event is \"vault,\" so not relevant.\nRow 1: Event is \"balance beam.\"\nRow 2: \"Floor exercise.\"\nRow 3: \"Uneven bars.\"\nRow 4: \"Balance beam.\"\nRow 5: \"Vault.\"\nRow 6: \"All - around.\"\nRow 7: \" Vault s\" (I think it's a typo, but still not pommel horse).\nRow 8: \"Pommel horse.\" Oh, here we go. The athlete is Larisa Latynina from the Soviet Union in 1964.\nNow, checking if they received a medal for this event. In row 8, their sport is gymnastics and the event is \"pommel horse.\" The cell doesn't specify medals, but looking at other rows with the same athlete, like row 21, it's clear that she won multiple events and likely medals.\n\nSince there's an entry for pommel horse in the table, I can confirm that at least one athlete received a medal for this event. So the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data as there is an entry for an athlete receiving a medal in the pommel horse event.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim is true based on some data in a table. The claim is: \"3 athlete receive medal in gymnastics.\" My task is to figure out which cells in the table support or contradict this claim and then decide whether the answer should be TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. It has several columns like Row Index, Event Name, Athlete, Age, Nationality, and Medal. Each row represents a different event with details about the athlete who participated in it.\n\nNow, the claim is specifically about gymnastics medals. So I should focus on rows where the Event Name is related to gymnastics. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Vault by Larisa Latynina from the Soviet Union. That's a gymnastic event.\n- Row 1: Floor Exercise by the same athlete, so that's another gymnastic event.\n- Rows 2 and onwards up to 17 are all about different gymnastic events like Uneven Bars, Balance Beam, etc., all under Gymnastics.\n\nAfter row 18, the events switch to Swimming with Michael Phelps. So rows beyond 18 aren't relevant for this claim since we're only looking at gymnastics medals.\n\nNow, focusing on rows 0 through 17, I need to count how many times an athlete received a medal in Gymnastics. The key column here is \"Medal.\" The values are either 'g' or 'b', which likely stand for Gold and Bronze. So each row where Event Name is Gymnastics and Medal is not null (i.e., has a value) indicates a medal was awarded.\n\nLet me count the number of such rows:\n\n- Row 0: Vault, Medal 'g' \u2192 counts.\n- Row 1: Floor Exercise, Medal 'g' \u2192 counts.\n- Row 2: Team G \u2192 counts.\n- Row 3: All-around S \u2192 counts.\n- Row 4: Vault S \u2192 counts.\n- Row 5: Uneven Bars B \u2192 counts.\n- Row 6: Balance Beam B \u2192 counts.\n- Row 7: Floor Exercise G \u2192 counts.\n\nSo that's 8 rows where an athlete received a medal in Gymnastics. However, the claim is about \"3 athletes,\" which suggests three individuals each receiving a medal. But wait, each row here represents one event and one athlete winning a medal. So if there are multiple events per athlete, does that count as multiple medals for the same athlete?\n\nLooking at the data, Larisa Latynina appears in rows 0 through 17, specifically as an athlete in Gymnastics. Each of her events is a separate row with her name. So she has multiple medals in different events. But the claim says \"3 athletes,\" not three medals.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the count. The table lists each event separately, so each time a different gymnastic event is mentioned, it's a separate instance. However, if an athlete wins multiple medals, they are listed as separate rows but same athlete. So in terms of athletes receiving medals, how many unique individuals are there?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Larisa Latynina \u2192 1st athlete.\n- Rows 21 and beyond: Michael Phelps for Swimming. Not relevant here.\n\nWait, from row 18 onwards, it's about Michael Phelps, so only rows 0 through 17 are gymnastics. Within those, I see that all medalists in these events are Larisa Latynina. So is she the only athlete mentioned? Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Athlete is Larisa.\n- Rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7: All same athlete.\n\nSo it seems that only one athlete received medals in gymnastics during those events. Therefore, there's only one athlete who got multiple medals, but the claim is about three athletes receiving medals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If each row represents a different event where an athlete receives a medal, then the total number of athletes would be the count of unique names in the Gymnastics rows.\n\nIn this case, the only name listed under Gymnastics is Larisa Latynina, so she's the only athlete. Therefore, only one athlete received medals in gymnastics, which doesn't align with the claim of three athletes.\n\nWait, but looking again at the table, I see that after row 17, it goes back to Swimming. So rows 18 and onwards are Swimming, not Gymnastics. The initial part from row 0 to 17 is all Gymnastics events, and within those, only Larisa Latynina is mentioned as the athlete.\n\nTherefore, in the Gymnastics section, only one athlete received medals across multiple events. So the claim says \"3 athletes,\" which would be incorrect because there's only one. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"3 athlete receive medal in gymnastics\" is based on analyzing the table data. The table shows that only Larisa Latynina, a single athlete, received medals across various Gymnastics events from rows 0 to 17. There are no other athletes listed under Gymnastics in those rows. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as there's only one athlete who received medals, not three.\n\nAnswer: FALSE",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Michael Phelps has less medal than Larisa Latyna\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who Michael Phelps and Larisa Latyna are in relation to medals. From the table, it looks like both are Olympic athletes with a significant number of medals. I know that Michael Phelps is a famous American swimmer, and Larisa Latynina was a Soviet Union gymnast. Both have won multiple gold medals.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different medal event or achievement. The columns include details like the name of the event (like \"200 m butterfly\", etc.), the number of medals in that event (either 's' for silver or 'g' for gold), and the country they represented.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to compare the total number of medals each person has won. So, my first step is to count how many medals Michael Phelps has in total. Similarly, I'll do the same for Larisa Latyna.\n\nStarting with Michael Phelps, let's go through each relevant row:\n\n1. Row 18: He got a gold medal in \"200 m butterfly\".\n2. Row 19: Gold in \"4 x 200 m freestyle\".\n3. Row 20: Gold in \"200 m individual medley\".\n4. Row 21: Gold in \"100 m butterfly\".\n5. Row 22: Gold in \"4 x 100 m medley relay\".\n\nSo, Michael has 5 gold medals listed here. Wait, but I remember that Michael Phelps actually won a total of 28 Olympic medals, including 23 golds, which is a huge number. But according to the table provided, only certain events are listed. So in this table, he's shown with 5 golds.\n\nNow, looking at Larisa Latynina, specifically rows 21-25. She has multiple medals:\n\n1. Row 21: Gold in \"team\".\n2. Row 22: Silver in \"all - around\".\n3. Row 23: Gold in \"vault\".\n4. Row 24: Bronze in \"uneven bars\".\n5. Row 25: Bronze in \"balance beam\".\n6. Row 26: Gold in \"floor exercise\".\n\nThat's a total of 6 medals: 3 golds and 3 bronzes, but the table uses 'g' for gold and 'b' for bronze? Wait, no, looking back at the columns, I think each cell shows either 's' or 'g'. So perhaps in this table, only golds are marked as 'g', and others might not be. Hmm, maybe the table doesn't show all medals but just specific ones.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again, each row has a column for event type with 's' or 'g', which I think stands for silver and gold. So Larisa's total in this table would be 4 golds (rows 21,23,26, and maybe another? Wait, rows 21-26: rows 21,22,23,24,25,26.\n\nRow 21: Gold (g)\nRow 22: Silver (s) or bronze?\nWait, I might have misinterpreted the columns. Let me check again. The table's columns are \"Name\", \"Country\", \"Sport\", and \"Medal\". Wait no, looking at the initial problem, the table has four columns: Name, Country, Sport, Medal.\n\nSo for each row, the Medal column is either 'g' or 's'. So for Larisa Latynina:\n\nRows 21-26:\nRow 21: Gold (g)\nRow 22: Silver (s)\nRow 23: Gold (g)\nRow 24: Bronze (b)\nRow 25: Bronze (b)\nRow 26: Gold (g)\n\nWait, but the columns don't list 'b', so maybe only 's' and 'g' are shown. Hmm, perhaps the table is simplified to show only gold and silver medals, but in reality, she has more.\n\nBut according to the data provided, Larisa has:\n\n- Row 21: Gold (1)\n- Row 22: Silver (2)\n- Row 23: Gold (3)\n- Row 24: Bronze (4)\n- Row 25: Bronze (5)\n- Row 26: Gold (6)\n\nSo in this table, she has 6 medals: 3 golds and 3 bronzes, but maybe only considering 'g' and 's', her total would be 4 golds. Wait, no, the Medal column is either 'g' or 's'. So perhaps in the table, bronze isn't shown as a separate medal. Alternatively, each row represents one medal, so she has multiple medals listed here.\n\nBut Michael Phelps has 5 golds and possibly more elsewhere not shown in this table. However, based on what's provided, in this table, Michael has 5 golds (rows 18-22), while Larisa has 4 golds (rows 21,23,26) plus a silver and bronze.\n\nSo comparing the two: Michael has 5 golds, Larisa has 4. Therefore, Michael has more medals than Larisa in this context.\n\nWait, but that's only based on the data provided. In reality, Michael Phelps has way more medals than Larisa Latynina, but perhaps in the table, it's simplified.\n\nBut according to the table as given:\n\nMichael: rows 18-22 = 5 golds\nLarisa: rows 21,23,26 = 3 golds (assuming that the other medals are not shown). Wait, no, row 21 is Gold, row 22 is Silver, so that's one. Then row 23 is Gold (2), row 24 Bronze (maybe 3), row 25 Bronze (4), row 26 Gold (5).\n\nSo in total, she has 5 medals: 3 golds and 2 bronzes. But again, the table might not list all her medals, only some.\n\nBut according to what's provided here, Michael has more medals than Larisa. Therefore, the claim that Michael has less is false.\n</think>\n\nMichael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latynina based on the comparison of their medals as listed in the table. \n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latynina according to the provided data.",

First, I'll look through the table to see who these two individuals are and what their countries are.\n\nLooking at the table, I see Robert Garrett listed in row 4 under the country column as the United States. James Connolly isn't immediately obvious, so I'll scan further down. In row 15, there's a James Connolly with the country also being the United States. Wait, that means both Robert Garrett and James Connolly represent the same country, not different ones.\n\nHmm, but the claim says they represent different countries. Since both are from the US, this must be false. I should check the table again to make sure I didn't miss any entries for James Connolly in other countries, but as far as I can see, he's only listed under the United States.

The columns we're interested in are \"Athlete\" and \"Medal,\" specifically looking for pommel horse. \n\nStarting from row 0: The athlete is not specified here. The column doesn't mention pommel horse, so it's probably not relevant.\n\nRow 1: Again, no athlete listed and no pommel horse entry.

Continuing until the end of the table. \n\nI see that row 5 mentions Larisa Latynina with a medal in vault, but that's not pommel horse. Row 6 has uneven bars, also not pommel horse.\n\nLooking back at the columns: I might have missed it earlier. Wait, row 3 lists a gymnast named Vitaly Scherbo who won a bronze medal in pommel horse.

First, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that no athletes in the table received a medal for gymnastics.\n\nLooking at the table, I see various columns like 'Name', 'Nationality', 'Sport', and 'Medal'. The rows go from 0 to 22, each representing an athlete with their respective details. My task is to check if any of these athletes have a medal in gymnastics.\n\nTo do this, I'll need to focus on the relevant cells. That means I should look at the rows where the 'Sport' is Gymnastics and the 'Medal' column has a value. Any such occurrence would mean that athlete received a medal in gymnastics, which would make the claim false.\n\nStarting from row 0, I see the first athlete's sport as Gymnastics. Looking at the 'Medal' cell, it says 'g'. Assuming 'g' stands for gold, this means Michael Phelps got a gold medal in swimming, not gymnastics. Wait, no, the sport is swimming here, so that's irrelevant.\n\nMoving on, I'll need to check each row where 'Sport' is Gymnastics. From the table provided, rows 21 to 29 (but actually looking at the data, it seems only up to row 22) have 'Gymnastics' as their sport.\n\nFor example, in row 14, the athlete is Larisa Latynina from the Soviet Union, and her medal is 's', which likely stands for silver. Her sport is Gymnastics, so this means she received a silver medal in gymnastics. That directly contradicts the claim that none of the athletes received a medal in gymnastics.\n\nTherefore, since there's at least one athlete (Larisa Latynina) who received a medal in gymnastics, the original claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"none of the athletes receive a medal in gymnastics,\" we need to check if any athlete in the table has 'Gymnastics' as their sport and has a medal.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Only rows where the 'Sport' is Gymnastics are relevant.\n2. **Check for Medals in those Rows:** For each of these rows, check if there's a value in the 'Medal' column.\n3. **Conclusion:** If any such row exists, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells Found:**\n- Row 14: Larisa Latynina received a Silver medal in Gymnastics.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
