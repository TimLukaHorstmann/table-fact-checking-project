    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure and identify which parts of the claim correspond to specific cells. The claim mentions two key pieces: \"Susan Sarandon,\" \"winner nominee,\" and \"2001.\" \n\nLooking at the columns in the table, they are year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. Each row represents a different award or category.\n\nI need to find if there's a row where the winner/nominee is Susan Sarandon and the year is 2001. So I'll scan through each row:\n\n- 1997: The winner/nominee is Rosalie O'Donnell, not Susan.\n- 1999: N/A for winner, so no.\n- 2001: Category is \"favorite voice from an animated movie,\" film is \"Rugrats in Paris: The Movie,\" and the winner/nominee is Susan Sarandon. That's a match because 2001 is the year, and she's listed as the winner here.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows for 2001 to make sure there's only one entry. There's only one row for 2001, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this specific cell in the table. So I should mark it as TRUE and list the relevant cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Bruce Willis be nominate for the film Rugrats Go Wild\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and understanding what each column represents.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: it has columns for year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. Each row corresponds to a different award or nomination, probably from some ceremony like the Oscars or maybe another award show.\n\nThe claim mentions Bruce Willis being nominated for \"Rugrats Go Wild.\" So I need to look through each row to see if any of them match both aspects: the film title and the person's name.\n\nStarting with 1997: The category is \"favorite movie actress,\" and the film is \"Harriet the Spy.\" The winner/nominee is Rosalie O'Donnell, nominated. Doesn't match Bruce Willis or Rugrats Go Wild.\n\nNext, 1999: The category is favorite movie, film is The Rugrats Movie, result is won. N/A for nominees. Not relevant since it's about the Rugrats Movie, not Go Wild.\n\n2001: Category is favorite voice from an animated movie, film is Rugrats in Paris, winner is Susan Sarandon. Not Bruce or Go Wild.\n\n2004: Favorite voice category again, but this time the film is Rugrats Go Wild. The nominee here is Bruce Willis. That seems relevant because it matches both the person's name and the film title. So that row (row index 3) in column \"winner / nominee(s)\" would be important.\n\nThen there's 2005: Favorite movie actor, film is Lemony Snicket's..., nominee is Jim Carrey. Not relevant here.\n\n2007 has two entries: first for favorite movie actor (Nacho Libre, Jack Black nominated), and another for favorite movie actress (Charlotte's Web, Dakota Fanning won). Neither of these is Bruce Willis or Rugrats Go Wild.\n\n2012: Favorite voice category, Rango with Johnny Depp nominated. Not matching.\n\nSo the only row that matches both the film \"Rugrats Go Wild\" and the person Bruce Willis is 2004, where he was nominated in the category of favorite voice from an animated movie. Therefore, the claim's statement about Bruce Willis being nominated for Rugrats Go Wild is supported by this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there is a row in the table (specifically row index 3) that shows Bruce Willis as the nominee for the film \"Rugrats Go Wild.\" \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee(s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"the winner / nominee (s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about the year 2007, category \"favorite movie actor,\" and the person in question is Rosie O'Donnell. So, I need to find the row for 2007 under \"favorite movie actor\" and see who the winner or nominee was.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row until I find one that matches all three: year 2007, category \"favorite movie actor.\" \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- The first rows are for 1997, 1999, 2001, 2004. None of these are 2007.\n- Then there's a row for 2007 with category \"favorite movie actress,\" which is Dakota Fanning winning. That's not the same category as \"actor.\"\n- Next, another 2007 row: category is \"favorite movie actor.\" Here, the film is \"nacho libre\" and the winner/nominee is Jack Black. It says \"nominated,\" so the person nominated is Jack Black, not Rosie O'Donnell.\n- After that, I don't see any other rows for 2007 in the category of \"favorite movie actor.\" \n\nSo, there's no row for 2007 under \"favorite movie actor\" where Rosie O'Donnell was either a winner or nominee. The claim is specifically about her being associated with that position in 2007 for the \"favorite movie actor\" category.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Rosie O'Donnell wasn't nominated or won in that category and year. The relevant cells would be the one where Jack Black was nominated, but since the claim mentions Rosie, that's not matching.\n\nI need to make sure I'm pointing out exactly which cell is relevant. It should be the row for 2007 under \"favorite movie actor,\" column 3 (winner/nominee(s)), and row index is 6. But wait, rows are zero-indexed? Let me check: the first row is index 0, so the 2007 movie actress row is index 6, and the next one is index 7, which is the movie actor row.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is at row_index 7 (for 2007, favorite movie actor), column \"winner / nominee(s).\" The value there is Jack Black, but since the claim mentions Rosie, it's not matching. However, in terms of cells to check, this is the one that needs to be examined.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants to know which cells are relevant for verification. So, I should include all cells that could possibly relate, even if they don't match. In this case, only the row where \"favorite movie actor\" in 2007 is present matters, regardless of who the winner was.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be the one cell at row_index 7, column_name \"winner / nominee(s).\"\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because Rosie wasn't the winner or nominee for that category in 2007.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee(s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\" So, I'm looking for the entry in the table where year is 1999 and category is \"favorite movie\" to see what the result was.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table until I find the one that matches both the year 1999 and the category \"favorite movie\". \n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- 1997: Not 1999, skip.\n- Next is 1999. The category here is \"favorite movie\", which matches what's in the claim. Now, the result for this row is \"won\".\n\nWait, that doesn't match the claim. The claim says it was nominated, but according to the table, it was won.\n\nSo, the result column for 1999 favorite movie shows \"won\", not \"nominated\". Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states the opposite of what's actually in the table.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The row index for the 1999 entry is probably row number 1 (since the first row after <thead> is row 0 or 1 depending on how we count). But looking at the structure, each tr starts with year 1997 as the first data row, so row_index would be 0:1997, 1:1999, etc. So the relevant_cells are for row 1, column \"result\".\n\nWait, let me double-check the table:\n\nLooking at the HTML, the first tbody row is:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1997</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\nSo that's row index 0. The next one is 1999: <tr>, so that's row index 1.\n\nIn row 1, category is \"favorite movie\", and result is \"won\". So yes, the relevant cells are row 1, column \"result\".\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the claim says it was nominated when in reality it was won.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
