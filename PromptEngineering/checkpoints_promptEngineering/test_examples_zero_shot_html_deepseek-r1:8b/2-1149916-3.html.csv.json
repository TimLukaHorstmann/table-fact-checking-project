    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"denny hulme be the driver at anderstorp in 1973\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by carefully analyzing the claim and breaking it down into its components. The key elements are:\n- Driver: Denny Hulme\n- Year: 1973\n- Location: Anderstorp\n\nI should look through each row of the table to find a match for these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and provides information about the driver, constructor, location, and whether a report was filed. \n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1. 1978: Driver is Niki Lauda\n2. 1977: Jacques Laffite\n3. 1976: Jody Scheckter\n4. 1975: Niki Lauda again\n5. 1974: Jody Scheckter\n6. 1973: Denny Hulme. This matches the driver in question, year 1973.\n7. Then there are rows for years before and after 1973, some marked as 'not held'.\n\nSo, in row 1973 (which is actually at index 6 if we start counting from 0), the driver is Denny Hulme, and the location is Anderstorp.\n\nWait, let me check the exact row. The sixth row after 1972-1968: it's for 1973, and the driver is Denny Hulme. The constructor is McLaren-Ford, but that doesn't matter. The key point is that Denny Hulme was indeed driving at Anderstorp in 1973.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's a row for 1973 where \"Denny Hulme\" is listed as the driver and \"Anderstorp\" is the location. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The sixth entry (index 6) corresponds to 1973.\n- In that row, the driver is Denny Hulme and the location is Anderstorp.\n\nSince all parts of the claim match, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
