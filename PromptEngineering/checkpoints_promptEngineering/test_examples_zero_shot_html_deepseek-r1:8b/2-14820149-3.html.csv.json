    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a specific claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the year with the most win in the 250cc class with team ducados - yamaha be 1988 with 3 win.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It's saying that within the 250cc class for the team Ducados - Yamaha, the year 1988 has the highest number of wins, which is 3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should focus on rows where the \"class\" is \"250cc\" and the \"team\" is \"ducados - yamaha.\" Then, within those rows, I need to check the \"wins\" column for each year to see if 1988 has the highest number of wins.\n\nLet me go through the table step by step.\n\nStarting with the first row (row_index 0): year 1984, class 250cc, team Yamaha, points 0, wins 0. This isn't relevant because the team is just \"yamaha\" without the \"- Ducados\" part mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, row 1: 1985, 250cc, jj cobas, 8 points, 0 wins. Not our team.\n\nRow 2: 1986, 500cc, cagiva, 4 points, 0 wins. Different class and team.\n\nRow 3: 1987, 250cc, Ducados - yamaha, 46 points, 0 wins. This is relevant because it's the correct team and class.\n\nRow 4: 1988, 250cc, Ducados - yamaha, 221 points, 3 wins. So in 1988, they have 3 wins.\n\nRow 5: 1989, 250cc, same team, 98 points, 0 wins.\n\nRows 6-10 are either 500cc or not the team in question.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant rows (rows 3 and 4). For the 250cc class and Ducados - yamaha team, I need to check the \"wins\" column. In 1987, they have 0 wins, and in 1988, they have 3 wins. So, up until now, it seems like 1988 has the most wins at 3.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there aren't any other years with higher wins. Let's check all the rows for the 250cc class and Ducados - yamaha team:\n\n- 1987: 0\n- 1988: 3\n- 1989: 0\n- 1990: 500cc, so not relevant.\n- 1991: 500cc\n- 1992: 500cc\n- 1993: cagiva\n\nSo in the 250cc class for this team, the highest number of wins is indeed 3 in 1988. No other year in that specific class and team has more than 0 except 1988 with 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the player have 221 point in 1988 for the 250cc class , but only have 98 point in 1989 for the 250cc class.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what's being claimed. It mentions two specific years, 1988 and 1989, both for the 250cc class. The points in each year are given as 221 and 98, respectively.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant rows and columns. The table has the following columns: year, class, team, points, wins. So, for each claim, I should look up these details.\n\nStarting with 1988: \n- Year is 1988.\n- Class is 250cc.\n- Points are given as 221 in the claim. So I need to check the 'points' column for row 1988 and 250cc class.\n\nLooking at the table, 1988 is indeed a year. The team is \"ducados - yamaha\" and their points are listed as 221. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking 1989:\n- Year is 1989.\n- Class is 250cc.\n- Points in the claim are 98.\n\nIn the table, for 1989, the year is correct. The class is 250cc, and the team is \"ducados - yamaha\" with points listed as 98. So this also matches.\n\nNow, I need to check if all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Since both years' points match what's stated, it seems the claim is accurate based on the table data.\n\nI should identify which cells in the table support these claims. For 1988, row index might correspond to the position in the tbody. Looking at the HTML, each <tr> represents a row. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1984\n2. 1985\n3. 1986\n4. 1987\n5. 1988 (row_index:4)\n6. 1989 (row_index:5)\n7. 1990\n8. 1991\n9. 1992\n10. 1993\n\nSo, for 1988, it's the 5th row in the tbody, which would be index 4 if we start counting from 0? Wait, no\u2014the first <tr> is for 1984, so row 0 is 1984, row 1 is 1985, etc. So 1988 is row 4.\n\nThe 'points' column in this row is indeed 221.\n\nFor 1989, it's the next row, which is row 5. The 'points' here are 98.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 1988: year=1988, class=250cc, points=221. So row_index=4, column_name='points'.\n- For 1989: year=1989, class=250cc, points=98. So row_index=5, column_name='points'.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"player have 221 points in 1988 for 250cc\", which is correct as per row 4. Then it says \"but only have 98 points in 1989 for 250cc\". That's also correct from row 5.\n\nTherefore, both cells are relevant and support the claim fully.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the points for the specified years and class as shown in the table. Both points values match exactly, confirming the correctness of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"team ducados - yamaha have the same number of points in 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class with 121.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The team in question is \"ducados - yamaha.\" The years mentioned are 1990 and 1991, specifically for the 500cc class. The points should be equal between these two years.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows corresponding to 1990 and 1991 under the 500cc class. Each row has columns: year, class, team, points, wins.\n\nStarting with 1990:\n- Year: 1990\n- Class: 500cc\n- Team: ducados - yamaha\n- Points: 121\n\nNext, for 1991:\n- Year: 1991\n- Class: 500cc\n- Team: ducados - yamaha\n- Points: 121\n\nThe points for both years are indeed 121.

It's an HTML table with headers year, class, team, points, and wins.\n\nThe claim refers to two specific years: 1985 and 1986. For each of these years, it mentions points in their respective classes.\n\nStarting with 1985:\n- The table has a row for 1985 under the '250cc' class.\n- Looking at the 'points' column for this row, I see it's 8.\nSo that part checks out: 1985 250cc has 8 points.\n\nNow for 1986:\n- The table also has a row for 1986 under the '500cc' class.\nWait, but the claim mentions \"1986cc\" which seems like a typo. It probably refers to 500cc since that's what's listed for 1986.\nIn the 'points' column for 1986 500cc, it shows 4 points.\nSo that part also checks out: 1986 500cc has 4 points.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. There are 8 points for the 1985 250cc and 4 points for the 1986 500cc (assuming the class is correctly interpreted).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified with two relevant cells: the 1985 250cc row and the 1986 500cc row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me first understand what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"the year with the most point for the 250cc class be 1988 with a total of 221 point.\"\n\nSo, I should look into the 250cc class and check which year has the highest points in that category. According to the table, let's list out the years and their points for 250cc.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 1984: 0\n- 1985: 8\n- 1986: 500cc, so not relevant here.\n- 1987: 46\n- 1988: 221\n- 1989: 98\n- 1990: 500cc, irrelevant.\n- 1991: 121 (Wait, no, 1991 is for 500cc as per the table. Let me double-check that.)\n\nWait, looking at each row:\n\nYear | Class | Team | Points | Wins\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n1984 | 250cc | yamaha | 0 | 0\n1985 | 250cc | jj cobas | 8 | 0\n1986 | 500cc | cagiva | 4 | 0\n1987 | 250cc | ducados - yamaha |46|0\n1988 |250cc |ducados - yamaha |221|3\n1989 |250cc |ducados - yamaha |98|0\n1990 |500cc |ducados - yamaha |121|0\n1991 |500cc |ducados - yamaha |121|0\n1992 |500cc |ducados - yamaha |61|0\n1993 |500cc |cagiva |7|0\n\nWait, in 1986 and beyond, some years are for 500cc. So the relevant rows for 250cc are:\n\n- 1984: 0 points\n- 1985:8\n- 1987:46\n- 1988:221\n- 1989:98\n- So from these, 1988 has the highest points at 221.\n\nThe claim says that 1988 is the year with the most points in 250cc, which matches what I see. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be 'year' and 'points'. Specifically, for the row where it's 250cc and year 1988, so the cells at row_index 7 (since rows start from 0: 0-9). Wait, let me count:\n\nRows:\n\n0: 1984\n1: 1985\n2: 1986 (500cc, not relevant)\n3:1987\n4:1988\n5:1989\n6:1990 (500cc)\n7:1991 (500cc)\n8:1992 (500cc)\n9:1993\n\nSo the row for 1988 is index 4.

First, I'll check if 1988 is indeed a year in the table. Scanning through the 'year' column: 1984, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93. Yes, 1988 is there.\n\nNext, I need to see what class and team were active in 1988.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"team ducados - yamaha have the same number of point in 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class with 61\". So, I need to check if the points for team Dukados - Yamaha in the 500cc class were the same in both 1990 and 1991, specifically looking at 61 points.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, class, team, points, wins.

The points for that year are listed as 121. Wait, but the claim mentions 61 points. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me double-check the table. For 1992, it says 61 points. So in 1990, the points were 121, not 61. That would mean the claim is incorrect because the points in 1990 and 1991 (which also shows 121) don't match 61.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the years again. The row for 1990 shows 121 points, while the one for 1992 shows 61. So maybe there's a typo or confusion here. But according to the table, in 1991, the team Dukados - Yamaha also has 121 points.\n\nSo the claim says they had the same number of points (61) in both 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class. However, according to the table, in both those years, their points were 121 each. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states 61 instead of 121.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because maybe the team had different classes over the years. Let me check that too. In 1990 and 1991, they're competing in 500cc, which aligns with the claim. So their points were both 121, not 61.

The claim mentions two specific years and classes: 1991 in the 250cc category and 1986 in what's referred to as the \"1986cc\" class, though looking at the table, it seems like there isn't a 1986cc class but rather a 500cc class for that year.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the 1991 250cc entry. Scanning through the table, I find the row with year 1991. The team is Ducados - Yamaha, and under points, it shows 121. That doesn't match the claim's 8 points, so this part of the claim isn't correct.\n\nNext, the claim refers to a 1986cc class with only 4 points. However, in the table, for the year 1986, the class is 500cc, and the points are 4. Wait, that actually matches the claim's second part: 4 points for the 1986cc class. But hold on, the column name in the table for points is 'points', so I should check that.\n\nLooking at row 2 (row_index 2), which is 1986, the class is 500cc, and points are 4. The claim says \"only 4 points for the 1986cc class,\" but the table doesn't have a 1986cc class; it has a 500cc class for that year. So, the wording in the claim might be confusing. It's referring to the 500cc class as if it were the 1986cc class, which isn't accurate based on the table.\n\nAdditionally, the 1991 250cc entry shows points as 121, not 8, so that part is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim aren't fully supported by the table. The first part about 1991 having 8 points is wrong, and the second part's reference to the 1986cc class isn't accurate since it's actually the 500cc class with 4 points in 1986.\n\nHowever, the second part of the claim does mention the correct number of points (4) for the right year. But since the class name doesn't match, I think the claim is still false because it incorrectly labels the class as 1986cc instead of 500cc.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"the year with the most point for the 250cc class be 1985 with a total of 221 point.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has columns: year, class, team, points, wins.\n\nI'm focusing on the 250cc class because that's what the claim is about. So I'll filter the rows where \"class\" is \"250cc\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n- 1984: 250cc, yamaha, points=0\n- 1985: 250cc, jj cobas, points=8\n- 1986: 500cc, cagiva, points=4 (not relevant)\n- 1987: 250cc, ducados - yamaha, points=46\n- 1988: 250cc, ducados - yamaha, points=221\n- 1989: 250cc, ducados - yamaha, points=98\n- 1990: 500cc, ducados - yamaha, points=121 (not relevant)\n- 1991: 500cc, ducados - yamaha, points=121 (not relevant)\n- 1992: 500cc, ducados - yamaha, points=61 (not relevant)\n- 1993: 500cc, cagiva, points=7 (not relevant)\n\nNow, I'll list the points for the 250cc class:\n1984: 0\n1985: 8\n1987:46\n1988:221\n1989:98\n\nI need to find which year has the highest points. The claim says 1985 with 221 points. Wait, but in the table, the highest points for 250cc is 221 in 1988, not 1985.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it's pointing to 1985 with 221 points when actually 1988 has higher points.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
