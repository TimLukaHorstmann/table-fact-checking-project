    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 , conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini and helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce be winner, runner - up, and semi finalist respectively in the week of may 8 tier 1.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to check if these three individuals are correctly positioned as winner, runner-up, and semi-finalist during week 8 May at tier 1.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" in the 'winner' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Tier II winners are Conchita Mart\u00ednez and Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez with Martina Hingis as runner-up.\n- Row 2: Same week, another match where Gigi and Martina win against different runners-up.\n- Moving to tier I for May 8th (Row 4): The winner is Conchita Mart\u00ednez vs Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario. Not the Gigi & Natalia pair.\n- Next row (Row 5): Here, Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Natalia Zvereva are the winners against Conchita Mart\u00ednez and Patricia Tarabini as runner-up.\n\nWait, that seems to match. So in this week of May 8th, tier I, Gigi and Natalia won, Conchita was the runner-up, and Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce were semi-finalists.\n\nThe claim mentions Gigi as winner, which matches. It also mentions Conchita as runner-up, but looking at the table, in row 5 (May 8), Conchita is indeed the runner-up. However, the third part of the claim says \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\" as semi-finalists.\n\nLooking back at the table for that week, under 'semi finalists', it's listed as \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\". So all three positions are correctly stated.\n\nWait, but in the table, row 5 for May 8th tier I shows that Gigi and Natalia are winners, Conchita is runner-up, and Helena and Mary are semi-finalists. Therefore, the claim's statement seems accurate based on this row.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other entries for week May 8 tier I. Scanning through, rows 4 and 5 correspond to May 8th. So yes, row 5 is the correct one.\n\nThus, all three individuals are correctly placed as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches the information in the table for week May 8th, tier I. Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Natalia Zvereva are winners, Conchita Mart\u00ednez is runner-up, and Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce are semi-finalists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"semi finalist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sandrine testud yone kamio be semi finalist the week of 22 may\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The table has several columns: week of, tier, winner, runner-up, and semi finalists. Each row represents a different week with related information about tennis matches.\n\nThe claim mentions \"sandrine testud yone kamio\" as a semi finalist in the week of 22 May. So I need to find if this specific entry exists in the table under the \"semi finals\" column for that week.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Week 1 May: Doesn't mention sandrine.\n2. Week 8 May: Sandrine isn't listed here either.\n3. Week 15 May: No, different players are mentioned.\n4. Week 22 May: Here's a row with \"sandrine testud yone kamio\" in the semi finals column.\n5. Week 29 May: Different players altogether.\n\nSo the entry exists in the week of 22 May under the semi finalists column. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The row index for the week of 22 May is 6 (since it's the 7th row if we start counting from 0). The column is \"semi finals\".\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include the row index and the column name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"semi finals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"when week be 9 may , when semi finalist be helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce , and when runner - up be conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini , winner be gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\"\n\nThe claim is structured in a way that it's making three specific conditions:\n\n1. The week is 9 May.\n2. The semi finalists are Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce.\n3. The runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez and Patricia Tarabini.\n4. The winner is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Natalia Zvereva with a score of 3-6,7-6,6-4.\n\nNow, I'll need to check the table provided to see if any row meets all these conditions simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has data for different weeks: 1 May, 8 May, 15 May, 22 May, and 29 May (with a note about being two weeks). There's no week mentioned as \"9 May\" in the table. That's a red flag because the claim is specifically mentioning Week 9 May.\n\nAdditionally, I'll check if any row has the semi finalists as Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce. Scanning through the table:\n\n- In week 8 May (tier i), the semi finalists are listed as \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\" in one of the rows.\n- Wait, looking closer: The row for 15 May tier i shows \"irina sp\u00eerlea natalia zvereva\" as semi finals. Hmm, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking at week 8 May, tier i: The semi finalists are \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\". That matches the second condition of the claim.\n\nNow, checking runner-up and winner for that row (week 8 May, tier i):\n\nRunner-up is \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\", which also matches the third condition of the claim. The winner is listed as \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" with a score of 3-6,7-6,6-4. That's exactly the fourth condition mentioned in the claim.\n\nBut here's the problem: The table doesn't have a week 9 May. All weeks mentioned are up to 29 May. So, if the claim is stating that this happened during week 9 May, but the table doesn't have such a week, then the claim would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the week numbering. Maybe 29 May is considered as week 2 of some other weeks? Let me check:\n\nIn the row for \"29 may 2 weeks\", it's under grand slam and has winners as steffi graf and gigi fern\u00e1ndez. So that seems to be the final week.\n\nBut regardless, there's no week 9 May in the table. The claim mentions week 9 May, but the table doesn't have such a week. Therefore, even if all other conditions are met in another week, the week number is incorrect, making the overall claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake and week 8 May was meant to be considered as week 9? No, that's speculative. The table explicitly lists weeks starting from 1 May up, so week 9 would logically come after these listed weeks unless it's part of a different dataset. But based on what's provided, there is no week 9 May in the table.\n\nTherefore, since the claim requires the week to be 9 May but the table doesn't have such an entry, the claim isn't fully supported by the data presented.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that all conditions occurred during week 9 May. However, the table does not include a week labeled \"9 May.\" The presence of other weeks like 8 May and 15 May indicates that the data is sequential but skips over week 9. Without an entry for week 9, none of the rows can be considered as meeting all the claim's criteria simultaneously.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Semi Finalists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Runner-up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"22 may be a week when the winner be sandrine testud.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each part of the claim. It mentions \"22 may,\" which likely refers to May 22nd, and it's about a week where the winner is Sandrine Testud.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are 'week of,' 'tier,' 'winner,' and possibly others like 'runner-up' or 'semi-finals.' But the key information we need is in the 'winner' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nSo I'll go through each row of the table to see if any week includes Sandrine Testud as the winner. \n\nStarting from the first row: week 1 May, tier ii, winners include Conchita Mart\u00ednez and Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez vs. Martina Hingis. No Sandrine here.\n\nNext, rows for 8 May: there are two entries. One has Julie Halard winning, another Linda Harvey vs. Chanda Rubin. Neither is Sandrine.\n\n15 May has a couple of matches. The first winner is Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, the second Amanda Coetzer and In\u00e9s Gorrochategui. No Sandrine again.\n\n22 May has two rows. Let's look at them:\n\n- First row for 22 May: tier iii, Lindsay Davenport vs. Kimiko Date. Winner is Lindsay Davenport.\n- Second row: same week, Davenport vs. Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez. Again, winner is Lindsay Davenport.\n\nSo in both cases for 22 May, the winner isn't Sandrine Testud.\n\nLooking further down, on 29 May (two weeks later), the winners are Steffi Graf and Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez/Natalia Zvereva. No Sandrine there either.\n\nWait, I need to double-check if Sandrine Testud is a winner in any row for week 22 May. From the table data:\n\nIn row 22 May tier iii: winner is Lindsay Davenport. The other entry for that week has Davenport as well. So no, Sandrine isn't listed as the winner.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"22 may be a week when the winner be sandrine testud\" is false because there's no evidence in the table of Sandrine Testud winning on May 22nd.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: I need to find which cells in the table support this. But since the claim isn't true, the relevant_cells would be all the cells for week 22 May where the winner is Lindsay Davenport, as those are the only ones that could potentially have Sandrine, but they don't. So maybe the cell in row 6 (index 6) where it's tier iii and the winner is Lindsay Davenport. Also, row 7 (index 7), same week, same winner.\n\nSo relevant cells would be both of those rows' 'winner' columns because that's where we check if Sandrine won.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
