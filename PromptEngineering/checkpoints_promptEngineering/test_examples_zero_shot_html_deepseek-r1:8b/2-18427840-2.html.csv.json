    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"takaichi hirayama finish the event in 1.25\". I need to verify if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table columns to identify which ones are relevant. The columns seem to include fight details like fighter name, opponent, event name, and other specifics. The key part of the claim is \"finish the event in 1.25\", which likely refers to the time taken or duration of a particular event involving Hirayama.\n\nI'll scan each row for the fighter's name, \"takaichi hirayama\". Once found, I need to check the relevant columns. The column names provided are: 'Fighter', 'Opponent', 'Event Name', 'Winning Method', 'Time (mins)', 'Winning Streak', and others.\n\nSince the claim mentions finishing an event in 1.25 minutes, the most relevant columns would be \"Time (mins)\" because it directly relates to the duration of the fight or event. Other columns like 'Opponent' or 'Event Name' might provide context but aren't necessary here. However, I should focus on the 'Time (mins)' column specifically.\n\nLooking at row 14, which corresponds to Takaichi Hirayama's win against Johil de Oliveira, the \"Time (mins)\" is listed as 2:50. This doesn't match the claim of finishing in 1.25 minutes. \n\nNext, checking other rows where Hirayama might have participated, such as row 15 and others, none show a time of 1.25 minutes. The closest match is in row 14 with a duration of 2:50 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold because there's no evidence in the table that Hirayama finished an event in 1.25 minutes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"Time (mins)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is that Adriano Abu won in the third round at his first Juiz de Fora fight due to a split decision. I need to verify this using the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the name \"Adriano Abu\" in the table. Scanning through each row's \"Name\" column... there it is in the last row: Adriano Abu. His record is 0-1, which means he lost that fight. Wait, but the claim says he won, so that's a red flag.\n\nNext, I'll check how many rounds this particular fight was in. The table doesn't specify the number of rounds for each fight, only the win/loss status and sometimes the method (TKO, Decision, etc.). So, without round information, I can't confirm if it was the third round.\n\nLooking at the \"Result\" column for Adriano's fight: it's a split decision loss. The claim mentions a split decision win, which doesn't match because he lost that fight. Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on this info.\n\nSo, even though the table doesn't provide the exact round number, since Adriano lost, the claim can't be true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Adriano Abu won a split decision in his first Juiz de Fora fight. The table shows he lost that fight with a split decision, contradicting the claim.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Adriano Abu in the Table:** Found in the last row.\n2. **Check Result:** Result is a split decision loss.\n3. **Contradiction:** The claim states a win; table shows a loss.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"gabriel veiga lose in the third round\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"gabriel veiga\" refers to a specific fighter, Gabriel Veiga. The term \"lose in the third round\" suggests that Veiga lost a match during the third round of a fight.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check for any rows where the fighter's name is Gabriel Veiga and then see if there's a loss in the third round. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find Gabriel Veiga. Scanning down, I see his name in several fights:\n\n- Row 7: Win against Mauricio Souza\n- Row 8: Win against Thiago Minu\n- Row 9: Win against Johil de Oliveira\n- Row 10: Win against Mateus Trindade\n- Row 11: Win against Diogo Oliveira\n- Row 12: Loss against Jorge Britto\n- Row 13: Win against Felipe Arinelli\n- Row 14: Win against Joao Paulo\n\nI notice that in row 12, Gabriel Veiga has a loss. The column for the result is \"loss\" and the round isn't explicitly mentioned, only that it's a loss. There's no indication of which round this loss occurred in.\n\nWait, the claim says he lost in the third round, but looking at row 12, there's no specific information about the round number. The column for rounds sometimes has \"n / a\" or other text like \"na\". In row 12, the round is listed as 2 because it's a loss against Jorge Britto, but wait, no\u2014the columns are \"row_index\", \"fighter\", \"result\", and others. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. The rows have fighter names in the second column (column 1). So row 12 has Gabriel Veiga as the fighter with a loss against Jorge Britto. The round number is listed as 3? Wait, no\u2014the \"row_index\" is 12, which corresponds to row 13 in the table because tables are zero-indexed. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking back, the table has a header and then rows starting from index 0. So row 0 is the first row after the headers. In row 12, Gabriel Veiga loses to Jorge Britto. The columns show that the round is \"2 - 2\" for the opponent's record. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, in the table, each row represents a fight. So for example, row 7: Win against Mauricio Souza. Let me check row 12 again. Row index 12 corresponds to fighter name Diogo Oliveira? No, wait no\u2014row index 12 is:\n\n- row_index: 12\n- fighter: Diogo Oliveira\n- result: submission (armbar)\n- etc.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the rows. Let me list them out properly.\n\nThe table has a header with columns like \"fighter\", \"result\", \"round\", etc. Each row corresponds to a fight. For example:\n\nRow 0: fighter is some name, result is Win against someone.\n...\nLooking for Gabriel Veiga, I see his name in several rows:\n\n- Row 7: fighter is Mauricio Souza, but wait no\u2014wait, the second column is the fighter's name. Wait, no, the first row after headers is row index 0, which has \"gabriel veiga\" as the fighter? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nRow 0: gabriel veiga lost to adriano abu in a decision.\nRow 1: some other fighter.\n...\nNo, wait, perhaps I need to check each row's fighter name. So for each row, the second column is the fighter. Let me go through them.\n\nRow 0: fighter: Adriano Abu (opponent)\nRow 1: fighter: Felipe Arinelli\nRow 2: fighter: Joao Paulo\n...\nWait, maybe I'm not approaching this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for any row where the fighter is Gabriel Veiga and see if he lost in round 3.\n\nBut from the table provided, I can't find a row where Gabriel Veiga has a loss with the round specified as 3. All his losses are against Jorge Britto in row 12, but that's not round 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that he lost in the third round, regardless of who he fought. But looking at the table, I don't see any indication that Veiga lost specifically in the third round. He has a loss against Jorge Britto, but without the round number specified, it's unclear.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, there's no evidence in the table that Gabriel Veiga lost in the third round. The claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"gabriel veiga lose in the third round\" is not supported by the provided data. After examining the table, there is no specific mention of Gabriel Veiga losing in the third round. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there is no evidence in the table that Gabriel Veiga lost in the third round.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check whether the claim \"mateus trindade lose with a score of 4 - 2\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"mateus trindade\" is the name of the fighter we're interested in. The claim says he lost a fight, so I need to find if there's any row where his name is followed by a loss. Next, the score is given as 4 - 2. In MMA fights, scores are typically split into points from the judges, and each judge gives their own score. Sometimes it's presented as a total of all three judges' scores. However, sometimes it might be the individual scores for one fighter against another.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to scan each row where \"mateus trindade\" is mentioned. Let me go through the rows one by one.\n\nStarting from the top, the first row is about someone else (it looks like a different name), so not relevant. As I go down, I find the row with \"mateus trindade\". The score column says 4 - 2. Now, I need to check if this means he lost. In the table, each row has a 'result' column, which indicates whether it's a win or loss.\n\nLooking at that specific row for mateus trindade: result is \"win\", score is 4-2 against thiago minu. Wait, so in this case, mateus won the fight with a score of 4-2 against thiago. That means the claim is incorrect because it says he lost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check. The row for mateus trindade shows that he fought thiago minu and won with 4-2 points. So if someone claims he lost with a score of 4-2, that's false because the result is a win. Therefore, the claim is not supported by this row.\n\nI should also check other rows for mateus trindade to see if there are any losses. The next relevant row is where mateus fought mateus trindade against someone else, but looking at the table, I don't see another instance of mateus trindade as a fighter in a loss. Wait, no\u2014wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, actually, the table shows that mateus trindade has a win with 4-2 points against thiago minu. So he didn't lose; he won. Therefore, the claim that he lost is false because the result was a win.\n\nI don't see any other rows for mateus trindade where the result is a loss and the score is 4-2. All other instances of mateus trindade are wins or losses with different scores or opponents.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because in the table, mateus trindade won his fight against thiago minu with a 4-2 score, not lost.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

My goal is to check if this statement is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The opponent mentioned is Takaichi Hirayama. The event time is \"last 1:25\", which probably refers to a fight that ended at 1 minute and 25 seconds. The location is Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows where Takaichi Hirayama is listed as an opponent, the fight duration is approximately 1:25, and the venue is in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. Starting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is not mentioned. So, no relevance here.\nRow 1: Opponent is not Hirayama. Move on.\nRow 2: Opponent is Mauricio Souza. Not our guy.\nRow 3: Opponent is Thiago Minu. No match.\nRow 4: Opponent is Johil De Oliveira. Nope.\nRow 5: Mateus Trindade, not relevant.\nRow 6: Diogo Oliveira, no.\nRow 7: Jorge Britto, not Hirayama.\nRow 8: Felipe Arinelli, not him.\nRow 9: Joao Paulo, irrelevant.\nRow 10: Adriano Abu, not the opponent.\n\nWait a minute, I might have missed something. Let me check again. The claim mentions \"opponent takaichi hirayama that last 1:25 in sao paulo , brazil\". So perhaps there's an entry where Takaichi Hirayama is the opponent, and the fight ended at 1:25 in Sao Paulo.\n\nLooking back at the table, I see rows 6 to 10 are about opponents in Brazil. Row 7 mentions Jorge Britto with a decision split. Row 8 is Felipe Arinelli, who fought in Juiz de Fora. Row 9 is Joao Paulo, location is Minas Gerais. Then row 10 is Adriano Abu, which took place in Juiz de Fora.\n\nWait, I think I might have skipped a part. Looking at the table more carefully:\n\nThere's a row with row_index: 6 where the opponent is Thiago Minu, fight time 7:28, location Rio de Janeiro. Not our guy or time.\n\nThen row 5: Johil De Oliveira, 2:50, Juiz de Fora. No.\n\nRow 4: Mateus Trindade, decision, Shooto Brazil 11, 5:00. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe Takaichi Hirayama is an opponent, and the fight ended at 1:25 in Sao Paulo. Let me check if such a row exists.\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see any entry where the opponent is Takaichi Hirayama with a time of around 1:25 and location Sao Paulo. The closest is perhaps row 3, but that's Thiago Minu with 7:28 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"last\" part. Perhaps it refers to the last fight in the table where Hirayama was involved. Let me check from the bottom up.\n\nRow 11: Loss against Jorge Britto in Brazil, but no time specified except 5:00.\nRow 12: Win against Felipe Arinelli in Juiz de Fora, n/a time.\nRow 13: Win against Joao Paulo in Minas Gerais, n/a.\nRow 14: Loss against Adriano Abu in Juiz de Fora, at 5:00.\n\nNone of these seem to match Takaichi Hirayama as the opponent with a fight ending at 1:25 in Sao Paulo. Wait, perhaps I'm looking for Takaichi Hirayama being the one who fought someone else, not necessarily as the opponent. Maybe the row where the fighter is Hirayama and he won at 1:25 in Sao Paulo.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\nRow 15: Win against Felipe Arinelli, but time is n/a.\nRow 16: Decision against Joao Paulo, n/a time.\n\nNo match for a 1:25 finish. Wait, perhaps I missed a row where Takaichi Hirayama is the fighter, not the opponent. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the table, I don't see any rows where the fighter's name is Takaichi Hirayama. The opponents mentioned are other names like Mauricio Souza, Thiago Minu, etc.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the claim refers to when Hirayama was the opponent, and someone else fought him ending at 1:25 in Sao Paulo. But looking through all the rows, I don't see any such entry. The closest is row 6 where Thiago Minu has a fight time of 7:28, but that's not 1:25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"last\" refers to the last fight in the table involving Hirayama, which might be a loss at 5:00 in Juiz de Fora against Adriano Abu. But that doesn't match the 1:25 time.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the row indices. Let me recount:\n\nRows go from 0 to 14 (since there are 15 rows). Looking for Takaichi Hirayama as opponent and fight time around 1:25 in Sao Paulo. But I don't see any such entry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fight is not recorded under \"opponent\" but under the fighter's name. But the table seems to list opponents on each row, so perhaps Takaichi Hirayama isn't listed as an opponent anywhere.\n\nWait, looking again at the table:\n\nRow 6: Thiago Minu vs someone in Rio de Janeiro, time 7:28.\nRow 5: Johil De Oliveira vs Mateus Trindade, time 2:50.\nRow 4: Mateus Trindade vs someone else, 5:00.\nRow 3: Thiago Minu vs someone else, 7:28.\n\nNo, I don't see Takaichi Hirayama being an opponent in any of these. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no fight involving him ending at 1:25 in Sao Paulo.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a row. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 0: Fighter vs Opponent (unknown), time n/a.\nRow 1: Unknown vs Mauricio Souza.\nRow 2: Unknown vs Thiago Minu, 7:28.\nRow 3: Unknown vs Mateus Trindade, 5:00.\nRow 4: Unknown vs Johil De Oliveira, 2:50.\nRow 5: Unknown vs Felipe Arinelli, n/a.\nRow 6: Unknown vs Diogo Oliveira, 1:25? No, time is 7:28.\nWait, no, row 6 is Thiago Minu's fight with someone, ending at 7:28.\n\nHmm. Maybe the claim is misphrased. Alternatively, perhaps Takaichi Hirayama isn't listed as an opponent in any of these fights. Therefore, the statement might not be fully supported by the table data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"last\" part refers to the last row where he's involved, but that doesn't help because the time is 5:00, not 1:25.\n\nSo, after going through each row carefully, I don't see any entry where Takaichi Hirayama is the opponent, and the fight ended at 1:25 in Sao Paulo. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"opponent takaichi hirayama that last 1:25 in sao paulo , brazil\" is not fully supported by the information in the table. There are no records of Takaichi Hirayama being an opponent in a fight ending at approximately 1 minute and 25 seconds in Sao Paulo, Brazil. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is not supported by the provided data as there is no corresponding entry for Takaichi Hirayama with those specifics in the table.",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the name \"mateus trindade\" is mentioned. Looking through the table, I should check if there's a fighter with that name. Scanning down the rows, yes, there's a row where Mateus Trindade is listed under the name column, and his record is 4-2.\n\nNext, the claim says he \"lose 4 - 2 in round 1.\" The term \"lose\" implies that he lost a fight. In the table, each row has columns like Result, Round, etc. For Mateus Trindade's row, the result is \"decision (unanimous)\", which doesn't indicate a loss. Also, his record being 4-2 suggests he has four wins and two losses.\n\nWait, but if his total record is 4-2, that means he's lost two fights. However, the specific round isn't mentioned in his row\u2014only that it was a decision in round 3. So, did he lose this fight? Or did he win? Since the result is a decision, which can be a loss or a win depending on how it's interpreted.\n\nBut according to the table, each \"loss\" entry would have a Result column indicating that outcome. However, for Mateus Trindade, his row doesn't show a Result as a Loss; instead, it shows a Decision. So, perhaps he didn't lose this particular fight but either won or it was a draw.\n\nAdditionally, the claim specifies \"round 1,\" but in the table, the round for Mateus's fight is listed as 3. That's conflicting with the claim of round 1.\n\nPutting this together: The claim says he lost 4-2 in round 1. Looking at his record, it's indeed 4-2, which suggests two losses elsewhere. However, his specific fight against Adriano Abu resulted in a decision (not a loss), and that was in round 3, not round 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to have incorrect information regarding both the round number and the result of the fight.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on an incorrect assessment of Mateus Trindade's fight.
