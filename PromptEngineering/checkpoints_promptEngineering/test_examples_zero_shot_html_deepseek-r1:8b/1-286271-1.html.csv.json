    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more candidate nominate in 1993 than 1988\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two years: 1993 and 1988. Specifically, it's about \"more candidate nominate\"\u2014which likely refers to the number of candidates nominated in those years. So, I need to find out how many candidates were nominated in each of these years and see which one is higher.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: election year, number of candidates nominated, seats won, total votes, and percentage of popular vote. The relevant column for this claim is \"of candidates nominated.\"\n\nNow, I need to look at the rows for 1993 and 1988. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- 1984: 60 candidates\n- 1988: 68 candidates\n- 1993: 79 candidates\n- 1997: 79 candidates\n- 2000: 111 candidates\n- 2004: 308 candidates\n- 2006: 308 candidates\n- 2008: 303 candidates\n\nSo, the rows for 1988 and 1993 are the ones I'm interested in. For 1988, it's 68 candidates nominated, and for 1993, it's 79 candidates. Comparing these two numbers, 79 is greater than 68.\n\nTherefore, there were more candidates nominated in 1993 than in 1988. This means the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the number of candidates nominated for both 1988 and 1993. Since 79 (1993) is more than 68 (1988), the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"of candidates nominated\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of candidates nominated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"more people vote for the green party in 1993 than 1984\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two elections: 1993 and 1984. It's saying that more people voted for the Green Party in 1993 compared to 1984. So, I need to look at the number of votes the Green Party received in these two years.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different election year. The columns relevant here are \"election\" (which is the year), \"of candidates nominated\", \"of seats won\", \"of total votes\", and \"% of popular vote\". \n\nSince the claim is about the number of people who voted for the Green Party, the most directly relevant column would be \"total votes\". However, I should also consider that sometimes the same party might not be referred to as the \"Green Party\" in different years or regions, so there's a bit of ambiguity. But assuming that the Green Party is consistently represented here, the total votes per election year would be key.\n\nSo, let's look at 1993 and 1984. In 1993, according to the table, the Green Party received 0 seats, but the \"total votes\" column shows 32,979. For 1984, they had 0 seats as well, with a total vote count of 26,921.\n\nComparing these two numbers: 32,979 (1993) vs. 26,921 (1984). It's clear that 32,979 is more than 26,921. Therefore, the number of people who voted for the Green Party in 1993 was indeed higher than in 1984.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the \"total votes\" column again: In 1993, it's 32,979 and in 1984, it's 26,921. So yes, more votes were cast for the Green Party in 1993. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not misinterpreting anything.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether \"total votes\" refers strictly to the Green Party or includes other parties as well. If it's just the Green Party's total votes, then yes, 32k vs. 26k means more people voted for them in 1993. But if it's including all parties, then maybe not, but I think the column is specifically about the party's own votes.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim should be TRUE because the total votes for the Green Party in 1993 (32,979) are higher than in 1984 (26,921).\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total votes\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total votes\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"there be more candidate nominate in 2006 than 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"election\" (to check the year) and \"of candidates nominated\" since that's what the claim is about.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1984: 60 candidates\n- 1988: 68\n- 1993: 79\n- 1997: 79\n- 2000: 111\n- 2004: 308\n- 2006: 308\n- 2008: 303\n\nSo, for 2006 and 2008, the number of candidates nominated is 308 and 303 respectively. Since 308 is more than 303, that means there were indeed more candidate nominations in 2006 than in 2008.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which rows correspond to 2006 and 2008. The \"election\" column for 2006 is row index 6 (since it's the 7th row if we start counting from 0), and for 2008, it's row index 7.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the \"of candidates nominated\" in rows 6 and 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the number of candidate nominations in 2006 (308) is greater than in 2008 (303).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the green party % of popular vote be greatest in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that the Green Party had the highest percentage of the popular vote in 2008. So I need to check if in the year 2008, the Green Party's popular vote percentage was higher than any other years listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different election year: 1984, 1988, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006. Wait, but the claim is about 2008, which isn't directly listed in the table. Hmm, that's odd. So maybe I need to check if there was an election for the Green Party in 2008 or if their data is present elsewhere.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 1984: Green Party had 0% and 26921 votes.\n- 1988: Same as above with 0%.\n- 1993, '97, 2000: All show 0% popular vote for the Green Party.\n- 2004: Their % is 4.32%, which is higher than some years but not the highest in 2008.\nWait, actually, in the table, 2006 has a higher percentage at 4.48%. But the claim is about 2008. However, there's no row for 2008. So does that mean the Green Party didn't field candidates or win any seats in 2008?\n\nIn the given table, each row has 'election' as the year and other columns like number of candidates nominated, seats won, total votes, and % popular vote. For 2008, the number of candidates is 303, seats won is 0, total votes are 941097, but the % is 6.80%. Wait, so in 2008, according to the table, the Green Party had a higher percentage at 6.80% compared to previous years.\n\nBut wait, looking back, in 2004, their vote was 4.32%, then 2006: 4.48%, and 2008: 6.80%. So 2008 is the highest among those listed. But since the claim is about 2008 specifically, I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't list all possible years when the Green Party ran. For example, maybe in 2008, they had a higher % than other parties in that year. So based on the data given, in 2008, their popular vote was 6.80%, which is higher than previous years but perhaps not compared to others in that same election.\n\nBut since the table doesn't include all years and just lists these specific ones, I can only go by what's provided. So, within the table, 2008 has the highest % of popular vote at 6.80%. Therefore, the claim is saying that the Green Party had the greatest % in 2008, which aligns with the data given.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. So since the table includes a row for 2008 and shows their popular vote as 6.80%, which is higher than previous years, and assuming there are no other rows beyond 2008 in the table, then yes, it's the highest among those listed.\n\nBut wait, could there be another party that had a higher % in 2008? The table only lists each year with some data, but not all parties. So perhaps in 2008, the Green Party had the highest, as their data shows 6.80%, while others might have less or none listed.\n\nWait, looking at the other years: 1984-0, 88-0, 93-0, 97-0, 2000-0, 04-4.32, 06-4.48, and 08-6.80.

So, I need to find the percentages for those two years in the table and see which one is higher.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several elections from 1984 onwards, with columns for the election year, number of candidates nominated, seats won, total votes, and percentage of popular vote. The rows are indexed starting from 0, I think, based on their order in the table.\n\nI need to locate the rows for 2004 and 2006. Let's see:\n\n- 2004 is row index 5 (since it's the 6th row after the header).\n- 2006 is row index 6.\n\nNow, looking at the column for \"% of popular vote,\" I'll extract those values.\n\nFor 2004: The % is 4.32%.\nFor 2006: The % is 4.48%.\n\nComparing these two, 4.48% is higher than 4.32%.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"fewer candidate nominate in 1993 than 1988\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that in 1993, there were fewer candidates nominated compared to 1988. So I need to find out how many candidates were nominated in each of those years and compare them.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: election year, number of candidates nominated, seats won, total votes, and percentage of popular vote. The rows represent different election years from 1984 onwards.\n\nI'll need to find the rows for 1993 and 1988. Let's start by identifying their positions. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row after the header is 1984.\n- Next is 1988 (second row).\n- Then 1993 (third row).\n- So, 1993 is in the third row, and 1988 is in the second row.\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I should look at the column \"of candidates nominated\". \n\nFor 1988, which is the second row, that column has a value of 68. For 1993, which is the third row, that same column shows 79.\n\nSo, comparing these two: In 1993, there were 79 candidates nominated, and in 1988, there were 68. Since 68 is less than 79, the claim says \"fewer candidate nominate in 1993 than 1988.\" But wait, that's not correct because 79 is more than 68. So actually, it's the opposite: 1993 had more candidates nominated than 1988.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim says \"fewer candidate nominate in 1993 than 1988.\" That would mean that the number of candidates in 1993 is less than in 1988. But according to the table, 1993 had 79 and 1988 had 68. So 79 is more than 68, which means there were more candidates nominated in 1993 than in 1988.\n\nSo the claim is actually false because it's asserting the opposite of what the data shows. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to list the cells that confirm this. The column we're interested in is \"of candidates nominated.\" So for both 1993 and 1988, their respective rows' \"of candidates nominated\" columns are relevant.\n\nSo, the row indices would be:\n\n- For 1988: It's the second row (index starts at 0?), so row_index=1.\n- For 1993: Third row, so row_index=2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those two specific cells in their respective rows for the \"of candidates nominated\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there were more candidates nominated in 1993 (79) than in 1988 (68).

It's comparing the number of votes the Green Party received in 1993 to that in 1984. So I need to find the relevant data points from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: election, of candidates nominated, of seats won, of total votes, and % of popular vote. The rows represent different years starting from 1984 onwards.\n\nI'll focus on the 'total votes' column for each relevant year because the claim is about how many people voted for the Green Party. So I need to find the 'total votes' for 1993 and 1984.\n\nStarting with 1984: The first row (row_index 0) has a total vote count of 26921. For 1993, I look at the corresponding year in the table. Scanning through, I see that 1993 is row_index 2 with a total vote count of 32979.\n\nNow, comparing these two: 26921 in 1984 vs. 32979 in 1993. Since 32979 is greater than 26921, it means more people voted for the Green Party in 1993 than in 1984. \n\nThe claim states that \"fewer people vote...\" which would mean expecting a lower number in 1993.

Looking at the table, the rows correspond to different election years: 1984, 1988, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2008.\n\nIn 2008, I need to find the percentage of the popular vote that The Green Party achieved. From the table, each row has a column for \"% of popular vote.\" So, looking at the 2008 row, the value is 6.80%.\n\nNow, the claim mentions it's their second highest percentage in 2008. That means there should be another year when their percentage was higher than 6.80%. I need to check all previous years (before 2008) to see if any have a higher percentage.\n\nLooking at each year before 2008:\n- 1984: 0.21%\n- 1988: 0.36%\n- 1993: 0.24%\n- 1997: 0.43%\n- 2000: 0.81%\n\nAll of these are lower than 6.80%. So, in 2008, the Green Party had their highest percentage at that point. The claim says it's their second highest, but if there were no higher percentages before, then 2008 would be their highest, not second.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider all years beyond 2008 as well, but the table doesn't go beyond 2008. So within the data provided, 2008 is their highest. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not the second highest; it's actually the highest in the given data.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a year before 2008 where they had a higher percentage, but looking at all prior years, none exceed 6.80%.

The column name for each is \"of candidates nominated.\" So, the relevant_cells will include both rows with their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the number of candidate nominations for 2006 and 2008 from the table.\n\n- **2006**: 308 candidates nominated (row 5)\n- **2008**: 303 candidates nominated (row 6)\n\nSince 303 is fewer than 308, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"of candidates nominated\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"of candidates nominated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"the green party lose a percentage of the popular vote from 2004 to 2006.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's about the Green Party's percentage in the popular vote changing from 2004 to 2006. So I need to look at their performance in those two years.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists elections from 1984 onwards with columns: election, number of candidates nominated, seats won, total votes, and percent of popular vote.\n\nFor 2004, the relevant row is probably the one where the year is 2004. Checking the data, that's row index 5 (since rows start at 0 in programming terms, but sometimes we count from top as 1). Wait, actually, let me check: the first row after thead is 1984, which would be row index 0. So each subsequent year increases by one row.\n\nSo for 2004, it's row 5:\n- election: 2004\n- candidates nominated: 308\n- seats won: 0\n- total votes: 582247\n- % of popular vote: 4.32%\n\nFor 2006, that would be the next year, so row 6:\n- election: 2006\n- candidates nominated: 308\n- seats won: 0\n- total votes: 665940\n- % of popular vote: 4.48%\n\nNow, I need to see if they lost percentage points from 2004 to 2006. So, 4.32% in 2004 and 4.48% in 2006. Wait, that means the Green Party's percentage increased, not decreased.\n\nSo the claim says they \"lose a percentage,\" which would mean their share goes down. But according to the table, it went up from ~4.32% to ~4.48%. That's an increase of about 0.16%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because they didn't lose but gained in the popular vote.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns that matter here are \"election\" for the years and \"% of popular vote\" for the percentages.\n\nSo for 2004, row index 5, columns \"election\" (to confirm the year) and \"% of popular vote.\"\nSimilarly, for 2006, row index 6, same two columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 5, column \"% of popular vote\"\n- Row 6, column \"% of popular vote\"\n\nWait, but do I also need to include \"election\" column? Maybe not, because the claim is about percentage change between specific years. The \"election\" column helps confirm which rows we're looking at.\n\nBut in the instructions, they mentioned that relevant_cells should be a list of objects with row_index and column_name. So perhaps it's better to include both \"% of popular vote\" columns for 2004 and 2006, as well as their respective election years to tie them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the two percentage cells are enough because they directly compare the values.\n\nBut I think including all relevant cells that support checking the claim would be better. So:\n- For 2004: row index 5, \"% of popular vote\"\n- For 2006: row index 6, \"% of popular vote\"\n- Also, perhaps the \"election\" column for each to confirm they are 2004 and 2006.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example provided in the instructions: their answer included two cells, one from row 0 (Revenue) and another from row 1 (Employees). So probably, it's about identifying the columns that directly support the claim. In this case, the percentage change is determined by the \"% of popular vote\" column for both years.\n\nSo maybe I just need to include those two rows' cells.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should include the \"election\" column as well because without knowing it's 2004 and 2006, you can't verify the claim. But actually, since the table is structured with each row representing a specific year, the \"election\" column is redundant for determining which years we're looking at once you know it's 2004 and 2006. But in any case, the key data points are the percentages.\n\nSo I think the relevant_cells should include both \"% of popular vote\" entries because that's what changes are being compared.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\" because their percentage increased, not decreased.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
