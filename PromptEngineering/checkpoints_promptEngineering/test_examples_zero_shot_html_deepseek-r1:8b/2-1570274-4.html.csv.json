    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"tony lema be in the top 5 for the master tournament , the us open , and the open championship.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. The task is to determine if Tony LeMa (though I think it's supposed to be Tiger Woods) is in the top 5 for each of those tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, and The Open Championship.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists various golf tournaments along with their performance metrics. Each row represents a tournament, and the columns are wins, top-5 finishes, top-10, etc. There's also a 'totals' row which seems to aggregate the data, but for now, I should focus on individual tournaments.\n\nWait, actually, the table has six columns: tournament name, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, and cuts made. So each row after the headers represents a specific tournament's performance by one player, probably Tiger Woods since 'tony lema' seems like a typo for his name.\n\nThe first step is to identify which rows correspond to the tournaments mentioned in the claim: Masters Tournament, US Open, and The Open Championship. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: This is the first row after the headers with \"masters tournament\" as the tournament name.\n2. **US Open**: This should be the second row with \"us open\" as the tournament name.\n3. **The Open Championship**: I'm not sure if this is listed directly, but looking at the table, the third row says \"the open championship,\" so that's correct.\n\nNow, for each of these tournaments, I need to check if Tiger Woods (assuming 'tony lema' is a typo) has a top-5 finish. The relevant column for this is the \"top - 5\" column.\n\nLet me extract the data for each tournament:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**:\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top-5: 1\n   So, he has 1 top-5 finish here.\n\n2. **US Open**:\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top-5: 2\n   He has 2 top-5 finishes.\n\n3. **The Open Championship**:\n   - Wins: 1\n   - Top-5: 2\n   Again, he has 2 top-5 finishes.\n\nEach of these tournaments shows that Tiger Woods is in the top-5. Therefore, the claim should be true because each specified tournament has him ranked within the top 5.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the relevant cells in the table. For each tournament, I'll get the row index and check the \"top - 5\" column.\n\n- Masters Tournament: Row index 0 (since it's the first data row), column \"top - 5\" with value 1.\n- US Open: Row index 1, column \"top - 5\" with value 2.\n- The Open Championship: Row index 2, column \"top - 5\" with value 2.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at rows 0, 1, and 2 for the top-5 column. \n\nPutting it all together, since each specified tournament shows Tiger Woods in the top 5, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are as identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Tony LeMa's participated tournaments is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"tournament that Tony LeMa have participate in include the master tournament , the us open , the pga championship and the open championship.\" I need to verify if all these tournaments are indeed part of Tony LeMa's participation based on the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several tournaments with their respective statistics like wins, top-5 finishes, etc. The relevant columns for checking participation would be \"tournament\" and possibly others, but primarily \"tournament\" since that directly indicates which events each participant has played in.\n\nLet me go through each mentioned tournament one by one:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: Checking the table, there's a row with \"masters tournament\" as the tournament name. This suggests Tony LeMa participated here.\n\n2. **US Open**: Similarly, there's a row for \"us open\", indicating participation.\n\n3. **PGA Championship**: The table includes \"pga championship\", so another check for participation.\n\n4. **The Open Championship**: The term \"the open championship\" is listed as a tournament in the table. This might be a bit tricky because sometimes tournaments have similar names, but here it's explicitly named, so participation is confirmed.\n\nAdditionally, the last row labeled \"totals\" likely aggregates data from all participants, including Tony LeMa. It shows 1 win, 5 top-5 finishes, etc., which aligns with his participation across these tournaments.\n\nI need to make sure that each of these four tournaments is present in the table and that there's no contradiction or missing information. Since all four are listed, the claim seems supported.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: Each tournament name corresponds to a row in the table. The \"row_index\" refers to their position in the tbody. Let me count them:\n\n- Masters Tournament: Row 0\n- US Open: Row 1\n- PGA Championship: Row 3\n- The Open Championship: Row 2\n\nWait, the last one is at row index 2? Let me double-check the table structure. The table has five rows in the tbody, with the first four being specific tournaments and the fifth being totals. So:\n\nRow 0: Masters Tournament\nRow 1: US Open\nRow 2: The Open Championship\nRow 3: PGA Championship\nRow 4: Totals\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, each of Tony LeMa's participated tournaments corresponds to rows 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the table.\n\nIn conclusion, all the stated tournaments are indeed part of Tony LeMa's participation, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because all listed tournaments appear in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the only tournament that Tony Lemay win in be the Open Championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the name mentioned is \"Tony Lemay.\" Wait a minute, looking at the table, I see tournaments like masters tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship. None of these seem to correspond directly to \"Tony Lemay.\" Maybe there's a typo? Perhaps it's supposed to be \"Tiger Woods\" or another golfer known for winning major tournaments. But assuming the name is correct as per the claim, let's see.\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lemay won only in The Open Championship. So, I need to check if any other tournaments in the table are associated with him winning, according to the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table columns: tournament names and their corresponding wins. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: 0 wins.\n2. **US Open**: 0 wins.\n3. **The Open Championship**: 1 win.\n4. **PGA Championship**: 0 wins.\n5. **Totals**: Total wins across all tournaments, which is 1.\n\nWait, the totals row says total wins are 1. So that aligns with the claim that Tony Lemay won only in The Open Championship. But wait, let me check if the other rows have any data that might contradict this.\n\nThe columns for each tournament list various statistics: top-5, top-10, etc., but the 'wins' column is what's directly relevant here. Each row lists the number of wins for each tournament.\n\nSo, in the The Open Championship row, it says 1 win. For the others, like US Open, Masters, and PGA, it's 0. So if Tony Lemay won only in The Open Championship, that seems to match the data.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the totals at the bottom show total wins as 1. That would mean all wins are attributed to one tournament, which is The Open Championship. So there's no other win elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"The Open Championship\"}]}",

The claim says: \"tony lema make it to the top 10 in the pga championship , but do not continue on.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if there's a player named Tony LeMa in the table. Looking at the 'tournament' column, I see entries like masters tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship. There's no mention of \"Tony LeMa\" or similar names here.\n\nNext, since Tony LeMa isn't listed as an entry, there's nothing to check regarding his performance in the top 10 or continuation. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the table data provided.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the necessary information about Tony LeMa isn't present in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"tony lema be in the top 5 for the pga championship , the us open , and the open championship.\"\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim refers to. It mentions three tournaments: pga championship, us open, and the open championship. So I'll need to look at the corresponding rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a DataFrame with columns: tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, cuts made. Each row represents a specific tournament and its performance metrics.\n\nStarting with the pga championship. The relevant row is where \"pga championship\" is listed. Scanning through the rows, I see it's the fourth row (index 3). In that row, under \"top - 5\", the value is 0. So Tony LeMa didn't make the top 5 in the pga championship.\n\nNext, the us open. The us open is the second row (index 1). Checking the \"top - 5\" column here, it's 2. So he made the top 5 there.\n\nThen, the open championship. That's the third row (index 2). The \"top - 5\" column has a value of 2. So again, he made the top 5 in this tournament as well.\n\nNow, evaluating the claim: it says Tony LeMa is in the top 5 for all three tournaments mentioned. However, in the pga championship, he didn't make the top 5\u2014he got 0. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely true because one of the stated tournaments doesn't support it.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells are for the us open (row index 1, \"top - 5\") and the open championship (row index 2, \"top - 5\"). The pga championship cell is not relevant since it doesn't support the claim.\n\nPutting this together, the JSON should reflect that the answer is FALSE and list only the cells for us open and open championship.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tournament that Tony LeMa won in be pga championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions \"Tony LeMa\" and specifies that he won a tournament which is the \"pga championship\". So, I'm looking for information about Tony LeMa's participation in the pga championship.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament, with columns like 'tournament', 'wins', etc. The last row is totals, so the relevant rows are before that, each corresponding to a specific tournament.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: No mention of Tony LeMa here.\n2. **US Open**: Again, no direct reference to him.\n3. **The Open Championship**: Not his.\n4. **PGA Championship**: This is the one that might be relevant since the claim mentions it.\n\nNow, looking at the 'tournament' column for the PGA Championship row: it says \"pga championship\". That matches the tournament name in the claim. So this row is definitely relevant because it's about the pga championship.\n\nBut wait, does the data indicate that Tony LeMa won this tournament? Let me check the 'wins' column. For the pga championship row, under 'wins', it says \"0\". That means he didn't win; he had zero wins there. So even though he participated in the pga championship (as per the claim), he didn't win it.\n\nHowever, the claim doesn't specify whether he won or not\u2014it only states that the tournament he won is the pga championship. If the claim says \"tournament that Tony LeMa won\", but according to the table, he didn't win any tournaments listed here. The 'wins' column for each individual tournament shows zero except for The Open Championship and totals. Wait, the Open Championship row has a 'wins' of 1, but that's not the pga championship.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again:\n\n- Masters: wins 0\n- US Open: 0\n- The Open Championship: 1\n- PGA Championship: 0\n- Totals: 1\n\nSo, Tony LeMa won the Open Championship (not the PGA), and that's in a different row.\n\nThe claim says he won the pga championship. But according to the table, he didn't win it; he had 0 wins there. So the claim is incorrect because he didn't win the pga championship as per the data.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if Tony LeMa even participated in the pga championship. The 'cuts made' column for the pga championship row is 4. Each number represents how many cuts a player made before the tournament ended (like cut after two rounds). So 4 cuts mean he participated but didn't make it past that round. But just because he participated doesn't mean he won.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that the tournament Tony LeMa won was the pga championship. The table shows he participated in it but didn't win; instead, someone else did (since wins are 0). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, which cells are relevant? The row index for the pga championship is 3 (assuming rows start at 0). So the relevant_cells would be that row's 'tournament' column and perhaps other columns if needed. Since the key point is the tournament name, I'll include row_index:3 and column_name:\"tournament\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Tony LeMa did not win the pga championship as per the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Wait, no, actually, \"tony lema do not win in the us open\" \u2013 maybe there's a typo here. Could it be referring to \"Tony Lemma\" or perhaps another name? Alternatively, it might be a misphrasing of \"Tiger Woods\" or someone else. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents different tournaments and their corresponding statistics like wins, top-5 finishes, etc. The relevant columns for determining a win would be the \"wins\" column, which is in position 1 (if we count starting from 0).\n\nNow, let's look at each tournament:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: 0 wins.\n2. **US Open**: 0 wins.\n3. **The Open Championship**: 1 win.\n4. **PGA Championship**: 0 wins.\n5. **Totals**: 1 win.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the US Open. So, I need to check if Tony LeMasters (assuming that's who \"tony lema\" refers to) has any wins in the US Open. From the table, the US Open row shows 0 wins. However, wait \u2013 maybe the person's name is different. The claim says \"tony lema,\" which doesn't exactly match any name I know in golf, but perhaps it's a typo.\n\nAssuming that the intended name is Tiger Woods, for example, let's check if he has any wins in the US Open from the table. Wait, but according to the table, the US Open row shows 0 wins. That would mean Tiger Woods didn't win the US Open based on this data. But I know in reality, Tiger Woods has won the US Open multiple times.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's confusion here. Maybe \"tony lema\" is supposed to refer to someone else, but according to the table, the US Open has 0 wins. So if the claim is that Tony LeMasters didn't win the US Open, and the table shows 0, then the statement would be TRUE because he didn't win it.\n\nAlternatively, if \"tony lema\" is a typo for Tiger Woods, then the statement would actually be FALSE because Tiger has won the US Open. But since the claim specifically refers to \"tony lema,\" I have to go with that name as given.\n\nSo, based on the table, the US Open has 0 wins, meaning Tony LeMasters didn't win it, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tony LeMasters did not win the US Open.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"tournament that Tony LeMa have not participate in include the master tournament , the us open , the pga championship and the open championship.\" Wait, actually, I think there might be a typo here. It probably says \"do not include\" but it's written as \"include,\" which is confusing. But moving past that, the claim seems to suggest that Tony LeMa has not participated in these tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open Championship.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a tournament with columns for wins, top-5 finishes, etc., but more importantly, it shows whether Tony LeMa participated. Wait, no\u2014the table doesn't specify who participated; actually, I'm not sure if the data is about Tony LeMa or someone else. Hmm, this might be a point of confusion.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"tournament that tony lema have not participate in,\" so perhaps each row represents a tournament where Tony LeMa didn't participate? Or maybe the opposite. Let me check the table again.\n\nThe table has several tournaments listed: Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, PGA Championship, and Totals. For each of these, there are numbers under columns like wins, top-5, etc. But the key is whether Tony LeMa participated in them or not.\n\nWait, actually, I'm not sure who this data is about. Maybe it's a dataset showing performance across tournaments, but without information on participation. So perhaps the relevant cells are those that indicate participation, but the table doesn't show participation; it shows performance metrics like wins and top finishes.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for any indication of participation in each tournament. But in the given table, the columns are 'wins,' 'top-5,' etc., not participation status. So perhaps the relevant cells would be the ones indicating whether he participated, but that info isn't present here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"cuts made\" is an indicator of participation\u2014if you make cuts, you participate. But that's speculative. Or perhaps the number of events and cuts made can indicate participation.\n\nWait, the 'events' column seems to show how many events he played in each tournament. For example, Masters Tournament has 4 events, US Open has 6, etc. If 'cuts made' is a measure of participation (i.e., how many times he made it through the cut), then perhaps we can infer that if he made any cuts, he participated.\n\nBut without explicit participation data, this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe \"top - X\" positions indicate participation\u2014if he's in the top 25, for example, he probably participated.\n\nBut let me think differently. The claim is that Tony LeMa did not participate in these four tournaments: Masters, US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open Championship. So, to verify this, I need to check if there's any data in the table indicating that he didn't participate in these.\n\nLooking at each tournament:\n\n1. Masters Tournament:\n   - He has 0 wins.\n   - 1 top-5 finish.\n   - 2 top-10.\n   - 4 top-25.\n   - 4 events.\n   - 4 cuts made.\n\nIf he made 4 cuts, that suggests he participated. So if making a cut means participating, then he did participate in Masters Tournament. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says he didn't participate, but the data shows he did.\n\n2. US Open:\n   - 0 wins.\n   - 2 top-5.\n   - 3 top-10.\n   - 4 top-25.\n   - 6 events.\n   - 5 cuts made.\n\nAgain, 5 cuts made suggests participation. So he participated here too, contradicting the claim.\n\n3. PGA Championship:\n   - 0 wins.\n   - 0 top-5.\n   - 1 top-10.\n   - 2 top-25.\n   - 5 events.\n   - 4 cuts made.\n\n4 cuts made indicates participation. So he participated here as well.\n\n4. The Open Championship:\n   - 1 win.\n   - 2 top-5.\n   - 2 top-10.\n   - 2 top-25.\n   - 3 events.\n   - 3 cuts made.\n\n3 cuts made suggests participation.\n\nNow, looking at the Totals row: It shows totals across all tournaments. The 'cuts made' column here is 16. So in total, he made 16 cuts across these tournaments, which implies he participated in each of them because making a cut usually requires participating.\n\nWait, but if the claim says he did not participate in these four, and the data shows he did participate in all four (as he made cuts in each), then the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for participation would likely be 'cuts made' because it indicates whether he participated (cut means entry). So for each of these tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open Championship, their respective 'cuts made' cells are relevant.\n\nBut wait, the Totals row also has 'cuts made' as 16. However, that's overall, so it might not be directly relevant unless we're comparing, but in this case, each tournament's participation is shown by its own cuts made count. So I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Masters Tournament: row_index 0, column 'cuts made'\n- US Open: row_index 1\n- PGA Championship: row_index 3\n- The Open Championship: row_index 2\n- Totals: row_index 4\n\nWait, but the claim is about not participating in those four specific tournaments. So perhaps each individual tournament's participation (cuts made) matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'events' column indicates participation\u2014if he participated, he would have events. But since all these tournaments have positive event counts, that might not be helpful.\n\nI think the most relevant cells are the 'cuts made' columns for each of those four tournaments because they directly indicate participation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"tony lema make it to the top 10 in the us open , but do not continue on.\" Hmm, first thing I notice is that \"tony lema\" doesn't seem to match any of the tournaments listed in the table. The table has \"masters tournament,\" \"us open,\" \"the open championship,\" \"pga championship,\" and a totals row.\n\nWait, maybe \"tony lema\" is a typo or refers to someone else. But looking at the table, there's no mention of a player named Tony Le\u043c\u0430. So perhaps this is a red herring. If the person doesn't exist in the data, then their performance can't be determined from the table.\n\nBut let me double-check. The claim mentions the US Open specifically. In the table, under the US Open row, the top-5 column has 2, and top-10 has 3. So if Tony Lema made it to the top 10, that would mean the top-10 count should include them. However, since the table doesn't list any data for a player named Tony Lema, we can't verify whether they made it or not.\n\nAdditionally, the part about \"do not continue on\" is unclear. Maybe it's referring to not advancing past the top 10? But again, without specific data about Tony Lema, we can't confirm anything related to their performance.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim references a player not present in the table, making it impossible to verify from the given information. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"tony lema\" which is not listed as a tournament or participant in the table, so it cannot be verified.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tony lema do not win in the pga championship\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table. First, I should check if Tony LeMa is mentioned in the table. Looking at the table's rows, the tournaments listed are masters tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship. None of these entries mention Tony LeMa.\n\nWait, maybe \"tony lema\" refers to someone else, like a player or a person associated with golf? But according to the table, there's no data on any players named Tony LeMa winning or not winning in these tournaments. The table tracks which tournaments each event won and some statistics, but it doesn't specify individual wins by players.\n\nSince none of the rows mention Tony LeMa, I can't confirm whether he did or didn't win in the PGA Championship because there's no relevant data. Therefore, without information about Tony LeMa's participation or performance, the claim can't be fully supported. So, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because we don't have sufficient evidence from the table to verify it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
