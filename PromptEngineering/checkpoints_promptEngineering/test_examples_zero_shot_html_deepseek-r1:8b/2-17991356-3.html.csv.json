The claim states: \"all of the 7 players in the 2003 PGA Championship were from the United States.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check the table structure. It has columns for player, country, year won, total, and to par. There are seven rows listed, each with a different player's name and their country as \"united states.\"\n\nThe claim refers to the 2003 PGA Championship, but looking at the table, none of the players have the year 2003 listed. The years range from 1986 to 1997. So there are no entries for 2003 in the table provided.\n\nThis means that if the claim is about the 2003 tournament, the table doesn't contain any relevant data on those players.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some golf players and their stats, and I need to check if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the highest total of all 7 player be mark brook , with 181.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it.\n\nFirst, I think the user meant to say that Mark Brooks has the highest total among all 7 players listed in the table, and his total is 181. So, I need to check each of the seven players' 'total' column and see if Mark Brooks indeed has the highest number there.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows:\n\n1. Paul Azinger: total 149\n2. Davis Love III: total 149\n3. Mark Brooks: total 181\n4. John Daly: total 151\n5. Bob Tway: total 151\n6. Jeff Sluman: total 154\n7. Rich Beem: total 157\n\nSo, the totals are 149, 149, 181, 151, 151, 154, and 157. The highest among these is Mark Brooks with 181. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which cells in the table support this claim. Each player's row has a 'total' cell. So, all seven players have their total listed. But since the claim is specifically about Mark Brooks having the highest total, only his row's relevant column is the 'total'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the 'total' cell for Mark Brooks, which is in row index 2 (since it's zero-based) and the column name \"total\". Therefore, I should include this specific cell in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states, \"Davis Love III does not win in 1996 or 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that Davis Love III did not win any tournaments in the years 1996 and 1991. To verify this, I should look into the table provided and check if there are any entries for Davis Love III corresponding to those years.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's an HTML table with several columns: player, country, year won, total, and to par. Each row represents a different player along with their respective details.\n\nNow, let me scan through each row to find the one where the player is Davis Love III. \n\n1. The first row has \"paul azinger\" as the player, so that's not relevant.\n2. The second row lists \"davis love iii,\" which is our target player. Let's note down this row's details.\n\nIn the second row:\n- Player: davis love iii\n- Country: united states\n- Year won: 1997\n- Total: 149\n- To par: +9\n\nSo, according to this table, Davis Love III won a tournament in 1997. There's no mention of him winning in either 1996 or 1991.\n\nNow, the claim is that he did not win in those years. Since there's no data showing a win in 1996 or 1991 for him, the claim holds true based on the information provided.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other rows where Davis Love III might have won in those years. However, looking through all the rows, only one row corresponds to him, which is in 1997. There's no indication of wins in 1996 or 1991.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, it appears that Davis Love III did not win any tournaments in 1996 or 1991.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Davis Love III did not win in 1996 or 1991.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"Paul Azinger and Davis Love III each have the same number as their total: 149.\" So, I need to check if both Paul Azinger and Davis Love III have a 'total' of 149 in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: player, country, year won, total, and to par. The rows are for different golfers with their stats.\n\nNow, let's find Paul Azinger's row. Scanning through the players, the first one is Paul Azinger in 1993 with a total of 149. So that matches the claim.\n\nNext, Davis Love III. I need to locate his row. The second row is for Davis Love III from 1997. His total is also 149. That's exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo both Paul Azinger and Davis Love III have a 'total' of 149. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. For each player mentioned, their 'total' column values need to be checked. So for Paul Azinger, it's row index 0, column \"total\" with value 149. For Davis Love III, it's row index 1, same column \"total.\"\n\nI should list these two cells as relevant in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"3 of the 7 2003 PGA Championship players have to par +11.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists players, their countries, the year they won, total, and to par. But wait, the years listed are from 1986 to 2002. There's no player with a year of 2003. Hmm, that seems odd because the claim is about the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\nSo, I should check if any players in the table played in 2003. Looking at each row:\n\n1. Paul Azinger won in 1993.\n2. Davis Love III in 1997.\n3. Mark Brooks in 1996.\n4. John Daly in 1991.\n5. Bob Tway in 1986.\n6. Jeff Sluman in 1988.\n7. Rich Beem in 2002.\n\nNone of these players have a year of 2003. That means there are zero players in this table who won the PGA Championship in 2003, not three or seven as the claim suggests.\n\nNow, checking the columns: total and to par. For each player, I need to see if their total was achieved with a to-par score of +11.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Paul Azinger: total 149, to par +9. Not +11.\n- Davis Love III: same as above.\n- Mark Brooks: total 181, to par +11. That's one.\n- John Daly: total 151, +11. Second.\n- Bob Tway: same as Daly, so third.\n- Jeff Sluman: total 154, +14. Not relevant.\n- Rich Beem: total 157, +17. Also not.\n\nSo, only three players (Mark Brooks, John Daly, Bob Tway) have a to par of +11. However, the claim is about the 2003 championship, which isn't even in the table. Since there are no 2003 players listed, the claim's premise is incorrect. \n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"7 2003 PGA Championship players.\" If none of them are in this table, then the number of players with +11 is zero, not three. Therefore, the statement is FALSE because it misrepresents both the year and the count.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the 2003 PGA Championship, but no player with that year is listed in the table.

The claim says, \"only 5 of the 7 players in the 2003 PGA Championship were from the United States.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It lists several golf players, their countries, the year they won, total, and to par. The years listed are 1991, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1986, 1988, and 2002. Wait a minute, none of these players have a year that's 2003. That's interesting because the claim is about the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\nSo, I need to check if any of the players in the table participated in the 2003 event. But looking at the \"year won\" column, all entries are from before 2003 except for rich beem in 2002. That means none of these seven players won in 2003. \n\nBut the claim isn't about who won; it's about how many players were from the US. So, I need to know if there were only five US players out of seven in the 2003 field. However, since the table doesn't include any players from 2003, I can't verify the number of US players based on this data. \n\nWait, maybe the table is about winners, not all participants. If that's the case, then none of these seven won in 2003, so they're irrelevant to the 2003 event. Therefore, I don't have enough information from the table to confirm how many US players were in the 2003 field because it only lists winners up to 2002.\n\nSo, the claim can't be verified as TRUE because there's no data about the 2003 participants in the table.

I should check if this discrepancy affects the evaluation.\n\nNext, the claim says \"lowest total out of all 7 players.\" The table has seven rows, each representing a different player. My task is to find out who among these seven has the lowest total score.\n\nLooking at the 'total' column in the table:\n\n- Paul Azinger: 149\n- Davis Love III: 149\n- Mark Brooks: 181\n- John Daly: 151\n- Bob Tway: 151\n- Jeff Sluman: 154\n- Rich Beem: 157\n\nSo, the totals range from 149 to 157. The lowest total in this list is 149, which is shared by Paul Azinger and Davis Love III. Mark Brooks has a total of 181, which is much higher than that.\n\nTherefore, Mark Brooks does not have the lowest total; instead, he has one of the higher totals. The claim states that he has the lowest, which isn't true.\n\nNow, considering the relevant cells: Since the claim refers to Mark Brooks, I should look at his row in the table. His row is the third one (row_index 2), and the column in question is \"total.\" So the relevant cells are row index 2 and column name \"total.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is FALSE because Mark Brooks does not have the lowest total.

Or perhaps both columns \"year won\" and another? Wait, no. The claim is about the year, so we need to check if davis love iii's year matches those. But since his row is row1 with 1997, which doesn't match, so the cells are irrelevant for confirming this particular claim.\n\nWait, but the user is asking to find relevant cells regardless of whether they confirm or not.
