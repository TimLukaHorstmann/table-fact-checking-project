    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"With a tie no 2, Sheffield Wednesday be home team.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"tie no 2,\" which refers to a specific row in the table. Looking at the table, there are multiple rows with \"tie no\" as their identifier. For example, tie no 1, tie no 2, and so on.\n\nThe claim says that for tie no 2, the home team is Sheffield Wednesday. So I need to find the row where tie no is 2 and check what the home team is in that row.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row with tie no 2. Let me check each row:\n\n1. Tie no 1: Home team is Nottingham County.\n2. Tie no 2: Home team is Sheffield Wednesday.\n3. Tie no replay: Home team is Southampton, but this isn't numbered as 2, so it doesn't apply here.\n\nSo the second tie (tie no 2) has Sheffield Wednesday as the home team, which matches the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because in tie no 2, Sheffield Wednesday is indeed listed as the home team.\n\nI should also identify the relevant cells that support this claim. The relevant cell would be the \"home team\" column for tie no 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"on march 19 , 1984 , plymouth argyle play derby county\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it states that on March 19, 1984, Plymouth Argyle played against Derby County. The key elements here are the date (March 19, 1984), the home team (Plymouth Argyle), and the away team (Derby County).\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table lists several matches with their tie numbers, home team, score, away team, and dates. Each row represents a match between two teams on a specific date.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column, I see that the earliest date mentioned is March 10, 1984, in rows 1, 3, and 4. Then, there are replay matches on March 20 and March 14, which seem to be related to earlier matches needing a replay. The last entry is row 4 with a date of March 10, 1984.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions March 19, but in the table, all dates are either March 10 or subsequent days for replays. I don't see any match on March 19. That's odd because March 19 falls between March 10 and March 20 but isn't listed anywhere in the table.\n\nSo, checking each row:\n\n- Row 1: March 10, 1984. Teams are Notts County vs Everton.\n- Row 2: March 11, 1984. Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton.\n- Row 3: March 20, 1984 (replay). Southampton vs Sheffield Wednesday.\n- Row 4: March 14, 1984 (replay). Derby County vs Plymouth Argyle.\n- Row 5: March 10, 1984. Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County.\n\nWait, row 5 is number 4 in the table? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the HTML table again, it starts with row 1 as 1, then 2, 3 (which is a replay), 4, and then another replay as row 5. So row 5 is Derby County vs Plymouth Argyle on March 14.\n\nSo, in the table, there are matches for Plymouth Argyle against Derby County on March 10 (row 5) and then a replay on March 14 (row 4, which was initially row 3 but now it's a replay). But the claim says March 19. There's no match between these two teams on that specific date.\n\nTherefore, since there is no match on March 19 in the table, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions a game between Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton with a score of 0-0. So, I need to find any such match in the table where these two teams played each other and the score was 0-0.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's an HTML table with headers: tie no, home team, score, away team, date. The rows have data for different matches. Let me go through each row to find Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Tie number 1: Home team is Notts County vs Everton. Not relevant.\n- Tie 2: Home team is Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton. The score here is 0-0. That's exactly what the claim mentions. So, that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, there's also a replay in tie 3 and tie 4. Let me check those as well.\n\nTie 3:\n- Home team is Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County. Not relevant.\nTie 4:\n- Replay between Derby County and Plymouth Argyle. Again, not relevant for Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton.\n\nSo, the only match that fits is tie number 2, where Sheffield Wednesday played against Southampton with a score of 0-0 on 11 March 1984.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by this particular row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim: \"the score for the game where birmingham city be the home team on 10 march 1984 be 1 - 3.\"\n\nSo, I need to find in the table a game where Birmingham City is the home team and it was played on 10 March 1984. Then check if their score was 1-3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. Let's list out the rows:\n\nRow 1: \ntie no:1\nhome team: notts county\nscore:1 -2\naway team: everton\ndate:10 march 1984\n\nRow 2:\ntie no:2\nhome team: sheffield wednesday\nscore:0 -0\naway team: southampton\ndate:11 march 1984\n\nRow3:\ntie no: replay\nhome team: southampton\nscore:5-1\naway team: sheffield wednesday\ndate:20 march 1984\n\nRow4:\ntie no:3\nhome team: plymouth argyle\nscore:0 -0\naway team: derby county\ndate:10 march 1984\n\nRow5:\ntie no: replay\nhome team: derby county\nscore:0-1\naway team: plymouth argyle\ndate:14 march 1984\n\nRow6:\ntie no:4\nhome team: birmingham city\nscore:1 -3\naway team: watford\ndate:10 march 1984\n\nWait, so row6 is the one where Birmingham City is the home team on 10 March 1984. Their score is indeed 1-3.\n\nSo, all the conditions in the claim are met: Birmingham City is the home team on that date with a score of 1-3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row_index 5 (since it's zero-indexed) for column 'score' because that's where the score is checked. Also, row6 has the tie no as 4, but the key columns are date, home team, and score.\n\nWait, the claim mentions the game where Birmingham City is the home team on 10 March 1984. So in the table, row6 (index5) is that match. So I need to check the home team, date, and score.\n\nThus, relevant cells would be:\n\n- For tie number: row_index 5, column 'tie no' isn't needed because the claim doesn't mention it.\n- Home team: row5, 'home team'\n- Date: row5, 'date'\n- Score: row5, 'score'\n\nBut wait, in the table, rows are numbered starting from 1 to 6. So in the HTML, the first row is index0? Or does the user consider them as per their order?\n\nWait, the instruction says \"row_index\" which I think refers to the position in the list. So row1 is index0, row2 index1, etc.\n\nBut looking at the table, it's actually:\n\n<tr> elements start from 0, but the tie numbers are 1,2,3,4, so perhaps the first row is index0 with tie no 1.\n\nSo in the claim, the game is identified by three criteria: home team (Birmingham City), date (10 March 1984), and score (1-3).\n\nIn the table:\n\nLooking at each row's home team:\n\nRow0: notts county\nRow1: sheffield wednesday\nRow2: southampton\nRow3: plymouth argyle\nRow4: derby county\nRow5: birmingham city\n\nYes, row5 is Birmingham City as home. The date for this row is 10 march 1984, and the score is 1-3.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n\n- tie no: not necessary, but maybe not needed.\n- home team: row5 (index5), 'home team'\n- date: row5, 'date'\n- score: row5, 'score'\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about the game where Birmingham City is the home team on that date. So all three columns are relevant.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, they only considered two cells. Hmm. But in this case, perhaps all three columns are needed.\n\nWait no, let me check the instructions again. The instruction says:\n\n\"relevant_cells\": a list of objects, each with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string)\n\nSo for each relevant cell, we need to state which column it is in, regardless of whether it's being used for identity or not.\n\nIn this case, the claim mentions three things: home team, date, score. So all three columns are relevant because they're part of verifying the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index5 (since it's the 6th row in the HTML, which starts at index0) for 'home team', 'date', and 'score'.\n\nWait no: wait, the rows are as follows:\n\nRow0: tie1\nRow1: tie2\nRow2: replay\nRow3: tie3\nRow4: replay2\nRow5: tie4\n\nSo row5 is where Birmingham City is home on 10 March with score 1-3.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor home team: row_index5, column 'home team'\n\nDate: row_index5, column 'date'\n\nScore: row_index5, column 'score'\n\nTherefore, all three columns are relevant for this specific claim because each of them is a condition in the claim. So we need to check that these cells match.\n\nSo, I think the answer is TRUE and the relevant_cells include home team, date, and score from row5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Birmingham City was the home team on 10 March 1984 with a score of 1-3 against Watford. Checking the table, row index 5 (tie no 4) matches all these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the score for the game where birmingham city be the away team on 10 march 1984 be 1 - 3.\" So, they're saying that on March 10, 1984, when Birmingham City was the away team, the score was 1-3.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row where Birmingham City is listed as the away team and see if their game on that date had a score of 1-3. \n\nLet me go through the table row by row:\n\nRow 1:\n- tie no: 1\n- home team: notts county\n- score: 1 - 2\n- away team: everton\n\nSo, this is Everton vs. Notts County. Birmingham City isn't the away team here.\n\nRow 2:\n- tie no: 2\n- home team: sheffield wednesday\n- score: 0 - 0\n- away team: southampton\n\nAgain, not Birmingham City as the away team.\n\nRow 3:\n- tie no: replay\n- home team: southampton\n- score: 5 - 1\n- away team: sheffield wednesday\n\nNot relevant either.\n\nRow 4:\n- tie no: 3\n- home team: plymouth argyle\n- score: 0 - 0\n- away team: derby county\n\nStill not Birmingham City.\n\nRow 5:\n- tie no: replay\n- home team: derby county\n- score: 0 - 1\n- away team: plymouth argyle\n\nNope, still not the one.\n\nRow 6:\n- tie no: 4\n- home team: birmingham city\n- score: 1 - 3\n- away team: watford\n\nWait a minute, in this row, Birmingham City is the home team, and they scored 1-3 against Watford. But the claim says Birmingham City was the away team on that date. So, according to the table, on March 10, 1984, when Birmingham City played as the home team, their score was 1-3. However, the claim states they were the away team.\n\nSo, in the table, there's no row where Birmingham City is the away team with a score of 1-3 on that date. They are only listed as the home team. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims they were the away team but the data shows them as the home team.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The claim says \"Birmingham City be the away team\" and the score \"1 - 3.\" Looking at the table, in row 4 (tie no:3), the away team is derby county against plymouth argyle, so that's not Birmingham. In row 6, tie no:4, the home team is Birmingham, so they scored 1-3 as home. So there's no game where Birmingham was away with a score of 1-3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Birmingham City wasn't the away team in any game that resulted in a 1-3 score on March 10, 1984.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on March 10, 1984, when Birmingham City was the away team, the score was 1-3.

There's no row where they were the away team with that score.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\nRelevant cells:\n- The cell where the home team is birmingham city on 10 march 1984, which is in row index 6, column \"home team\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"plymouth argyle play the away team derby county after 14 march 1984\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It mentions that Plymouth Argyle plays against Derby County as the away team, and the match occurs after March 14, 1984. So, the key points here are Plymouth Argyle (home team), Derby County (away team), and a date after March 14, 1984.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. There are six entries in total, some with \"replay\" as the tie number, which probably indicates additional matches due to draws.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Tie 1: Home team is Notts County vs Everton on March 10, 1984.\n2. Tie 2: Home team is Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton on March 11, 1984. There's a replay on March 20, 1984.\n3. Tie 3: Home team is Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County on March 10, 1984. Then a replay on March 14, 1984.\n4. Tie 4: Home team is Birmingham City vs Watford on March 10, 1984.\n\nThe claim mentions Plymouth Argyle playing against Derby County as the away team after March 14, 1984. Looking at the table, I see that in Tie 3, Plymouth Argyle is the home team against Derby County with a score of 0-0 on March 10. Then there's a replay where Derby County is the home team playing Plymouth Argyle as the away team on March 14. So, the match after March 14 would be the replay.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"play... after 14 march 1984.\" The replay is on March 14, so does that count as after? Technically, March 14 is the same day, not after it. However, in some contexts, a match on the 14th might be considered after the initial match on the 10th.\n\nBut looking at the table, the replay for Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County is on March 14, which is the date specified in the claim. So the match does occur on that date, which is March 14, 1984.\n\nAlso, in the replay row (tie 5), Derby County is listed as the home team and Plymouth Argyle as away, which matches the claim's structure: Plymouth Argyle is the home team? Wait no, in the replay, Derby County is home and Plymouth is away. So the claim says \"plymouth argyle play the away team derby county,\" meaning that Plymouth would be the home team against Derby as away. However, in the table, it's the opposite in the replay.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the roles here. In football matches, the \"away\" team is usually listed second. So when the claim says \"plymouth argyle play the away team derby county,\" that would mean Plymouth is home and Derby is away. But looking at the table, in Tie 3, Plymouth is home against Derby as away on March 10. Then in the replay (tie 5), it's reversed: Derby is home and Plymouth is away.\n\nSo the initial match is Plymouth at home vs Derby away, but the replay flips that. The claim states that after March 14, 1984, Plymouth plays as the home team against Derby as the away team. But according to the table, on March 14, it's actually Derby hosting Plymouth. So does this match the claim?\n\nThe claim says \"plymouth argyle play the away team derby county after 14 march 1984.\" The wording suggests that Plymouth is the home team and Derby is the away team after that date. However, in reality, on March 14, it's the opposite: Derby is home and Plymouth is away.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect because the match on March 14 has Derby as home, not Plymouth. Unless there's another match where Plymouth is home after March 14, but looking at the table, that's not the case. The only other matches are on March 10, which is before March 14.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"after\" March 14, so any match on or after that date would need to have Plymouth as home and Derby as away. But in the table, there's no such match. The replay on March 14 has Derby as home and Plymouth as away, which doesn't fit the claim.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the specific match where Plymouth is home against Derby as away doesn't occur after March 14; instead, it's the opposite. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Plymouth Argyle plays against Derby County (away) after March 14, 1984. The table shows a match between Plymouth and Derby on March 10, 1984, with Plymouth as home and Derby as away. A replay occurs on March 14, but it's Derby hosting Plymouth, not the other way around.
