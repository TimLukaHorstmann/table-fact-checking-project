    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field , yona\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any that mention both \"2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\" and \"Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona\".\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. The first few rows don't have \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" in the competition column.\n2. Moving down, I notice row 20 (row_index: 12), which has:\n   - date: 20 July 2012\n   - venue: Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona\n   - score: 5 - 1\n   - result: 5 - 1\n   - competition: 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\n\nThis row directly mentions the competition in question and the venue specified in the claim. So this is a match between two cells that support the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check if there are other rows related to the same competition. Row 21 (row_index: 13) also has the same venue but the competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\". Wait, no, looking again, row 12 (index: 20) is correct for the competition and venue. Then row 13 (index: 21) mentions a different date but same venue, with competitions that don't match.\n\nWait, actually, row 12 (index: 20) has the correct both competition and venue. Row 13 (index: 21) might not be necessary because it's about a different competition, so only row 12 is relevant here.\n\nTherefore, only one cell in row 12 for 'competition' and 'venue' supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in rizai memorial stadium , manila\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any entries that match the competition mentioned, which is the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first few rows have competitions like AFC Challenge Cup and others, but none mention the 2013 EAFF.\n2. Then there's a row from July 20, 2012, in Yona with Leo Palace. It mentions the 2012 and 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifiers. Wait, that's relevant because it includes the competition we're looking for.\n3. The next rows are also in July 2012 but have different scores and maybe other competitions. I'm focusing on the competition name here.\n4. There's another row with Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila, and the competition is the 2012 Philippine Peace Cup. That's not the one we're looking for.\n\nSo, the key relevant row is the July 20, 2012, entry in Yona, where the competition is listed as 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier. However, the claim mentions that the match was played in Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila. But in the table, that stadium is associated with the 2012 Philippine Peace Cup, not the 2013 EAFF.\n\nTherefore, even though there's an entry for the 2013 competition, it's not linked to Rizal Memorial Stadium. So the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
