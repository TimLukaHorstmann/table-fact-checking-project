    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville.\" So I need to verify if row 217 has the lowest lbsc number among all entries where the lbsc name is Granville.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant data in the table provided. Looking through the table, I see that there are several rows with different lbSC names and numbers. My main focus is on the lbSC name \"granville\" and its corresponding lbSC number.\n\nI start by scanning each row to find where \"granville\" appears as the lbsc name. After skimming through the table, I find that row 217 has the lbsc name Granville with an associated number of 620. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest number for that specific name.\n\nNext, I'll look at other rows to see if there's any other entry where the lbSC name is \"granville\" and its number is lower than 620. Scanning further, I notice that row 216 also has an lbsc name of Granville but with a higher number (619). Similarly, row 215 doesn't have Granville as the lbsc name; it's Salisbury. Row 214 is Gladstone, not relevant here.\n\nContinuing down, I check if any rows after 217 have Granville with lower numbers than 620. However, since we're looking for the lowest, and row 217 is the only one in question, there are no lower numbers to consider beyond that point because it's near the end of the table provided.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that no other rows before 217 have the name \"granville\" with a number less than 620. From what I can see, prior to row 217, the Granville entry at 217 is the first occurrence in the lower part of the table, and there are no earlier entries (lower row indices) with that name.\n\nWait, actually, the rows are listed from 0 upwards, so row 0 is the top, and row numbers increase as we go down. So if Granville appears at row 217, I need to check all rows before it (i.e., rows 0-216) for any other entries of \"granville\" with a lower number than 620.\n\nLooking back, in the table provided, prior to row 217, the only entry with \"Granville\" is row 217 itself. There's no Granville in earlier rows, so it doesn't have any lower numbers. Therefore, 620 is indeed the lowest for that name.\n\nSo putting it all together: among all entries where lbSC name is Granville, row 217 has the number 620, and there are no other entries with a lower number. Hence, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 217, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
