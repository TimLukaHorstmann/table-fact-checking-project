    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the match with opponent cleber luciano last 7:57\". \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is stating. It mentions a match where the opponent is Cleber Luciano and that it ended at 7:57. So I need to find in the table if there's such a record.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like 'res' (result), 'record', 'opponent', etc. I'll go through each row to check for Cleber Luciano as the opponent and see what time is associated with that match.\n\nI'll start scanning the 'opponent' column. The first few rows have opponents like John Cox, Flavio Troccoli, Din Thomas, etc., none of which are Cleber Luciano. \n\nContinuing down, I find a row where the opponent is Cleber Luciano. Let me check that row: \n\n- res: win\n- record: 3 - 0\n- opponent: Cleber Luciano\n- method: ko\n- event: ec 22 - extreme challenge 22\n- round: 1\n- time: 7:57\n\nSo this row matches the claim perfectly. The opponent is Cleber Luciano, and the time is exactly 7:57.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other rows with Cleber Luciano to avoid missing another instance. Scanning further, I don't see any other entries for him in the 'opponent' column. \n\nSince all the details in the matching row align with the claim\u2014opponent and time\u2014I can confirm that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tko (cut) be the method in round 1 of the ufc 20 event\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two main things: the method used and the round number. The method is \"tko (cut)\", which stands for Technical Knockout (Cut). The event is UFC 20, and it specifically refers to Round 1 of that event.\n\nNow, I'll examine the HTML table to find any relevant cells. The table has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time. My focus is on the \"method\" column for each row because that's where the actual method used in the fight is recorded, and also the \"event\" and \"round\" columns.\n\nStarting with the event \"ufc 20\". I need to look through the table rows where the \"event\" cell matches this. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"ufc 33\", which doesn't match.\n2. Second row: \"hitman fighting productions 2\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: \"ufc 32\" \u2013 not 20.\n4. Fourth: \"ufc 31\" isn't there either. Wait, looking closer, the fifth row is \"ufc 30\", sixth is \"ufc 29\", seventh \"ufc 27\", eighth \"kotc 4 - gladiators\", ninth \"ufc 24\", tenth \"pride 8\", eleventh \"ufc 20\". Ah, there it is. So the eleventh row is for UFC 20.\n\nNow, looking at that row: res is \"loss\", record is \"3 - 1\", opponent is \"laverne clark\", method is \"tko (cut)\", event is \"ufc 20\", round is \"1\", and time is \"1:31\".\n\nSo the method used in Round 1 of UFC 20 is indeed \"tko (cut)\". That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. The event is UFC 20, the method is tko (cut), and it happened in round 1. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the relevant cells in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the ufc 20 event ended with a method of decision (unanimus).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main things: \n1. The event is UFC 20.\n2. The method used to determine the outcome was a decision, specifically a unanimous one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with columns like 'res' (result), 'opponent', 'method', etc. I need to find rows related to UFC 20 and check if any of them have a 'decision (unanimous)' method.\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'event' column for \"ufc 20\". The table has several events like \"ufc 33\", \"ufc 32\", etc., but I don't see \"ufc 20\" listed. Wait, let me double-check. \n\nGoing through each row's 'event' column:\n- ufc 33\n- ufc 32\n- ufc 30\n- ufc 29\n- ufc 27\n- ufc 4 (kotc)\n- ufc 24\n- pride 8\n- ufc 20\n\nAh, here's \"ufc 20\" in the 9th row. Now, looking at that row:\n- res: loss\n- method: tko (cut)\n\nSo, the method for UFC 20 was a 'tko (cut)', not a decision. The claim mentions a 'decision (unanimus)' method, which doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other row related to UFC 20 with a different outcome, but in this table, each event is unique, so each row corresponds to one fight.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data. The relevant cells are the ones for \"event\" and \"method\" in the UFC 20 row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
