The claim states: \"the oldest stadium be stanford bridge , which open in 1877.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions \"Stanford Bridge\" as the oldest stadium and claims it opened in 1877. So I need to verify if there's a stadium named Stanford Bridge in the table with that opening year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the team name, stadium name, capacity, opened year, and city. I'll go through each row to find any mention of \"Stanford Bridge.\"\n\nStarting from the top, I see rows for teams like Amsterdam Admirals, Barcelona Dragons, Berlin Thunder, etc., but none have \"Stanford Bridge.\" Scrolling further down, there's a team called London / England Monarchs with multiple stadiums listed. \n\nOne of their entries is:\n- Stadium: Stanford Bridge\n- Capacity: 42449\n- Opened: 1877\n- City: London, England\n\nThis matches the claim exactly.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"At 8000, Wembley Stadium has the largest capacity of any NFL stadium in Europe.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a capacity of 8000 and refers to Wembley Stadium. It also claims this is the largest among all NFL stadiums in Europe.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team, their stadium, capacity, opened year, and city. So, I need to find the relevant cells that can verify the claim. \n\nI'll start by locating Wembley Stadium in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see several entries for London / England Monarchs, one of which is Wembley Stadium with a capacity of 80000. Wait, but the claim says 8000, which doesn't match this. That's odd.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"at 8000 , wembly stadium have...\" So they're saying capacity is 8000. But in the table, Wembley Stadium has a capacity of 80,000. So that already doesn't match. Maybe there's another stadium with 8000 capacity?\n\nLooking further, I see London / England Monarchs have multiple stadiums listed: Ashton Gate (21500), Alexander Stadium (7600), Crystal Palace (15500), Stamford Bridge (42449), White Hart Lane (36240), and Wembley Stadium (80000). None of these except Wembley match 8000. Wait, but none have 8000. So maybe the claim is referring to another stadium.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo. The claim says \"at 8000,\" which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which team uses Wembley Stadium as their home ground. In the table, London / England Monarchs have several stadiums, including Wembley with 80,000 capacity, but none at 8000.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is incorrect because Wembley's capacity is much higher than 8000. So the claim's figure doesn't match any stadium in Europe listed here as having that capacity. Therefore, the claim might be false.\n\nBut I should check all relevant cells. The key points are: capacity of 8000 and whether it's the largest NFL stadium in Europe.\n\nLooking at the table, all capacities are higher than 8000 except maybe some smaller ones like Alexander Stadium with 7600 or Crystal Palace with 15500? Wait, no, 15k is more. So perhaps the claim refers to a capacity of 8000, but none match that exactly. The closest might be 7600, but it's not 8000.\n\nAdditionally, Wembley has a capacity of 80,000, which is much higher than 8000. So if the claim says Wembley has the largest capacity at 8000, that's incorrect because it's actually 80k and there might be other stadiums with higher capacities in Europe.\n\nWait, but the table only lists NFL teams in Europe, perhaps? Or is it all European football leagues? The team names include Scottish Claymores, Rhein Fire, etc., which I think are part of European leagues. So Wembley's capacity is 80k, which would be higher than any other in the table.\n\nBut the claim says 8000, so maybe it's a typo and they meant to refer to another stadium with that capacity. For example, looking at Rhein Fire, their Rheinstadion has 55,900, which is larger than 8000. Similarly, Wembley is much higher. So regardless of the team, the claim's figure doesn't align with any listed capacity.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Wembley Stadium's actual capacity is much higher than 8000, and no other stadium in the table has a capacity of exactly 8000. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any stadium in the table has a capacity of 8,000 and if Wembley Stadium holds the highest capacity among NFL stadiums in Europe.\n\n1. **Looking for Capacity = 8,000:**\n   - Scanning through the table, none of the listed capacities match 8,000 exactly.\n   - The closest lower figure is Alexander Stadium with 7,600 and Crystal Palace with 15,500, neither of which are 8,000.\n\n2. **Wembley Stadium's Capacity:**\n   - Wembley Stadium has a capacity of 80,000, which is significantly higher than 8,000.\n   - This makes the claim's figure incorrect as it doesn't match any stadium in the table.\n\n3. **Largest NFL Stadium in Europe:**\n   - Wembley Stadium has the highest capacity among all listed stadiums, being 80,000.\n   - No other stadium exceeds this number in the provided data.\n\nBased on these points, the claim is incorrect because it misrepresents Wembley Stadium's actual capacity and there are no stadiums with a capacity of 8,000 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Amsterdam Admirals are in Amsterdam, Netherlands \u2013 not relevant.\n2. Another entry for Amsterdam Admirals, same city \u2013 still irrelevant.\n3. Barcelona Dragons are in Barcelona, Spain \u2013 nope.\n4. Their second stadium is also in Barcelona \u2013 still not London.\n5. Berlin Thunder has two entries, both in Berlin, Germany \u2013 not what we're looking for.\n6. Cologne Centurions are in Cologne, Germany \u2013 again, not London.\n7. Frankfurt Galaxy is in Frankfurt, Germany \u2013 nope.\n8. Hamburg Sea Devils are in Hamburg, Germany \u2013 still not London.\n9.

Third entry is in London, England \u2013 this one counts!\n12. Fourth entry for London team is Stamford Bridge, London \u2013 another count.\n13.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"arena aufschalke be open 1 year after aol arena\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that \"arena aufschalke\" was opened one year after \"aol arena.\" So, I need to find out when each of these two stadiums were opened and see if they are exactly one year apart.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for both stadium names: \"arena aufschalke\" and \"aol arena.\"\n\nStarting with \"aol arena,\" I scan through the 'stadium' column. I find it in row 8: <td>aol arena</td>. According to the 'opened' column, this stadium was opened in 2000.\n\nNext, I look for \"arena aufschalke.\" Scanning the same column, I see it in row 9: <td>arena aufschalke</td>. The 'opened' year here is 2001.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between these two years. If the claim is correct, \"arena aufschalke\" should have been opened exactly one year after \"aol arena.\" So, 2001 minus 2000 equals 1 year. That fits perfectly.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other entries that might confuse this. Let me check if \"aol arena\" appears more than once or in any other rows. From the table, it only appears once in row 8.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table and then identify which cells in the table support that conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"at 80000 , wembley stadium have the second largest capacity of any nfl stadium in europe.\" \n\nSo, several points to consider here:\n\n1. **Capacity of Wembley Stadium**: The claim mentions a specific capacity figure, which is 80,000.\n2. **Second Largest Capacity**: It claims that this capacity makes Wembley Stadium the second largest among NFL stadiums in Europe.\n3. **NFL in Europe**: The reference is to NFL stadiums, not necessarily traditional European football stadiums.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant rows and columns. Let's see:\n\n- **Wembley Stadium** is listed under the \"stadium\" column for one of the London / England Monarchs' entries.\n- The capacity figure in the table for Wembley Stadium is 80,000.\n\nNow, considering NFL stadiums in Europe, I know that the NFL has a presence there through various games and practices. However, looking at the table, I need to check if any other stadium listed has a higher capacity than 80,000.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Amsterdam Admirals**: Capacities are 51,859 and 31,600.\n2. **Barcelona Dragons**: 15,276 and 56,000.\n3. **Berlin Thunder**: 76,000 and 19,500.\n4. **Cologne Centurions**: 50,374.\n5. **Frankfurt Galaxy**: 52,000.\n6. **Hamburg Sea Devils**: 55,989.\n7. **London / England Monarchs**: Various capacities (21,500; 7,600; 15,500; 42,449; 36,240; 80,000).\n8. **Rhein Fire**: 51,500; 61,524; 55,900.\n9. **Scottish Claymores**: 52,500 and 67,500.\n\nFrom this list, the highest capacity is 76,000 at Olympiastadion (Berlin Thunder) and another 67,500 at Murrayfield Stadium (Edinburgh). Wait, no, Murrayfield is 67,500. So, Wembley has 80,000, which is higher than both.\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to check NFL stadiums in Europe. Looking back, the table includes various European stadiums, but it's unclear if they are all NFL-regular-season stadiums or just practice facilities. The claim specifically refers to NFL stadiums, so perhaps only those that host NFL games regularly would count.\n\nLooking at the table, Wembley Stadium is known to have hosted multiple NFL games, including the London Games starting in 2016. So it's a valid NFL stadium in Europe with a capacity of 80,000.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any other NFL stadium in Europe with a higher capacity than 80,000. From my general knowledge, Wembley is one of the larger stadiums used by the NFL in Europe, but I'm not sure if it's the second largest. However, based on the table provided, the next highest capacity listed is Olympiastadion at 76,000 and Murrayfield at 67,500.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the capacities listed are:\n\n- Wembley: 80,000\n- Berlin (Olympiastadion): 76,000\n- Frankfurt: 52,000\n- Hamburg: 55,989\n- Cologne: 50,374\n- Rhein Fire's Arena Aufschalke is 61,524\n- Murrayfield: 67,500\n\nSo the highest after Wembley is Olympiastadion at 76,000. Therefore, Wembley would be the largest. But the claim says it's the second largest. That suggests there might be another stadium with a higher capacity.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the table:\n\nLooking for capacities over 80,000:\n\n- Wembley: 80,000\n- Olympiastadion (Berlin): 76,000\n- Murrayfield (Edinburgh): 67,500\n- Arena Aufschalke: 61,524\n- Rheinstadion: 55,900\n- LTU Arena: 51,500\n- etc.\n\nNone of the other stadiums listed have a capacity higher than 80,000. So Wembley is actually the largest. Therefore, the claim that it's the second largest would be incorrect because it's the largest.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking for the \"stadium\" column and their capacities:\n\n- Wembley: 80,000\n- Olympiastadion (Berlin): 76,000\n- Arena Aufschalke (Rhein Fire): 61,524\n- Murrayfield (Scottish Claymores): 67,500\n- Rheinstadion (Rhein Fire): 55,900\n- LTU Arena (Rhein Fire): 51,500\n\nSo the highest is Wembley at 80k, followed by Berlin at 76k. Therefore, if the claim says Wembley is second largest, that's incorrect because it's actually the largest.\n\nBut wait, maybe the table has another stadium with higher capacity? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all capacities:\n\n- 52,500 (Scottish Claymores)\n- 67,500 (Murrayfield)\n- 61,524 (Arena Aufschalke)\n- 76,000 (Berlin)\n- 80,000 (Wembley)\n\nSo no, Wembley is the highest. Therefore, the claim that it's the second largest would be false because it's actually the largest.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"NFL stadium in Europe.\" Maybe the user refers to stadiums used by NFL teams in Europe, not just any European stadium hosting NFL games. In that case, Wembley is known as a regular host for NFL games, and the other main stadiums are London's, Berlin, etc.\n\nBut based on the table provided, Wembley has the highest capacity at 80k, so it can't be second largest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wembley Stadium with a capacity of 80,000 is the second largest among NFL stadiums in Europe. Upon reviewing the table, Wembley indeed has the highest capacity listed (80,000), making it the largest rather than the second. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\nRelevant cells:\n- The cell at row 8, column \"stadium\" where the stadium name is \"Wembley Stadium\" with a capacity of 80,000.\n- The cell at row 6, column \"capacity\" for Wembley Stadium to confirm its capacity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

London / England Monarchs - White Hart Lane (1899)\n15. London / England Monarchs - Wembley Stadium (1923)\n16. Rhein Fire - LTU Arena (2004)\n17. Rhein Fire - Arena Aufschalke (2001)\n18. Rhein Fire - Rheinstadion (1926)\n19. Scottish Claymores - Hampden Park (1903)\n20. Scottish Claymores - Murrayfield Stadium (1925)\n\nNow, I'll identify the stadium that opened in 1877 because the claim mentions that specific year.\n\nLooking through each row's \"opened\" column:\n\n- The London / England Monarchs have Stamford Bridge which opened in 1877.\n\nThat's one stadium. Now, is there any other stadium with an earlier opening date? Let's check all rows.\n\nAnother stadium, Hampden Park, was opened by Scottish Claymores in 1903, but that's later than 1877.\n\nSo, the earliest opening year is 1877 with Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe claim says the oldest stadium is LTU Arena, which opened in 1877. But according to the table, it's Stamford Bridge (not LTU Arena) that opened in 1877 and is the oldest. \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the oldest stadium isn't LTU Arena but Stamford Bridge.\n\nNow, I need to find the relevant cells. The claim mentions \"ltu arena\" which corresponds to row_index 16, column_name \"stadium name\". Also, it refers to the opening year 1877, which is in column \"opened\".\n\nSo, the relevant_cells are:\n- Row 13 (since index starts at 0) for \"opened\" column.\nWait, no: row indices start at 0. Let me check:\n\nStamford Bridge is row 13 (index 13), and it's in the \"opened\" column.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the table has rows from 0 to 39.\n\nWait, actually, let me recount. The user provided a list of rows numbered from 1 to 40? Wait no, the user listed each row with details, but I need to assign row_index correctly.\n\nIn the table, each <tr> represents a row. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first stadium (Amsterdam Admirals - Amsterdam Arena) as row 0, then next ones incrementing by 1.\n\nSo, row 13 would correspond to London / England Monarchs - Stamford Bridge.\n\nYes, so in the table, the row where \"stadium name\" is Stamford Bridge is at row_index 13, and the column is \"opened\".\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions LTU Arena, which is row_index 16 (Rhein Fire - LTU Arena), column \"stadium name\".\n\nSo, both row 13 (\"opened\") and row 16 (\"stadium name\") are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the oldest stadium is LTU Arena, opened in 1877. However, the table shows Stamford Bridge as the oldest, opened in 1877. The relevant cells are where \"opened\" for Stamford Bridge (row 13) and \"stadium name\" for LTU Arena (row 16).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opened\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"stadium name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim and see if it holds true based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"there be 7 stadium locate in london , england.\" So, I need to check how many stadiums listed in the table are located in London, England.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table and note down which ones have their city as 'london , england'. \n\n1. **Row 8**: team is 'london / england monarchs', stadium is 'ashton gate', city is 'bristol , england' \u2013 not London.\n2. **Row 9**: same team, stadium is 'alexander stadium', city is 'birmingham , england' \u2013 still not London.\n3. **Row 10**: same team, stadium is 'crystal palace national sports centre', city is 'london , england' \u2013 this counts.\n4. **Row 11**: same team, stadium is 'stamford bridge', city is 'london , england' \u2013 another one.\n5. **Row 12**: same team, stadium is 'white hart lane', city is 'london , england' \u2013 third one.\n6. **Row 13**: same team, stadium is 'wembley stadium', city is 'london , england' \u2013 fourth.\n\nSo that's four stadiums for the London/England Monarchs in London. Now, I should check other teams with 'london' in their city.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- **Row 14**: Rhein Fire's 'ltu arena' is in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.\n- **Row 15**: same team, arena Aufschalke is in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.\n- **Row 16**: same team, Rheinstadion is in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.\n\nNo other teams have London listed as their city except the Monarchs. Wait, actually, looking back, the first row is Amsterdam Admirals with locations in Amsterdam, so not relevant. The claim only concerns London.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each team:\n\n- **London / England Monarchs** have 5 entries:\n  - Bristol (row8)\n  - Birmingham (row9)\n  - London: Crystal Palace (row10), Stamford Bridge (row11), White Hart Lane (row12), Wembley (row13) \u2013 that's four stadiums in London.\n\nAny other teams with 'london , england' as their city? Let me check each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Amsterdam\n- Row1: Amsterdam\n- Row2: Edinburgh, Scotland\n- Row3: Glasgow, Scotland\n- Row4: Edinburgh, Scotland\n- Row5: Glasgow, Scotland\n- Row6: Glasgow, Scotland\n- Row7: D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n- Row8: Bristol, England (not London)\n- Row9: Birmingham, England\n- Row10: London, England\n- Row11: London, England\n- Row12: London, England\n- Row13: London, England\n- Row14: D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n- Row15: Gelsenkirchen, Germany\n- Row16: D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n- Row17: Glasgow, Scotland\n- Row18: Edinburgh, Scotland\n- Row19: Rhein Fire in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n- Row20: same team, Gelsenkirchen, Germany\n- Row21: same team, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n- Row22: Scottish Claymores in Glasgow, Scotland\n- Row23: same team, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nWait, so only the London/England Monarchs have multiple entries. Specifically, rows 10,11,12,13 are in London. That's four stadiums.\n\nBut the claim says \"7 stadium locate in london , england.\" So, is it four?\n\nHold on, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check each team:\n\n- Rhein Fire: no entries in London.\n- Scottish Claymores: Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n- Amsterdam Admirals: only in Amsterdam.\n- Others: mainly in Germany or other UK cities.\n\nSo, only the London/England Monarchs have four stadiums in London. Therefore, there are four, not seven.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me count again:\n\nRows 10-13 (4 entries) for London/England Monarchs in London. No others.\n\nBut wait, row8 is Bristol, so it's not London. Rows 10-13 are four.\n\nSo the claim says there are seven, which is incorrect because only four are listed as being in London.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all stadiums in London:\n\nLooking for city 'london , england' across all rows:\n\nRows where city is 'london , england':\n\n- Row10: Crystal Palace\n- Row11: Stamford Bridge\n- Row12: White Hart Lane\n- Row13: Wembley\n\nThat's four.\n\nSo the claim is saying there are seven, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists four stadiums in London for the London/England Monarchs team.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the scottish claymore have stadium in d\u00fcsseldorf hamburg , germany\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions the Scottish Claymores having a stadium in D\u00fcsseldorf and Hamburg, Germany. So I should look for entries in the table where the team is \"Scottish Claymores\" and the city is either D\u00fcsseldorf or Hamburg.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to find matches. \n\nRow 1: Team is Scottish Claymores, city is Glasgow, Scotland. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Same team, city is Edinburgh, Scotland. No match.\nRows 3-10: These are other teams like Berlin Thunder, Cologne Centurions, etc., so not relevant for the claim about Scottish Claymores.\n\nLooking further down, rows 11-19:\nRow 12: Team is Rhein Fire. Not relevant.\nRow 13: Same team, different city. \nRow 14: Still Rhein Fire.\nRow 15: Team is Scottish Claymores. City is Glasgow, Scotland. Not D\u00fcsseldorf or Hamburg.\nRow 16: Same team, city is Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"arena aufschalke be open 3 year before aol arena\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Arena Aufschalke opened three years before AOL Arena. So, I need to find out when each of these venues was opened and see if there's a three-year difference between them.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two relevant rows: one for Arena Aufschalke and another for AOL Arena. Let me locate those in the table.\n\nStarting with Arena Aufschalke: Scanning through the 'stadium' column, I find it under the row for \"rhein fire.\" The stadium name is \"arena aufschalke,\" and according to the 'opened' column, it was opened in 2001.\n\nNext, AOL Arena: Looking again at the 'stadium' column, there's a row for \"hamburg sea devils\" with the stadium named \"aol arena.\" The 'opened' year is listed as 2000.\n\nNow, let me calculate the difference between these two opening years. Arena Aufschalke opened in 2001, and AOL Arena opened in 2000. So, the difference is 2001 minus 2000, which equals 1 year. Wait, that's only a one-year gap, not three years as the claim states.\n\nHmm, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. Maybe I confused the stadium names or the years. No, Arena Aufschalke is for Rhein Fire and opened in 2001, while AOL Arena is for Hamburg Sea Devils, opened in 2000. So the difference is indeed one year, not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Arena Aufschalke was open three years before AOL Arena isn't supported by the data. It actually only opens one year prior.
