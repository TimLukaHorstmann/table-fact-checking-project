    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"anne street have no major junction in the milepost\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes. The claim mentions \"anne street,\" so my first thought is to find any rows where \"anne street\" appears in the 'street names' column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row lists \"norfolk\" as the county, \"stoughton\" as location, and the street names include \"pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue.\" No mention of \"anne street\" here.\n2. The second row is for \"weymouth,\" and the street name is just \"anne street.\" This seems relevant because the claim is about \"anne street.\"\n3. The third row discusses \"north avenue plain street market street\" in \"rockland,\" so not directly related to \"anne street.\"\n4. The fourth row repeats the same streets as the third, so again not about \"anne street.\"\n5. The fifth row talks about \"hanover street rockland street columbia road,\" which doesn't mention \"anne street.\"\n\nSo, the second row is the only one where \"anne street\" appears. Now, I need to check if this row supports the claim.\n\nIn that row, the 'milepost' column has \"(no major junctions)\" and the 'roads intersected' also say \"(no major junctions).\" The notes column confirms it as well: \"(no major junctions).\" \n\nWait, but the claim says \"have no major junction in the milepost.\" Milepost is a specific data point. However, looking at the table, the 'milepost' column has numerical values like 3.0, (no major junctions), etc. For the second row, it's written as \"(no major junctions)\" instead of a number.\n\nSo, the claim mentions \"milepost,\" which refers to specific mile markers. The row in question doesn't provide a number but indicates no major junctions. Therefore, there might be some ambiguity here. But since the 'roads intersected' column also says \"(no major junctions),\" and it's more directly related to junctions, maybe that's where the focus should be.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions \"milepost,\" which in other rows is a number. So perhaps the user means checking if there are any major junctions associated with \"anne street\" at a specific milepost location. But since this row doesn't have a numerical value for milepost and instead notes no major junctions, it's more about confirming that there are none.\n\nBut wait, the claim is stating that \"anne street have no major junction in the milepost.\" The 'milepost' column either has numbers or \"(no major junctions).\" So in this case, since \"anne street\" is present and the corresponding 'roads intersected' (and notes) say there are no major junctions, it seems to support the claim.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because 'milepost' usually refers to a specific location on a road. If a row has \"(no major junctions),\" does that mean at all mileposts or just this particular one? The claim says \"in the milepost,\" which might imply that for any milepost along \"anne street,\" there are no major junctions.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row represents a specific segment or point. So if \"anne street\" is only present in one row, and in that row, there are no major junctions, then it's TRUE for that particular milepost. But perhaps the claim is trying to say that generally, \"anne street\" doesn't have any major junctions at any milepost.\n\nIn the table provided, the only occurrence of \"anne street\" is in the second row, where there are no major junctions. So based on this data, it seems TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if \"milepost\" refers to a specific value or just whether there's a junction. Since the 'roads intersected' column explicitly states \"(no major junctions),\" and that's tied to the same row as \"anne street,\" that's where the relevant cells are.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be the second row, looking at the 'roads intersected' column, which confirms no major junctions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on checking if there are any major junctions for \"anne street\" in the milepost. The table shows that in the second row, where \"anne street\" appears, there are indeed no major junctions as indicated by both the 'roads intersected' and notes columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"roads intersected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"north avenue plain street market street have both 12.2 and 12.8 list in the milepost column.\" \n\nI need to check if this statement is true or not by looking at the provided HTML table. The relevant part of the claim is about the \"milepost\" column containing both 12.2 and 12.8 for a specific set of streets.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the columns are county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes. The rows represent different entries in the same locations but possibly different intersections or points.\n\nThe claim mentions \"north avenue plain street market street.\" From the table, this specific combination of streets appears in two rows: one with a milepost of 12.2 and another with 12.8. \n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\n- The first relevant row is when county is plymouth, location is rockland, and the street names are \"north avenue plain street market street.\" For this row, the milepost is 12.2, roads intersected are route 123, and notes mention it's the western terminus of a concurrency.\n\n- The next relevant row is also for county=plymouth, location=rockland, same street names: north avenue plain street market street. Here, the milepost is 12.8, roads intersected are again route 123, but the note says it's the eastern terminus of the concurrency.\n\nSo both 12.2 and 12.8 appear in the milepost column for these specific streets. Therefore, the claim should be true because both values are present.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that \"north avenue plain street market street\" is exactly as given. In the table, it's listed as \"north avenue plain street market street\" in two rows, which matches the claim.\n\nSo the milepost column does have both 12.2 and 12.8 for those streets. That makes the claim true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"milepost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"milepost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"route 24 intersects with pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure and the data it provides. The table has several columns: county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes.\n\nThe claim mentions route 24 and a set of streets: pleasant street, turnpike street, and lindelof avenue. I need to find if there's any row where these streets are listed as being intersected by route 24.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific location in either Norfolk or Plymouth counties. For each row, we can check which columns are relevant.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- County: norfolk\n- Location: stoughton\n- Street names: pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue\n- Milepost: 3.0\n- Roads intersected: route 24\n- Notes: route 24 exit 20\n\nHere, the roads intersected column says \"route 24\", which matches the claim. The street names in this row include all three streets mentioned in the claim. So this seems directly relevant.\n\nNow checking other rows to see if any others might be relevant:\n- Second row (Norfolk, Weymouth): No major junctions mentioned, so not relevant.\n- Third row (Plymouth, Rockland): Milepost 12.2 and 12.8 both show route 123 as the intersected road, which doesn't match route 24.\n- Fourth row: Similar to the third but at milepost 12.8.\n- Fifth row (Plymouth, Hanover): Route 53 is mentioned, so again not relevant.\n\nSo only the first row has the intersection of route 24 with those specific streets.

It has several columns: county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes. The rows represent different entries with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions a milepost value \"12.8\" for the location \"rockland.\" So I need to look into the table and see if there's any row that matches both the milepost of 12.8 and the location as rockland.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first two rows are for Norfolk county.\n2. Then there are three rows for Plymouth county, specifically one for rockland with milepost 12.8? Let's check.\n   - Third row: milepost is 12.2 and location is rockland.\n   - Fourth row: milepost is 12.8 and location is rockland.\n   - Fifth row: another rockland entry with a different milepost.\n\nSo, the fourth row has milepost 12.8 and location rockland. That seems to match exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other occurrence of milepost 12.8 elsewhere in the table that might also be for rockland. Looking through all rows:\n\n- Norfolk has a row with milepost (no major junctions), but no 12.8.\n- Plymouth has three entries: two at 12.2, one at 12.8, and another at 17.9.

The claim says: \"anne street be located in plymouth county and have no major junction for milepost or road intersect.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The first part is about the location of Anne Street. From the table, I remember that there's a row where the location is \"weymouth\" and the street name is \"anne street\". So in the table, Anne Street is in Weymouth, not Plymouth. That already seems to contradict the first part of the claim, which says it's in Plymouth County.\n\nNext, the second part mentions having no major junctions for milepost or road intersections. Looking at the table, there are two rows with \"weymouth\" as the location. In both of these rows, the 'roads intersected' column is filled with \"(no major junctions)\" and so is the 'notes' column. So Anne Street in Weymouth does not have any major junctions. \n\nHowever, since the first part of the claim incorrectly states that Anne Street is in Plymouth County, that part is wrong. The second part about no major junctions is correct because the table supports that. But the overall claim is a statement that both parts are true. Since one part is false and the other is true, the entire claim isn't fully accurate.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say to check each condition in the claim against the table. So maybe I should look for cells related to \"Anne Street\" and see if it's in Plymouth or not, and whether there are any major junctions.\n\nFrom the table, Anne Street is only mentioned once in Weymouth, so that part of the claim is false because it's not in Plymouth County.

The claim involves two specific locations: hanover in plymouth county and route 123.\n\nI should check if there's a row where county is \"plymouth\" and location includes \"hanover.\" Looking at the table, I see that under Plymouth County, there are two rows for Rockland and one for Hanover.

So, my task is to check if there's any row in the table where \"milepost\" equals 12.8 and \"location\" is Weymouth.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different intersection point with details like county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see if any match both milepost 12.8 and location as Weymouth.\n\nRow 0: Milepost is 3.0, and the location is Stoughton. So no match here.\n\nRow 1: Milepost is (no major junctions), which probably means there's no specific milepost value. The location is Weymouth, but since milepost doesn't have a number here, it doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Milepost is 12.2 and the location is Rockland.
