    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about Jessica Quinones is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by breaking down what the claim says and then cross-reference it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"jessica quinone (26) play for far eastern in 2012.\" First, I notice that there's a typo in the name; it should be \"Jessica Quinones\" instead of \"jhofel morales\" or any other names mentioned. So, the correct spelling is important here.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: name, position, number, school/club team, season, and acquisition via. Since the claim mentions \"far eastern,\" that's likely referring to the 'school / club team' column. The season mentioned is 2012, so I should look for a row in 2012 where the name is Jessica Quinones.\n\nNow, scanning through each row for 2012: let's see. There are multiple players with the same position and number, but specifically looking for Jessica Quinones. Wait, in the table provided, I don't actually see a row with the name \"Jessica Quinones.\" The closest is jessica quinones with a lowercase 'j' and without the last name spelled correctly as \"Quinones\" versus \"Quinone.\"\n\nWait, no, looking again, I see that in the table, there's a row:\n\n<td>jessica quinones</td>\n<td>guard</td>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>far eastern</td>\n<td>2012</td>\n<td>rookie draft</td>\n\nSo yes, the name is \"jessica quinones,\" with lowercase 'j' and correct spelling. The claim uses \"Jessica Quinone\" which might be a typo. Wait, no, the claim says \"jessica quinone (26)\"\u2014wait, that's different. Oh, the claim has \"quinone\" as the last name instead of \"Quinones.\" So there's another discrepancy: \"quinone\" vs \"quinones.\"\n\nWait, looking back at the table, I think the exact row is:\n\n<td>jessica quinones</td>\n... which would correspond to the correct spelling with an 'es' at the end. The claim uses \"jessica quinone,\" missing the second 's.' So that's another point against it.\n\nWait, but in the table, it's \"jessica quinones,\" so the last name is spelled as \"quinones.\" The claim says \"jessica quinone,\" which would be incorrect. But perhaps I should check if the name in the claim exactly matches a row in the table.\n\nBut regardless of spelling, let me look for the exact match. In the table, there's a player named jessica quinones (with lowercase 'j') in 2012, playing for far eastern as a guard with number 26. So the name in the claim is \"jessica quinone\" which might not exactly match. Wait, but actually, I think that might be a typo in my part\u2014perhaps the claim intended to write \"Jessica Quinones.\"\n\nWait, no, the user's claim is written as: \"jessica quinone (26) play for far eastern in 2012.\" So the name is misspelled as \"quinone\" instead of \"quinones.\" Additionally, the player's first name is \"jessica,\" not \"jessica,\" which might be a typo. Wait, no\u2014the player in the table has \"jessica quinones,\" so perhaps the claim is using a different name entirely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on what's in the table versus the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"jessica quinone (26).\" In the table, there's a player named jessica quinones with number 26. So the last name in the claim is incorrect\u2014it's \"quinone\" instead of \"quinones.\" That's one issue.\n\nSecond, the position: the table shows the player as guard, which matches the claim's \"guard.\" So that part is correct.\n\nThird, the team: far eastern, which matches the table.\n\nSeason: 2012, which matches.\n\nSo despite the misspelling in the last name (\"quinone\" vs \"quinones\"), all other details match. However, in the table, the player's first name starts with a lowercase 'j,' while the claim might have it as uppercase or not, but perhaps that's just a formatting issue.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the first column is written as \"jessica quinones\" with a lowercase 'j' and correct last name. The claim uses \"jessica quinone,\" which is incorrect spelling but matches all other details: number 26, position guard, team far eastern, season 2012.\n\nSo, the main point is whether the name in the table exactly matches the claim. Since the last name is misspelled, that would make the claim FALSE because the exact name doesn't match. Alternatively, if we consider that the misspelling is just a typo and the rest of the details align, it might be considered TRUE.\n\nBut in reality, the name must match exactly for the claim to be true. So since \"quinone\" isn't the correct last name, it's incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: in the table, the player is jessica quinones, and the claim refers to jessica quinone. The only difference is the 's' at the end of the last name. So that's a discrepancy in spelling, making the claim incorrect.\n\nSo yes, the answer would be that the claim is FALSE because the last name doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the user is incorrect due to a misspelling in the player's last name. While all other details such as position, team, and season align with the information in the table, the discrepancy in the spelling of the last name (\"quinone\" vs \"quinones\") means the claim does not match exactly.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because the last name \"quinone\" does not match the correctly spelled \"quinones\" in the player's name.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"in 2012, julieta makidato play for cebu.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if there's a player named Julieta Makidato in the table. Looking through the 'name' column, yes, there's an entry for her in row index 1.\n\nNext, I need to verify the details for that specific row. The season is given as 2012, which matches the claim. Now, checking the 'school / club team' column for this player: it says \"cebu.\" That directly matches the team mentioned in the claim.\n\nI should also make sure there are no discrepancies or other information that might contradict the claim. For example, if the acquisition method was different or another team is listed, but in this case, everything aligns with the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row where Julieta Makidato is listed and the specific column for the team she plays for. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row index 1 for both 'name' and 'school / club team' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about Jessica Quinones is true based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"in the 2012 season jessica quinone (26) play for a team call mcgill.\" So, I need to verify if Jessica Quinones with number 26 played for McGill in the 2012 season.\n\nI'll start by locating Jessica Quinones in the table. Scanning through each row, I find her in row 8 (since it's zero-indexed, but looking at the HTML, it seems like rows are from 0 to 9). Her details: name is Jessica Quinones, position is guard, number is 26, school/club team is far eastern, season is 2012, and acquisition via is rookie draft.\n\nNow, checking if she played for McGill. Looking at the 'school / club team' column, her entry is \"far eastern,\" which doesn't match McGill. So that's a red flag. But wait, I should double-check in case of any confusion. Maybe there's another row for McGill?\n\nI'll scan through all rows again. The row for Joyce Guio (row 7) is the closest to McGill, but her number is 11 and she plays as forward, which doesn't match Jessica Quinones.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions \"team call mcgill,\" which I interpret as McGill being her team. But according to the table, she's with far eastern. So the information in the table contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Jessica Quinones was part of the far eastern team, not McGill, during the 2012 season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
