    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is about the earnings being 2,335,460 total made during 2013.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The table has multiple columns: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, top 10s, best finish, earnings, money list rank, scoring average, and scoring rank. Each row corresponds to a specific year, from 2004 onwards, including 2013.\n\nI need to focus on the year 2013 specifically because that's when the claim is about. So I'll look for the row where the \"year\" column says 2013. Scanning through the rows, I find that the 13th row (since it starts from 2004) has the year 2013.\n\nLooking at this row, the relevant data points are in each column. The claim mentions \"earnings of 2335460 total be made during 2013.\" So I should check the earnings column for 2013.\n\nIn the 2013 row, under the \"earnings\" column, the value is 2,335,460. This matches exactly with the number in the claim. \n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure there are no discrepancies or typos. The claim's figure is 2,335,460 and the table also shows 2,335,460 under earnings for 2013. So that seems correct.\n\nHowever, looking further, I notice that some cells have \"n / a,\" which probably stands for 'not applicable.' But in this case, since the claim is about earnings and the relevant cell has a numerical value matching the claim, it's fully supported.\n\nSo, all conditions are met because the exact earning figure for 2013 as stated in the claim is present in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"earnings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is true or false. The claim states: \"earnings of 7603184 total be make from 2004 - 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that the total earnings across all years from 2004 to 2013 sum up to 7,603,184. So, my goal is to verify this by checking the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there are two rows related to totals: one for individual player earnings and another for overall totals. Wait, no, actually, the last row of the table says \"totals,\" which includes total tournaments, cuts made, wins, etc., but it also lists a \"money list rank\" as n/a and some scoring averages. However, I see that in the 2004-2013 rows, each year's earnings are provided. For example, 2007 has 380,263, 2008 has 1,138,370, etc., up to 2012 with 2,287,080 and 2013 with 2,335,460.\n\nWait a minute, the totals row at the very end of the table might be a separate section. Let me check: the last row in the tbody is for totals across all years? It shows \"totals\" as 161 tournaments, 137 cuts, etc., but then earnings are listed as n/a. So perhaps the total earnings aren't directly provided in that last row.\n\nTherefore, to find the total earnings from 2004 to 2013, I need to sum up the individual player's earnings each year. Each year's earnings are in separate rows starting from 2004 to 2013, except for 2013 which is included. So I should add all the \"Earnings\" column values from 2004 to 2013.\n\nLet me list out the yearly earnings:\n\n- 2004: n/a\n- 2005: n/a\n- 2006: 5,406\n- 2007: 380,263\n- 2008: 1,138,370\n- 2009: 271,303\n- 2010: 825,477\n- 2011: 365,231\n- 2012: 2,287,080\n- 2013: 2,335,460\n\nWait, but the years 2004 and 2005 have \"n/a\" in their earnings column. That might mean that either there was no earning data for those years, or it's not applicable. So I should only include the years where earnings are provided.\n\nThat leaves me with the following years to sum: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.\n\nNow, let's add these up:\n\nStarting from 2006:\n5,406\n+ 380,263 = 385,669\n+ 1,138,370 = 1,524,039\n+ 271,303 = 1,795,342\n+ 825,477 = 2,620,819\n+ 365,231 = 2,986,050\n+ 2,287,080 = 5,273,130\n+ 2,335,460 = 7,608,590\n\nWait, that's approximately 7,608,590. But the claim says the total earnings are 7,603,184. There's a discrepancy here\u2014my calculation shows about 7,608,590, which is slightly higher than the claimed 7,603,184.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an addition error. Let me double-check each step:\n\n2006: 5,406\n+2007: 380,263 \u2192 total so far: 385,669\n+2008: 1,138,370 \u2192 total: 1,524,039\n+2009: 271,303 \u2192 total: 1,795,342\n+2010: 825,477 \u2192 total: 2,620,819\n+2011: 365,231 \u2192 total: 2,986,050\n+2012: 2,287,080 \u2192 total: 5,273,130\n+2013: 2,335,460 \u2192 total: 7,608,590\n\nYes, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 7,608,590.\n\nNow, comparing this to the claim which states 7,603,184, there's a difference of about 5,406. That suggests the claim might be incorrect because the actual total based on the table is higher than what's stated.\n\nWait another thought\u2014perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again: in the totals row at the bottom, it says \"7603184\" for earnings? No, looking back, the totals row shows n/a in the earnings column. So that can't be the source of the 7,603,184 number.\n\nWait no, hold on. The user's claim is about \"earnings of 7603184 total be make from 2004 - 2013.\" Wait, maybe I misread it. Is it 7,603,184 or 76,031,84? No, in the table, one of the rows (the totals) shows 7,603,184 as a single number: \"7603184\".\n\nWait, looking at the table again, the last row before the totals is 2013's earnings: 2,335,460. The totals row says \"totals\" for various columns and in the earnings column, it's n/a except for the very last part where it might be a typo or another entry.\n\nWait no, looking carefully: the totals row has cells for each column. Let me parse that:\n\nRow index 12 (assuming starting from 0) is the totals row. The first cell is \"totals\", then 161 tournaments, 137 cuts, etc., and towards the end, the earnings column says n/a, except in the last entry it might be a different value? Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the table has 13 rows (0 to 12). The last row (row index 12) is for totals. Let's look at each cell:\n\n- Column 0: \"totals\"\n- Column 1: 161\n- Column 2: 137\n- Column 3: 9\n- Column 4: 46\n- Column 5: n/a\n- Column 6: 7603184\n- Column 7: n/a\n- Column 8: n/a\n- Column 9: n/a\n\nWait, that's different. I must have misread it before. So in the totals row (row index 12), column 6 is 7,603,184.\n\nSo now, perhaps the claim is referring to this total earnings of 7,603,184 from 2004-2013.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the relevant cell is row index 12, column \"Earnings\". But wait, the totals row is a separate row from the individual years. So the user's claim might be referring to whether the sum of all earnings from 2004 to 2013 equals 7,603,184.\n\nIn that case, I need to calculate the total earnings across all relevant rows and see if it matches.\n\nLooking back at each year:\n\n- 2004: n/a\n- 2005: n/a\n- 2006: 5,406\n- 2007: 380,263\n- 2008: 1,138,370\n- 2009: 271,303\n- 2010: 825,477\n- 2011: 365,231\n- 2012: 2,287,080\n- 2013: 2,335,460\n\nSo adding these up:\n\nStart with the first relevant year in 2006:\n\n5,406 (2006)\n\n+380,263 = 385,669 (2007)\n\n+1,138,370 = 1,524,039 (2008)\n\n+271,303 = 1,795,342 (2009)\n\n+825,477 = 2,620,819 (2010)\n\n+365,231 = 2,986,050 (2011)\n\n+2,287,080 = 5,273,130 (2012)\n\n+2,335,460 = 7,608,590 (2013)\n\nSo total earnings from the individual years 2006-2013 sum to 7,608,590.\n\nBut in the totals row, it's showing a different number: 7,603,184. So this suggests a discrepancy of about 5,406.\n\nTherefore, either there is an error in the table (perhaps the totals row should be 7,608,590), or the individual years' data might be incomplete or incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is only considering certain years or there's another factor, but based on the provided data, the total earnings from 2006-2013 are 7,608,590, which does not match the totals row of 7,603,184.\n\nWait, but in the totals row, it's showing a different number. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the actual total is higher than stated.\n\nTherefore, the user's claim that the earnings from 2004-2013 total 7,603,184 is not accurate based on the provided data; it should be 7,608,590.\n\nAlternatively, if the totals row is correct at 7,603,184, then there might be an error in how the individual years' earnings were added. But given that I've checked the addition multiple times and it comes to 7,608,590, it's more likely that the user's claim is incorrect.\n\nThus, in conclusion, the statement in the claim does not align with the provided data, making it incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim stating that the total earnings from 2004 to 2013 amount to 7,603,184 is incorrect based on the provided data. The accurate sum of earnings for these years is 7,608,590, which contradicts the figure presented in the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is incorrect. The total earnings from 2004 to 2013 are actually 7,608,590, not 7,603,184.",

The claim says, \"earnings of 2287080 total be made during 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There are multiple rows, each representing a year from 2004 to 2013, plus a totals row. Each row has several columns like year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, top 10s, best finish, earnings, money list rank, scoring average, and scoring rank.\n\nThe claim mentions \"earnings,\" so I need to find the relevant column in the table that corresponds to this. Scanning through the headers, I see a column named \"earnings.\" That's definitely the one we're interested in. \n\nNext, I have to identify which row pertains to 2012 because the claim is about earnings made during that year. Looking at the rows, I see that 2012 is represented by the row with \"row_index\": 6 (since it starts from 0). In this row, under the \"earnings\" column, the value is 2287080.\n\nWait a minute, but I just noticed something. The claim says \"total be made,\" and in the table, the \"earnings\" cell for 2012 is indeed 2287080. So that matches exactly. \n\nHowever, looking back at the instruction, it's important to ensure that all relevant cells are checked. The user provided an example where they included the \"Revenue\" column as a relevant cell. In our case, since the claim refers to \"earnings,\" which maps directly to the table's \"earnings\" column, we should include that specific cell.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells array should contain the row index (6) and the column name (\"earnings\"). Since all conditions are met and the data supports the claim, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"earnings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"earnings of 365231 total be make during 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the year 2011 in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that 2011 is row number 6 (since the first row is 2004, then 2005, and so on until 2012 as row 7). So row_index would be 6.\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"earnings of 365231 total be make.\" From this, the key columns are likely 'earnings' and possibly 'money list rank', as these relate to financial metrics.\n\nLooking at row 6 (2011), under 'earnings' it says 365231. That matches exactly with the number in the claim. So the earnings column is definitely relevant.\n\nNow, for 'money list rank', which is another column that might relate to earnings or total money made. In row 6, this column shows 31. While it's a different value, since the claim refers specifically to the total earnings being 365231, the money list rank isn't directly contradicted but isn't part of the main assertion either.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'earnings' column in 2011 and perhaps the 'money list rank'. However, the claim doesn't mention the rank, so maybe only 'earnings' is needed. But to be thorough, I'll include both as they might provide additional context about earnings.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to include a list of relevant cells that verify the claim. Since the claim focuses on earnings being 365231, the main cell is earnings. The money list rank could be additional info, but it's not necessary for verifying the specific earning figure. So perhaps only 'earnings' is needed.\n\nAlternatively, if the user includes both, it might show more context, but strictly speaking, the key data point is in the earnings column.\n\nI think I should include both columns just to cover all bases, especially since the table structure might imply that higher ranks correlate with higher earnings. But the claim doesn't state anything about the rank, so maybe only 'earnings' is relevant for this particular check.\n\nHmm, but the user's example includes two cells, like in their sample JSON. So perhaps they expect both columns to be marked as relevant if they provide context. However, since the specific number is in earnings, that's the critical one. The money list rank could be additional data but isn't necessary for confirming the exact figure.\n\nI'll go with including both columns to show that all possible relevant info is considered.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers specifically to the earnings of 365231 in 2011. By checking the table:\n\n- Year 2011 matches row index 6.\n- The 'earnings' column in this row shows exactly 365231, which supports the claim.\n- The 'money list rank' for 2011 is 31, which provides additional context but isn't directly part of the earnings figure.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data, making it TRUE. The relevant cells are 'earnings' and 'money list rank'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money list rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The main points are \"earnings,\" \"total,\" \"825477,\" and the year \"2011.\" So, I need to find these elements in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, starting from 2004 up to 2013, with various statistics. The column that seems relevant here is \"Earnings\" because it directly relates to the earnings mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find where \"Earnings\" equals 825477 and occurs in the year 2011. Let's check each row:\n\n- **2004**: Earnings are listed as \"n / a.\" Not matching.\n- **2005**: Also \"n / a.\"\n- **2006**: 5406. Not 825k.\n- **2007**: 380,263. Still not.\n- **2008**: Over a million, but the exact number isn't clear yet. Wait, in 2010, the earnings are 825477. That's the number we're looking for.\n\nWait, the claim is about 2011, so let me check the 2011 row. The \"Earnings\" column there says \"365231.\" Hmm, that's not 825k either. So maybe I misread the rows.\n\nWait no, actually in 2010, the earnings are exactly 825477. So if the claim is about 2011, then it should be looking at the 2011 row. But in 2011, the earnings are 365231, which doesn't match.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The claim says \"during 2011,\" but the earnings of 825477 occur in 2010, not 2011. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me double-check each row for 2011 and see if any other column might relate. But \"Earnings\" in 2011 is definitely 365k, so it doesn't match 825k.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the earnings of 825477 happened in 2010, not 2011.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the \"Earnings\" column equals 825477 for the year 2011. \n\n- The row for **2011** shows an \"Earnings\" value of **365231**, which does not match 825477.\n- The correct \"Earnings\" value of **825477** is found in the **2010** row, not 2011.\n\nSince the claim specifies the year 2011 but the earnings occur in 2010, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"earnings from 2009 to 2012.\" So I need to look at the earnings data for those years. In the table, each row corresponds to a year, and one of the columns is \"earnings.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I can see that each year's row has an \"earnings\" cell. For example, in 2009, the earnings are 271,303; in 2010, it's 825,477; in 2011, it's 365,231; and in 2012, it's 2,287,080.\n\nWait a minute, those numbers don't seem right. Let me double-check. Oh, actually, the table might have some formatting issues. For instance, in 2006, earnings are listed as 5,406 which seems low compared to other years, and in 2007 it's over 380,000. But the claim is about 2009 to 2012.\n\nIn 2009, earnings are 271,303. That's less than $500,000. In 2010, they're 825,477 which is more than half a million. So already, in 2010 alone, the earnings exceed the claimed amount. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting the years? Let me list them out:\n\n- 2009: 271,303\n- 2010: 825,477\n- 2011: 365,231\n- 2012: 2,287,080\n\nSo from 2009 to 2012, earnings start below $500k in '09 and '11, but go above in '10 and '12.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"during 2013 earnings be a mere 10000.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. The key points here are \"earnings\" and the year \"2013.\" So I need to look at the row for 2013 and the column named \"earnings.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"year\" column followed by others. Scanning through the rows, I see that the last data row is for 2013. In that row, under \"year,\" it's 2013, and in the \"earnings\" column, the value is $2,335,460.\n\nThe claim says earnings were a mere $10,000. That doesn't match because the actual earnings in 2013 were over two million dollars. \n\nSo based on this comparison, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"in 2012 the earnings be over $5,000,000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the year in question, which is 2012. So, I should focus on the row where the year is 2012.\n\nLooking through the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. The row for 2012 is indeed present. Now, I need to find the relevant column for earnings. Scanning the columns: there's 'earnings' and 'money list rank'. \n\nThe 'earnings' column for 2012 shows \"2287080\". This number is over 2 million but under 5 million. So, it doesn't meet the claim of over $5,000,000.\n\nI should also check if any other cells might be relevant, but in this case, only the earnings column directly relates to the claim. The 'money list rank' for 2012 is 1, which probably refers to the position on a money list, not the total earnings.\n\nTherefore, since the earnings in 2012 are 2,287,080, which is less than $5,000,000, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"earnings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "in 2011 there be earnings of only 5100",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 2011 there be earnings of only 5100.\" Hmm, first thing I should do is figure out what part of the table is relevant to this claim.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see several related to earnings: 'earnings', 'money list rank'. But wait, the exact wording mentions 'earnings' specifically. So the key column would be 'earnings'.\n\nNext, I need to find the 2011 row in the table. Scanning through, I see a row where year is 2011. That's row index 8 (since it starts at 0). In that row, under 'earnings', the value is 365231. Wait, but the claim says \"only 5100.\" So 365231 isn't equal to 5100.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Is the earnings column sometimes referred to as 'money list rank' or something else? Let me check again. No, the 'earnings' column is separate and in 2011 it's 365231. That's way higher than 5100.\n\nBut wait, could the claim be referring to a different metric, like money list rank? In that case, for 2011, the 'money list rank' is 31, which also isn't 5100. So no matter how I look at it, neither earnings nor money list rank in 2011 is 5100.\n\nWait, maybe the claim was miswritten and meant to say 510 million? Because looking at other years like 2008, earnings are in millions. But in 2011, it's still about 365,231 dollars. So that's not even close to 5100 or 510 million.\n\nAlternatively, could I be missing a different column related to earnings? Let me check the columns again: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, top 10s, best finish, earnings, money list rank, scoring average, scoring rank. So only 'earnings' and 'money list rank' are relevant for income-related metrics.\n\nSince neither matches the claim, I think the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells would be the 'earnings' column in the 2011 row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2011, earnings were only $5,100. However, checking the table, the earnings for 2011 are listed as $365,231 under the 'earnings' column (row index 8). Since this does not match the claim, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"in 2011 the earnings be 365231.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and focus on the year 2011. Let me scan through each row until I find where the year is 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a row for 2011 towards the bottom. The columns in that row are: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, top 10s, best finish, earnings, money list rank, scoring average, and scoring rank.\n\nNow, I need to check each column's value for 2011. Specifically, the claim mentions \"earnings,\" so I should find the cell under \"earnings\" in that row.\n\nIn the 2011 row, under \"earnings,\" it says \"365231.\" That matches exactly what the claim is stating: earnings were 365,231 in 2011.\n\nI don't see any other columns mentioned in the claim, so I only need to consider the \"earnings\" column.
