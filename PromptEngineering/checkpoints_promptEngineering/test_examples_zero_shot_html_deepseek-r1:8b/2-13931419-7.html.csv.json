    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the penguin and blue game on march 6 have an attendance of 9092.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions a specific game between the Penguins and the Blues that took place on March 6th, and it claims the attendance was 9092.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row corresponding to March 6th. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 1: March 2\n- Row 2: March 6\n\nSo, March 6 is row index 1 (since rows start from 0). Now, I'll check what team played that game. The 'visitor' column for row 1 says \"penguins.\" So the home team must be the opponent, which is the Blues.\n\nNext, the attendance. The table has a column named 'attendance,' and for March 6 (row 1), the value is 9092. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there are no discrepancies in other columns that might affect this claim. For example, the score is \"2 - 4,\" but since attendance is a separate metric, it doesn't impact whether the number of attendees was correct.\n\nSo, all relevant cells confirm that the attendance on March 6 for the Penguins-Blues game was indeed 9092.\n</think>\n\nThe attendance for the Penguins vs. Blues game on March 6 is listed as 9092 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the blue and penguin game on march 20 , score be 2 - 4.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The game involves two teams: blue and penguin. It happened on March 20th. The score was 2-4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with different details. I need to find the row that matches all these criteria: date is March 20, home team is either blue or penguin, away team is the other, and the score is 2-4.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one starting from March 20.\n\nIn the first relevant row for March 20 (row index 7), the visitor is blues. The score is 2 - 4. Wait, that matches! So the home team here must be penguins because the visitor is blues, and the score is 2-4 as claimed.\n\nSo all the details in the claim are present in this row: date, teams involved, and the score. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with the data in the table on March 20 where the Pittsburgh Penguins hosted the Blues with a score of 2-4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the king and penguin game on march 20 have score of 2 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It mentions a game between the Kings (king) and Penguins (penguin), which took place on March 20th. The score claimed is \"2 - 4\". So, I need to find in the table if there's a row for March 20th where both teams are Kings and Penguins, and their score matches 2 - 4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, points. The relevant columns here are \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", and \"date\". I'll focus on these four to verify the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match March 20th with Kings as the visitor and Penguins as home or vice versa. \n\nStarting from the top, I scan each row's date until I find March 20. There it is: one of the rows has \"march 20\" as the date. Let me check that row.\n\nIn the row for March 20th:\n- Date: march 20\n- Visitor: blues (so Kings are not the visitor here)\n- Score: 2 - 4\n- Home: penguins\n\nWait, so the home team is Penguins and the visitor is Blues. That means the game was between Blues (visitor) and Penguins (home). The claim says it's a game between Kings and Penguins. So this row doesn't match because the visitor is Blues, not Kings.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check if there's another March 20th entry with Kings as the home or visitor. But looking through the table, each date only has one row. So the only game on March 20th is between Blues and Penguins, which doesn't involve Kings.\n\nTherefore, there is no game on March 20th between Kings and Penguins. The claim is incorrect because it's referring to a non-existent game or a mix-up of teams. \n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if any other row on March 20th exists with Kings as home or visitor. But the table shows only one row per date, so no. Thus, the claim is FALSE because there's no such game between Kings and Penguins on March 20th with that score.\n\nAdditionally, to confirm, the score in that March 20th game is 2 - 4, but since it's Blues vs Penguins, not Kings vs Penguins, the teams don't match. So even if the score were correct, the teams are wrong.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game between the Kings and Penguins on March 20th with a score of 2-4. However, in the provided table, there is no such game entry for March 20th involving both Kings (visitor) and Penguins (home). The only match on that date is between Blues (visitor) and Penguins (home), with the same score of 2-4 but incorrect teams.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are the \"date\", \"visitor\", \"home\", and \"score\" columns for March 20th. Since the teams don't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
