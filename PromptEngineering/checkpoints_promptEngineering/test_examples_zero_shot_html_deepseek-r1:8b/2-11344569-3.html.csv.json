    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2009 andorra win the fewest gold medal with only 1\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions that in 2009, Andorra won the fewest gold medals with only 1. So I need to check if Andorra's gold medal count is indeed 1 in the year 2009 according to the table provided. However, looking at the table, I notice that it doesn't have a year column. The table lists various nations along with their gold, silver, bronze, and total medals from rank 1 to 8. But there's no indication of the year these statistics are for.\n\nAssuming that the table is for the 2009 Olympic Games, which might be a reasonable assumption given the context of medal counts. If that's the case, then I can look at Andorra's gold medals. According to the table, Andorra is ranked 8th with 1 gold medal, 7 silver, and 9 bronze, totaling 17 medals.\n\nSo, checking the \"gold\" column for Andorra, which is in row index 7 (since rows start from 0 or 1? Wait, let's count. The first row after <thead> is row 0 with Cyprus, then Iceland is row 1, Luxembourg row 2, Monaco row3, San Marino row4, Malta row5, Liechtenstein row6, and Andorra is row7. So yes, in row index 7, the gold column has a value of 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Andorra won only 1 gold medal is supported by the table data for 2009. However, I should consider if there's any possibility that the table isn't from 2009. If the table is from another year, like 2015 or something else, then the claim would be incorrect. But without explicit information on the year in the table, it's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention the year in their instruction. They just provided a table without any date context. So maybe I should check if the claim refers to a specific year not present in the table. For example, perhaps the data is from 2009, but the user included it in the problem, so I can assume that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all relevant years, and the claim is about 2009, which matches the data provided. So, given that, Andorra does have only 1 gold medal in their row, as per the table.\n\nSo, to break it down: The claim says Andorra won only 1 gold medal in 2009. From the table, Andorra's gold is indeed 1. Therefore, the claim is true based on this data.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key information is in the \"gold\" column for Andorra. So the relevant cells would be the row where nation is Andorra and the column is \"gold\". Looking at the table, that's row index 7 (since it's the eighth row if we count starting from 1, but in programming terms, rows are usually zero-indexed). Wait, let me recount:\n\n1. Cyprus - row 0\n2. Iceland - row 1\n3. Luxembourg - row 2\n4. Monaco - row3\n5. San Marino - row4\n6. Malta - row5\n7. Liechtenstein - row6\n8. Andorra - row7\n\nYes, so the relevant cells are row index 7 and column \"gold\".\n\nI think that's it. So the answer should be TRUE with those two relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Cyprus win 27 more gold medals than Iceland.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. So, to check the number of gold medals each country won, I should focus on the \"gold\" column.\n\nLooking at the rows, Cyprus is ranked 1, and Iceland is ranked 2. I need to find their respective gold medal counts.\n\nCyprus's gold count is 59, as per row index 0 (since it's the first row). Iceland's gold count is 32, which is in row index 1.\n\nNow, the claim says Cyprus has 27 more golds than Iceland. To verify this, I subtract Iceland's gold from Cyprus's: 59 - 32 equals 27. That seems correct at first glance.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Maybe I misread the numbers. Let me count again. Yes, 59 minus 32 is indeed 27. So, according to this calculation, the claim holds true.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this comparison, like total medals or the other medal counts. However, the claim specifically mentions only gold medals, so I don't need to worry about silver or bronze for this particular check.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether \"more\" implies a significant difference beyond just arithmetic. But in this context, since it's about the exact number, 27 more is accurate based on the numbers provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Cyprus has 59 gold medals, Iceland has 32. The difference is 27, which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"in 2009 cyprus win the most gold medal with 59\" is true based on the given table. Let's start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"cyprus,\" which in the table is one of the nations listed. That's good because we can look for Cyprus in the table to verify their performance. Next, it says \"win the most gold medal.\" This likely refers to having the highest number of gold medals compared to other countries at that time.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different country with their respective gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. The ranks go from 1 to 8, so rank 1 is Cyprus, which according to the claim should have won the most gold medals.\n\nIn the table, under \"gold,\" the numbers for each nation are: Cyprus has 59, Iceland has 32, Luxembourg has 26, Monaco has 7, San Marino has 4, Malta has 3, Liechtenstein has 2, and Andorra has 1. Comparing these, Cyprus indeed has the highest number of gold medals with 59.\n\nNow, to validate this claim, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The key cell is where Cyprus's rank is 1 and under the \"gold\" column it has 59. So the relevant cells are at row index 0 (since rows start from 0) for both the rank and gold columns.\n\nI should also check if the claim mentions anything about total medals, but in this case, the focus is on gold medals, so only the gold column is relevant here. The other numbers like silver or bronze aren't necessary unless the claim refers to them, which it doesn't.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is true because Cyprus indeed has the highest number of gold medals in 2009 as per the table. Therefore, I need to provide a JSON object that lists these relevant cells and marks the answer as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"although luxembourg win more total medals, monaco win 1 more silver medal.\" So, it's making two points here. First, that Luxembourg has more total medals than Monaco. Second, that Monaco wins exactly one more silver medal than someone\u2014wait, actually, the wording is a bit unclear. It says \"monaco win 1 more silver medal,\" but it doesn't specify compared to whom. Hmm, maybe I need to parse this carefully.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a nation with their gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. So, for Luxembourg (row 3), let's check the numbers. They have 26 gold, 17 silver, 19 bronze, totaling 62. For Monaco (row 4), they have 7 gold, 18 silver, 17 bronze, totaling 42.\n\nFirst part of the claim: does Luxembourg win more total medals than Monaco? Yes, because 62 vs. 42. So that part is correct.\n\nSecond part: \"monaco win 1 more silver medal.\" Wait, does it mean Monaco has one more silver than someone else, or that they have one more than another nation? The claim isn't clear on this. But looking at the table, we can see how many silvers each country has.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if Monaco indeed has 1 more silver than another country, but the claim doesn't specify whom. Alternatively, perhaps it's comparing within their own row, which doesn't make sense because they have 18 silvers. Maybe the comparison is between Luxembourg and Monaco? But that would be 17 vs. 18, so Monaco has one more than Luxembourg.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's phrased as \"monaco win 1 more silver medal.\" So maybe it's stating that Monaco's silver count is higher by exactly one compared to someone else, but without specifying whom, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since the claim mentions both countries, it's likely comparing them.\n\nSo, if the claim says that despite Luxembourg having more total medals, Monaco has one more silver, then we need to check both aspects.\n\nNow, looking at the instructions: I need to verify each condition in the claim against the table and identify relevant cells. The answer is TRUE only if all conditions are fully supported by the data.\n\nFirst condition: Luxembourg's total medals are higher than Monaco's. Yes, 62 vs. 42.\n\nSecond condition: Monaco has one more silver medal than someone\u2014specifically, it's likely compared to Luxembourg because that's the other country mentioned. Let me check their silver counts. Luxembourg has 17 silvers, Monaco has 18. So yes, Monaco has exactly one more silver medal than Luxembourg.\n\nSo both conditions are met based on the table data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: which cells do I need to check? For each condition.\n\nFirst condition: total medals for Luxembourg and Monaco. So rows 3 (Luxembourg) and 4 (Monaco), column 'total'.\n\nSecond condition: silver medals for both countries. So again, rows 3 and 4, column 'silver'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row 3, column 'total'\n- row 4, column 'total'\n- row 3, column 'silver'\n- row 4, column 'silver'\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about Monaco winning more silver by one. So for that part, we need to check Monaco's silver and compare it to Luxembourg's. Therefore, rows 3 and 4, column 'silver'.\n\nSo in total, four cells: two totals, two silvers.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should structure the relevant_cells as a list where each object is a row and column. So for row index, starting from 0? Let me check the table:\n\nRow 1: Cyprus\nRow 2: Iceland\nRow 3: Luxembourg (index 3)\nRow 4: Monaco (index 4)\nSo the row indices are 0-based or 1-based? Wait, in the HTML table, the first row is index 0.\n\nWait, looking at the HTML:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td> \u2192 this is rank=1, so probably row index starts at 1. But wait, no: in the JSON example, the first entry has row_index 0 and column 'Revenue'. So I think the rows are 0-indexed.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's instruction says to return a list of objects with \"row_index\" as int and \"column_name\". In the example, the first relevant cell is row 0, so perhaps the HTML table's <tr> elements are considered row 0, row 1, etc., even though their content starts at rank=1.\n\nWait no, in the HTML, the first tr is for Cyprus (rank 1), which would be row index 0 in the JSON. So yes, the rows are 0-indexed.\n\nSo:\n\nLuxembourg is row 2 (since it's third tr) \u2192 wait, no: let me count.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFirst tr is Cyprus: rank=1 \u2192 row_index=0\nSecond tr: Iceland: rank=2 \u2192 row_index=1\nThird tr: Luxembourg: rank=3 \u2192 row_index=2\nFourth tr: Monaco: rank=4 \u2192 row_index=3\nSo yes, the row indices are 0-based.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor total medals of Luxembourg: row index 2, column 'total'\nFor total medals of Monaco: row index 3, column 'total'\n\nFor silver medals of Luxembourg: row 2, 'silver'\nFor silver medals of Monaco: row 3, 'silver'\n\nSo the relevant_cells list should include these four.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just include all four cells as they are needed for both conditions. So that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each condition based on the table data:\n\n1. **Luxembourg has more total medals than Monaco.**\n   - Luxembourg: 62\n   - Monaco: 42\n   - True.\n\n2. **Monaco has exactly one more silver medal than Luxembourg.**\n   - Luxembourg: 17\n   - Monaco: 18\n   - True.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Total medals of Luxembourg (row 2, column 'total')\n- Total medals of Monaco (row 3, column 'total')\n- Silver medals of Luxembourg (row 2, column 'silver')\n- Silver medals of Monaco (row 3, column 'silver')\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"malta win 1 more of each type of medal , gold , and bronze than liechtenstein\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has a header row with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. Each subsequent row represents a different nation along with their medal counts.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Malta and Liechtenstein. So, I should find the rows for these two nations in the table.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Malta's row is at index 6 (since indexing starts from 0, the first row is 0). The medals are: gold=3, silver=5, bronze=13.\n- Liechtenstein's row is at index 7. Their medals are: gold=2, silver=4, bronze=12.\n\nNow, the claim states that Malta has 1 more of each medal type than Liechtenstein. Let me check each category:\n\n1. **Gold Medals**: Malta has 3, Liechtenstein has 2. The difference is 1 (3-2=1). So this condition holds.\n2. **Silver Medals**: Malta has 5, Liechtenstein has 4. Again, the difference is 1 (5-4=1). This also holds.\n3. **Bronze Medals**: Malta has 13, Liechtenstein has 12. The difference here is 1 as well (13-12=1).\n\nSince all three types of medals have exactly one more in Malta than Liechtenstein, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect this conclusion. For example, does the total medals matter? The total for Malta is 21 and for Liechtenstein it's 18. But the claim only specifies \"1 more of each type,\" not the total. So the totals don't directly impact the claim.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the rows are correctly identified. Malta is indeed row 6, Liechtenstein is row 7. No mistakes there.\n\nSo putting it all together, since all medal counts for Malta exceed those of Liechtenstein by exactly one in each category, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"andorra win the most gold medals in 2009 with 26.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Andorra win the most gold medals\" implies that Andorra has the highest number of gold medals among all the nations listed. The second part, \"with 26,\" refers to the specific number of gold medals\u2014so it's stating that Andorra won 26 gold medals.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should check if Andorra is indeed one of the nations listed and what their gold medal count was. Scanning through the 'nation' column, I see Andorra as the 8th row. In that row, under the 'gold' column, it says 1. That's only one gold medal, not 26.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. The claim mentions \"win the most gold medals,\" so I need to verify if Andorra has more golds than others. Let me check all the rows:\n\n- Cyprus: 59 golds\n- Iceland: 32 golds\n- Luxembourg: 26 golds\n- Monaco: 7 golds\n- San Marino: 4 golds\n- Malta: 3 golds\n- Liechtenstein: 2 golds\n- Andorra: 1 gold\n\nSo, the highest number of gold medals is Cyprus with 59. Then Luxembourg has 26. But Andorra only has 1. Therefore, the claim that Andorra won the most gold medals (with 26) is incorrect.\n\nI think the user might have confused Andorra's position in the table or perhaps made a mistake in the numbers. Since the table clearly shows Andorra with only 1 gold medal, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: the claim refers to Andorra's gold medals, so I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'nation' column for Andorra is row index 7 (since counting starts at 0), and the 'gold' column in that row is where the number is found. So the relevant cells are row_index 7 for both columns 'nation' and 'gold'.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each row has several columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. The claim is about the 'gold' count, so I need to include the specific cell where Andorra's gold is listed. That would be row 7 (since it's the 8th entry), column 'gold'. But also, the row index for Andorra in the table: looking at the first row as index 0, then each subsequent row increments by one. So Andorra is at row index 7.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include both the nation and gold columns for row 7. Because to verify the claim, you need to check what country Andorra is (to confirm it's indeed Andorra) and how many gold medals they have (to see if it's 26). Since both checks fail, the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Andorra won the most gold medals with 26. However, checking the table:\n\n- Andorra has only 1 gold medal.\n- The highest number of gold medals is Cyprus at 59.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Nations and Gold Medals**: Check each row's 'gold' column to see which nation has the most medals. Cyprus leads with 59, followed by Iceland (32), Luxembourg (26), etc.\n2. **Check Andorra's Data**: Locate Andorra in the table (row index 7). Their gold count is 1.\n3. **Compare Claims to Data**: Since Andorra does not have 26 golds nor the highest, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row 7, 'nation' column (to confirm it's Andorra).\n- Row 7, 'gold' column (to check their medal count).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Iceland won the fewest gold medals.\n2. In 2009, they have 3 gold medals.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists countries and their performance in terms of gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. Each row represents a country's rank based on the number of total medals. \n\nI should focus on finding Iceland's data in the table.

It shows 32 gold, 24 silver, 25 bronze, totaling 81 medals. \n- Then there's Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Malta, Liechtenstein, and Andorra.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"in 2009\" and mentions \"3 gold medals.\" So I'm looking for Iceland's gold count in that year. From the table, Iceland has 32 gold medals, not 3. That already seems off because 32 is much higher than 3.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The table shows each country's performance, and Iceland is ranked second with a total of 81 medals. Their gold count is indeed 32. There's no row for 2009 specifically listed in the table, but maybe the data represents the 2009 Olympics? Or perhaps it's a general statement about that year.\n\nAssuming the table reflects 2009, Iceland's gold medal count is 32, which contradicts the claim of only having 3.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about Cyprus earning exactly 4 gold medals in 2009. The table provided seems to be a ranking of nations based on their medal counts, including gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. Each row represents a different nation, with the first column being their rank.\n\nSince the claim is specific to the year 2009 and mentions only gold medals, I need to find the relevant information in the table that corresponds to Cyprus and the year 2009.

All the entries are just rankings without a time component.\n\nWait, so if the table doesn't mention the year, how can we determine whether Cyprus only earned 4 gold medals in 2009? The table only provides data on the number of medals, not their distribution by year or specific event years like 2009. Therefore, I don't have information about Cyprus's performance in 2009 specifically.\n\nAdditionally, in the table, under the \"gold\" column for Cyprus, it shows '59' in row 1, which is rank 1. That means Cyprus has a high number of gold medals, not just 4. So the claim seems incorrect because the table doesn't support it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no data in the provided table that confirms the claim about Cyprus earning only 4 gold medals in 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"luxembourg win the most silver medal\" is true based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Luxembourg has won the most silver medals. So, my goal is to verify if this statement holds true by analyzing the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's clear that each row represents a nation, and the columns correspond to the number of gold, silver, bronze medals, and the total. The 'silver' column specifically shows the count of silver medals each country has won.\n\nNext, I'll locate Luxembourg in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that it's in rank 3. So, the relevant row is the third one, which corresponds to row_index = 2 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nNow, I need to find the value in the 'silver' column for Luxembourg. From the table, under the 'silver' column and Luxembourg's row, the number is 17.\n\nTo confirm whether this is indeed the highest, I'll check all other nations' silver medal counts:\n- Cyprus: 47\n- Iceland: 24\n- Luxembourg: 17\n- Monaco: 18\n- San Marino: 9\n- Malta: 5\n- Liechtenstein: 4\n- Andorra: 7\n\nComparing these numbers, the highest silver count is 47 from Cyprus. Therefore, Luxembourg does not have the most silver medals; Cyprus has more.\n\nSince the claim says \"luxembourg win the most silver medal,\" which isn't supported by the data, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" \n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells to check, it's essential to identify which cells were used for this analysis. Specifically, I looked at the 'silver' column and the row where Luxembourg is listed. Therefore, the relevant_cells would include the 'silver' column (column_name) and the specific row_index of 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Cyprus has more silver medals than Luxembourg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"liechtenstein win more total medal than malta\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two nations: Liechtenstein and Malta. Specifically, it's stating that Liechtenstein has won more total medals than Malta. \n\nLooking at the table, I should locate the rows corresponding to Liechtenstein and Malta. Let me scan through the 'nation' column:\n\n1. Cyprus\n2. Iceland\n3. Luxembourg\n4. Monaco\n5. San Marino\n6. Malta\n7. Liechtenstein\n8. Andorra\n\nOkay, so Malta is at row index 6, and Liechtenstein is at row index 7.\n\nNext, I need to look at the 'total' column because that's what the claim is referring to\u2014total medals won. \n\nFor Malta (row 6), the total is 21. For Liechtenstein (row 7), the total is 18.\n\nSo, Liechtenstein has 18 total medals and Malta has 21. That means Malta has more total medals than Liechtenstein. Therefore, the claim that \"liechtenstein win more total medal than malta\" is FALSE.\n\nNow, to back this up with relevant cells from the table. I need to find the specific cells in the HTML table that correspond to each nation's total medals. For Liechtenstein, it's the 'total' cell in row 7, and for Malta, it's the 'total' cell in row 6.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 7, column 'total' for Liechtenstein.\n- Row index 6, column 'total' for Malta.\n\nPutting this all together, the claim is FALSE because Malta has more total medals than Liechtenstein. The relevant cells to check are the 'total' column for both nations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"liechtenstein win more total medal than malta\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare their respective total medal counts from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Rows**: Locate rows for Liechtenstein and Malta in the 'nation' column:\n   - Liechtenstein: Row 7\n   - Malta: Row 6\n\n2. **Check Total Medals**:\n   - Liechtenstein: 18 total medals\n   - Malta: 21 total medals\n\nSince Malta has more total medals than Liechtenstein, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify are the 'total' column for both nations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
