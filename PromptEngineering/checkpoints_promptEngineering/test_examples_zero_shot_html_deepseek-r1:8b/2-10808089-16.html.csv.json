    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about an HTML table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to verifying that claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"On August 13th, 1966, the away team be north melbourne, while the home team be collingwood.\" So, essentially, it's asserting two things: one about the away team and another about the home team for that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists various football matches with details like the home team, their score, the away team, their score, the venue, the crowd size, and the date. The date in all the rows is \"13 august 1966,\" which matches the claim's date. That\u2019s a good sign.\n\nNext, I need to check whether the away team was indeed north melbourne and the home team was collingwood on that day. So, I'll go through each row of the table and look at the 'away team' and 'home team' columns.\n\nStarting with the first row: Home team is st kilda, away team is south melbourne. Not matching.\n\nSecond row: Home team essendon vs away team fitzroy. Nope.\n\nThird row: Home team collingwood vs away team north melbourne. Wait, that's exactly what the claim says! So, on this row, the home team is collingwood and the away team is north melbourne.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might also have these teams on August 13th, but since all rows have the same date, it's possible multiple games were played. But the claim specifically refers to a single game where these teams met. However, in the table, each row seems to represent a separate match.\n\nSince only one row matches both the home and away team as per the claim, that specific row is relevant. Therefore, I need to identify which cells in that row are relevant: 'home team' and 'away team'.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be the ones for the third row (index 2), specifically the 'home team' and 'away team' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one specific row in the table where the home team is collingwood and the away team is north melbourne on August 13th, 1966.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
