    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about an awards table is true or false. The claim is: \"Kristofer Martin was nominated for a 3 Act Award in 2012 and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by carefully examining the given HTML table to see if Kristofer Martin's information aligns with the claim. The table lists various awards from 2012 and 2013, along with details like the award-giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nLooking at the 'award giving body' column in 2012 rows, I find a few entries: \"the young critics circle awards,\" \"28th pmpc star awards for movies,\" \"famas awards,\" and \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards.\" None of these directly mention Kristofer Martin or a \"3 Act Award.\"\n\nNext, focusing on the 'nominated for' column in 2012. There's an entry for \"new movie actor of the year\" from the 28th pmpc star awards, but that's not about a \"3 Act Award.\" The other rows don't mention Kristofer Martin or any award that fits the claim.\n\nIn the 'result' column for 2012, there are two wins: one for \"german moreno youth achievement award\" under FAMAS awards and another for \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching.\" The FAMAS win might seem relevant, but it's attributed to \"german moreno,\" not Kristofer Martin. \n\nI need to check if Kristofer Martin was actually nominated for any 3 Act Award in 2012. From the table, I don't see any row that mentions him or a \"3 Act Award.\" The closest is the \"new movie actor of the year\" from the pmpc awards, but that's not the same as what the claim states.\n\nAlso, regarding the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, according to the table, it was won by Kristofer Martin under FAMAS. But wait, looking at row 4: the award is for \"german moreno youth achievement award\" and the result is \"won.\" So does that mean Kristofer Martin won it? The 'nominated for' column here says \"none,\" which might be confusing. Wait, in row 4, the 'nominated for' cell says \"none,\" but the 'result' says \"won.\" That seems conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in how the data is presented. If Kristofer Martin won the German Moreno award, then he should have been nominated for it, not none. Maybe the table has an error here, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. But according to the claim, he was both nominated and won, which doesn't align with the table's current data.\n\nGiven that there's no row in 2012 where Kristofer Martin is nominated for a \"3 Act Award,\" the first part of the claim isn't supported. Additionally, while he might have won another award, it's not the one mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kristofer Martin was nominated for a 3 Act Award in 2012 and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. Checking the table:\n\n- **No row** in 2012 lists a \"3 Act Award\" nomination or win for Kristofer Martin.\n- The German Moreno Youth Achievement Award is mentioned, but it's under FAMAS awards and the recipient isn't specified as Kristofer Martin.\n\nThus, the claim lacks support from the table, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Kristofer Martin is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"in 2013 , kristofer martin receive only an honorable mention for best support actor in oros , at the 16th long island international film expo , but win best actor in a supporting role for oros at the 10th golden screen award.\"\n\nSo, the claim has two main points:\n1. Kristofer Martin received an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in \"oros\" at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo in 2013.\n2. He won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role for \"oros\" at the 10th Golden Screen Awards in 2013.\n\nI need to check if both these points are supported by the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's an HTML table with headers: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. Each row represents a different award or nomination.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (2013)**:\n   - Award Giving Body: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards\n   - Category: Stand Out Season Performer\n   - Nominated For: None\n   - Result: Nominated\n\n   This doesn't relate to Kristofer Martin, so it's not relevant.\n\n2. **Row 1 (2013)**:\n   - Award Giving Body: 16th Long Island International Film Expo\n   - Category: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor\n   - Nominated For: oros\n   - Result: Won\n\n   This matches the first part of the claim. Kristofer Martin received an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in \"oros\" at this expo.\n\n3. **Row 2 (2013)**:\n   - Award Giving Body: 10th Golden Screen Awards\n   - Category: Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n   - Nominated For: oros\n   - Result: Won\n\n   This matches the second part of the claim. He won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for \"oros\" at this awards ceremony.\n\n4. **Rows 3-5 (2012)**:\n   These are from 2012, so they don't pertain to 2013 and can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if the table supports both points in the claim.\n\nPoint 1: Honorable Mention at Long Island Expo - Yes, supported by Row 1.\nPoint 2: Best Actor win at Golden Screen - Yes, supported by Row 2.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells for the JSON response. The relevant cells are where the information is confirmed in the table. For Kristofer Martin's awards, it's Rows 1 and 2, specifically their respective columns.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include Row 1 (index 1) for the honorable mention and Row 2 (index 2) for the win.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that Kristofer Martin has been nominated for 7 ACT awards between 2012 and 2013 and won 4 of those.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided to see if there's any mention of Kristofer Martin. But wait, scanning through each row, I don't see his name anywhere in the \"award giving body\" or \"nominated for\" columns. The award-giving bodies listed are things like 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, Long Island International Film Expo, Golden Screen Awards, etc., none of which mention Kristofer Martin.\n\nHmm, so if he's not even listed as a nominee in any of these awards from 2012 to 2013, then the claim must be false. But I should check more carefully. Maybe his name is hidden or there's another column that might reference him? Let me look again.\n\nThe columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. No column mentions a person's name, so it seems like Kristofer Martin isn't listed here at all. That means he wasn't nominated for any of these awards in the years mentioned. \n\nTherefore, since there's no data supporting the claim, the answer should be \"FALSE\".

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in 'Oros'.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. Each row represents a specific award.\n\nI need to check each row where Kristofer Martin was involved. The claim is about nominations for \"Oros,\" so I should focus on rows where the \"nominated for\" column mentions 'Oros'.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. 2013: Award is 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category is \"Stand Out Season Performer,\" nominated for none. Doesn't relate.\n2. 2013: 16th Long Island International Film Expo, honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor, oros as result. Wait, no, in this row, the \"nominated for\" is 'oros'? No, actually, the fourth column is \"nominated for,\" and here it's blank? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me check again. The second row: year 2013, award body is 16th Long Island International Film Expo, category is honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor, nominated for 'oros'\u2014wait, no. Actually, in the table, the fourth column is \"nominated for.\" In this row, it's \"oros\"? Let me check the original data.\n\nOriginal table: \n\nSecond row:\n- year 2013\n- award giving body: 16th long island international film expo\n- category: honorable mention for best supporting actor\n- nominated for: oros\n- result: won\n\nSo here, he was nominated for 'oros' and won. So that's one nomination related to Oros.\n\nThird row:\n- year 2013\n- award body: 10th Golden Screen Awards\n- category: Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n- nominated for: oros\n- result: won\n\nAnother nomination for Oros, so that's two.\n\nFourth row:\n- 2012\n- Young Critics Circle Awards\n- Best Performance\n- oros\n- nominated\n\nThat's the third. So Kristofer Martin has three award nominations in 'Oros' across different years and categories.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nomination be for his performance in Oros.\" The wording is a bit off\u2014should probably be \"nominations\" plural. But assuming it means three separate nominations where he was nominated for Oros.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nSecond row: 2013, Expo, honorable mention, oros, won \u2192 counts as a nomination.\nThird row: 2013, Golden Screen, Best Supporting Actor, oros, won \u2192 another.\nFourth row: 2012, Young Critics, Best Performance, oros, nominated \u2192 third.\n\nSo yes, three nominations in Oros. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. Each of these rows has a \"nominated for\" cell where 'oros' is mentioned. So for each row, row indices are 1,2,3 (assuming starting from 0 or 1? Wait, looking at the example, in their sample JSON, they had row_index as integers, and the first row was index 0.\n\nIn the table provided:\n\nFirst row (row 0): doesn't have oros.\nSecond row (row 1): has 'oros' in nominated for \u2192 relevant.\nThird row (row 2): same \u2192 relevant.\nFourth row (row3): same \u2192 relevant.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the fourth row is index 3, fifth is 4, etc. So rows where \"nominated for\" is 'oros':\n\nRow 1: 16th Long Island... Expo\nRow 2: 10th Golden Screen Awards\nRow 3: Young Critics Circle (row index 3)\nWait, no. Let me count the rows:\n\nThe table has 7 rows in tbody.\n\nRow 0: 2013, first award \u2192 not relevant.\nRow1: 2013, Expo \u2192 oros \u2192 relevant.\nRow2: 2013, Golden Screen \u2192 oros \u2192 relevant.\nRow3: 2012, Young Critics \u2192 oros \u2192 relevant.\nRow4: 2012, PMPA \u2192 not oros.\nRow5: 2012, Famas \u2192 not.\nRow6: 2012, Pilipinas Most Liked \u2192 not.\n\nSo rows 1,2,3 have 'oros' in \"nominated for\".\n\nThus, the relevant cells are columns: each has column_name 'nominated for', and row_index 1,2,3.\n\nBut wait, in the sample JSON example, they used row_index as integers starting from 0. So row 0 is first row, etc. Therefore:\n\nRow index 1: second row.\nRow index 2: third row.\nRow index 3: fourth row.\n\nSo each of these rows has a cell where 'oros' is the value in \"nominated for\" column.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n[\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\" }\n]\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by three rows in the table where Kristofer Martin was nominated for 'Oros' awards.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down what's being asked.\n\nThe claim says: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 be not base[d] on nomination for a specific show.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky. I think it means that two of his award wins weren't based solely on nominations for specific shows.\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries from 2012 and 2013 where Kristofer Martin (I assume \"Kristofer Martin\" refers to the person's name) won awards. Let me check each relevant row.\n\nFirst, in 2013:\n- Row with award: \"10th golden screen awards\", category: \"best actor in a supporting role\". The nominated for column says \"oros\". Wait, \"oros\" might be a typo or code; perhaps it's an organization or specific show. But the result is \"won\".\n- Another 2013 row: \"1st sunday all stars awards\", category: \"stand out season performer\", nominated for \"none\", and result: \"nominated\". So this one was only nominated but didn't win.\n\nIn 2012:\n- \"famas awards\": won, category: \"german moreno youth achievement award\". Nominated for: \"n / a\".\n- \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards\": won, category: \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\". Nominated for: \"n / a\".\n\nWait, the claim mentions two wins that aren't based on nominations for specific shows. So let's see which wins don't have a nomination in their row.\n\nLooking at each award win:\n1. 2013 Golden Screen Awards: category is supporting actor. Nominated for: oros. If \"oros\" refers to a show, then this would be based on nomination. But if \"oros\" isn't a specific show, maybe it's not. However, the table doesn't specify what \"oros\" stands for.\n2. 2013 Sunday All Stars Awards: He was nominated but didn't win.\n3. 2012 Famas Awards: Won, nominated for: n/a. So this is a win without any nomination listed.\n4. 2012 Pilipinas Most Liked Awards: Another win with n/a as the nominated for.\n\nSo Kristofer Martin has two wins in 2012 (Famas and Pilipinas) where the result is \"won\" but the \"nominated for\" column is empty. That suggests that these wins weren't based on a nomination for a specific show, since there's no entry there.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because there are two award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 where he didn't base his win on a specific show's nomination.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Kristofer Martin won two awards (2012 Famas and 2012 Pilipinas Most Liked) without any specified nominations for shows, indicated by 'n/a' in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns in the table are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nI start by scanning each row's \"award giving body\" column because that might mention Kristofer Martin or relate to his awards. \n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- 2013: 1st sunday all stars awards\n- 2013: 16th long island international film expo\n- 2013: 10th golden screen awards\n- 2012: the young critics circle awards\n- 2012: 28th pmpc star awards for movies\n- 2012: famas awards\n- 2012: 1st party pilipinas most liked awards\n\nNone of these award giving bodies directly mention Kristofer Martin.

The \"result\" column shows whether he won, but without a match in the \"nominated for\" column, it's unclear if he was even nominated.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed an entry where Kristofer Martin is mentioned. Let me check again. Maybe his name appears in another column or row. However, scanning each row, there's no mention of Kristofer Martin in any cell except the \"nominated for\" column once, but that's for \"oros,\" not him.\n\nGiven that, it seems the claim might be false because there's no evidence in the table that Kristofer Martin was nominated or won any awards in 2013.

The columns relevant here are \"year\", \"award giving body\", \"category\", \"nominated for\", and \"result\". I'm specifically interested in the years 2012 and 2013 because the claim mentions both years.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Kristofer Martin is mentioned in any of these awards. \n\nIn 2012, I see several awards:\n1. The Young Critics Circle Awards: Best Performance (nominated)\n2. 28th PMPA Star Awards for Movies: New Movie Actor of the Year (nominated)\n3. FAMAS Awards: German Moreno Youth Achievement Award (won)\n4. Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards: Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching (won)\n\nNone of these entries mention Kristofer Martin by name, so he's not listed in 2012 awards.\n\nIn 2013:\n1. 1st Sunday All Stars Awards: Stand Out Season Performer (nominated)\n2. 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (won)\n\nAgain, no mention of Kristofer Martin here.

Scanning through the table, rows 0, 1, 2 are for 2013.\n\nNext, the claim mentions Kristofer Martin. However, looking at the table, there's no entry with \"Kristofer Martin\" as the nominated person. The closest names I see are \"none,\" \"oros,\" and other award categories, but none specifically mention Kristofer Martin. This might be a red flag because if he didn't receive any awards listed here, then the claim could be false.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific events:\n\n1. **Honorable Mention for Best Support Actor in Oros at 16th Long Island International Film Expo:**\n   - Looking at row 1 (since it's 2013), the category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" and the award-giving body is \"16th long island international film expo.\" The nominated field is \"oros.\" This part of the claim seems to match this row. So, cell (row_index:1, column_name:\"result\") is relevant because it shows \"won,\" but wait, no\u2014wait, in the table, for row 1, the result is \"won\" because it's a honorable mention, right? Wait, no\u2014the term \"honorable mention\" might not be equivalent to \"won.\" Hmm, that needs clarification. Typically, \"honorable mention\" is a nomination without winning. So if Kristofer received this, he didn't win; he was just mentioned. But the claim says he \"receive 2 honorable mentions,\" implying perhaps multiple nominations without wins.\n\nBut wait, in row 1, it's about him getting a \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" at that expo. The result column is \"won,\" but maybe that's incorrect because it's actually just a nomination. So there might be an inconsistency here. But I'm not sure if that affects the claim's truthfulness yet.\n\n2. **Winning Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at FAMAS Awards:**\n   - Looking again at 2013 rows, row 2 is about Kristofer Martin winning \"best actor in a supporting role\" at the \"10th golden screen awards.\" However, the claim mentions the FAMAS awards. In row 5 (year 2012), there's an entry for FAMAS awards where he won \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" but not specifically best actor in a supporting role.\n\nSo here's the problem: The claim says Kristofer won at the FAMAS award for best actor, but looking through the table, he actually won that category in 2013 at the Golden Screen Awards, not the FAMAS. So there's a discrepancy between what's stated in the claim and the table.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"in oros,\" which I assume refers to his role as Oros. The table shows that Kristofer was nominated for \"oros\" in multiple categories but won some and didn't win others. Specifically, row 1 (16th Long Island Expo) is a nomination, while row 2 (Golden Screen Awards) is a win.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- The first part of the claim is partially correct; Kristofer was indeed nominated for \"best supporting actor\" at the Long Island Expo.\n- However, the second part is incorrect because he won in the same category but at the Golden Screen Awards, not FAMAS.\n\nSince one part of the claim doesn't match the table, the overall claim is false. The relevant cells are the ones where Kristofer was nominated and won, but they don't align with what the claim states regarding the specific awards.\n</think>\n\nThe claim contains two parts: receiving a honorable mention at the Long Island Expo and winning best actor at FAMAS. Checking the table:\n\n1. **Honorable Mention:** Found in row 1 (2013) for \"16th long island international film expo.\" However, it's only a nomination, not a win.\n2. **Best Actor Win:** Not found in any FAMAS entry; he won at Golden Screen Awards.\n\nSince the claim inaccurately states the award category and body, it is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"All of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in 'Oros'\". \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table where Kristofer Martin was nominated or won an award. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with 2013:\n1. In 2013, there are two relevant rows. The first is \"1st sunday all stars awards\" where he was nominated for \"stand out season performer\", but it says 'none' under nominated for. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. So, the 'nominated for' column here is 'none', which probably means he wasn't actually nominated, just maybe recognized? Or perhaps it's an error. But the result is 'nominated', so he was nominated, but not for any specific performance in Oros since it's none.\n\n2. The next 2013 row is about \"16th long island international film expo\" where he got a honorable mention for best supporting actor, and it's under 'oros'. So this seems relevant because the category is related to his performance in Oros. Similarly, the third 2013 row is \"10th golden screen awards\" which also lists 'oros' as the nominated for, so that's another relevant cell.\n\nMoving on to 2012:\n1. The first 2012 row is \"the young critics circle awards\" where he was nominated for \"best performance\", and again under 'oros'. So this is definitely relevant.\n\n2. Next is \"28th pmpc star awards for movies\" where he's up for \"new movie actor of the year\", but it's under \"tween academy : class of 2012\". So that's not related to Oros, so maybe not relevant unless there's a connection I'm missing.\n\n3. Then there's \"famas awards\" which gave him a \"german moreno youth achievement award\", and 'n/a' for nominated for, but he won it. This seems unrelated because 'oros' isn't mentioned here.\n\n4. Finally, \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards\" awarded him for being the \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\". Again, not related to Oros.\n\nSo, from this analysis, Kristofer Martin had multiple award nominations and wins. The claim says all of his nominations were for Oros. Let's check each row where he was nominated:\n\n- 2013: Two rows where he was either nominated or won. Both have 'oros' in the 'nominated for' column except the first one, which has 'none'. So that might be an exception.\n- 2012: He was nominated for \"best performance\" and \"new movie actor of the year\", both under 'oros' except the second one is under a different category. \n\nWait, in the third 2013 row, he won for best actor in a supporting role under 'oros'. The first 2013 row's 'nominated for' is 'none', so that might mean it wasn't specifically for Oros. Similarly, the 2012 rows: the \"new movie actor of the year\" is under 'tween academy', not directly linked to Oros.\n\nSo, not all nominations are related to Oros. Therefore, the claim isn't fully accurate because some were for other categories or bodies.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about Kristofer Martin's award nominations being solely for his performance in \"Oros\" is true, we must check each relevant row and column.\n\n1. **2013:**\n   - **16th long island international film expo:** Nominated for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" under 'oros' \u2013 **Relevant.**\n   - **10th golden screen awards:** Won for \"best actor in a supporting role\" under 'oros' \u2013 **Relevant.**\n\n2. **2012:**\n   - **the young critics circle awards:** Nominated for \"best performance\" under 'oros' \u2013 **Relevant.**\n   - **28th pmpc star awards for movies:** Nominated for \"new movie actor of the year\" under a different category \u2013 **Not relevant to Oros.**\n\nThe claim isn't entirely true since Kristofer Martin's award in 2013 was for \"stand out season performer\" with 'none' as the nominated for, and another in 2012 wasn't specifically for \"Oros\". \n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"All of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were based on nomination for a specific show.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to see which ones involve Kristofer Martin winning awards between 2012 and 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that most of the rows are about award-giving bodies, categories, who was nominated, and the result. But I don't see any mention of Kristofer Martin anywhere in the 'nominated for' or 'result' columns. That's a bit confusing because the claim is specifically about him.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table lists winners and nominees from various award bodies. If Kristofer Martin won some awards, then those wins should be based on his having been nominated for specific shows. So I need to check if each of his wins was preceded by a nomination in the same or previous year.\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- 2013: The first two rows are about different award bodies. In 2013, there's a 'stand out season performer' nominated but didn't win. Then, in another body, he got a honorable mention and won for best supporting actor. So that's one win.\n\nIn 2012, the table shows several awards where Kristofer Martin either won or was nominated. For example, in 2012, he won a youth achievement award, which I assume is based on his nomination as 'new movie actor of the year' by the Tween Academy. Also, another award where he was honored for best performance, and another where he won despite it being 'n/a'.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"all\" of his wins between 2012-2013 were based on nominations. So I need to check each of his wins.\n\nLet's list all the times he won:\n\n1. 2013: honorable mention for best supporting actor at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo. Wait, but that row shows him as 'won' in 'result', but looking at 'nominated for', it says 'oros'. Maybe 'oros' is a typo or refers to something else. But assuming it's correct, he won, and was nominated for 'honorable mention...'\n\n2. 2013: another win for 'best actor in a supporting role' at the 10th Golden Screen Awards. The 'nominated for' column says 'oros', same as above.\n\nIn 2012:\n\n3. Won German Moreno Youth Achievement Award (Famas Awards). Nominated for 'german moreno youth achievement award'.\n\n4. Won 'most liked loveteam with joyce ching' at the Party Pilipinas awards, but the 'nominated for' is 'n/a'. So that's another win without a specific nomination listed.\n\nSo for each of his wins, I need to check if he was nominated in the same or any previous year for those categories.\n\nIn 2013:\n\n- For the Long Island Film Expo and Golden Screen Awards: The 'nominated for' column says 'oros'. If that's accurate, then maybe he was only considered by this organization. But it's unclear what 'oros' refers to. Perhaps 'oros' is a placeholder or an acronym I'm not familiar with. It might mean \"Organization\" in Spanish? Not sure.\n\nIn 2012:\n\n- For the Famas Awards: He was nominated for the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, which he won. So that's a direct correlation between nomination and win.\n\n- For Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards: He won 'most liked loveteam', but the 'nominated for' is 'n/a'. That means perhaps he wasn't specifically nominated for this award, or it was not applicable.\n\nWait, the claim says \"all of the award wins... were based on nomination.\" So if in 2012 and 2013, all his wins were because he was previously nominated, then the claim holds. But for Party Pilipinas, he won without a specific 'nominated for' listed, which might mean he wasn't directly nominated for that award. Or maybe 'n/a' means the category didn't require nomination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is to check if each of his wins was based on being nominated in that same or previous year for a specific show.\n\nSo looking at each win:\n\n1. 2013: honorable mention and best supporting actor. If 'oros' refers to the organization that nominated him, then yes, he was likely nominated by them.\n\n2. 2012: He was nominated for 'german moreno youth achievement award' and won it. So that's based on nomination.\n\n3. 2012: Won 'most liked loveteam' but 'n/a' in 'nominated for'. Maybe it's a different category where the win doesn't require nomination, or perhaps he was implicitly nominated as part of a team. Not sure if this fits the claim exactly.\n\nThe claim says \"based on nomination for a specific show.\" If 'specific show' refers to each award's context, then maybe all his wins were based on being nominated for that particular award.\n\nBut since in one case (Party Pilipinas), there's no 'nominated for' listed, it might mean he wasn't specifically nominated for that award but still won. Thus, the claim wouldn't hold because not all wins were based on nominations for specific shows.\n\nAlternatively, if 'n/a' implies that the nomination was made, perhaps it's just missing information. So I'm a bit confused here.\n\nGiven that, I think the relevant cells to check are the ones where he won and had a corresponding 'nominated for' column. Those would be the rows where he won because of being nominated. The other win (Party Pilipinas) might not have a clear nomination link.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- 2012 Famas: He was nominated, so that's relevant.\n- 2013 Long Island and Golden Screen: 'oros' in 'nominated for', possibly indicating he was nominated by them.\n- 2012 Youth Achievement and Best Performance: These likely had nominations.\n\nBut the Party Pilipinas row doesn't have a 'nominated for' entry, so it's unclear if he was specifically nominated there. Therefore, to verify \"all\" wins were based on nominations, that particular win needs to be checked.\n\nSo the conclusion is that not all his wins had clear nomination links, especially the Party Pilipinas one. Hence, the claim isn't entirely accurate, making the answer 'no'.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if every award win by Kristian Flores between 2012 and 2013 (referred to as \"he\") was based on a prior nomination for that specific show or category. After analyzing each of his wins:\n\n1. **2013 Long Island International Film Expo**: He won, and the 'nominated for' field says \"oros.\" If \"oros\" refers to the organization that nominated him, this win is linked to a nomination.\n2. **2013 Golden Screen Awards**: Similarly, he won with \"oros\" as the 'nominated for,' suggesting a prior nomination.\n3. **2012 Famas Awards - German Moreno Youth Achievement Award**: He was explicitly nominated and then won, so this aligns with the claim.\n4. **2012 Party Pilipinas Most Liked Loveteam**: His win here doesn't have a clear 'nominated for' entry (\"n/a\"), making it unclear if he was specifically nominated.\n\n**Conclusion**: While most of his wins were based on prior nominations, the lack of information in the 'nominated for' column for the Party Pilipinas award raises doubts about whether that particular win was nomination-based. Therefore, not all his wins meet the condition stated in the claim.\n\n**Answer**: No, not all of Kristian Flores's awards between 2012 and 2013 were based on prior nominations for specific shows.",
