    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then determine which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"asc diaraf lose to stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two teams: asc diaraf and stade malien. The action is a loss by asc diaraf against stade malien. The setting is the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should check if there's any row where both asc diaraf and stade malien are involved as team1 and team2 or vice versa, and see how they performed in their matches.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: abaluhya united vs great olympics. No match here.\n3. Third row: asc diaraf vs stade malien. This seems promising because both teams are mentioned in the claim. Let's check their performance.\n\nIn the third row, under 'agg', it says 3 - 4. That suggests that over two legs (1st and 2nd), the aggregate score is 3-4. So asc diaraf scored 3 goals, while stade malien scored 4. \n\nLooking at the individual legs: the first leg is 3 - 0 in favor of asc diaraf, and the second leg is 0 - 4 in favor of stade malien. Wait a minute, that would mean that in total, stade malien won both legs (since their score is higher) but the aggregate might reflect the total goals. However, if the claim says that asc diaraf lost to stade malien, we need to see who actually won.\n\nIn the first leg, asc diaraf won 3-0, so they scored more. In the second leg, stade malien won 0-4, scoring more. So in the two legs combined, each team won one leg. Therefore, there was no overall winner; it's a draw on legs, but aggregate might show differently.\n\nWait, the 'agg' column shows 3 - 4, so asc diaraf scored 3, stade malien scored 4. So in total, stade malien has more aggregate points, meaning they won the match overall? Or is it that each leg is a separate game, and both teams have one win each.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The 'agg' column might be the total goals from both legs. So if asc diaraf scored 3 in total and stade malien scored 4, then stade malien has a higher aggregate score, which could mean they won the series or it's just the combined goals.\n\nBut looking at the individual legs: first leg, asc diaraf 2-1 tele sc asmara. Wait no, wait, in row three, team1 is asc diaraf and team2 is stade malien. So for their match, 1st leg was 3-0 and second leg was 0-4.\n\nWait, that can't be because the 'agg' would then be 3 + 0 = 3 for asc diaraf and 0 + 4 = 4 for stade malien. So stade malien has a higher aggregate score, implying they won more in total, but asc diaraf won the first leg.\n\nSo the overall result is that both teams won one game each, and stade malien has a higher aggregate score, which might mean they are considered the winners for the series. Therefore, asc diaraf lost to stade malien.\n\nBut wait, in the first leg, asc diaraf scored 3-0, so they clearly won that. In the second leg, stade malien scored 4-0, so they won that. So it's a two-legged match where each team won once. The 'agg' is just the total goals, but in reality, since it's a knockout or a series, perhaps the higher aggregate means they are the winners.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because typically, in a two-legged match, if both teams win one game each, it might be considered a draw overall, but sometimes the team with the higher aggregate is declared the winner. However, in some contexts, it's just the sum of goals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'agg' refers to aggregate goals, and since stade malien has more, they won, so asc diaraf lost.\n\nBut let me check if this match took place in 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. The table might not include all matches from that year, but looking at the rows:\n\nThe third row is asc diaraf vs stade malien with a result of 3-4 aggregate, which seems to suggest that in 1971, they played and stade malien had more goals.\n\nSo based on this, asc diaraf lost to stade malien in their match in the African Cup, supporting the claim as true.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if it's from 1971. The table doesn't specify the year of each match, so maybe that's a problem. The claim mentions \"1971\", but without knowing when the data in the table is from, this could be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'agg' is the overall result for the competition, and if asc diaraf lost their match to stade malien in 1971, then the claim would hold. But without the exact date, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nBut given that the table has a row with both teams, and assuming that the '1971' is correct, then yes, asc diaraf lost to stade malien in that year.\n\nSo I think the answer is yes, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nYes, based on the information provided in the table, asc diaraf lost to stade malien in a match during the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. The aggregate score of 3-4 indicates that stade malien scored more goals over the two legs, resulting in their victory.\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, according to the data, asc diaraf lost to stade malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs.",

    "claim": "the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific team, \"young africans,\" and states that they scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. I need to check if this information aligns with the data presented in the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table for any rows where the first column is \"young africans.\" Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 0: al - merrikh\nRow 1: abaluhya united\nRow 2: asc diaraf\nRow 3: maseru united\nRow 4: as porto novo\nRow 5: canon yaound\u00e9\nRow 6: esp\u00e9rance\nRow 7: secteur 6\nRow 8: young africans\n\nYes, row 8 has \"young africans\" in the team1 column. Now I'll check the other columns relevant to the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions points (agg), so looking at the 'agg' column for this row. The value is \"2 - 0.\" Hmm, that's a score of 2-0. But wait, the claim says they scored 2 points. In football, typically, a team can either win, lose, or draw a match. Each match result affects their aggregate (agg) score.\n\nWait, in the table, each row has two legs: first and second leg. So for \"young africans,\" let's look at both legs. The '1st leg' is 2 - 0 and the '2nd leg' is 0 - 0. So their total aggregate is 2-0.\n\nBut the claim says they scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup. Now, I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being referred to here. Points in football can sometimes be total goals, but it's also possible that this refers to the tournament aggregate.\n\nLooking at other teams, like canon yaound\u00e9, their agg is 9-4, which likely means they scored 9 goals and conceded 4. Similarly, young africans have 2-0, so they scored 2 goals and conceded none in their two legs combined.\n\nSo, if the claim says they scored 2 points (goals), that aligns with the first leg's score but perhaps not the aggregate. Wait, no\u2014the agg column is the total over both legs. So in this case, the agg is 2-0, meaning they have a total of 2 goals scored.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure if \"points\" here refers to goals or something else like points earned from wins or draws. In some contexts, a point might be awarded for each win (3 points) or draw (1 point). But in this table, the agg is just the scoreline, not the points accumulated based on results.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is misinterpreting the aggregate as points. For example, if they won both legs, that would be 6 points (2 wins * 3 points each), but here it's only 2 goals in total, which might not align with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"points\" is being used interchangeably with goals scored. If so, then scoring 2 goals in aggregate would mean they have 2 points. That seems plausible.\n\nBut I'm also considering the year mentioned in the claim: 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. The table provided includes matches from various teams, but I don't see any indication of the year. So there's a chance that the data doesn't include the specific year 1971. However, looking at the team names and the table structure, it seems like all the data is for a particular competition, possibly around the same time.\n\nGiven that, even though the exact year isn't specified in the table, it's safe to assume that the aggregate score is relevant regardless of the year. So if \"young africans\" scored 2 goals in total across both legs, and the claim refers to points as goals, then it would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, another angle: if the competition were a knockout tournament where each win gives a certain number of points, like 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. Let's see how \"young africans\" performed. They won the first leg 2-0 and drew the second leg 0-0. So in a two-leg match, if each leg is considered separately, perhaps they earned points accordingly.\n\nIn the first leg, winning would give them 3 points, and the second leg was a draw, so 1 point, totaling 4 points. But their agg is listed as 2-0, which refers to goals scored and conceded, not points.\n\nSo there's a confusion here between points (as in tournament points) and aggregate goals. The claim says they scored 2 points, which if referring to goals, that's correct (they scored 2 goals in total). But if referring to tournament points, their points would be more than 2.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the claim is inaccurately stating the number of goals as points. Since the agg column shows they scored 2 goals, but not necessarily 2 points, it might depend on how \"points\" are being used.\n\nIn football terminology, points are often from goals or from results (wins/draws). So if they only scored 2 goals, that's 2 points, assuming each goal is worth one point. But in reality, a win gives more than just the goals; it also awards points based on the result.\n\nWait, no, typically points are awarded as follows: 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss. So if \"young africans\" won both legs, they would have 6 points (2 wins * 3). But in their case, first leg was 2-0 (win), second leg was 0-0 (draw). So total points: 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nBut the agg column is 2 goals. So if the claim says they scored 2 points, it's ambiguous. If it's referring to goals, then yes, they scored 2 goals. But typically, points in football aren't just about goals; they're about results as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"points\" here refers to aggregate goals. So I think the confusion is between 'goals' and 'points earned.' The claim might be using \"points\" to mean goals, so if they scored 2 goals, that's 2 points.\n\nIn that case, it would be TRUE. But if \"points\" refers to tournament points based on results (wins/draws), then the claim is incorrect because they only earned 4 points, not 2.\n\nBut without explicit indication in the table about how points are calculated, it's hard to say definitively. However, since the agg column shows 2 goals scored, and if \"points\" is being used as a synonym for goals, then the claim would be correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that the claim is TRUE because they scored 2 goals in total across both legs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"young africans scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs\" can be considered true under a specific interpretation. \n\n- **Interpretation as Goals:** If \"points\" refers to goals scored, then yes, they scored 2 goals in total across both legs.\n  \n- **Interpretation as Tournament Points:** However, if \"points\" refer to tournament points earned from results (wins and draws), then this would be incorrect, as \"young africans\" earned a total of 4 points (3 for the win and 1 for the draw).\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the term \"points,\" it is plausible that the claim intends to state the number of goals scored. Therefore, under this interpretation, the statement is considered true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true if \"points\" refer to goals scored, as young africans scored a total of 2 goals across both legs.",

    "claim": "secteur 6 lose by 1 against the enugu ranger",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two teams: secteur 6 and enugu rangers. I should locate their respective rows in the table to find relevant information about their match.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row for \"secteur 6\" which is in position row_index 8. The columns provided are team1, agg, team2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. From this row, I can extract the following data:\n\n- Team 1: secteur 6\n- Agg (aggregate result): 1 - 2\n- Team 2: enugu rangers\n- 1st leg: 1 - 1\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 1\n\nThe claim states that \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger.\" Let me break this down. \n\n\"lose by 1\" suggests that the match result was a loss for secteur 6, and the score difference is exactly one goal. The aggregate result shows \"1 - 2,\" which means enugu rangers won with a score of 1-2 (or two goals). However, the term \"lose by 1\" implies a margin of victory of one goal, but here the margin is two goals (since 2-1 would mean they lost by one, but 1-2 means they lost by two).\n\nLooking at the 2nd leg score, it's 0 - 1. So in the second leg, enugu rangers won with a single goal. However, the first leg was a draw with a score of 1 - 1.\n\nThe aggregate result combines both legs: 1-2 for secteur 6 against enugu rangers. But the claim specifically mentions losing by one point, which doesn't align because the margin is two goals over the two legs combined, or just one goal in the second leg alone.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to a specific leg. If it's referring to the aggregate, then the total is 1-2, meaning enugu rangers won by one goal? No, wait, 1-2 means they lost by two goals in total. But if we consider only the second leg, it was 0-1, so a loss by one goal.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. The claim says \"lose by 1,\" which could refer to the second leg where they lost 0-1, but in aggregate, they lost 1-2.\n\nSo, depending on whether \"by 1\" refers to the second leg or the aggregate result. If it's about the second leg alone, then yes, they lost by one goal. But if it's about the aggregate, then it's a loss by two goals.\n\nThe exact wording is important here. The claim says \"lose by 1 against enugu ranger.\" Since \"enugu rangers\" is plural, but in the table, team2 for secteur6 is \"enugu rangers,\" which seems correct as per the data.\n\nSo, considering that in the second leg, secteur6 lost 0-1, which is a loss by one goal. Therefore, the claim could be referring to this specific result. However, if the aggregate is considered, then it's a loss by two goals.\n\nBut the table shows both legs and the aggregate, so I need to check if the claim is about the aggregate or a single leg. The term \"against enugu ranger\" might imply the overall performance against them, which would be the aggregate result.\n\nWait, but the team2 in the row for secteur6 is \"enugu rangers,\" plural. So maybe the claim should also be plural, but it's using \"enugu ranger.\" That might be a typo, but I'll proceed with what's given.\n\nIn any case, whether the loss was by one goal in aggregate or two goals in total, the claim says they lost by 1. If the user is referring to the second leg, then yes, it's accurate that they lost 0-1, which is a one-goal loss. However, if considering both legs, it's a two-goal loss.\n\nBut the table doesn't provide a single \"by\" margin, only the individual leg results and aggregate. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the total loss was by two goals, not one. Alternatively, if it's referring to just the second leg, then it's correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the instruction: I need to determine whether the claim is fully supported by the table. The claim states that they lost by 1 against enugu rangers. So in the second leg, they did lose 0-1, which is a one-goal loss. Therefore, the claim would be correct based on the second leg.\n\nBut does \"lose by 1\" typically refer to aggregate or specific legs? It can vary, but often it refers to the total result. However, since the table provides both legs and the aggregate, I should check if the claim is supported either way.\n\nIf the user claims a loss by one against enugu rangers, then in the aggregate, it's 1-2, which is a two-goal loss. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it states a one-goal loss when the actual total was two goals.\n\nBut maybe \"lose by 1\" refers to the second leg only. The first leg was a draw, so the second leg being 0-1 would mean they lost by one goal in that leg, but overall, it's a two-goal loss.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but I think for the purposes of this task, the claim states \"lose by 1,\" and looking at the table, the aggregate result shows a two-goal loss. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because they lost by two goals in total.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about a single leg, then yes, it's correct. But without more context, I have to assume it refers to the overall performance against enugu rangers, which would be the aggregate result of 1-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because they lost by two goals in total, not one.\n\nWait no, let me clarify: The aggregate result is 1-2. If you're the team, your score is first, so secteur6's aggregate is 1-2, meaning enugu rangers won with a score of two to one? No, wait, in football, it's goals for and against.\n\nSo if the result is 1 - 2, that means enugu rangers scored two goals and secteur6 scored one. So secteur6 lost by one goal (two minus one). Wait, no: in sports, the margin of victory is goals_for - goals_against. So if it's 1-2, then enugu rangers' goals are 2, and sector6's are 1. So the difference is 2-1, meaning they lost by one goal.\n\nWait, that's a key point. If the aggregate result is 1-2, meaning secteur6 scored once, enugu rangers scored twice. Therefore, enugu rangers won by one goal (since 2 - 1 =1). So from the perspective of secteur6, they lost by one goal.\n\nSo the claim says \"lose by 1\" which aligns with this. Because 2-1 is a one-goal margin in favor of enugu rangers, so for secteur6, it's a loss by one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because the aggregate result shows that enugu rangers won by one goal.\n\nWait, but in football terminology, if your team scores two and opponents score one, you win 2-1, which is a margin of one. So yes, if the aggregate is 1-2, that's enugu rangers winning 2-1, so they have a one-goal lead.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"lose by 1\" is accurate because secteur6 lost the match by one goal in total.\n\nSo after considering both legs and how margins are calculated, the claim is correct based on the aggregate result.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"secteur6 lose by 1 against enugu rangers\" is supported by the table data. The aggregate result of the match shows a score of 1-2 in favor of enugu rangers, indicating that they won by one goal. Therefore, secteur6 lost the match by one goal.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is accurate based on the aggregate result; enugu rangers won by one goal, so secteur6 lost by one goal.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The claim is correct.}}",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that as porto novo didn't score any points against victoria club mokanda. So, I need to find in the table where these two teams are involved and check their scores against each other.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a row for \"as porto novo\" and another for \"victoria club mokanda\". Specifically, as porto novo is in the first column (team 1) of one row, and victoria club mokanda is in the third column (team 2) of another row. Wait, actually, I need to check if they are on the same match.\n\nWait no, each row represents a different match between two teams. So as porto novo's match is against victoria club mokanda? Let me check:\n\nIn the table, the first team in the row is \"as porto novo\" and the second is \"victoria club mokanda\". Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the columns: 'agg' is aggregate score, '1st leg', and '2nd leg'. So for each leg, I need to see how much as porto novo scored against victoria club mokanda in both legs.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In the 1st leg, as porto novo scored 0 - 1 (so they scored 0 points).\n- In the 2nd leg, as porto novo also scored 0 - 2 (again, 0 points).\n\nSo in both legs combined, their aggregate score was 0 - 3. The claim says \"as porto novo scored no point\", which seems to align with this.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014did they score any goals at all? Let me check the 'agg' column for as porto novo against victoria club mokanda. According to the table, their aggregate is 0 - 3, so yes, as porto novo didn't score any points in either leg.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"as porto novo scored no point against the victoria club mokanda\" is TRUE.\n\nSo, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking at the table, as porto novo's row is row index 4 (since it starts from 0). The columns we're interested in are '1st leg' and '2nd leg', because those show their scores against each opponent.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column \"1st leg\"\n- Row 4, column \"2nd leg\"\n\nI think that's correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"canon yaound\u00e9 score 5 more points than their opponent.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several rows and columns. The relevant columns for this claim seem to be the ones showing the scores of each team in both legs of a match. The team mentioned is \"canon yaound\u00e9,\" so I need to find their row in the table.\n\nLooking through each row, I see that \"canon yaound\u00e9\" is indeed one of the teams. Let's find their specific row. Scanning down, there it is: the fifth row from the top, with team1 being \"canon yaound\u00e9.\" The agg column shows \"9 - 4,\" which probably represents their aggregate score or total points over both legs.\n\nNow, I need to identify the opponent in this match. Opposite to \"canon yaound\u00e9\" in the same row is \"as solidarit\u00e9.\" So, the opponent's name is \"as solidarit\u00e9.\"\n\nNext, I'll look at the scores for each leg. The first leg score for canon yaound\u00e9 is 7 - 3, and the second leg is 2 - 1. To find out if they scored 5 more points than their opponent, I need to calculate the total points each team has.\n\nAdding up the goals: For \"canon yaound\u00e9,\" it's 7 (first leg) + 2 (second leg) = 9 goals. Their opponent, \"as solidarit\u00e9,\" has 3 in the first leg and 1 in the second, totaling 4 goals. \n\nSo, canon yaound\u00e9 scored 9 points, and their opponent scored 4 points.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"asc diaraf win against stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into key parts. The main elements are:\n\n1. Team 1: asc diaraf\n2. Team 2: stade malien\n3. Event: win against each other (so team 1 wins)\n4. Context: 1971 African Cup of Champion Club\n\nLooking at the table, I need to see if there's a match where asc diaraf plays against stade malien and whether they won.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"asc diaraf\" in the table. Scanning through each row, I find it in the fourth row (index 3). \n\nNow, checking this row, team 1 is asc diaraf, and team 2 is stade malien. The first leg score is 3 - 0 for team 1, and the second leg is 0 - 4. So overall, the aggregate (agg) is 3 - 4.\n\nWait, but the claim says they won against stade malien in the 1971 African Cup. However, according to the table, asc diaraf has a higher score in the first leg but lost the second leg heavily. The aggregate result is 3-4, meaning stade malien actually won overall. So that contradicts the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me double-check:\n\nThe 'agg' column shows the total after both legs. For asc diaraf vs. stade malien, it's 3-4. So stade malien won the aggregate, not asc diaraf.\n\nSo the claim is saying that asc diaraf won against stade malien in the 1971 African Cup. But according to the table, they didn't win; instead, stade malien did. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim refers to a different year? The table might not cover 1971. Let me check if there's any row where this happened in 1971.\n\nLooking at the '1st leg' and '2nd leg' columns for asc diaraf vs stade malien: first leg is 3-0, second leg 0-4. I don't see a year mentioned in the table; it just lists the scores. So maybe the table doesn't cover 1971.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table's data is from 1971. If that's the case, then asc diaraf didn't win against stade malien, so the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because asc diaraf did not win against stade malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the young african score zero point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is true or false by checking the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts:\n- The team in question is \"young africans.\"\n- They scored zero points.\n- This happened in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between two teams. The columns are: team1, agg (aggregate score), team2, first leg score, and second leg score.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"young africans\" in the table to find their relevant matches.\n\nIn the 7th row of the tbody:\n- Team 1 is \"young africans.\"\n- Agg column shows \"2 - 0\" against \"lavori publici.\"\n- The first leg was \"2 - 0,\" and the second leg was \"0 - 0.\"\n\nThis indicates that young africans scored two goals in the first leg and none in the second. So their total aggregate score is 2 - 0, not zero.\n\nThe claim says they scored zero points, which doesn't match the table data.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams, with their aggregate score (agg) as well as the scores from each leg.\n\nThe claim mentions \"secteur 6\" and \"enugu ranger\". I need to find these in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 8: team 1 is \"secteur 6\", team 2 is \"enugu rangers\".\n  \nSo, this row directly matches the teams mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking at the columns relevant for a win: The 'agg' column shows the total score, but it's better to check each leg. In the first leg (1st leg), secteur 6 scored 1 - 1, and in the second leg (2nd leg), they lost 0 - 1.\n\nThe agg column is \"1 - 2\". So overall, they didn't win; the other team won both legs? Wait, no. The 'agg' is 1-2, meaning enugu rangers have a higher total score. But let's check each leg:\n\nFirst leg: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers: 1 - 1 (draw).\nSecond leg: secteur 6 lost 0 - 1.\n\nSo, in the aggregate, it's 1-2, so enugu rangers won the match. Therefore, secteur 6 did not win against enugu rangers.\n\nThe claim says \"secteur 6 win agains the enugu ranger,\" which is incorrect because enugu rangers won. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: The row in question is row index 8 (since it's zero-indexed). The columns to check are 'agg', '1st leg', and '2nd leg' because these show the match results.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 8, 'agg'\n- Row 8, '1st leg'\n- Row 8, '2nd leg'\n\nThat's three cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying that canon yaound\u00e9 scored zero points in a match against their opponent. So I need to find out if there's any evidence of that in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, it seems to list matches between two teams, with columns for aggregate (agg), 1st leg, and 2nd leg scores. The team names are listed under \"team 1\" and \"team 2,\" so I need to locate canon yaound\u00e9 in this table.\n\nI'll scan through the \"team 1\" column first:\n\n- al - merrikh\n- abaluhya united\n- asc diaraf\n- maseru united\n- as porto novo\n- canon yaound\u00e9\n- esp\u00e9rance\n- sector 6\n- young africans\n\nGot it. Canon Yaound\u00e9 is listed in the \"team 1\" row, which I believe corresponds to row index 5 based on my count (since indexing starts at 0). Now, looking at their match details.\n\nIn the \"team 1\" row for canon yaound\u00e9, the aggregate score is \"9 - 4.\" This means that in both legs combined, they scored 9 goals and conceded 4. The first leg score is \"7 - 3,\" so they won that 7-3, and the second leg was \"2 - 1,\" meaning they also won that one. So their aggregate isn't zero points; in fact, they have a positive score.\n\nThe claim says they scored zero points, but according to the table, their aggregate is 9-4, which suggests they scored more than zero. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because canon yaound\u00e9 did not score zero points against their opponent. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. The column names are team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. So for canon yaound\u00e9 as team 1, the first leg is 7-3 and the second is 2-1. That adds up to an aggregate of 9 goals scored. So they definitely didn't score zero.\n\nI don't see any relevant cells that would support the claim; in fact, all the cells indicate a positive score for canon yaound\u00e9.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because canon yaound\u00e9's match results show a total score of 9-4, not zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"as porto novo score 3 point against the victoria club mokanda.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has a header with columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams, with their aggregate (agg) score and scores from each leg.\n\nThe claim mentions \"as porto novo\" scoring 3 points against \"victoria club mokanda.\" I need to find these teams in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- The first team's name is \"as porto novo,\" which matches. This is row index 7 (since the table has 8 rows, starting from 0).\n- The second team in this row is \"al - ahly (benghazi),\" not relevant here.\n- Then, further down, there's a row with \"victoria club mokanda\" as team 2. That's row index 5.\n\nSo, the two relevant cells are:\n\n1. As porto novo's agg score in their match against victoria club mokanda. This should be under the \"agg\" column, which is column index 1.\n2. The result of the first leg (column index 3) and second leg (column index 4) for this match to ensure that as porto novo scored 3 points.\n\nWait, but the claim is about scoring 3 points in total. In aggregate, \"as porto novo\" has an agg score of 0 - 3 against \"victoria club mokanda.\" That means as porto novo scored 3 goals, and victoria club mokanda scored 0. So the aggregate supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row index 7 (as porto novo's row), column \"agg\" for the total score.\n- Also, maybe check each leg to confirm the points, but perhaps only the aggregate is needed since the claim is about the total score.\n\nBut wait, in football, a \"point\" isn't exactly the same as goals. Sometimes it refers to goals, but other times points can be from wins or draws. However, given the context of the table, it's likely referring to goal aggregate. So if as porto novo scored 3 goals, that would be considered 3 points in this context.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For as porto novo: row index 7, columns \"agg\" (which is 0 - 3), but wait, no\u2014the agg for as porto novo is 0 - 3. So their score is 0-3. Wait, that can't be right. If as porto novo scored 0 and the opponent scored 3, then the agg would be 0-3, meaning as porto novo has 0 points or goals? No, in football, if a team scores 3 goals, their aggregate is 3, not 0.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nThe row for as porto novo and victoria club mokanda is row index 5. Team1: as porto novo has agg 0 - 3. So that would mean as porto novo scored 0, and their opponent scored 3. That doesn't make sense because if you score 3 goals, your agg should be 3, not 0.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check:\n\nIn row index 5: team1 is \"as porto novo\" with agg 0 - 3. Team2 is \"victoria club mokanda.\" So as porto novo scored 0, victoria scored 3? That can't be right because then as porto novo wouldn't have 3 points.\n\nWait, no\u2014agg typically stands for aggregate score. So if it's 0 - 3, that would mean team1 (as porto novo) scored 0, and team2 scored 3. So as porto novo didn't score any goals, but the claim says they scored 3 points against them.\n\nThis suggests a discrepancy. If as porto novo scored 0, then they can't have scored 3 points. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the table is structured. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting rows.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nThe table has 8 rows. Let me list them out with row indices from 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\nRow 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\nRow 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\nRow 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\nRow 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda (row index 5?)\nWait, no\u2014row indices go from 0 to 7. Let me count:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh\n- Row 1: abaluhya united\n- Row 2: asc diaraf\n- Row 3: maseru united\n- Row 4: as porto novo\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9\n- Row 6: esp\u00e9rance\n- Row 7: secteur 6\n\nWait, no. The table has 8 rows from tr tags. So row indices are 0 to 7.\n\nLooking at the team1 and team2 in each row:\n\nRow 4 (index 4): as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda? Or is it another team?\n\nWait, let me parse the HTML-like structure:\n\nThe first <tr> is row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara.\n\nSecond <tr> is row1: abaluhya united vs great olympics.\n\nThird: row2: asc diaraf vs stade malien.\n\nFourth: row3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave.\n\nFifth: row4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda.\n\nThen row5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs ??? (canon yaound\u00e9 is team1, but who's team2?)\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. The initial list provided in the problem seems to have 8 teams:\n\n1. al - merrikh\n2. abaluhya united\n3. asc diaraf\n4. maseru united\n5. as porto novo\n6. canon yaound\u00e9\n7. esp\u00e9rance\n8. secteur 6\n\nBut each row is a match, so the table has 8 matches. So:\n\nRow0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara (is this correct? Or perhaps it's another team.)\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the actual HTML structure as provided.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\nYou are given a table with the following rows:\n\n1. al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n2. abaluhya united vs great olympics\n3. asc diaraf vs stade malien\n4. maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n5. as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n6. canon yaound\u00e9 vs ...\n7. esp\u00e9rance vs ...\n8. secteur 6 vs ...\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's not clear if each row is a match or what. Alternatively, perhaps each <tr> is a match.\n\nBut regardless, in any case, as per the table provided:\n\n- The fifth match (row4) is as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda.\n\nSo, in this match, team1 is as porto novo with agg 0 -3.\n\nThat would mean as porto novo scored 0 goals, and victoria club mokanda scored 3. So the aggregate for as porto novo is 0, not 3.\n\nThis contradicts the claim that as porto novo scored 3 points (goals) in this match.\n\nTherefore, there's a problem here\u2014either I misread the table or the data is inconsistent with the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the agg is presented as goals for and against. So if it's 0 -3, then as porto novo scored 0 and their opponent scored 3.\n\nBut that would mean as porto novo has 0 points, not 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table uses a different notation, like 3-0 meaning as porto novo won with 3 goals. But in this case, it's written as 0 -3, which is unconventional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a typo and the agg for as porto novo should be 3 -0 or something else.\n\nGiven this confusion, I need to make sure that I'm interpreting the table correctly.\n\nAssuming the table is correct, and as porto novo has an aggregate of 0 -3 against victoria club mokanda, then they did not score any goals in that match. Therefore, the claim that as porto novo scored 3 points (goals) is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps \"points\" here refer to something else, like goals or maybe a different scoring system. Alternatively, it could be a mistake in the table.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n- For team as porto novo: row index4 (if it's row4), columns for agg, first leg, and second leg to confirm any goals scored.\n\nBut if the agg is 0 -3, then they didn't score any goals. Therefore, the claim that they scored 3 points is incorrect based on this table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the problem statement, it says:\n\nYou are given a table with the following rows:\n\n1. al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n2. abaluhya united vs great olympics\n3. asc diaraf vs stade malien\n4. maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n5. as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n6. canon yaound\u00e9 vs ...\n7. esp\u00e9rance vs ...\n8. secteur 6 vs ...\n\nWait, perhaps the actual table has each row as a match between two teams. So rows 1 to 8 are matches.\n\nTherefore:\n\nRow1: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n\nRow2: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n\nRow3: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n\nRow4: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n\nRow5: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n\nRow6: canon yaound\u00e9 vs ... (but who is the opponent?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each row with team1, team2:\n\nRow0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n\nRow1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n\nRow2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n\nRow3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n\nRow4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n\nRow5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs ... (maybe another team not listed)\n\nBut without the full table, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a separate match, and I just need to focus on the specific match between as porto novo and victoria club mokanda.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTeam1: as porto novo\n\nTeam2: victoria club mokanda\n\nGoals: 0 -3\n\nTherefore, as porto novo scored 0 goals in this match. Thus, they cannot have scored 3 points (assuming points are awarded per goal).\n\nBut perhaps \"points\" refer to something else, like total points in the tournament rather than this specific match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different aspect, but given the problem statement, it seems to be about the match result.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the key is to identify that in the specific match between as porto novo and victoria club mokanda, as porto novo did not score any goals (0 -3), so they didn't achieve 3 points.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the user's claim is incorrect based on the given data. Or maybe I've misinterpreted the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"points\" in this context mean something other than goals scored, but without additional context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn any case, based on the table provided:\n\n- as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda: 0 -3\n\nThus, as porto novo did not score in this match. Therefore, they cannot have scored 3 points in this game.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task, we need to analyze the match results between \"as porto novo\" and \"victoria club mokanda.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Match:** From the provided table, the fifth row represents the match between \"as porto novo\" and \"victoria club mokanda.\"\n\n2. **Extract the Result:** In this match, the result is listed as 0 - 3.\n\n   - This notation typically means:\n     - Goals scored by the first team (as porto novo) = 0\n     - Goals scored by the second team (victoria club mokanda) = 3\n\n3. **Determine Points Scored:** Assuming points are awarded based on goals scored, \"as porto novo\" would have earned 0 points from this match.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since \"as porto novo\" did not score any goals in the match, they did not achieve 3 points. Therefore, the claim that they scored 3 points is incorrect based on the given data.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the provided match result, as porto novo did not score any goals (0 - 3), they therefore did not achieve 3 points in that game.",
