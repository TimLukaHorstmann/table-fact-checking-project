    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter , with a pick number of 19.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things:\n1. Corey Peter is the only defensive tackle.\n2. His pick number is 19.\n\nI'll start by finding any players named \"Corey Peter\" in the table who play defensive tackle and have a pick number of 19.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has columns: round, pick, overall, name, position, college.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Name is Sean Weatherspoon, position Linebacker. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Name is Corey Peters, position Defensive Tackle, pick 19. This matches both parts of the claim.\n- Row 2: Mike Johnson, guard. Not defensive tackle.\n- Row 3: Joe Hawley, guard. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Dominique Franks, cornerback. Not defensive tackle.\n- Row 5: Kerry Meier, wide receiver. Not defensive tackle.\n- Row 6: Shan Schillinger, safety. Not relevant.\n\nSo, Corey Peters is indeed listed as a defensive tackle with pick number 19. Now, I need to check if he's the \"only\" defensive tackle with that pick number. From the table, there are no other players named Corey Peter (note: it's spelled \"Peters\" in the table). So, he is unique.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because Corey Peters is listed as a defensive tackle with a pick number of 19, and there are no other such players in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
