The claim is: \"in karachi , mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 437 run.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see which parts might correspond to the table data.\n\n1. **Location**: The claim mentions Karachi. Looking at the table, the 'venue' column lists where each entry took place. I need to find if any row has Karachi in the venue column and also includes Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera as battling partners.\n\n2. **Battling Partners**: The claim refers to \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera\" as the pair involved. So I need to check if any row has these two names in the 'battling partners' column.\n\n3. **Runs**: The number of runs is 437, so I should verify if that specific number appears in the 'runs' column for that particular row.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find a match:\n\n- **Row 4**: The venue is Karachi, and the battling partners are Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera. The runs for this row are 437. This seems to perfectly match all parts of the claim.\n  \nI should also check if there's any other row that might accidentally fit, but looking through the rest, none have both Karachi as the venue with those specific players and the exact run number.\n\nSo, all conditions are met in Row 4, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"runs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 195 run together , in karachi.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. Players involved: Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera.\n2. Runs scored: 195.\n3. Venue: Karachi.\n4. Context: They batted together.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific instance where these players might have contributed to runs. I need to find rows where both Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera are mentioned as batting partners, with the runs being 195 in Karachi.\n\nI'll start by looking for any rows that mention Thilan Samaraweera. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 4: Players are Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera. Runs: 437. Venue: Karachi. Season: 2008/09.\n- No other rows mention Thilan.\n\nSo, only row 4 has both players involved. But the runs in that row are 437, not 195. The venue is correct as Karachi, but the runs don't match.\n\nNow, checking if any other rows have Mahela Jayawardene and a different partner with 195 runs in Karachi. Let's see:\n\n- Row 9: Players are Pat Symcox and Mark Boucher. Runs: 195. Venue: Johannesburg.\n- No row where Mahela and Thilan are partners with 195 runs in Karachi.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry that exactly matches all parts of the claim: both players, 195 runs, in Karachi.\n\nThe only relevant cells would be from row 4, specifically the \"runs\" and \"venue\" columns because they mention Thilan Samaraweera, Mahela Jayawardene, but the runs don't match. However, since the runs are incorrect, these cells don't fully support the claim. But the instruction says to include all relevant cells that could be checked.\n\nSo, I'll mark row 4 as relevant for both Mahela and Thilan being present, even though the runs are wrong.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because no row in the table shows both Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera having exactly 195 runs together at Karachi. \n\nHowever, I've identified that row 4 includes both players but with different run numbers.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"in 1997 , roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuira do not battle\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with headers like wicket, runs, etc., but the relevant columns for this claim are probably 'wicket', 'runs', 'battling partners', 'season'. The claim mentions a specific year (1997) and names of two players.\n\nI need to find any row in the table that matches these conditions. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 2: Wicket is 2nd, runs are 576, battling partners are Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jaya(suriya?), season is 1997. This seems relevant because it has the correct year and the two players mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, looking at the table data, row 2 has \"roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuriya\" as battling partners and the season is 1997. So according to the table, in 1997, Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jaya(suriya?) did battle. Therefore, the claim that they do not battle would be false because the table shows they did.\n\nI should check if there's any other row for 1997, but looking through the table, only row 2 has a season of 1997. So the relevant cells are row_index 1 (since it starts from 0) and the columns 'battling partners' because that's where the claim is about.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the table shows they did battle in 1997.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
