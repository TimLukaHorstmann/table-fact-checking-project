    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is: \"the one where everybody find out be episode number 111.0\". I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Episode Reference**: It mentions \"the one where everybody finds out.\" Looking at the table, this seems to correspond to an episode title. I should search for rows with that exact title or a similar variation if there's any.\n\n2. **Episode Number**: The claim states that this episode is number 111.0. Wait, in the table, all the episodes are numbered as integers, like 110, 111, etc., without any decimal points. So \"111.0\" might be a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe it's supposed to refer to episode 111.\n\n3. **Verification**: I need to check if there's an episode with the title \"the one where everybody finds out.\" If such an episode exists and its number matches, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me go through each row:\n\n- Starting from row 110: \"the one with joey 's bag\" \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 111: \"the one where everybody finds out\" \u2013 Yes, this matches exactly.\n- So, the episode number here is 111.\n\nNow, regarding the number part. The claim says \"111.0\", but in reality, it's just 111. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant to refer to 111 without the decimal. Since the table doesn't have .0 versions of episodes, I think the correct number is 111.\n\nTherefore, if the claim intended to say that episode 111 is \"the one where everybody finds out,\" then it would be true, but since it specifies \".0\", which isn't present, maybe there's an issue. However, considering the table, the exact match exists as 111 without any decimal, so perhaps the .0 was a mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the table data, there is an episode with the matching title and number 111, so the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 111, \"column_name\": \"Episode Number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true by checking each condition against the table provided. The claim states: \"episode 11, the one with all the resolution, air on the 7th of january, 1999.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n1. Episode number: 11\n2. Episode title: \"the one with all the resolution\"\n3. Air date: January 7, 1999\n\nI'll go through each part to verify them against the table.\n\nStarting with the episode number, I'll look for any cell in the table that mentions \"episode\" and see if it matches 11. Looking at the first column labeled \"Episode#\", I notice that row_index 0 is episode 1, then 2, etc., up to row_index 117 which is episode 118. So there must be an episode 11 somewhere.\n\nNext, the episode title is given as \"the one with all the resolution.\" I'll look for this exact phrase in the third column labeled \"Title.\" Scanning through each row's Title cell:\n\n- Row 0: \"The One With The Pilot\"\n- Row 1: \"The One With Monica's Friends\"\n...\n- Continuing until I find a match. Let me check row_index 110: \"the one with joey's bag\" doesn't match. Then, looking further ahead, at row_index 111: \"the one where everybody finds out.\" Not matching. Next is row_index 112: \"the one with the girl who hits joey.\" Still not.\n\nWait, I might have missed it earlier. Let me go back. Oh, there's a row before that: row 113 and 114 are missing (there's a gap). Wait, no, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 110: \"the one with joey's bag\"\nRow 111: \"the one where everybody finds out\"\nRow 112: \"the one with the girl who hits joey\"\nThen row 113 is skipped, but I don't see an episode titled \"the one with all the resolution\" in the table provided. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's listed later. Let me check further down:\n\nRow 114: \"the one with rachel's inadvertent kiss\"\nRow 115: \"the one where rachel smokes\"\n...\nContinuing until row 117: \"the one with the ride-along\"\nRow 118: \"the one with the ball\"\n\nI don't see an episode titled \"the one with all the resolution\" in this table. That's a problem because the claim refers to that title, but it's not present.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck each row carefully:\n\nLooking through each row from 0 upwards:\n\n- Row 0: The Pilot\n- Row 1: Monica's Friends\n- Row 2: Coffee and Donuts\n...\nRow 110: Joey's Bag\nRow 111: Everybody Finds Out\nRow 112: Girl Who Hits Joey\nRow 113 is skipped (missing data)\nRow 114: Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss\nRow 115: Where Rachel Smokes\nRow 116: Ross Can't Flirt\nRow 117: Ride-Along\nRow 118: The Ball\n\nI don't see \"the one with all the resolution\" anywhere. So, either it's missing from the table or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the title.\n\nWait, maybe the claim has a typo? Or perhaps the table is incomplete? But according to the user, that's the provided data. So if the table doesn't have an episode 11 with that title, then the claim would be false.\n\nNow, checking the air date: January 7, 1999. I'll look for this in the fifth column labeled \"Air Date.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 04/01/99\n- Row 1: 24/01/99\n...\nContinuing until I find a match. For example, looking at row 111: Air date is February 11, 1999. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the claim says January 7, 1999. Looking for that exact date in the table:\n\nLet's check each row's Air Date:\n\nRow 0: April 1, 1999\nRow 1: January 24, 1999\n...\nLooking through row indices:\n\n- Row 110: February 4, 1999\n- Row 111: February 11, 1999\n- Row 112: February 18, 1999\n- Then March 18, 1999 (Row 114)\n- April 8, 1999 (Row 115)\n- April 22, 1999 (Row 116)\n- April 29, 1999 (Row 117)\n- May 6, 1999 (Row 118)\n\nI don't see a row with Air Date as January 7, 1999. So the date doesn't match.\n\nMoreover, earlier I couldn't find the episode title in the table, which is another discrepancy.\n\nSo both the episode title and air date do not align with any entry in the provided table. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Episode Number (11):**\n   - The table lists episodes from 1 to 118. There is no direct indication of an episode numbered 11 specifically.\n\n2. **Episode Title (\"the one with all the resolution\"):**\n   - Scanning through each row's \"Title\" column, none match this exact title.\n\n3. **Air Date (January 7, 1999):**\n   - Checking the \"Air Date\" column reveals no entry for January 7, 1999.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is false because the table does not contain an episode numbered 11 with the specified title airing on January 7, 1999.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that the production code for the episode with 23.9 million US viewers is 467661. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. It seems like it's a list of episodes from a show, each with their own details. Each row has several columns: Production Code, Title, Air Date, etc.\n\nThe key here is to find the episode that had 23.9 million US viewers and then check what its production code is. \n\nLooking at the \"Number of US Viewers\" column, I need to scan each row's viewer count for 23.9 million. Let me go through the table step by step:\n\n- Starting from row 0: 19.6M\n- Row 1: 24.8M\n- Row 2: 27.7M\n- Row 3: 29.3M\n- Row 4: Not sure, skipped because some rows are missing data.\n- Then I see 24.5M, which is in row 14 (but the table seems a bit off, so maybe I'm miscounting)\nWait, actually, looking at the table again, after row 15 with 29.3M, there's a jump to row 17 with 24.5M. Then row 18 has 21.9M, and so on until row 20: 19.6M.\n\nHmm, I don't see any entry that exactly matches 23.9 million. The closest is row 1 with 24.8M, which is close but not exact. Since the claim specifies 23.9M, there's no matching viewer count in the table.\n\nSo, because there's no episode with exactly 23.9M viewers listed here, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that an episode with 23.9 million US viewers has production code 467661. Checking each row for a viewer count of 23.9M reveals none match. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify if the claim that \"467671 be the production code that have 24.8 million US viewers\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the production code in question is 467671. Looking at the table, I see that each row has a Production Code column with numbers like 1, 2, ..., up to 119 or so. So yes, 467671 is one of these codes.\n\nNext, the claim states it \"have\" 24.8 million US viewers. In the table, I should look for a column that relates to viewer numbers. Scanning through the columns, I see one labeled \"Viewers (US)\" which seems relevant. The values in this column are percentages or specific numbers like 27.7, 29.3, etc., but not sure about 24.8 million yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the units here. The column might represent the number of viewers in millions. So, for example, if it's 24.8 million, that would be written as 24.8 in the cell. Let me check each row with production code 467671 to see what their Viewers (US) is.\n\nLooking through the table, I find that Row 112 has Production Code 467665 and Viewers (US) of 29.3 million. Hmm, not matching. Then Row 114: 467667 and Viewers (US) 24.5. Close but not exactly 24.8. Wait, is there a row with 467671? Let me check the last few rows.\n\nLooking down, I see that Row 118 has Production Code 467670 and Viewers (US) of 19.6. Then Row 119: maybe it's cut off or missing. Wait, no, in the table provided, the last rows go up to 119. Wait, actually, looking at the data, after row 112 comes row 114, which is Production Code 467667 and Viewers (US) 24.5. Then row 115:467668 with 21.9. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The claim says \"467671 be the production code that have 24.8 million US viewer.\" So I need to find a row where Production Code is 467671 and Viewers (US) is 24.8.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me see if there's such a row. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 110:467662, Viewers 24.9\n- Row 111:467664, Viewers 27.7\n- Row 112:467665, Viewers 29.3\n- Then it jumps to Row 114:467667, Viewers 24.5\n- Row 115:467668, Viewers 21.9\n- Row 116:467669, Viewers 20.9\n- Row 117:467670, Viewers 19.6\n- Row 118:467671, Viewers 20.9\n\nWait a minute, I might have miscounted earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nEach row has several columns: Episode Number, Title, Air Date, Production Code, Revenue ($M), Viewers (US), etc.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 112:467665 | ... | Viewers (US):29.3\n\nThen Row 114:467667 | ... | Viewers (US):24.5\n\nWait, but what about row 113? Oh, I notice that after Row 112 comes 114, skipping 113. Maybe there's a missing row or it was omitted in the table provided.\n\nBut looking further down:\n\nRow 118 has Production Code 467671 and Viewers (US):20.9\n\nSo I don't see any row with Production Code 467671 having Viewers (US) as 24.8 million.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial search. Let me double-check each row where Production Code is 467671. From the table:\n\nLooking at the last few rows:\n\n- Row 117:467670 | ... | Viewers (US):19.6\n- Row 118:467671 | ... | Viewers (US):20.9\n\nSo, no, there's no row with Production Code 467671 and Viewers (US) equal to 24.8 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the production code 467671 doesn't have 24.8 million US viewers according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 118, \"column_name\": \"Viewers (US)\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"October 1, 1998 be the date that the one with all the resolution originally air\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by breaking down what's needed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim. It says that the episode titled \"The One with All the Resolutions\" first aired on October 1, 1998. So, my task is to check if this date matches the original air date of that specific episode in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various episodes from what appears to be season 5 of Friends, given the format and the presence of Joey, Chandler, Monica, etc. Each row has details like the episode title, date, director(s), writer(s), etc.\n\nI need to find the row where the episode title is \"The One with All the Resolutions\" or something similar that might be a variation. Let me scan through the table's titles:\n\nRow 0: The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey\nRow 1: The One with the Birthday Party\n...\nContinuing, I look for an exact match. Hmm, in row 112, it says \"The One with the Girl who hits joey\" which doesn't match. Then, looking further down, I see rows like 114: The One with Rachel's inadvertent kiss, 115: The One where Rachel smokes, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I skipped some rows. Let me check again. Oh, wait, row numbers are a bit off because there are gaps (like row 113 is missing). So row 112 is episode 15, then 114 is episode 17.\n\nLooking at row 110: The One with Joey's bag\nRow 111: The One where everybody finds out\nRow 112: The One with the Girl who hits joey\nThen, row 114: The One with Rachel's inadvertent kiss\nWait, I'm not seeing \"The One with All the Resolutions\" here. Maybe I need to check if it's in a different spot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the title is slightly different or there's a typo. Let me see: in the table, row 112 has \"the one with the girl who hits joey\", and row 114 is about Rachel's kiss. Hmm. Wait, maybe the exact title is missing from the table? Or perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim refers to \"The One with All the Resolutions.\" Looking through the table:\n\nRow 0: The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey\nRow 1: The One with the Birthday Party\n...\nWait, row 112 is episode 15: The One with the Girl who hits joey\n\nI don't see an exact match in the table. That might mean that either the claim is incorrect or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"The One with All the Resolutions\" was not included in the table provided, which would mean the claim can't be verified from the given data. So, if the episode isn't listed, then the date isn't present, so the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nLooking at each row's title:\n\nRow 0: The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey\nRow 1: The One with the Birthday Party\n...\nRow 110: The One with Joey's Bag\nRow 111: The One Where Everybody Finds Out\nRow 112: The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey (again)\nThen, row 114: The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss\nSo, I don't see \"The One with All the Resolutions\" in any of these. Therefore, either the table is missing that episode or it's not included here.\n\nSince the claim refers to an episode that isn't present in the provided data, we can't confirm whether its original air date was October 1, 1998. Without knowing when that specific episode aired, the claim can't be fully supported based on this information.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's no relevant cell in the table to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
