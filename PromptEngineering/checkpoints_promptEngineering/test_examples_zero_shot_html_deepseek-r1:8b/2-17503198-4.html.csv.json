    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"there be only 1 match in the 2008 belarusian premier league with the agg of 4 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table provided. Let's break it down.\n\nThe term \"agg\" likely refers to the aggregate score, which is the total score after both legs of a two-legged match. So, they're talking about matches where the combined result (after both games) is 4-1 in favor of one team.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"only 1 match\" with this agg. That means there should be exactly one entry in the table where the aggregate score is 4 - 1. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different round or stage of some competition. The columns include \"round\", \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg.\" My focus should be on the \"agg\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I need to scan each row in the table's tbody section and check the value of the \"agg\" column. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: The \"agg\" cell is 1 - 5. That's a score, but not 4-1, so it doesn't fit.\n\nRow 2: The \"agg\" here is 2 - 0. Not matching.\n\nRow 3: Another \"agg\" of 2 - 0. Still not 4-1.\n\nRow 4: The \"agg\" column says 2008 - 09 uefa cup, which seems to be a header or some kind of placeholder, so it's likely not a score.\n\nRows 5 and 6: These are first qualifying rounds with \"agg\" scores of 4-1 and 2-3 respectively. Wait, row 5 has an agg of 4 - 1. That matches the condition we're looking for.\n\nRow 6: Agg is 2 - 3. Not our target.\n\nRows 7 to 9: These are about the uefa champions league and qualifying rounds, with various agg scores, none of which are 4-1.\n\nThen in rows 10-12, group stages have agg scores like 3-0, 2-2, and 3-1. Not matching.\n\nSo from this, only row 5 has an agg of 4 - 1. That seems to be the one match.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the competition is indeed the Belarusian Premier League as mentioned in the claim. Looking at the table headers:\n\nThe first row under thead has \"round\" and mentions \"2008 uefa intertoto cup,\" which doesn't sound like the Belarusian Premier League.\n\nLooking further down, rows 4 mention uefa cup and champions league competitions, which are different from a domestic league like Belarusian Premier League. The relevant entries for the Belarusian competition might be in other parts of the table.\n\nWait, actually, looking at row indices (since rows start from 0), let's check each \"round\" column:\n\nRow 1: uefa intertoto cup\nRow 2: unknown, as it's a placeholder?\nRow 3: uefa cup\nRow 4: champions league\nRows 5-12: various stages, but none explicitly say Belarusian Premier League.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is incomplete. Maybe not all competitions are listed here. So if the claim refers to the 2008 Belarusian Premier League, I might need to check whether any of the matches in the table are part of that league and have an agg of 4-1.\n\nHowever, based on the columns provided in the table, there's no specific indication of which competition each match belongs to. So without knowing which rows correspond to the Belarusian Premier League, I can't confirm if only one match meets the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all the matches in the table are part of various competitions, and the claim is making a general statement about any league, not specifically Belarusian. That would complicate things, but since the claim mentions \"Belarusian premier league,\" I think it's referring to that specific competition.\n\nGiven that, if none of the matches in the provided table belong to the Belarusian Premier League, then there might be no data to support the claim. Or perhaps only one match is present with an agg of 4-1.\n\nBut looking again at row 5: \"agg\" is 4 - 1. If that's part of the Belarusian league, then it fits. However, if that match is from another competition, it doesn't count towards the claim.\n\nSince the table might not include all matches or competitions, I can only rely on what's provided. The only match with an agg of 4 - 1 is row 5, but without knowing which competition that was part of, I can't confirm if it's from Belarusian Premier League.\n\nThis makes it tricky because I don't have enough information about the context of each match. Therefore, based solely on the table provided, there's at least one match with an agg of 4 - 1 (row 5), but whether it belongs to the specified league isn't clear.\n\nWait, perhaps row 0 is a header or placeholder, so rows start from 1. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, in the tbody, the first data row is row 0: 2008 uefa intertoto cup with agg 1-5, team1 and team2 not specified. Then row1: first qualifying round, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me list all rows:\n\n- Row 0: \"agg\" = 1 - 5 (not our target)\n- Row 1: \"agg\" = 2 - 0\n- Row 2: \"agg\" = 2 - 0\n- Row3: \"agg\" = 2008 - 09 uefa cup (placeholder)\n- Row4: first qualifying round, agg=4-1 (this is row4? Or maybe I'm getting confused with the indexes.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows are 0-based. So:\n\nRow0: agg=1-5\nRow1: agg=2-0\nRow2: agg=2-0\nRow3: placeholder\nRow4: agg=4-1 (first qualifying round)\nRow5: agg=2-3\nRow6: uefa cup, placeholder\nRow7: champions league, placeholder\nRow8: group stage, agg=3-0\nRow9: group stage, agg=2-2\nRow10: group stage, agg=3-1\n\nSo only row4 has agg=4-1. Now, if this is part of the Belarusian Premier League, then it's one match. But if not, then there might be none or more than one.\n\nBut without knowing which competition each row belongs to, I can't confirm that row4 is from the correct league. Therefore, based solely on the table data provided, only one match has an agg of 4-1, but I don't know if it's in the Belarusian Premier League.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be true because there's at least one such match in the table, but without knowing its competition, I can't say for sure. Alternatively, perhaps the table doesn't include that league's matches, so maybe no such match exists.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Since the claim specifies \"Belarusian Premier League,\" and if none of the matches in the table are from that league, then the statement would be false. But if any match in that league has an agg of 4-1, it's true.\n\nGiven the data, I only see one such match, but without knowing its competition, I can't confirm it's part of Belarusian Premier League. Therefore, perhaps the claim is not fully supported by the table data provided.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes all the necessary information, and perhaps \"Belarusian Premier League\" refers to some matches in rows beyond row12 or something, but since the table stops at row11 (if 0-based), I don't have more data.\n\nTherefore, based on what's provided, only one match meets the criteria. So if that's part of Belarusian Premier League, then it's true; otherwise, not.\n\nBut since I don't know which league each match belongs to, I can't confirm for sure. Therefore, the answer would be that there is at least one match with an agg of 4-1, but whether it's from the specified league isn't clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the table only includes matches from Belarusian Premier League, in which case row4 is the only one. Alternatively, maybe it's a different competition.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given data, there's at least one match with an agg of 4-1 (row4), but without knowing if it's part of Belarusian Premier League, I can't definitively say whether the claim is true or not.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, there is insufficient information to confirm that only one match in the Belarusian Premier League has an aggregate goal score of 4-1. The table includes a single match with this score (likely row 4), but it is unclear which competition this match belongs to.\n\n**Answer:** There is insufficient evidence to confirm that only one match in the Belarusian Premier League has an aggregate goal score of 4-1, as the provided data does not specify the competition for each match.",

    "claim": "bate borisov score 2 goal more in match against anderlecht as compare to the match against levski sofia",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bate Borisov scoring two goals more in their match against Anderlecht compared to Levski Sofia is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The table has several columns: round, team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's specifically about Bate Borisov scoring two goals more against Anderlecht than against Levski Sofia. So, I need to find the relevant matches where Bate Borisov played against both Anderlecht and Levski Sofia.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. The first few rows don't seem related because they mention other teams like Cracovia, Shakhtyor Soligorsk, etc., not Bate Borisov or Anderlecht or Levski Sofia.\n2. When I reach the rows involving Bate Borisov, I see:\n   - In row 6: Bate Boriso vs Anderlecht in the second qualifying round. The scores are team1 (Bate) scored 3, team2 (Anderlecht) scored 4.\n   - Next, row 7: Bate Boriso vs Levski Sofia in the third qualifying round. Here, Bate scored 1, and Levski scored 2.\n\nWait, but the claim says Bate scored two goals more against Anderlecht than against Levski. Let me check:\n\n- Against Anderlecht (second qualifying round): Bate scored 3 goals.\n- Against Levski Sofia (third qualifying round): Bate scored 1 goal.\n\nSo, 3 vs 1: difference is 2 goals. That matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that this is correct because sometimes the 'agg' column might have aggregate scores or it's just the match score. Looking at the columns, 'agg' stands for aggregate in some contexts, but in this table, looking at the headers and data, it seems each cell represents a single leg, with separate first and second legs.\n\nSo, the claim is about Bate scoring two goals more against Anderlecht than Levski Sofia. From the matches listed:\n\n- In their match against Anderlecht (row 6), Bate scored 3.\n- Against Levski Sofia (row 7), Bate scored 1.\n\nDifference: 3 - 1 = 2, so yes, Bate scored two goals more against Anderlecht than against Levski Sofia. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. Looking at row 6 (Bate vs Anderlecht), the 'team1' cell has 3 - 4. So column '1st leg' is 2 and '2nd leg' is 1? Wait, no, looking at the columns:\n\nWait, in each match row, the 'agg' is probably the overall aggregate, but each match seems to be a single game with separate legs. Let me clarify:\n\nEach match row has the round, team1, agg, team2, first leg, and second leg.\n\nFor row 6: Bate Boriso (team1) vs Anderlecht (team2)\n- First leg score for Bate: 3\n- Second leg: probably not listed as it's a single match? Or maybe the 'agg' is the total. Wait, but in this case, team1 scored 3 and team2 scored 4.\n\nWait, the columns are:\n\n- round\n- team1 (Bate)\n- agg\n- team2 (Anderlecht)\n- first leg score?\n- second leg score?\n\nNo, looking at the table data: For row 6, it's:\nRound: second qualifying round\nteam1: Bate Boriso\nagg: 3 - 4\nteam2: Anderlecht\n\nWait, perhaps 'agg' is the total score. So in that case, Bate scored 3 and Anderlecht scored 4.\n\nSimilarly, row 7:\nRound: third qualifying round\nteam1: Bate Boriso\nagg: 1 - 2\nteam2: Levski Sofia\n\nSo, for the match against Anderlecht (row6), Bate scored 3 in total.\nFor Levski Sofia (row7), Bate scored 1.\n\nDifference is 2 goals. So the claim is correct.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Bate vs Anderlecht: row index 6, columns 'team1' and 'agg' because they show the score.\n- For Bate vs Levski Sofia: row index7, column 'team1' and 'agg'.\n\nWait, but perhaps only specific columns are needed. The claim is about the goals scored by Bate, so 'team1' in each match.\n\nSo, I'll need to identify the cells where Bate Boriso's score against Anderlecht and Levski Sofia are mentioned.\n\nThus:\n\n- row 6 (Bate vs Anderlecht), column 'team1': 3\n- row7 (Bate vs Levski), column 'team1':1\n\nSo, these two cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true, we need to compare Bate Borisov's goals scored against Anderlecht and Levski Sofia. The relevant data points are found in specific table cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"bate borisov play as team 2 against juventus in the group stage\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: bate borisov and juventus. It says that in the group stage, bate borisov plays as team 2 against juventus. So I need to find evidence in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between two teams across different rounds or stages. The columns are round, team1, agg, team2, first leg, and second leg. \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows could be relevant. The claim mentions \"group stage,\" so I'll look for rows where the 'round' column has the word \"group stage.\" Scanning through the table:\n\n- There's a row with round as \"group stage\" and team1 is real madrid against bate borisov.\n- Another row has group stage, team1 as bate borisov vs juventus.\n- A third row has group stage, team1 as zenit st petersburg against bate borisov.\n\nSo these are the three rows I need to check.\n\nNow, focusing on the second row (index 2) where team1 is bate borisov and team2 is juventus. The claim says bate borisov is team 2, but in this row, they're listed as team1 with a score of 3-0 against juventus. That doesn't fit because the claim has them as team2.\n\nLooking at the third row (index 4), it's group stage, team1 is bate borisov and team2 is juventus again, but this time the score is 2-2. Here, bate borisov is team1 with a draw against juventus. So still not matching the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in row indices. Let me recount:\n\nThe first group stage row (index 5) has real madrid vs bate borisov. The second one is index 6: bate borisov vs juventus with score 2-2. Then index 7: zenit vs bate borisov.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the HTML, the first group stage row is:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>group stage</td>\n  <td>real madrid</td>\n  <td>3 - 0</td>\n  <td>bate borisov</td>\n  <td>2 - 0</td>\n  <td>1 - 0</td>\n</tr>\n\nThat's index 5.\n\nNext, the second group stage row is:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>group stage</td>\n  <td>bate borisov</td>\n  <td>2 - 2</td>\n  <td>juventus</td>\n  <td>2 - 2</td>\n  <td>0 - 0</td>\n</tr>\n\nThat's index 6.\n\nThird is:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>group stage</td>\n  <td>zenit st petersburg</td>\n  <td>3 - 1</td>\n  <td>bate borisov</td>\n  <td>1 - 1</td>\n  <td>2 - 0</td>\n</tr>\n\nThat's index 7.\n\nSo, in the group stage rows, bate borisov is either team1 or team2. The claim says they are team2 against juventus. But looking at index 6: team1 is bate borisov and team2 is juventus. So that doesn't match because the claim has bate borisov as team2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each row:\n\nIn row with index 5 (real madrid vs bate borisov), team1 is real madrid, so no.\n\nIndex6: team1 is bate borisov, team2 is juventus. So in this case, bate borisov is team1 against juventus.\n\nThe claim says bate borisov is team2 against juventus. So that's not matching here.\n\nLooking further, index7: team1 is zenit st petersburg, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps the match where bate borisov is team2 would be if they were listed as team2 in any group stage match.\n\nBut looking through all the group stage rows:\n\nOnly in index6 is bate borisov team1. So maybe there's no row where bate borisov is team2 against juventus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a row. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table, the group stage rows are:\n\n5: real madrid vs bate borisov\n\n6: bate borisov vs juventus\n\n7: zenit st petersburg vs bate borisov\n\nSo in none of these is bate borisov listed as team2 against juventus. They're always team1 or playing against someone else.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be FALSE because there's no row where bate borisov is team2 against juventus in the group stage.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting rows. Let me check again:\n\nThe table has 15 rows in the tbody. The group stage rows start at index5 and go to index7. So within group stage, there are three matches: real vs bate, bate vs juventus, and zenit vs bate.\n\nIn none of these does bate borisov play as team2 against juventus; they're either team1 or playing another opponent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the table data. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where \"bate borisov\" and \"juventus\" appear in group stage matches, but bate borisov is listed as team1, not team2. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"valur lose the first qualify round of the 2008 - 09 uefa champion league.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's stating. It mentions \"valur,\" which I think is a team name, \"first qualify round,\" and \"2008 - 09 uefa champion league.\" So, the claim is saying that Valur lost their first qualifying round in the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's any row related to Valur in the context of the first qualifying round for the Champions League during that season. \n\nI'll start by scanning the 'team 1' and 'team 2' columns to see which ones mention Valur. \n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- The first row seems to be about the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup, not relevant.\n- Next rows are about different rounds but don't mention Valur until further down.\n\nI notice that in row 9 (assuming indexing starts at 0), the team is \"valur\" under 'team 1' and the opponent is \"bate borisov.\" The score is 3 - 0, so Valur won. But wait, the claim says Valur lost, which would mean they didn't win.\n\nLooking further down, row 10 has \"anderlecht\" as team 1 against \"bate borisov.\" So that's not Valur either. \n\nRow 11 is about Levski Sofia vs. Bate Borisov; again, not Valur. Then in group stage rows (rows 12-14), it shows matches involving Real Madrid, Bate Borisov, Juventus, and Zenit St. Petersburg. None of these are Valur.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought row 9 was about Valur, but let me check again. Oh no, actually, in the table provided by the user, after some rows related to the UEFA Cup, there's a section for the Champions League.\n\nLooking at the first row under \"2008 - 09 uefa champions league,\" all cells are filled with that text, which might be a header or placeholder, not actual data. Then, in subsequent rows, I see:\n\n- Row where team1 is \"bate borisov\" and opponent is \"valur.\" The score is 2 - 0, so Bate Borisov won against Valur.\n- Another row where team1 is \"zenit st petersburg\" vs. \"bate borisov,\" but that's not Valur.\n\nWait, the claim is about Valur losing in the first qualify round. So I need to see if there's a match where Valur was in the first qualifying round and lost.\n\nLooking back at rows related to the Champions League:\n\n- First qualifying round: There's a row with team1 \"bate borisov\" vs \"valur,\" score 2 - 0. That means Bate Borisov won, so Valur lost that match.\n- Second qualifying round: Anderlecht vs Bate Borisov.\n- Third qualifying round: Levski Sofia vs Bate Borisov.\n\nBut where is Valur's first qualifying round match? It seems in the table, Valur played against Bate Borisov in the first qualifying round. The result was a loss for Valur since Bate won with 2 - 0.\n\nSo based on this, the claim that \"valur lose the first qualify round of the 2008 - 09 uefa champion league\" would be TRUE because there's a match where Valur lost in the first qualifying round against Bate Borisov.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where \"valur\" is involved in their first qualifying round match against \"bate borisov.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in HTML format and a claim to verify. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table data and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table and the details it contains. Looking at the table, it seems to be about various rounds and matches in different competitions like the UEFA Intertoto Cup, UEFA Champions League, and UEFA Cup. Each row represents a round or stage, with columns for team 1, aggregate score (agg), team 2, first leg, and second leg.\n\nThe claim is: \"shakhtyor soligorsk score the highest goal of 5 in first round of 2008 uefa intertoto cup.\" \n\nSo, I need to verify if Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 5 goals in the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup. \n\nLooking at the table, the first row is the header, and then each subsequent row represents a different match or round. The rows after the headers are:\n\n1. <tr> for the 2008 uefa intertoto cup, but all cells in this row seem to be filled with \"2008 uefa intertoto cup\", which might be just a placeholder or repetition, not meaningful data.\n2. Then there's a row labeled 'first round' where team1 is Cracovia and team2 is Shakhtyor Soligorsk. The agg (aggregate) score is 1-5, so that would mean Shakhtyor scored 5 goals against Cracovia in the first leg? Wait, but the columns for 1st leg and 2nd leg show 1-2 and 0-3.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In the second row (row index 1), under 'first round', team1 is Cracovia, agg is 1-5, which likely means Shakhtyor scored 5 goals against them in the first leg because the agg is team1 - team2. So if it's 1-5, that would mean Cracovia scored 1 and Shakhtyor scored 5.\n\nBut wait, looking at the columns: 'agg' is the aggregate of both legs, right? Or is it per leg? No, in this table, each row seems to represent a match with first and second legs. So for example, in the first data row (row index 1), the first leg is 1-2, second leg is 0-3, so aggregate would be 1+0=1 for team1 and 2+3=5 for team2. Therefore, the agg column shows the total goals from both legs.\n\nSo in this case, Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 5 goals in total (1st leg 1-2 and 2nd leg 0-3). Wait, no: wait, if team1 is Cracovia and team2 is Shakhtyor, then the first leg is 1-2. So Cracovia scored 1, Shakhtyor scored 2 in the first leg. Then second leg is 0-3, so total for Cracovia is 1+0=1, and for Shakhtyor it's 2+3=5. Therefore, Shakhtyor Soligorsk indeed scored 5 goals in the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"highest goal of 5\". So if they scored 5 total, that would mean they scored 5 goals across both legs, which is the case here. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells. The relevant data is in row index 1 (since it's the first data row after headers). The columns involved are:\n\n- row_index: 1\n- column_name: 'first round'\n- Also, looking at the teams: team2 is Shakhtyor Soligorsk, so we need to check those cells as well.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include:\n\n1. row index 1 and 'first round' column.\n2. For team2 (Shakhtyor Soligorsk), their score in both legs: first leg is 2, second leg is 3, but perhaps just one cell indicates the total? Wait, no, the agg column shows total. Alternatively, maybe the highest goal per match or per round.\n\nWait, the claim says \"score the highest goal of 5\". So it's about scoring 5 goals in a single match or in total across legs?\n\nIn the first leg, Shakhtyor scored 2, and in the second leg, they scored 3. The aggregate is 5, but that's across both legs. If the claim is that they scored 5 goals in the first round (which includes both legs), then the agg column shows 5 for team2.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about a single match, then perhaps the highest goal in one leg, which would be 3 in the second leg.\n\nBut the way the table is structured, each row represents a particular match with two legs. So the first round consists of both legs, and the aggregate is the sum. Therefore, Shakhtyor scored 5 goals in total across both legs, making the claim TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The row for the first round (row index 1).\n- The 'agg' column to see the total score.\n- The 'team2' cell since it's Shakhtyor Soligorsk who scored the goals.\n- Possibly the 'first leg' and 'second leg' columns, but maybe just the agg is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include all cells related to team2 and their scores. So:\n\nrow_index: 1\ncolumns: first round (to identify the match), team2 (Shakhtyor Soligorsk), first leg score, second leg score, and agg.\n\nBut since the claim refers to scoring 5 goals, which is the aggregate, perhaps the 'agg' column for Shakhtyor Soligorsk is 5. So including that cell as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the 'team2' column is necessary because it's their total.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has multiple cells: team1, agg, team2, first leg, second leg. So to verify the claim, we need to check:\n\n- That the match was part of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n- That Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 5 goals in that round.\n\nLooking at row index 1:\n\n- The first cell under 'first round' is for team1: Cracovia.\n- The agg column shows 1-5, which means team2 (Shakhtyor) scored 5.\n- So the relevant columns are 'first round', team2, and the agg.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON, we need to include:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n]\n\nWait no, that's an example. In our case, it should be row index 1 and columns 'first round', 'team2', and 'agg'.\n\nWait, the user's example had two cells with different rows and column names.\n\nIn our case, we need to identify all the cells that are directly related to the claim.\n\nThe claim is about Shakhtyor Soligorsk scoring 5 goals in the first round of the 2008 Intertoto Cup. So:\n\n- The relevant row is row index 1 (first data row after headers).\n- The columns involved are 'first round' (to confirm it's the correct match), 'team2' (since that's Shakhtyor), and 'agg' (to see if they scored 5).\n\nTherefore, in the 'relevant_cells', we should include:\n\n- For row index 1:\n  - column_name: first round\n  - column_name: team2\n  - column_name: agg\n\nWait, but each relevant cell is a separate object. So for row_index=1, we have three columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to just point out the 'agg' value, but according to the task, we need to list all cells that are part of the information needed.\n\nSo, yes, the three columns: first round, team2, and agg.\n\nWait, no. The 'first round' is a header or a cell? If it's a column name, then each row has 'first round' as a label for that cell. So the data in the 'first round' column is just the text 'first round', but perhaps to identify which match it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we don't need the 'first round' column because every row represents a first round match? But no, the headers might have 'first round' as a category for that particular match.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include:\n\n1. The entire row (row index 1) to see all data.\n2. Alternatively, specific columns within that row: team2 and agg.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each relevant cell is an individual object. So for row_index=1, we need to list the columns that are part of the claim.\n\nSince the claim is about Shakhtyor Soligorsk scoring 5 goals in the first round, we can infer that:\n\n- The 'first round' column indicates which match it is.\n- The 'team2' cell shows who scored (Shakhtyor).\n- The 'agg' column shows their total score.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first round\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team2\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, it's a single object per cell. So maybe for each relevant data point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we just need to indicate that the 'first round' column has the value 'first round', which identifies the match, and the 'team2' is Shakhtyor, and 'agg' shows 5.\n\nBut I think it's better to include all three columns: first round, team2, agg.\n\nSo in the JSON, relevant_cells would be a list of objects:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"first round\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"team2\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n  }\n]\n\nBut perhaps the 'first round' isn't necessary because it's implied by row index=1. Maybe just team2 and agg.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the agg cell is needed since that directly shows the total score.\n\nI think including all three is safer to cover all bases in case more information is needed later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as TRUE based on the data provided. The relevant cells confirming Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 5 goals in the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup are:\n\n1. The 'first round' column (row index 1).\n2. The 'team2' cell, which lists Shakhtyor Soligorsk.\n3. The 'agg' column, showing a score of 5 for team2.\n\nThese cells collectively indicate that Shakhtyor Soliganskars indeed scored the highest number of goals in that match.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"first round\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"team2\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n  }\n]\n```",

The claim says: \"there be at least 3 matches in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with an agg of 4 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table contains. Looking at the table, it seems to list various rounds and matches from different tournaments, including the 2008 UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup, and the Belarusian Premier League. Each row has details about the round, both teams (team 1 and team 2), aggregate score (agg), first leg, and second leg scores.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the 2008 Belarusian Premier League having at least three matches where the aggregate score is 4 - 1. So I need to look for any matches in that league with an agg of 4-1.\n\nLooking through the table rows, most seem to be from other competitions like the UEFA Inter toto Cup or Champions League. I need to focus on rows where the tournament is the 2008 Belarusian Premier League. \n\nI scan each row's 'agg' column for a score of 4 - 1. Wait, the table might not explicitly state the tournament for each match, but some rows have titles like \"first round\" or \"group stage.\" However, I think that without the tournament specified in the row, it's hard to know which league it is.\n\nWait, actually, looking closely, there's a row that says \"2008 - 09 uefa cup\" and another for \"2008 uefa intertoto cup,\" but none explicitly mention Belarusian Premier League. So perhaps the relevant matches are in rows where the 'agg' column shows 4-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure because the table might be aggregating different leagues, so without clear indication of which tournament each match is from, it's tricky. However, since the claim is specifically about the Belarusian Premier League, maybe those matches are present elsewhere in the table but aren't clearly labeled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for any occurrence where 'agg' is 4-1 regardless of the tournament. But given that the claim is about Belarusian Premier League, and the table might not have specific matches from that league, it's possible that there are no such matches here, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, I need to check if there are at least three matches in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with an aggregate score of 4-1. \n\nUpon reviewing the table, most entries pertain to other tournaments like the UEFA Cup or Champions League. There's no explicit mention of matches from the 2008 Belarusian Premier League. Without specific data on those matches, I can't confirm the presence of three such matches.\n\nAnswer: FALSE\n\nRelevant cells: None found that specifically indicate matches from the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with a 4-1 aggregate score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Bate Borisov is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"bate borisov do not score any goal against anderlecht , but score 4 more when compete against levski sofia.\" \n\nFirst, I should carefully go through each part of the claim and find relevant information in the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: Bate Borisov not scoring any goals against Anderlecht. Looking at the table, I see that Anderlecht is listed as a team, so I need to check if there's a match between Bate Borisov and Anderlecht in the table. Scanning through the 'team 1' and 'team 2' columns:\n\n- Row with 'second qualifying round': Team 1 is Anderlecht, Team 2 is Bate Borisov.\n  - In the first leg, Anderlecht vs Bate Borisov: goals? Let me check. The '1st leg' column shows \"1 - 2\" for that row. Wait, no\u2014actually, in that specific row, team 1 is Anderlecht, and they scored 1-2 against Bate Borisov. So Anderlecht scored 1 goal, Bate scored 2. But the claim says Bate didn't score any goals against Anderlecht. Hmm, but here Bate did score 2 goals. That would contradict the first part of the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. In the 'second qualifying round' row:\n\n- Team1: Anderlecht\n- Agg: 3 - 4 (so total aggregate)\n- Team2: Bate Borisov\n- 1st leg: 1 - 2\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 2\n\nSo in the first match, Bate scored 2 goals. So they did score against Anderlecht, which would make the first part of the claim false.\n\nNow the second part: Bate Borisov scoring 4 more when competing against Levski Sofia. Looking for matches between Bate and Levski Sofia:\n\nLooking through the table, in the 'third qualifying round' row:\n\n- Team1: Levski Sofia\n- Agg: 1 - 2\n- Team2: Bate Borisov\n\nWait, no, that's team1 is Levski, so team2 is Bate. But let me see if there's a match where Bate is team1.\n\nLooking further down, in the 'third qualifying round' row:\n\n- Team1: Levski Sofia\n- Agg: 1 - 2 (so total goals)\n- Team2: Bate Borisov\n\nSo the first leg was Levski 0 - 1 Bate. Second leg: 1 - 1.\n\nWait, but in the 'third qualifying round' row, team1 is Levski, so that's Levski vs Bate. So the scores are:\n\nFirst leg: Levski 0 - 1 Bate (so Bate scored 1)\nSecond leg: Levski 1 - 1 Bate (no goals by Bate in second leg)\n\nTotal aggregate: 1-2 in favor of Bate.\n\nWait, but the claim says Bate scored 4 more against Levski. But from the table, it seems that in the match between Bate and Levski, Bate only scored once in the first leg. So the total goals by Bate would be 1, not 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing another match where Bate scored 4 against Levski.\n\nWait, let's check all rows:\n\nLooking through 'team1' and 'team2':\n\n- In row with 'third qualifying round': Levski (team1) vs Bate (team2). Scores: 0-1 and 1-1. So Bate scored 1 goal total.\n- In another row, 'group stage' rows: There's a match between Bate and Juventus, but that's not relevant here.\n- Another group stage match: Zenit vs Bate, but again not Levski.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row where Bate plays Levski. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: Second qualifying round: Anderlecht vs Bate\nRow1: third qual: Levski vs Bate\nRow2: group stage: Bate vs Juventus\nRow3: group stage: Bate vs Zenit\n\nNo other rows where Bate plays Levski. So in the only match between them, Bate scored 1 goal.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Bate scored 4 against Levski is incorrect; they only scored 1 in total.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'more' part. If Bate scored 4 goals, perhaps it's aggregate over two legs? Let me check:\n\nIn the third qualifying round (row1), the aggregate for Bate is 1 - 2 against Levski. So total goals by Bate: 1.\n\nSo the claim says they scored 4 more when competing against Levski, which doesn't align with the table data.\n\nPutting it together: The first part of the claim is incorrect because Bate did score against Anderlecht (they scored 2 in the first leg). The second part is also incorrect because Bate only scored once against Levski, not 4.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"team 2 wouldn't allow bate borisov to play with juventus in the group stage\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It says that team 2 would not allow bate borisov to play against juventus during the group stage. So, I need to find evidence in the table related to these teams and their match in the group stage.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are round, team1, agg, team2, 1st leg, 2nd leg. Each row represents a specific game or stage.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"bate borisov\" in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that bate borisov appears multiple times:\n\n- In rows 4 and 5: first qualifying round.\n- Row 8: second qualifying round.\n- Rows 10, 11, 12: group stage.\n\nIn the group stage rows (rows 10, 11, 12), team1 or team2 is bate borisov. For example:\n\n- Row 10: bate borisov vs real madrid\n- Row 11: bate borisov vs juventus\n- Row 12: bate borisov vs zenit st petersburg\n\nNow, looking specifically at row 11, which is the group stage between bate borisov and juventus. The 'team1' is bate borisov and 'team2' is juventus. Their scores are 2-2 in both legs, as shown in the 'agg', '1st leg', and '2nd leg' columns.\n\nThe claim suggests that team2 (juventus) wouldn't allow bate borisov to play against them. However, according to the table, the match did take place. The scores are 2-2 each way, which means both teams scored, indicating the game was played without issues.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication that juventus prevented bate borisov from playing. From the table data, I don't see any entries where the match wasn't held or where juventus forbade it. Instead, all relevant rows show the match occurred with normal scores.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the game did happen as scheduled without any issues.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the group stage match between bate borisov and juventus in the table. The match indeed took place, contradicting the claim that team2 wouldn't allow it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Also, I need to check if they won their first match and subsequently went on to play three more rounds in the qualifiers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different stage or round. The columns are: round type (like first qualifying round), team1, agg (aggregate score?), team2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg scores.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- The first data row after the headers is about \"first round\" between Cracovia and Shakhtyor Soligorsk. Not relevant to the Champions League.\n\nNext, the second data row is \"second round,\" but again not related to the 2008-09 Champions League.\n\nThen there's a row for \"2008 - 09 uefa cup,\" which is a different competition, so I can skip that.\n\nThe next few rows are about the \"first qualifying round\" and other rounds. Let me focus on these:\n\n1. First qualifying round: Legia Warszawa vs. Gomel. Not Valor.\n2. First qualifying round: MTZ - Ripo Minsk vs. Zilina. Not Valor.\n3. 2008-09 uefa champions league row is skipped as it's a header, not data.\n4. First qualifying round: Bate Borisov vs. Valur. So here, team1 is Bate Borisov and team2 is Valur. The first leg score is 2-0 for Bate Borisov, and the second leg is 1-0. So Valor is team2 here, lost both legs.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"valor be able to win.\" In this match, Valor didn't win; they lost both legs. So that's a problem. But maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nThen there are more qualifying rounds:\n\n5. Second qualifying round: Anderlecht vs. Bate Borisov. Not relevant for Valor.\n6. Third qualifying round (thind qualifying round in the table, probably a typo): Levski Sofia vs. Bate Borisov. Again, not Valor.\n\nNext is group stage with Real Madrid, Juventus, and Zenit St. Petersburg. None of these are Valor.\n\nWait, I need to check if Valor is in any other first qualifying rounds. The fourth row after the headers is \"first qualifying round\" with Bate Borisov vs. Valur. So that's where Valor is, but they lost both legs.\n\nBut the claim says \"valor be able to win.\" If they didn't win even one match, then the claim might be false.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe in another row, Valor won a first qualifying round.\n\nLooking back at the table, after the 2008-09 Champions League header, there's a row for \"first qualifying round: Bate Borisov vs Valur\" again? Or maybe it's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list out all the rows:\n\n1. first round\n2. second round\n3. 2008-09 uefa cup (this is a header, not data)\n4. first qualifying round: Legia Warszawa vs Gomel\n5. first qualifying round: MTZ - Ripo Minsk vs Zilina\n6. first qualifying round: Bate Borisov vs Valur\n7. second qualifying round: Anderlecht vs Bate Borisov\n8. third qualifying round (thind): Levski Sofia vs Bate Borisov\n9. group stage: Real Madrid vs Bate Borisov\n10. group stage: Bate Borisov vs Juventus\n11. group stage: Zenit St Petersburg vs Bate Borisov\n\nSo in row 6, it's the first qualifying round between Bate Borisov and Valur. Valor is team2, lost both legs.\n\nTherefore, Valor did not win any matches in the first qualifying round; they lost to Bate Borisov.\n\nThis contradicts the claim that \"valor be able to win.\" Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the table includes other stages where Valor might have participated. Let me check if there are any rows beyond group stage with Valor.\n\nLooking through the group stages, none of them mention Valor. So it seems Valor only participated in one first qualifying round match and lost both legs.\n\nThus, the claim that they won is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the first qualifying round of the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League, Valor was able to win and proceed to three more rounds. However, upon reviewing the table, Valor was a team2 participant in the first qualifying round against Bate Borisov, where they lost both legs.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in the first round of 2008 uefa intertoto cup , shakhtyor soligorsk be eliminate and score no goal.\" \n\nI need to check if this statement is supported by the provided HTML table. The table has several columns: round, team1, agg, team2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg.\n\nLooking at the rows, I'm interested in the first round of the 2008 uefa intertoto cup. In the table, the first row after the headers seems to be the header itself. Then there are multiple rows for different stages like first qualifying round, group stage, etc. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, the first data row is labeled as \"first round\" under the 'round' column, and it shows Cracovia and Shakhtyor Soligorsk as team1 and team2 respectively.\n\nSo in that specific row (row index 1), the teams are Cracovia vs. Shakhtyor Soligorsk. The 'agg' column shows \"1 - 5\", which I assume is the aggregate score. The '1st leg' is \"1 - 2\" and the '2nd leg' is \"0 - 3\". \n\nThe claim states that Shakhtyor Soligorsk was eliminated and scored no goals. To check this, I need to see if they were eliminated (which would mean losing) and their score in both legs.\n\nIn the first leg, Shakhtyor scored 1 goal, and the opponent scored 2. In the second leg, Shakhtyor scored 0, and the opponent scored 3. So overall, their aggregate is 1 - 5, meaning they lost both legs, which would result in elimination. Also, they didn't score any goals in the second leg, but they did score one goal in the first leg.\n\nWait, the claim says \"score no goal,\" which might be a bit confusing because in football (soccer), scoring zero goals implies not scoring at all. But here, they scored 1 goal in the first leg. So that contradicts the claim. However, the 'agg' column shows their total score as 1 - 5, meaning overall they only scored once across both legs. Wait, no, wait: in the first leg, team2 is Shakhtyor Soligorsk and they have 1-2, so they scored one goal. In the second leg, they have 0-3, so they didn't score any goals there. So overall, they only scored once, but not zero.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'agg' column. The 'agg' seems to be the aggregate of both legs. For example, in row 1, team1 is Cracovia with agg 1-5, meaning their total score across both legs was 1, and opponent had 5. Then for team2, Shakhtyor Soligorsk, agg would be 1 (from first leg) + 0 (second leg) = 1, but the opponent's total is 2 + 3 = 5. So Shakhtyor scored a total of one goal in both legs combined.\n\nBut the claim says they \"scored no goal,\" which might not be entirely accurate because they did score once. However, maybe the 'agg' for them is zero? Wait, no, their agg is 1 -5, so they scored once. Therefore, the claim that they scored no goals is incorrect. But wait, the first leg, they scored one goal, but in the second leg, they didn't score any. So depending on how the claim is phrased, if it's about scoring any goals in both legs, then they did score once. If it's about scoring zero in either of the legs, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether Shakhtyor Soligorsk was eliminated and scored no goals. From the table, they were eliminated because they lost 1-5 aggregate. However, they did score a goal in the first leg. So the claim says they scored no goals, which isn't true because they scored one goal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'agg' is per match or something else. But looking at the structure, each row seems to represent a match between two teams, with their scores across both legs. So the agg column is showing the total for that match.\n\nTherefore, Shakhtyor Soligorsk did score in the first leg but not in the second. So they scored one goal overall. Thus, the claim's statement about scoring no goals is incorrect. But wait, maybe the 'no goal' refers to the entire tournament or something else. No, the context is the specific match.\n\nSo, the claim says they were eliminated and scored no goals. They were eliminated (TRUE), but they did score one goal in the first leg. So the part about scoring no goals is FALSE. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE because it's inaccurate to say they scored no goals; they scored once.\n\nWait, but I need to check the relevant cells. The relevant cells would be the row where Shakhtyor Soligorsk played and their scores in both legs. So looking at row index 1 (assuming rows start from 0, but sometimes tables can vary). Wait, the headers are row index 0? Or is row index 1 the first data row.\n\nWait, let me count: the table starts with a header row, which is the first row (row_index=0), then the next rows are data. So row 1 is \"first round\", team1 Cracovia, agg 1-5, etc.\n\nSo in that case, row index 1 is where Shakhtyor Soligorsk played as team2. The columns relevant for their performance would be 'team1', 'agg', and the legs.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1 (the first data row)\n- column_name: 'team2' (since it's about Shakhtyor Soligorsk's performance)\n\nBut wait, no, the columns are round, team1, agg, team2, 1st leg, 2nd leg.\n\nSo for that row:\n\n- team1: Cracovia\n- team2: Shakhtyor Soligorsk\n- In 'agg', team1 has 1-5.\n- In '1st leg', team1 scored 1, team2 scored 2.\n- In '2nd leg', team1 scored 0, team2 scored 3.\n\nSo the relevant columns would be:\n\n- agg (for both teams)\n- 1st leg and 2nd leg for both teams\n\nBut since the claim is about Shakhtyor Soligorsk scoring no goals, we need to check their scores in each leg.\n\nIn the first leg: team2 scored 2 (against Cracovia's 1). So they scored 2 goals. In the second leg: they scored 3 against 0. Wait, wait no: in row index 1, the '1st leg' is \"1 - 2\" which means Cracovia scored 1 and Shakhtyor scored 2. Then '2nd leg' is \"0 - 3\": Cracovia scored 0, Shakhtyor scored 3.\n\nWait, no: wait, in the table, for row index 1:\n\nteam1: Cracovia\n\nagg: 1-5 (so team1's total is 1, team2's total is 5)\n\n1st leg: 1 - 2 (so team1 scored 1, team2 scored 2)\n\n2nd leg: 0 - 3 (team1 scored 0, team2 scored 3)\n\nSo in the first leg, Shakhtyor scored 2 goals. In the second leg, they scored 3. So overall, they scored 5 goals in aggregate.\n\nWait, but that's confusing because the 'agg' for team2 is 5, which is their total across both legs. But in reality, their scores are:\n\n1st leg: 2\n\n2nd leg:3\n\nTotal:5.\n\nBut wait, in the 'agg' column, it shows 1-5, meaning team1 scored 1 in total (1+0), and team2 scored 2+3=5. So yes, that adds up.\n\nSo in that case, Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 2 goals in the first leg and 3 in the second, totaling 5. Therefore, they did score goals. The claim says they scored no goals, which is incorrect. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps each cell in '1st leg' and '2nd leg' represents something else, like home and away goals, but it's still that team2 scored 2 in the first leg and 3 in the second.\n\nSo regardless of how it's presented, they did score goals. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because they did score goals (in fact, a total of 5).\n\nTherefore, the overall answer is that the claim is false, so the task is to state that and identify the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made is incorrect. Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored goals in both legs of the match. Specifically:\n\n- In the first leg, they scored 2 goals.\n- In the second leg, they scored 3 goals.\n\nThus, the claim that they \"scored no goals\" is false. The relevant cells are:\n\n- **Row index**: 1 (the first data row after the header)\n- **Columns**: 'team2', '1st leg', and '2nd leg' for Shakhtyor Soligorsk's performance.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is false because Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored goals in both legs of the match.",
