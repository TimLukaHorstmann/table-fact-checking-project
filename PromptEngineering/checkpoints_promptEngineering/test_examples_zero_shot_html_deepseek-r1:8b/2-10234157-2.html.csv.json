    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support my answer. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"Alberto di Bernardo of Leeds Carnegie has more drop than Glen Jackson of the Saracen.\" I need to verify if Alberto di Bernardo's number of drops is higher than Glen Jackson's.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find both individuals. Starting with Alberto di Bernardo. Scanning through the rows, I see his name in row 6 (index starts at 0? Wait, actually, looking at the first row is index 0 because it's the first entry). Let me count: \n\n- Row 0: andy goode\n- Row 1: charlie hodgson\n- Row 2: danny cipriani\n- Row 3: glen jackson\n- Row 4: olly barkley\n- Row 5: ryan lamb\n- Row 6: alberto di bernardo\n- Row 7: shane drahm\n- Row 8: adrian jarvis\n- Row 9: chris malone\n\nSo Alberto is in row 6. Now, looking at his \"drop\" column, which is the fifth column. In row 6, the drop value is 0.\n\nNext, Glen Jackson is in row 3. His \"drop\" value is also 2.\n\nWait, so Alberto has 0 drops and Glen has 2. The claim says Alberto has more drops than Glen. But 0 is not more than 2. So that would make the statement false. \n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. Looking at the table again:\n\n- Alberto di Bernardo's row: 6, points 127, name alberto di bernardo, club leeds carnegie, tries 0, drop 5? Wait no, in the table, the \"drop\" column for Alberto is 5. Hmm, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking at the HTML table provided, each row has five columns: points, name, club, tries, and drop. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 0:\npoints:207\nname:andy goode\nclub:leicester tigers\ntries:1\ndrop:4\n\nRow1:\n201,charlie hodgson,sale sharks,0,9\n\nRow2:\n192,danny cipriani,london wasps,6,0\n\nRow3:\n179,glen jackson,saracens,2,2\n\nRow4:\n178,olly barkley,bath rugby,3,0\n\nRow5:\n152,ryan lamb,gloucester rugby,4,1\n\nRow6:\n127,alberto di bernardo,leeds carnegie,0,5\n\nWait, so in row 6, the \"drop\" is 5. So Alberto has 5 drops.\n\nGlen Jackson is in row3 with a drop of 2.\n\nSo the claim says Alberto has more drops than Glen. 5 is indeed more than 2. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought Alberto's drop was 0, but now it's showing 5. So perhaps I miscounted or miscalculated before. Let me make sure.\n\nYes, in row6: Alberto di Bernardo has \"drop\" as 5. Glen Jackson has 2. So 5>2 is correct. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, we need to find which cells are used to verify this. For each relevant person, their row index and the column for drop.\n\nAlberto di Bernardo is in row6, so his cell is row6, \"drop\".\n\nGlen Jackson is in row3, same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n- {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"drop\"}\n\nTherefore, these two cells are used to determine that Alberto has more drops than Glen.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the \"drop\" values of Alberto di Bernardo and Glen Jackson. Alberto's drop count is 5 (higher than Glen's 2), making the statement true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Shane Drahm of Worcester Warriors scores more points than Chris Malone of Harlequins.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant players. The table has several rows with different players and their stats. \n\nStarting with Shane Drahm, I'll search for his name in the 'name' column. Scanning each row, I see that he's in row 8 (since counting starts at 0). His points are listed as 107.\n\nNext, I need to find Chris Malone's data. His name is also in the table, and upon scanning, he's in row 9, with his points being 115.\n\nNow, comparing their points: Shane Drahm has 107 points, while Chris Malone has 115. Since 107 is less than 115, Shane doesn't score more points than Chris. \n\nSo, the claim is false.

Let me look for the rows where the name is either \"Glen Jackson\" or \"Chris Malone.\"\n\nStarting with Glen Jackson: I'll search through each row's 'name' column until I find his entry. Looking at the table, I see that the fourth row has \"glen jackson\" as the name, club \"saracens,\" and in the 'drop' column, it says 2.
