    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the zakspeed 841 chassis be from the year 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions two specific elements: the chassis model \"zakspeed 841\" and the year \"1985\". The claim asserts that these two are connected; in other words, the chassis \"zakspeed 841\" was used in the year 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, and each column under \"chassis\" lists the models used for that year. So, to verify the claim, I need to find the row where the year is 1985 and check if the chassis includes \"zakspeed 841\".\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **1985 Row**: The chassis listed here is \"zakspeed 841\". This matches exactly with what the claim states.\n   \n   - So, in this row, year is 1985, and the chassis is zakspeed 841.\n\n2. Other rows: For 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989, the years don't match 1985, so they can be disregarded for this specific claim.\n\nGiven that in 1985, the specified chassis is indeed \"zakspeed 841\", the claim holds true. Therefore, I should mark the answer as TRUE, and note down which cells are relevant. The relevant cell would be row_index 0 (since it's the first row) under the column_name \"chassis\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the zakspeed 891 chassis have a yamaha v8 engine\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: year, chassis, engine (s), tyres, and points. Each row represents a different year from 1985 to 1989, with corresponding data.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"zakspeed 891 chassis\" and associates them with a \"yamaha v8 engine\". So I need to find the row where the chassis is \"zakspeed 891\" and check what the engine information says for that year.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- 1985: Chassis is zakspeed 841, engine is zakspeed s4 t/c\n- 1986: Chassis is zakspeed 861, engine is zakspeed s4 t/c\n- 1987: Chassis has both zakspeed 861 and 871, engine is still zakspeed s4 t/c\n- 1988: Chassis is zakspeed 881, engine is zakspeed s4 t/c\n- 1989: Chassis is zakspeed 891, engine is yamaha v8\n\nSo the row for 1989 has the chassis \"zakspeed 891\" and the engine listed as \"yamaha v8\". That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"chassis have a yamaha v8 engine.\" The term \"have\" might imply multiple instances or that the chassis in question (891) uses this engine. From the table, in 1989, the engine is indeed yamaha v8 for zakspeed 891. So it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because in 1989, the zakspeed 891 chassis used a yamaha v8 engine.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be accurate based on the data provided in the table for the year 1989. The relevant cell is found by checking the \"chassis\" and \"engine (s)\" columns for that specific year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that in the year 1987, there were two Zakspeed chassis models available. So I need to look at the table for the year 1987 and check the 'chassis' column to see if there are two entries that are Zakspeed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. The year in question is 1987, which is the third row (since we start counting from 0). So I'll focus on row index 2, which has the following data:\n\n- Year: 1987\n- Chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\n- Engine: zakspeed s4 t / c\n- Tyres: g\n- Points: 2\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, in the table provided, each row's index starts from 0. So the first row is 1985 (index 0), second is 1986 (index 1), third is 1987 (index 2), and so on. That means I need to check row index 2 for the 'chassis' column.\n\nIn row 2, the chassis field is \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\". This seems to list two different Zakspeed models: 861 and 871. Therefore, there are indeed two Zakspeed chassis in 1987.\n\nSo the claim is correct because the table shows that in 1987, there were two Zakspeed chassis models listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the zakspeed s4 t / c engine be use on all chassis from 1985 until 1988.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each year in the table to see if the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was used across all chassis from 1985 to 1988. \n\nLooking at 1985: The chassis is \"zakspeed 841\" and the engine listed is also \"zakspeed s4 t / c.\" So that's consistent.\n\nFor 1986: Similarly, the chassis is \"zakspeed 861,\" and the engine is again \"zakspeed s4 t / c.\" That matches too.\n\nNow, 1987: The chassis entry here is a bit different; it's listed as \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871.\" This indicates that there were two chassis models used in this year. The engine for both remains the same: \"zakspeed s4 t / c.\" So even though multiple chassis were used, the main engine type didn't change.\n\nIn 1988: The chassis is \"zakspeed 881,\" and the engine is still \"zakspeed s4 t / c.\" That matches as well.\n\nMoving on to 1989: Here, the chassis is \"zakspeed 891\" but the engine changes to \"yamaha v8.\" So that's a different engine, which doesn't affect our claim since the time period in question stops at 1988.\n\nNext, I need to check if all the chassis from 1985 through 1988 used the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine. From the table:\n\n- 1985: Yes\n- 1986: Yes\n- 1987: Yes (even though there were two chassis models)\n- 1988: Yes\n\nSo, it seems that all the listed chassis for these years used the same engine type specified in the claim.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any other chassis entries within this period. The table lists each year with specific chassis numbers and engines. There's no indication of a different engine being used during those years except in 1989. \n\nTherefore, the claim holds true for all the relevant years and chassis as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"the zakspeed 861 chassis be make in the year 1986 and 1987.\" So, it's stating that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was manufactured in both 1986 and 1987. \n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different year with various details about chassis, engines, tyres, and points. The key columns here are \"year,\" \"chassis,\" and \"engine (s).\" But since the claim is specifically about the Zakspeed 861 chassis, I should focus on rows where this exact term appears in the \"chassis\" column.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\n1. **1985**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 841.\" Not relevant.\n2. **1986**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 861.\" This matches part of the claim for 1986.\n3. **1987**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871.\" Here, both \"zakspeed 861\" and another model are mentioned. The original claim says \"the zakspeed 861 chassis,\" but in 1987, there's an additional model. However, the presence of two models doesn't necessarily mean it's incorrect, as maybe both were used that year.\n4. **1988**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 881.\" Not relevant.\n5. **1989**: Chassis is \"yamaha v8.\" Not relevant.\n\nThe claim mentions that the Zakspeed 861 was made in both 1986 and 1987. From the table, in 1986, it's definitely present as the sole chassis. In 1987, it appears alongside another model, but the main point is whether it was produced that year. Since it does appear, even if there's another model listed, the claim could still hold true.\n\nHowever, looking at the \"engine (s)\" column might offer more insight. For 1986 and 1987, the engine is consistently \"zakspeed s4 t / c,\" which aligns with the Zakspeed 861. But the claim doesn't mention engines, so maybe that's not necessary.\n\nAnother angle: The term \"make\" in the claim could imply production or availability. If the chassis was used in both years, then it's correctly made in those years. Since both 1986 and 1987 have Zakspeed 861 entries (even if one has an additional model), the claim seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, in 1987, the chassis is listed as \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871.\" Does this mean that both models were used together? If so, it's possible that the Zakspeed 861 was indeed made that year, even alongside another. Therefore, the claim isn't false just because there's an additional model.\n\nHowever, if the claim is stating exclusively that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was made in both years without mentioning others, then perhaps the claim might be misleading. But based solely on the table data, the Zakspeed 861 does appear in both 1986 and 1987, so the claim isn't entirely false.\n\nWait, but the problem is to determine if the claim is true or false. The claim says that the Zakspeed 861 was made in both years. The table shows it's present in 1986 and 1987, so the claim seems supported. However, I should check each occurrence.\n\nIn 1986: yes, only Zakspeed 861.\nIn 1987: Zakspeed 861 and another. So, while the claim focuses on 861 being made, it's still correct because it was indeed present in both years. The additional model doesn't negate that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with relevant cells being row 1 (1986) and row 2 (1987), specifically their \"chassis\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was made in both 1986 and 1987.

The claim is: \"the zakspeed 841 chassis be the only chassis from the year 1985.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns are 'year', 'chassis', and maybe others like 'engine' or 'tyres'. But the main focus here is on the 'year' and 'chassis' columns.\n\nI remember that in 1985, there's only one entry in the table. Let me check each row to confirm:\n\n- The first row is for 1985. Under 'chassis', it says \"zakspeed 841\". So that's one chassis.\n- Now, I need to make sure if there are any other chassis entries for 1985 besides this one. Looking at the rest of the table, the years go from 1986 to 1989. Each of these years has their own 'chassis' column entries, but none of them are in 1985 except the first row.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The table only has five rows, each for different years: 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989. So no other entries share the same year as 1985. That means there's only one chassis in 1985.\n\nSo the claim is saying that the \"zakspeed 841\" is the only chassis from 1985, which matches what the table shows.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the zakspeed 891 chassis have multiple yamaha v8 engine\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I need to carefully examine the claim and identify which parts of it could potentially be verified using the information in the table. The claim mentions two specific elements: \"zakspeed 891 chassis\" and \"multiple yamaha v8 engines.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year along with details about the chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. I'm particularly interested in the rows where the chassis is \"zakspeed 891\" and the engine is \"yamaha v8.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\n1. **1985**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 841\" \u2013 doesn't match.\n2. **1986**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 861\" \u2013 doesn't match.\n3. **1987**: Chassis has both \"zakspeed 861\" and \"zakspeed 871\" \u2013 still, the engine isn't yamaha v8.\n4. **1988**: Chassis is \"zakspeed 881\" \u2013 nope.\n5. **1989**: Here we go! The chassis is \"zakspeed 891,\" and the engine is listed as \"yamaha v8.\"\n\nSo, in row 4 (index 4), the relevant columns are \"chassis\" and \"engine(s).\" Specifically, looking at the \"engine(s)\" column for this row confirms that it's a yamaha v8. \n\nNext, I need to check if the claim mentions multiple engines. The term \"multiple\" implies more than one engine. However, in the table, each chassis typically has only one engine listed per row. For example:\n- In 1987, there are two chassis numbers but under the same \"engine (s)\" entry.\n- In 1989, it's just a single yamaha v8.\n\nThe claim states \"multiple,\" which suggests that perhaps in another year, multiple engines were used for the zakspeed 891. But looking through all the rows, only 1987 and 1989 have engines other than zakspeed, but none of them use the zakspeed 891 chassis with multiple yamaha v8 engines. \n\nWait a minute. The claim specifically mentions \"zakspeed 891\" and \"multiple yamaha v8 engine(s).\" In the table, only in 1989 is the zakspeed 891 chassis used, but it's associated with one yamaha v8 engine, not multiple. There's no row where zakspeed 891 has more than one yamaha v8 engine.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect because it suggests that there are multiple engines, but the table only shows a single engine for that specific chassis in the relevant year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the zakspeed 891 chassis have multiple yamaha v8 engine.\" However, upon examining the table, we find that only in the year 1989 does the zakspeed 891 chassis use a yamaha v8 engine, and it's listed as a single engine. There are no entries indicating multiple engines for this specific chassis.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there isn't evidence of multiple yamaha v8 engines being used with the zakspeed 891 chassis in any year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be more than 2 zakspeed chassis make in the year 1987.\" So, the key points here are that we're looking at the year 1987, specifically for Zakspeed chassis models, and checking if there are more than two makes.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on the 'year' column to find rows related to 1987. From the table, the years listed are 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989. So, 1987 is the third row (index 2 if we count from 0). \n\nNow, moving to the 'chassis' column for that year: in row index 2, the chassis is listed as \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871.\" Wait, that's two separate models mentioned together. So, does this mean there are two Zakspeed chassis makes? Or more?\n\nThe term \"more than 2\" means we need at least three different Zakspeed chassis in 1987. But looking at the data, row 1987 has \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871.\" That's two models, not three or more. There are no other entries for 1987 in the table.\n\nSo, even though it lists two models, two is not more than two. Therefore, the claim is false because there aren't more than two Zakspeed chassis makes in 1987; there are exactly two.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify that there are more than 2 Zakspeed chassis makes in the year 1987 by checking relevant cells in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows for Year 1987**: Look for rows where 'year' equals 1987.\n   - Found in row index 2 (third row).\n\n2. **Check Zakspeed Chassis Models in 1987**:\n   - In row index 2, the chassis column reads: \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\".\n   - This lists two distinct models from Zakspeed.\n\n3. **Determine if More Than 2 Makes Exist**: The claim requires more than 2 makes. However, only two Zakspeed models are present in 1987.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since there are exactly two Zakspeed chassis models in 1987 and not more than two, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

My task is to check if there's any evidence supporting this claim.\n\nI'll go through each relevant column one by one.\n\nStarting with the \"year\" column: The claim mentions both 1986 and 1987. So I need to look for these years in the table. Checking the table, yes, 1986 (row index 1) and 1987 (row index 2) are present.\n\nNext, the \"chassis\" column: The claim refers specifically to the \"zakspeed 861\" chassis. Let's check each row:\n\n- For 1985 (row 0), the chassis is \"zakspeed 841\"\u2014not 861.\n- 1986 (row 1): \"zakspeed 861\"\u2014matches the claim.\n- 1987 (row 2): \"zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871\"\u2014includes 861, but also another number. So this might still be relevant because part of it is 861.\n- 1988 (row 3) and 1989 (row 4) don't have 861.\n\nSo rows 1 and 2 in the \"chassis\" column are relevant because they mention \"zakspeed 861.\"\n\nNow, considering both years and the specific chassis mentioned, I need to ensure that for each year (1986 and 1987), there's a corresponding entry where \"zakspeed 861\" appears.\n\nFor 1986: Yes, row 1 has \"zakspeed 861.\"\nFor 1987: Yes, row 2 mentions \"zakspeed 861.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in both years and the chassis column. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are where year is 1986 or 1987 AND the chassis is zakspeed 861. That corresponds to:\n\n- Row index 1 (year 1986), \"chassis\" column.\n- Rows 2 (year 1987), both \"year\" and \"chassis.\"\n\nWait, but for row 2, the year is 1987, which is part of the claim, so both \"year\" and \"chassis\" are relevant. So I should include both columns for that row.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 1: year=1986, chassis=861\n- Row 2: year=1987, chassis=861\n\nWait no, because in row 2, the chassis also includes another number, but since part of it is 861, maybe only the \"chassis\" column is relevant. Alternatively, perhaps both columns (year and chassis) for that row are relevant.\n\nI think I should include both columns for each relevant row.\n\nSo for row index 1: columns \"year\" (1986) and \"chassis.\"\nFor row index 2: columns \"year\" (1987) and \"chassis.\"\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n]\n\nWait, but the instruction says to list each relevant cell as a separate object. So for each row, if multiple columns are relevant, each should be listed.\n\nSo in total, four cells: two from 1986 and two from 1987.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about the zakspeed 861 being made in both 1986 and 1987. So for 1986, only the chassis column is relevant because the year is correct (1986) but it's combined with the chassis. Similarly, for 1987, same applies.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"the zakspeed 861 chassis be made in the year 1986 and 1987.\" So each occurrence of zakspeed 861 in those years supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, for 1986: chassis is zakspeed 861, so that's one relevant cell (chassis column).\n\nFor 1987: same thing, chassis includes 861, so another relevant cell (chassis column). Also, since both the year and chassis are present in 1987, perhaps both columns are relevant.\n\nBut I think for each row where the claim is supported, all relevant columns should be listed. So for 1986, both year and chassis are correct, so include both columns. For 1987, same: both year and chassis (since it's 861).\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row index 1: \"year\" and \"chassis\"\n- Row index 2: \"year\" and \"chassis\"\n\nSo total four cells.\n\nI think that's how I should structure it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in both 1986 and 1987, with relevant entries in the \"year\" and \"chassis\" columns. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
