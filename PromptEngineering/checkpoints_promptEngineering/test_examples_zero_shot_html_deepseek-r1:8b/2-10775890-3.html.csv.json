    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"On 7 May 1960, a crowd of 9000 watch the away team, Richmond, score 3.8 (26).\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n\n1. The date is 7 May 1960.\n2. The crowd size is 9000.\n3. The away team is Richmond.\n4. Their score is 3.8 (26).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details about home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through the table rows to find the one that matches all these criteria. Let's check each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Home team is North Melbourne, away team Richmond. The score for Richmond is 3.8 (26). Venue is Arden Street Oval, crowd 9000, date 7 May 1960. This seems to match the claim exactly.\n  \nWait, so if Row 0 matches all the points in the claim, then the claim should be true. But I should double-check other rows just in case there's another entry that also fits or perhaps a mistake.\n\n- **Row 1**: Home team Melbourne vs South Melbourne. Crowd is 23135, which doesn't match 9000.\n- **Row 2**: Fitzroy vs Geelong. Not relevant.\n- **Row 3**: Hawthorn vs Footscray. No match.\n- **Row 4**: Essendon vs Collingwood. Crowd is 30000.\n- **Row 5**: St Kilda vs Carlton. Crowd is 18700.\n\nOnly Row 0 matches all the claim's details: away team Richmond with score 3.8 (26), crowd of 9000, date 7 May 1960.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are in row 0 for home team, away team, their scores, crowd, and date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"3.8 (26) be the away team score against a home team that scored 5.12 (42).\" So, I'm looking for an instance where the away team scored 3.8 (26), and the home team scored 5.12 (42).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns relevant here are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", and \"away team score\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check for these scores.\n\n1. First row: Home team is north melbourne with 5.12 (42), away team is richmond with 3.8 (26). This matches the claim exactly.\n2. Second row: Home team melbourne scored 16.14, away south melbourne 6.10 \u2013 doesn't match.\n3. Third row: Home fitzroy 5.11, away geelong 8.7 \u2013 nope.\n4. Fourth row: Home hawthorn 6.9, away footscray 6.17 \u2013 no.\n5. Fifth row: Home essendon 11.10, away collingwood 11.8 \u2013 not matching.\n6. Sixth row: Home st kilda 5.11, away carlton 7.3 \u2013 doesn't match.\n\nOnly the first row matches both scores as per the claim. So the relevant cells are the ones in the first row for home and away team scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table's first row where \"north melbourne\" scored 5.12 (42) at home and \"richmond\" scored 3.8 (26) away.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"On May 7, 1960, the crowd was larger than 23135 who watched an away team score of 3.8 (26) and a home team score of 5.12 (42).\" \n\nSo, I need to verify two main points:\n1. On that date, there was a game where the away team scored 3.8 (26) and the home team scored 5.12 (42).\n2. The crowd size for this particular game was larger than 23135.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. Let's go through each row to find the one that matches both the scores mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Home team: North Melbourne with a score of 5.12 (42).\n- Away team: Richmond with 3.8 (26).\nThe crowd here is 9000, which is less than 23135, so this isn't the match we're looking for.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team: Melbourne scored 16.14 (110) against South Melbourne.\nCrowd was 23135, but the away team's score here is 6.10 (46), not 3.8 (26). So this doesn't match.\n\nThird row:\n- Fitzroy at home scored 5.11 (41).\nAway team Geelong scored 8.7 (55).\nCrowd was 13802. Again, the away team's score doesn't match, so skip.\n\nFourth row:\n- Hawthorn at home scored 6.9 (45) against Footscray.\nAway team scored 6.17 (53). Not matching either.\n\nFifth row:\n- Essendon at home with 11.10 (76).\nAway team Collingwood scored 11.8 (74).\nCrowd was 30000, which is larger than 23135. However, the away and home scores here don't match the claim's specific numbers.\n\nSixth row:\n- St Kilda at home scored 5.11 (41) against Carlton.\nCarlton scored 7.3 (45). Again, crowd was 18700, but scores don't match.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed something. Let me check each row again for the exact away and home scores mentioned in the claim: away team 3.8 (26), home team 5.12 (42).\n\nLooking at the first row: Home team North Melbourne scored 5.12 (42). The away team Richmond scored 3.8 (26). Yes, that's a match.\n\nNow, checking the crowd for this specific game. It was 9000, which is less than 23135. So the claim says the crowd was larger than 23135 who watched this particular game. But in reality, it was 9000. Therefore, the crowd size doesn't meet the claim's requirement.\n\nWait, but the claim might be referring to another game where both scores match and the crowd was large. Let me double-check all rows again.\n\nNo, only the first row has the specific scores mentioned in the claim. So for that game, the crowd was 9000, which is less than 23135. Therefore, the claim's statement about a larger crowd isn't true for that specific game. So the answer should be FALSE because while the scores match, the crowd size doesn't meet the claimed amount.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the crowd be larger than 23135 that watch an away team score of 3.8 (26) and a home team score of 5.12 (42).\" So it's about a game where both those scores happened, and the crowd was over 23135.\n\nBut in the table, only one game has those exact scores: North Melbourne vs Richmond on May 7, 1960 with 9000 attendees. None of the other games have both scores matching, so this is the only relevant row. Since the crowd was 9000, which is less than 23135, the claim's assertion about the crowd size being larger is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because even though the specific scores match, the crowd size doesn't meet the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
