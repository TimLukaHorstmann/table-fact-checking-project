    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"game 82 after date 7 have a score of 2 - 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in game 82, which took place after date 7, the score was 2-3. So I need to find the relevant row for game 82 and check if it happened after date 7 and what the score was.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, etc. The rows are numbered from 77 to 82.\n\nStarting with game 82, I look at the 'game' column to find the corresponding row. In the table, the last row is game 82, so that's row index 5 (since it starts counting from 0). Now, checking the 'date' for this game: according to the table, it's 11. So the date was November 11th.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this game occurred after date 7. Since November 11 is after July 7, that condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, looking at the 'score' column for game 82: it shows \"2 - 3\". That matches the claim's score of 2-3.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are met. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim: \"pittsburgh penguin be the opponent at the mellon arena 17132 fan in attendance.\" I need to verify this using the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the team name \"pittsburgh penguins\" in the 'opponent' column. Scanning through each row, I see that in the first row (row_index: 0), the opponent is indeed \"pittsburgh penguins.\"\n\nNext, I check the location and attendance. The claim mentions \"mellon arena - 17132.\" Looking at the same row, under 'location / attendance', it's listed as \"mellon arena - 17132.\" So both the opponent and the venue match.\n\nNow, ensuring there are no discrepancies: the opponent is correctly identified in that row, and the attendance figure matches. Therefore, all aspects of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, I will examine each part of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Opponent**: The claim states \"pittsburgh penguin\" as the opponent. Looking at the 'opponent' column in the table:\n   - Row 0 lists \"pittsburgh penguins\" which matches.\n\n2. **Location and Attendance**: The claim specifies \"mellon arena - 17132\". Checking the corresponding row (row_index: 0):\n   - Under 'location / attendance', it is listed as \"mellon arena - 17132\".\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied in row 0, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says, \"the score 3 - 2 be on date 4 after game 78.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions a specific score \"3 - 2\" and a specific date \"4\" occurring after game 78. So I need to find in the table if there's a game where the score is 3-2 and it took place on the 4th day after game 78.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. \n\nStarting with game 78: According to the table, game 78 happened on date 3 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The score was 4-5 in overtime, decided by Brodeur. So this is our starting point.\n\nThe claim says that a game occurred after game 78 (which was on date 3) where the score was 3-2 and it took place on date 4. Wait, but if game 78 was on date 3, then the next day would be date 4. So does any game occur on date 4 with a score of 3-2?\n\nLooking through the table, let's check each row after game 78 to see if any have a score of 3-2 on date 4.\n\nGame 79: Date is 4 against the Buffalo Sabres. The score was 3 - 2. That matches both the date (4) and the score (3-2). \n\nSo yes, game 79 took place on date 4 with a score of 3-2. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the claim specifies \"after game 78.\" Since game 78 was on date 3, and game 79 was on date 4, it's indeed after game 78. So yes, the score 3-2 is on date 4 after game 78.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are from row 3 (since rows start at 0) in the 'score' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"tampa bay lightning be the opponent when the score be 4 - 5 in overtime.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements here are:\n\n1. Opponent: Tampa Bay Lightning\n2. Score: 4 - 5\n3. Overtime: Yes\n\nNext, I'll look through the table to find any rows where these conditions might be met.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details like opponent, score, and decision. \n\nI start by scanning each row for \"tampa bay lightning\" as the opponent. From the table:\n\n- Row 2 (index 1) has Tampa Bay Lightning as the opponent.\n- The score for this row is \"4 - 5 (ot)\". Wait, that's exactly matching two conditions: the opponent and the score.\n\nSo in row 1 (since it's zero-indexed or one-indexed?), wait, no, the first data row is row index 0. Wait, looking back at the table:\n\nThe first <tr> after <tbody> has row index 0? Because the first row is game 77, and so on. So in the table, each <tr> corresponds to a game, with indexes starting from 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the given HTML:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr> ... </tr> (6 rows)\nSo the first <tr> is index 0, then 1, up to 5.\n\nIn row 1 (index 1), opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning, and score is \"4 - 5 (ot)\". So that matches both parts of the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, for row 1:\n\n<td>78</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>tampa bay lightning</td>\n<td>4 - 5 (ot)</td>\n<td>brodeur</td>\n... etc.\n\nSo yes, opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning and score is 4-5 in overtime.

The claim is: \"the game with a score of 4 - 5 that goes into overtime was held at the prudential center and had 17625 attendance.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three main points:\n\n1. The game has a score of 4-5.\n2. The game went into overtime.\n3. The location of the game is the Prudential Center.\n4. The attendance at this game was 17,625.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table. \n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game.\n\nLet me scan through each row to find where all these conditions might be met.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n\n- Game 77: Score is 1-6, not 4-5. So that's out.\n- Game 78: Score is 4-5, which matches the score part of the claim. Also, it says the decision was OT (over time), so it went into overtime. The location is Prudential Center with attendance 17,625.\n\nWait, that seems to fit all points except maybe the game number. Let's check if there are other games that might also have a score of 4-5 in OT at Prudential Center with similar attendance.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- Game 80: Score is 4-1, so no.\n- Game 82: Score is 2-3, no.\n  \nSo game 78 seems to be the only one that meets all these criteria. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because such a game exists in the table.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the attendance number. In game 78, it's listed as prudential center - 17625.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"final score of the game 82 hold before date 7 be 2 - 3.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and data. The table has several columns: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 82\" and refers to a specific date (7) in relation to the final score being 2 - 3. So I need to find the row where game is 82 and check if it happened before or on date 7 with that score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'game' number as an integer. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: game 77\n- Row 1: game 78\n- Row 2: game 79\n- Row 3: game 80\n- Row 4: game 81\n- Row 5: game 82\n\nSo, game 82 is in row index 5. Now I need to check what the date for that game was and compare it against date 7.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column for each row:\n\n- Row 0: date 1\n- Row 1: date 3\n- Row 2: date 4\n- Row 3: date 7\n- Row 4: date 9\n- Row 5: date 11\n\nSo, game 82 is on date 11. The claim mentions \"before date 7,\" which would mean the game in question should have a date less than or equal to 7. However, game 82's date is 11, which is after July 7th.\n\nNow, checking the score for game 82: according to the 'score' column, it's 2 - 3. So the final score is correct. But since the date is after the claimed date (7), this might affect the validity of the claim based on timing.\n\nWait, the claim says \"final score... hold before date 7 be 2 - 3.\" I think it means that by date 7, the score was already 2-3. So if the game happened after date 7, then maybe the score wasn't finalized yet, or perhaps the claim is about a specific point in time.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row represents a completed game with its own date and final result. Since game 82 occurred on date 11, which is after date 7, any reference to it before date 7 wouldn't have happened yet. Therefore, if the claim is asserting that by date 7, game 82 had already ended with a score of 2-3, this would be incorrect because the game was actually played later.\n\nHowever, I might need to check what \"hold\" means in the claim. Maybe it's about the final result being 2-3 when the game is held before date 7. But since the game wasn't held before date 7, maybe the score isn't applicable yet. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is that as of date 7, the game 82 had a final score of 2-3, but since it happened on date 11, that's not accurate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim seems to be incorrect because game 82 occurred after date 7, so its score couldn't have been established before that. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific game (82) and its final score before a certain date (7). The data shows that game 82 was played on November 11th, which is after July 7th. Since the game occurred after the specified date, it's impossible for the final score of that game to have been established by July 7th.

Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nThe claim says: \"the location / attendance be mellon arena - 17132 for the game against opponent buffalo sabre.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of this claim correspond to specific cells in the HTML table provided. The table has several columns: game, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information:\n1. Location/attendance is \"mellon arena - 17132.\"\n2. The opponent is \"buffalo sabre.\"\n\nSo, I need to find the row where the opponent is the Buffalo Sabres and check if the location/attendance matches Mellon Arena with the attendance figure provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The first step is to locate the row where the opponent is Buffalo Sabres.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n- Row 0: Opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins\n- Row 1: Tampa Bay Lightning\n- Row 2: Buffalo Sabres\n- So, the relevant row is row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nNext, I check the location/attendance column for this row. The cell contains \"hsbc arena - 18690.\" Wait a minute, that's not \"mellon arena.\" There's a discrepancy here.\n\nSo, the claim says Mellon Arena with attendance 17132, but in the table, for Buffalo Sabres (row 2), the location is HSBC Arena with 18,690 attendees. This doesn't match the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because the location doesn't match what's stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies Mellon Arena with attendance 17132 against Buffalo Sabres, but the table shows HSBC Arena for that game.

Wait, but in the table, the dates are just numbers without the month. Hmm, maybe it's referring to the row index or perhaps the date is in another format. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The rows have 'game' as 77, 78, 79, etc.\n- Each game has a 'date' column with values like 1,3,4,7,9,11, etc. So these are likely day numbers, perhaps relative to the month. For example, date 1 would be April 1st, 3 April 3rd, and so on.\n\nSo, for game 79, what's the date? Looking at the table, row 79 (index 4) has a date of 4. So the date is April 4th.\n\nThe claim says \"before date 4,\" which would mean games with dates less than 4, i.e., 1 or 3. But game 79's date is 4, so that part seems to contradict the claim. Wait, no\u2014the claim might be saying that the game in question (game 79) occurred before April 4th. Since game 79's date is 4, it's on April 4th, not before. So this would mean the score claim for a game happening before April 4th isn't correct because game 79 is on April 4th.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says \"score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2.\" Maybe it's saying that in game 79, which happened before date 4 (i.e., before April 4th), the score was 3-2.\n\nBut looking at the table for game 79, its date is 4, so it's on April 4th. Therefore, it didn't happen before date 4; it's the same day. So the condition of being before date 4 isn't met because the date is 4. Therefore, the score claim might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"hold before.\" Maybe it means that the game was played before April 4th, so the date should be less than 4. In that case, for game 79, which is on date 4, it's not before. So if the claim is about a game that occurred before April 4th having a score of 3-2, but game 79 didn't occur before April 4th, then the relevant cells would be checking whether any game with a date less than 4 has a score of 3-2.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n- Game 77: date 1, score 1-6\n- Game 78: date 3, score 4-5 (OT)\n- So none of these games have a score of 3-2. Therefore, the claim's assertion that game 79 before April 4th had a 3-2 score is incorrect because:\n1. Game 79 isn't before April 4th; it's on date 4.\n2. No other game with a date before April 4th has a 3-2 score.\n\nSo the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So they're talking about a game where Tampa Bay Lightning was the opponent, and the final score was 5-4 in overtime. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to search for any rows where the opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning. Let me scan through each row's opponent column.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is pittsburgh penguins - nope.\nRow 2: Opponent is tampa bay lightning - yes, that's the one we're interested in.\nRow 3: Buffalo sabres - nope.\nRow 4: Toronto maple leafs - nope.\nRow 5: Ottawa senators - nope.\nRow 6: Carolina hurricanes - nope.\n\nSo only row 2 has Tampa Bay Lightning as the opponent. Now, I need to check what the score was for that game. The 'score' column in row 2 is \"4 - 5 (ot)\".
