    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gilberto godoy filho be 192 inch tall\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that \"gilberto godoy filho\" has a height of 192 inches. The task is to verify if this information is present in the provided HTML table.\n\nNext, I need to examine the table structure. The table has several columns: name, date of birth, height, weight, spike, and block. Since the claim mentions height, I'll focus on the \"height\" column.\n\nNow, I'll search through each row of the table for the name \"gilberto godoy filho.\" Scanning through the rows, I find that there's a row where the name matches exactly. Looking at that specific row, I see what the height is recorded as.\n\nIn that particular row, under the \"height\" column, the value is '192'. This matches the claim exactly. There are no discrepancies or other factors that could invalidate this match, so it seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is supported and should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if \"gilberto godoy filho\" has a height of 192 inches. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - The relevant column for height is \"height\".\n   - Locate \"gilberto godoy filho\" in the table.\n\n2. **Check Height**:\n   - In the row corresponding to \"gilberto godoy filho\", the height is listed as 192.\n\nSince the height matches exactly, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"gilberto godoy filho be taller than andr\u00e9 nascimento\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll locate both individuals in the table. Looking at the 'name' column:\n\n- Gilberto Godoy Filho is in row 3 (since rows are 0-indexed, his index is 3).\n- Andr\u00e9 Nascimento is in row 4.\n\nNext, I check their heights. Gilberto's height is listed as 192 cm, and Andr\u00e9's height is 195 cm. \n\nComparing these values: 192 is less than 195, so Gilberto is not taller than Andr\u00e9.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n]}",
