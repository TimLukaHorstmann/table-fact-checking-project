    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim that the Super League XII score on July 21, 2007 was 14 - 10. Let me start by looking at the provided table and understanding its structure.\n\nFirst, I should locate the row corresponding to July 21, 2007. Scanning through the 'Date' column, I see that August dates are later in the table, so going back, there's a row with \"21 / 07 / 07\". That must be the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, looking at this specific row, which columns are relevant? The claim is about the score, so the 'Score' column is definitely important. I should note down that the cell for \"Score\" on this row needs to match the claimed score of 14 - 10.\n\nI'll also consider the opponent's name because sometimes different opponents might have similar scores, but in this case, since the claim specifies the date and the score, knowing who the opponent was could help confirm it's the right game. However, if I'm only verifying the score itself, maybe just the 'Score' column is enough.\n\nSo, relevant cells would be:\n1. The row for 21/07/07 in the 'Date' column.\n2. The 'Score' cell in that same row to check if it's 14-10.\n\nI should ensure that both these columns have values that support the claim. If either doesn't match, the answer might be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the score on 15 / 04 / 07 in super league xii be 52 - 22\" is true based on the provided table. First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe date mentioned is April 15, 2007 (15/04/07). Looking at the table, each row represents a specific game or match, and the columns include details like the opposing team, score, player statistics, etc. The relevant column here seems to be \"Score\" because we're talking about the score of a particular game.\n\nNext, I need to find the row that corresponds to April 15, 2007. Scanning through the table, each row starts with a date in the format DD/MM/07. So, looking for 15/04/07. Let me check each row:\n\n1. The first few rows are:\n   - 01/04/07\n   - 08/04/07\n   - 15/04/07 (This is the one we need)\n   - And so on.\n\nSo, the row with date 15/04/07 is row index 2 if starting from 0. Now, in that row, the score column shows \"52 - 22\". Wait, let me double-check. The score is listed as \"52 - 22\" for the opposing team, Bradford Bulls, against Hull Kingston Rovers.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"the score... be 52 - 22.\" But in the table, under the date 15/04/07, the score is indeed 52-22. So that matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because the score on 15/04/07 in Super League XII is indeed 52 - 22. The relevant cell is identified correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true based on the provided table and instructions. The claim says: \"the score on 15 / 04 / 07 in super league xii be 52 to 22 with an attendance of 9000\".\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the date is 15 April 2007. Looking through the table, I see each row has a \"Date\" column. Scanning down, I don't immediately see that exact date. The dates go from 15/04/07 to 21/9/07, so it's possible that 15/04/07 is somewhere in there.\n\nAssuming the relevant row is present, next, check the score and attendance columns for that row. The claim mentions a score of 52-22. I need to verify if this score appears in the \"Score\" column on that specific date. Also, the attendance should be 9000 as per the claim.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one until I find the one with 15/04/07. Once found, check the \"Score\" and \"Attendance\" columns. If both match the claim's values, then it's true; otherwise, false.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided, I don't see a row for 15/04/07. The earliest date is 21/7/07, and previous dates like 02/09/07, etc., but nothing jumps out as 15 April 2007. This makes me think that either the date isn't present or it's listed differently.\n\nAlso, the attendance column in some rows has 9000, for example, the row with Salford City Reds on 21/07/07 has an attendance of 3438. So I need to see if any other row with 15/04/07 matches 52-22 and 9000 attendance.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the dates. Maybe it's written as 15/4/07 instead of 15/04/07. Let me check again. The table uses formats like 21/7/07, which is likely day/month/year. So 15/4/07 would be row somewhere in April.\n\nLooking through the table, I don't see that exact date listed, so perhaps it's not present. If that's the case, then the claim can't be fully supported because there's no matching row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake and missed the row. Let me count the rows: starting from 0 to about 30. Hmm, not seeing 15/4/07 in there.\n\nTherefore, since there's no row with that date, the claim is false because the necessary data isn't present in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check whether the claim is true based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the score on 21 / 07 / 07 be 14 to 10 and the home team be bradford.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to 21 July 2007 in the table. Scanning through each row's date column... Yes, there's a row with \"21 / 07 / 07\".\n\nNext, I need to check two things: the score and the home team. The score part is about the match result. Looking at that row, I see the away team scored 14 points and the home team scored 10 points. Wait, no, actually, in the table, each row has \"Team\" as one of the columns. Let me check: for the 21/07/07 row, the Team column lists \"salford city reds\". That means they are the away team because the home team should be the other team, but in this case, the home team is listed as Bradford. Wait, no, looking at the table's header, I see that each row has a 'Team' column, which might indicate whether it's home or away, but perhaps the 'Team' column just lists the team name without indicating home/away. Alternatively, there might be another column for the home team. Let me check the columns again.\n\nLooking at the table headers: It seems that each row has columns like Date, Opponent, Score, Team, etc. The \"Opponent\" would be the away team, and the home team is listed as the team in the 'Team' column? Or perhaps there's another column for Home/Away status. Wait, I think each row includes the opponent (away) and the home team. So in the 21/07/07 row, the opponent is Salford City Reds, and the home team is Bradford.\n\nNow, checking the score: The 'Score' column shows \"14 - 10\". That matches the claim's first part. The claim also states that the home team is Bradford, which aligns with what I found in the table. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n\nI should identify the exact columns and row index for these pieces of information. For the score, it's the \"Score\" column at row 21 (if rows are zero-indexed? Wait, looking back, in the example JSON, they have row_index as int, so I need to figure out what each row's index is.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row after headers is likely row 0 or row 1. But let me count: the provided data starts with a row for 21/07/07, which would be row index 20 if there are more than 20 rows before it. Wait, that might not be correct because the example's JSON shows \"row_index\" as int without specific numbering beyond being relevant.\n\nWait no, perhaps each row in the table is numbered sequentially starting from 0. So for instance, the first data row (after headers) would be row 0, then row 1, etc. Let me count: Starting with the date as the first column, the first data row is \"21 / 07 / 07\". Let me see how many rows are there in total.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to have multiple rows, but for the purpose of this task, I just need to identify which specific cells correspond to the claim. So the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- The row where the date is \"21 / 07 / 07\" (so row index as per the list). Since each row has a unique date, I can find it by searching for that exact string in the 'Date' column.\n\nOnce found, I need to check two columns: 'Score' and 'Team'. For 'Score', the value is \"14 - 10\". For 'Team', the home team is listed as Bradford.\n\nSo in terms of JSON output, I'll create an object for each relevant cell. Therefore, two cells: one for the score and one for the home team.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Team\"}]}",
