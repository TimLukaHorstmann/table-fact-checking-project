    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the attendance at a specific game is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"on september 26 , 1971 the attendance at the game be 57895 crowd.\" So, the claim is stating that on September 26, 1971, the attendance was 57,895 people.\n\nNext, I need to refer to the HTML table to find the relevant data. The table has several rows, each representing a different week of games. Each row includes details such as the week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nTo verify the claim, I should look for the row where the date is September 26, 1971. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Week 1: September 19, 1971\n- Week 2: September 26, 1971\n- Week 3: October 3, 1971\n\nSo, week 2 corresponds to September 26, 1971. Now, I'll check the attendance for that week. According to the table, the attendance is listed as 57,895. \n\nComparing this with the claim, it matches exactly. Therefore, the attendance on September 26, 1971, was indeed 57,895.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells or potential discrepancies. The date and week number both align correctly, and the attendance figure is consistent. There's no indication of any typos or mismatches in the data provided.\n\nIn conclusion, since all parts of the claim are supported by the corresponding data in the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim: \"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971 and the attendance be 57895.\"\n\nI'll break this down into two parts:\n\n1. Week 14 occurs on September 26, 1971.\n2. The attendance for that week is 57,895.\n\nI'll need to verify both conditions against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a specific week with corresponding details.\n\nStarting with the first condition: Week 14 on September 26, 1971.\n\nI'll scan each row's 'week' column to find where week 14 is. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 0: week 1\n- ...\n- Row 13: week 14\n\nSo, week 14 is indeed present in the table. Now, I need to check what the date for week 14 is. The date listed under week 14 is December 19, 1971, not September 26. This already contradicts the claim's first part.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRows go from week 1 to week 14, with dates starting in September and ending in December. So week 14 is definitely on December 19th, not September 26th.\n\nTherefore, the first condition of the claim is FALSE because Week 14 isn't on September 26, but rather December 19.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim must be FALSE. I don't need to check the attendance because the week in question isn't even what's stated.\n\nHowever, for completeness, if I were to check attendance anyway:\n\nLooking at week 14, the attendance is 75,954, not 57,895. So both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nBut since the first part is already wrong, the answer must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Week 14 occurs on September 26, 1971, with an attendance of 57,895. Checking the table:\n\n- Week 14 is on December 19, 1971, not September 26.\n- The attendance for Week 14 is 75,954, not 57,895.\n\nBoth conditions are incorrect, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
