    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 200 m individual medley take place on 19 december 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows in the table where the event is \"200 m individual medley.\" Scanning through each row, I see that the sixth row has this event. \n\nIn that specific row, under the \"time\" column, it says 2:04.60, and the \"date\" column lists \"19 december 2009.\" So both the time and date in that row match what the claim is stating.\n\nNext, I'll check other rows to ensure there's no other entry for the same event on the same date. The only occurrence of \"200 m individual medley\" is in row number 26 (since it starts counting from 0). All other entries with similar names have different dates, so they don't conflict.\n\nTherefore, since the claim correctly refers to the event and its specific date as per the table, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are the ones in row 26 for both \"date\" and possibly \"event,\" but according to the instructions, I need to specify which columns to check. Since the claim mentions both the event and the date, I'll include those two columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and the specific instruction about the 200 m individual medley event on 19 December 2009.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the 200 m individual medley be the only event on 19 december 2009.\" So, the claim is asserting that on that particular date, there's only one event listed in the table.\n\nTo verify this, I should locate all the events that occurred on 19 December 2009. I'll go through each row of the table and check if the 'date' column matches that date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first relevant row is the 200 m individual medley, which indeed has the date \"19 december 2009.\"\n- Next, I see another event: 400 m freestyle, also on \"19 december 2009.\"\n- There's a 200 m breaststroke with the same date.\n- Additionally, there's a 100 m breaststroke and a 50 m butterfly, both on \"19 december 2009.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check:\n- Scanning each row:\n  - Row 21: 400 m individual medley \u2013 19 Dec 2009\n  - Row 22: 200 m individual medley \u2013 same date\n  - Row 23: 400 m individual medley again? Wait, no. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me list out all events with \"19 december 2009\" in the 'date' column:\n- 100 m breaststroke (row 25)\n- 200 m individual medley (row 26)\n- 400 m individual medley (row 27)\n- 4100 m medley relay (row 31) \u2013 no, that's on 16 Dec 2011.\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nActually, upon reviewing each row carefully:\n- The event \"200 m individual medley\" is at row index 26 with date \"19 december 2009.\"\n- The next check: Is there another event on the same date? Looking through each row's 'date' column:\n\nLooking at the table rows from top to bottom, I see that multiple events share the date of 19 December 2009:\n1. 100 m individual medley (row 28) \u2013 no, that's on 16 Dec 2010.\n2. 200 m individual medley (row 26)\n3. 400 m individual medley (row 27)\n4. 4100 m medley relay (row 31) is actually on 16 Dec 2011, so not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing row indices. Let me list them properly:\n\nFrom the table provided:\n- Row 26: 200 m individual medley \u2013 date \"19 december 2009.\"\n- Row 27: 400 m individual medley \u2013 same date.\n- Additionally, looking further down, rows 25 and 24:\nRow 25: 100 m breaststroke \u2013 19 Dec 2009?\nWait no, row 25 is actually the 100 m individual medley at Dubai on 16 Dec 2010. Let me recount.\n\nUpon a more careful examination, perhaps I misassigned some rows. Let's go through each row step by step:\n\n1. 450 m freestyle relay \u2013 March 2004\n2. 4100 m free relay \u2013 Dec 2011\n3. 4200 m free relay \u2013 Dec 2010\n4. 450 m medley relay \u2013 March 2000\n5. 4100 m medley relay \u2013 Dec 2011\n6. 400 m individual medley \u2013 19 Dec 2009 (row 27)\n7. 200 m individual medley \u2013 19 Dec 2009 (row 26)\n8. 100 m individual medley \u2013 16 Dec 2010\n\nSo, actually, only two events on 19 December 2009: the 400 m and 200 m individual medleys.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. Let me check each date in the table:\n\n- Row 6: 100 m free relay \u2013 March 2004\n- Row 7: 4100 m free \u2013 Dec 2011\n- Row 8: 4200 m free \u2013 Dec 2010\n- Row 9: 450 m medley \u2013 March 2000\n- Row 10: 4100 m medley \u2013 Dec 2011\n- Row 11: 400 m individual medley \u2013 19 Dec 2009 (row 11? Wait, the table seems to have more rows.)\n\nWait, perhaps my initial analysis was off. Let me list all events with date \"19 december 2009\":\n\nLooking through each row's 'date' column:\n\n1. 450 m freestyle relay: March 2004 \u2013 no\n2. 4100 m free relay: Dec 2011 \u2013 no\n3. 4200 m free relay: Dec 2010 \u2013 no\n4. 450 m medley relay: March 2000 \u2013 no\n5. 4100 m medley relay: Dec 2011 \u2013 no\n6. 400 m individual medley: 19 Dec 2009 (row 27)\n7. 200 m individual medley: 19 Dec 2009 (row 26)\n8. 100 m individual medley: 16 Dec 2010 \u2013 no\n9. 200 m individual medley: same as above\n10. 400 m individual medley: same as row 27\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact rows. Let me clarify:\n\nUpon reviewing each row's 'date' column, only two events on \"19 december 2009\":\n- 400 m individual medley (row 27)\n- 200 m individual medley (row 26)\n\nAdditionally, checking if any other event shares that date:\n- No, upon scanning, only these two.\n\nTherefore, the claim that multiple events share that date is incorrect; there are only two: 400 and 200.\n\nThus, the initial statement that multiple events share \"19 december 2009\" is incorrect. Therefore, the task was to identify whether a single event occurs on that date or if multiple do. From this analysis, it appears only two events occur on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying whether there are multiple events occurring on December 19, 2009. Based on the detailed analysis, **two** events take place on that date: the 400 meters and 200 meters individual medleys.\n\n**Answer:** Two events took place on December 19, 2009.",
