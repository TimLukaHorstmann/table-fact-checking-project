    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"In the ATP Master Series in 1994, the annual win-loss was 2-4.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table columns to find where the relevant information is stored. The table has several columns like Annual Win-Loss, Year End Ranking, Masters Series SR, etc. The claim specifically mentions \"annual win-loss,\" so that's the column I'm interested in.\n\nLooking at the first row of the table, under \"Annual Win-Loss,\" it says \"4-5\" for 1994. Wait, but the claim is about a win-loss record of 2-4. That doesn't match because 4-5 is different from 2-4.\n\nNow, maybe I should check other rows to see if there's another column that might relate. The row titled \"annual win - loss\" has data like \"0-0,\" \"4-5,\" etc., but the claim refers to the ATP Master Series in 1994. Maybe the relevant row is the first one because it's about the annual win-loss, not the year-end ranking.\n\nSo, if the annual win-loss for 1994 was 4-5 according to the table, then the claim stating it as 2-4 would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Annual Win-Loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim is true or false based on a table provided. The claim is: \"in 1995, 1996, and 1997, the annual win-loss for grand slam be all 5-4\". \n\nFirst, I should look at how the table is structured. From what I can see, each row corresponds to a different category, like \"Grand Slam Annual Win-Loss\", \"Masters Series SR\", etc. The columns seem to represent years from 1995 onwards, with each cell providing data for that specific year and category.\n\nThe claim mentions three consecutive years: 1995, 1996, and 1997, all having an annual win-loss of 5-4 in the Grand Slam context. So I need to find the relevant cells in the table that correspond to the \"annual win-loss\" row for each of these years.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row labeled \"annual win - loss\". In this row, the columns are from 1995 onwards. For each year (1995-1997), I need to check what value is in the cells under the \"annual win - loss\" category.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n1. **1995**: The cell for 1995 in the \"annual win - loss\" row shows \"4 - 5\". That's different from 5-4.\n2. **1996**: The cell here also says \"4 - 5\". Again, not matching the claim of 5-4.\n3. **1997**: Looking at 1997, it's \"5 - 7\". This doesn't match either.\n\nWait a minute, none of these years have the win-loss record as 5-4 in the annual win-loss for Grand Slam. The closest is 1995 and 1996 being 4-5, which is actually a loss to win ratio, but not 5 wins to 4 losses.\n\nSo the claim seems to be incorrect because the actual data doesn't support it. Therefore, I should conclude that the answer is \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim made in the statement is fully supported by the provided table. The claim is: \"in 2001 the annual win - loss was 9 - 9 , while they didn't play in 1987.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The first part mentions that in 2001, the annual win-loss record was 9-9. The second part says that in 1987, they didn't play, meaning there were no matches or perhaps the season wasn't held.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The table has several columns and rows, each representing different aspects such as tournaments, win-loss records, rankings, etc.\n\nI'll start by locating the \"annual win - loss\" column in the table. Scanning through the headers, I find that the fourth row from the top lists \"annual win - loss.\" This row provides data for various years, with columns labeled as numbers, possibly representing specific tournaments or years, and the corresponding win-loss records.\n\nNext, I need to find the cell corresponding to 2001. The table doesn't explicitly state what each column represents in terms of years. However, given that the claim refers to 2001 and 1987, I'll look for those numbers in the relevant row. In the \"annual win - loss\" row, I see columns labeled with numerical values, possibly indicating years like 1999, 2000, 2001, etc.\n\nLooking at the data under \"annual win - loss,\" I notice that the cell for 2001 (probably column 5) shows a 9-9 record. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, regarding the second part: they didn't play in 1987. This suggests there was no tournament or match held that year. In the table, under \"annual win - loss,\" I need to check if 1987 is covered. However, the columns don't go as far back as 1987; the earliest mentioned years seem to be around 1999 or earlier.\n\nGiven that the table doesn't include data for 1987 in the \"annual win - loss\" row, it's reasonable to infer that no information is provided about matches in that year. Therefore, based on the absence of data, it implies that there was either no tournament in 1987 or it wasn't part of this series.\n\nConsidering both parts of the claim, the data for 2001 aligns with the table, and the lack of data for 1987 also fits, suggesting they didn't play that year. Thus, the claim is supported by the information available.\n</think>\n\nThe table provides the annual win-loss record for 2001 as 9-9 in the \"annual win - loss\" row under column 5. Since there's no entry for 1987, it implies they didn't play that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
