    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"76059 attend when the result be l 20 - 17.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It seems like it's saying that there was a game attended by 76,059 people where the result was a loss (denoted by 'l') with a score of 20-17.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, and the columns are: week, date, opponent, result, attendance. The attendance numbers are in the 'attendance' column, and the results are in the 'result' column.\n\nI need to find if any row matches both the attendance of 76,059 and a result of \"l 20 - 17.\" \n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance is 57,406. Result was a loss, but score was 27-0.\n- Week 2: 62,063 attendees. Won 23-17.\n- Week 3: 69,814. Lost 20-7.\n- Week 4: 44,433. Lost 21-14.\n- Week 5: 64,578. Lost 20-6.\n- Week 6: 52,728. Lost 31-14.\n- Week 7: 76,059. Result was a loss with score 20-17.\n\nYes, week 7 has an attendance of 76,059 and the result is \"l 20 - 17.\" So the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 'week' (which would be row index 6 since it's zero-indexed) and the 'result' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
